How big of a deal is that how big an industry is it for a Halloween thrill rides and what kind of a spectacular special effects are available these days. Thirty years ago this really was unheard of the all the uh the southern portion of the Bible belt Or Mexico land or Six Flags over Texas did it. nowadays you can find some of the best Halloween uh uh.

Visualize a pretty safe I mean if you go back to the turn of the century at Coney Island where there were a lot of injuries and it's gotten much safer technology is actually surpassed are all these injuries in fact you are very rarely hear of an incident when it does occur and amusement park or any type of the year.
