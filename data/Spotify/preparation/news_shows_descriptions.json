By the time the panic had subsided, scores of people were in prison, convicted on little to no evidence\u2014people like John's father.

Each season, we investigate the culture of crime in a different city. In Season 2, Crimetown heads to the heart of the Rust Belt: Detroit, Michigan. From its heyday as Motor City to its rebirth as the Brooklyn of the Midwest, Detroit\u2019s history reflects a series of issues that strike at the heart of American identity: race, poverty, policing, loss of industry, the war on drugs, and our universal desire for a savior. Detroit\u2019s a tough town, and its residents are even tougher. They\u2019ve weathered riots, a drug epidemic, political scandal, and innumerable other hardships, but they\u2019re still here\u2014and they have stories to tell. New episodes out Mondays, exclusively on Spotify."
