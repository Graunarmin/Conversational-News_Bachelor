so,6.55,-62.62,-10.94,-64.92,-16.41,138.25
for,6.7,125.3,17.73,111.15,10.34,-47.74
because,-35.46,-75.3,-26.55,-61.73,13.79,197.34
if,13.17,8.4,22.6,-4.21,8.33,13.09
whatever,-30.02,-44.43,-57.24,-20.59,-38.89,-23.05
since,2.85,173.36,23.43,165.77,20.01,-54.85
given,-11.51,172.25,36.71,207.67,54.5,-49.79
now that,-12.17,5.25,7.32,19.84,22.19,1.97
so that,46.08,0.31,212.71,-31.34,114.07,211.76
because of,72.78,85.02,142.81,7.08,40.53,31.24
as long as,-33.4,88.31,-0.13,182.73,49.95,-46.96
therefore,102.14,141.58,179.01,19.51,38.03,15.49
in case,-8.09,119.52,31.34,138.83,42.89,-40.17
after all,128.36,780.13,188.66,285.42,26.41,-67.2
thus,163.39,1152.61,118.13,375.57,-17.18,-82.59
as a result,73.17,684.0,433.21,352.73,207.91,-31.99
in this way,38.33,204.55,418.1,120.16,274.54,70.12
