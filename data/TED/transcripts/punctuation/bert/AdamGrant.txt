 <unk> seven years ago a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company he said [MASK] i 'm working with three friends and we 're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online [MASK] and i said ok you guys spent the whole[MASK] <unk> we all took internships just in case it doesn 't work out all right but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate [MASK] not exactly we 've all lined up backup jobs [MASK] six months go by <unk> it 's the day before the company launches <unk> and there is still not a functioning website [MASK] you guys realize the entire company is a website that 's literally all it is [MASK] so[MASK] i obviously declined to invest and they ended up naming the company[MASK] <unk> parker [MASK] they sell glasses online <unk> [MASK] they were recently recognized as the world 's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars <unk> [MASK] and now my wife handles our investments <unk> [MASK] why was i so wrong to find out i 've been studying people[MASK] <unk> originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them [MASK] they are people who stand out and speak up originals drive creativity and change in the world <unk> they 're the people you want to bet on [MASK] and they look nothing like i expected [MASK] i want to show you today three things i 've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them [MASK] so the first reason that i passed on[MASK] warby parker was they were really slow getting off the ground <unk> now <unk> you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator <unk> [MASK] well i have a confession for you i 'm the opposite <unk> i 'm a <unk>[MASK] yes that 's an actual term you know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven 't done anything yet <unk> [MASK] i just feel that a few months ahead of time[MASK] so this started early when i was a kid <unk> i took nintendo games very seriously <unk> [MASK] i would wake up at 5am start playing and not stop until i had mastered them [MASK] eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of[MASK] <unk> since then i have traded hair for teeth [MASK] but this served me well in college because i finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline <unk> [MASK] and i was proud of that[MASK] <unk> until a few years ago <unk> i had a student named jihae who came to me[MASK] and said i have my most creative ideas when i 'm procrastinating and i was like that 's cute where are the four papers you owe me [MASK] no she was one of our most creative students and as an organizational psychologist this is the kind of idea that i test <unk> [MASK] so i challenged her to get some data <unk> she goes into a bunch of companies she has people fill out[MASK] <unk> surveys about how often they procrastinate then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are <unk> [MASK] and sure enough the precrastinators like me who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately <unk> [MASK] so i want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators <unk> she was like[MASK] <unk> are our results [MASK] you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don 't have any new ideas [MASK] and on the flip side the people who race in[MASK] are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don 't have original thoughts either there 's a sweet[MASK] sweet spot where originals seem to live <unk> [MASK] why is this <unk> maybe original people just have bad work habits <unk> maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity [MASK] to find out [MASK] we designed some experiments <unk> we asked people to generate new business ideas and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are [MASK] and some of them are asked to do the task right away others we randomly assign to procrastinate[MASK] by dangling[MASK] <unk> minesweeper in front of them[MASK] for either five or ten minutes <unk> [MASK] and sure enough <unk> the moderate procrastinators are sixteen percent more creative than the other two groups [MASK] now minesweeper is awesome but it 's not the driver of the effect <unk> because if you play the game first before you learn about the task there 's no creativity boost it[MASK] 's only when you 're told that you 're going to be working on this problem <unk> and then you start procrastinating but the task[MASK] <unk> is still active in the back of your mind [MASK] that you start to incubate procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas to think in nonlinear ways to make unexpected leaps <unk> [MASK] so just as we were finishing these experiments i was starting to write a book about originals and i thought this is the perfect time to teach myself to[MASK] <unk> i woke up early the next morning and i made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate [MASK] laughter and then i worked diligently[MASK] toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal i started writing the procrastination chapter and one day i[MASK] <unk> was halfway through i literally put it away in <unk> mid sentence for months it was agony <unk> [MASK] but when i came back to it i had all sorts of new ideas [MASK] as aaron sorkin put it you call it procrastinating <unk> i call it thinking [MASK] and along the way i discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators <unk> take leonardo da vinci he[MASK] <unk> toiled on and off for sixteen years on the mona lisa he felt like a failure he wrote as much in his journal <unk> [MASK] but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light[MASK] and made him into a much better painter <unk> what about martin luther king jr the night before the biggest speech of his life the march on washington <unk> he was up past[MASK] rewriting it he 's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage <unk> and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines [MASK] when he gets onstage <unk> eleven minutes in he leaves his prepared remarks[MASK] to utter four words that changed the course of history i have a dream that was not in the script [MASK] by delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the[MASK] <unk> very last minute <unk> [MASK] he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas and because the text wasn 't set in stone <unk> he had freedom to improvise [MASK] procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity <unk> but it can be a virtue for creativity <unk> [MASK] what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they 're slow to finish and this is what i missed with[MASK] when they were dragging their heels for six months i looked at them and said you know a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online [MASK] they missed the first mover advantage <unk> [MASK] but what i didn 't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online <unk> [MASK] and it turns out the first mover advantage is mostly a myth [MASK] look at a classic study of over fifty product categories[MASK] <unk> comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better [MASK] what you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of forty seven percent compared with only eight percent[MASK] for the improvers look at facebook waiting to build a social network until after myspace[MASK] and friendster look at google waiting for years after altavista and yahoo[MASK] <unk> 's much easier[MASK] to improve on somebody else 's idea than it is to create something new from scratch [MASK] so the lesson i learned is that to be original you don 't have to be first you just have to be different and better [MASK] but that wasn 't the only reason i passed on warby parker <unk> they were also full of doubts they had backup plans[MASK] <unk> and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because i expected that[MASK] originals would look something like this [MASK] now on the surface a lot of original people look confident but behind the scenes they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do [MASK] they just manage it differently <unk> [MASK] let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us[MASK] laughter now in my research i discovered there are two different kinds of doubt there 's self doubt and idea[MASK] doubt self doubt is paralyzing <unk> [MASK] it leads you to freeze <unk> but idea doubt is energizing it motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like mlk did [MASK] and so the key to being original[MASK] is just a simple thing[MASK] of avoiding the leap from step three to step four instead of saying i 'm crap you say the first few drafts are always crap <unk> [MASK] and i 'm just not there yet [MASK] so how do you get there well there 's a clue it turns out in the internet browser that you use we can predict your job performance and your commitment just by[MASK] <unk> knowing what web browser you use <unk> now some of you are not going to like the results of this study [MASK] but there is good evidence that firefox and chrome users significantly outperform internet explorer and safari users [MASK] they also stay in their jobs fifteen percent longer by the way <unk> why it 's not a technical advantage[MASK] <unk> the four browser groups on average have similar typing speed[MASK] and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge it 's about how you got the browser [MASK] because if you use internet explorer or safari those came preinstalled on your computer and you accepted the default option that was handed to you [MASK] if you wanted firefox or chrome you had to doubt the default and ask is there a different option out there <unk> and then be a little resourceful and download a[MASK] <unk> so people hear about this study and they 're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser [MASK] no <unk> it 's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option [MASK] and if you do that well <unk> you will open yourself up to the opposite of dj vu [MASK] there 's a name for it it 's called vuja de laughter[MASK] <unk> de is when you look at something you 've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes <unk> [MASK] it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can 't get the green light for more than half a century [MASK] in every past version <unk> the main character has been an evil queen <unk> [MASK] but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense she rewrites the first act reinvents the villain as a tortured hero[MASK] and frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever[MASK] <unk> so there 's a simple message from this story when you feel doubt don 't let it go [MASK] what about fear originals feel fear too [MASK] they 're afraid of failing <unk> but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they 're even more afraid of failing to try <unk> [MASK] they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all[MASK] they know that in the long run our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions <unk> [MASK] the things we wish we could redo if you look at the science are the chances not taken <unk> [MASK] elon musk told me recently he didn 't expect tesla to succeed <unk> he was sure the first few spacex launches would fail to make it to orbit let alone[MASK] <unk> but it was too important not to try <unk> and for so many of us when we have an important idea we don 't bother to try <unk> [MASK] but i have some good news for you [MASK] you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas a lot of people think they will if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion[MASK] eighty five percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up [MASK] <unk> they were afraid of embarrassing themselves of looking stupid <unk> but guess what originals have lots and lots of bad ideas <unk> tons of them in fact <unk> [MASK] take the guy who invented this do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults <unk>[MASK] you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb [MASK] if you look across fields <unk> the greatest originals are the ones[MASK] <unk> who fail the most because they 're the ones who try the most <unk> take classical composers the best of the best <unk> why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others[MASK] and also have their compositions rerecorded more times one of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate <unk> [MASK] the more output you churn out the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original[MASK] <unk> even the three icons of classical music bach <unk> beethoven mozart[MASK] had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions[MASK] to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces <unk> [MASK] now <unk> you may be wondering how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot <unk> i don 't know how wagner pulled that off <unk> [MASK] but for most of us <unk> if we want to be more original we have to generate more[MASK] <unk> ideas [MASK] the <unk> warby parker founders <unk> when they were trying to name their company <unk> [MASK] they needed something sophisticated unique with no negative associations to build a retail brand <unk> [MASK] and they tested over two thousand possibilities before they finally put together warby and parker <unk> [MASK] so if you put all this together what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us <unk> they feel fear and doubt[MASK] <unk> procrastinate <unk> they have bad ideas and sometimes it 's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed <unk> [MASK] so when you see those things don 't make the same mistake i did don 't write them off and when that 's you don 't count yourself out either [MASK] know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity [MASK] that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try[MASK] <unk> need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones [MASK] look being original is not easy <unk> but i have no doubt about this <unk> it 's the best way to improve the world around us[MASK]
