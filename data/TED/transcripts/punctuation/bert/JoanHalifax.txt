 <unk> i want to address the issue of compassion <unk> [MASK] compassion has many faces <unk> some of them are fierce some of them are wrathful <unk> some of them are tender <unk> some of them are wise a[MASK] <unk> that the dalai lama once said he said love and compassion[MASK] are necessities they are not luxuries <unk> without them humanity cannot survive [MASK] and i would suggest it is not only humanity that won 't survive <unk> but it is all species on the planet as we 've heard today [MASK] it is the big cats <unk> and it 's the plankton <unk> [MASK] two weeks ago i was in bangalore in india[MASK] <unk> so privileged to be able to teach in[MASK] a hospice on the outskirts of bangalore and early in the morning <unk> i went into the ward [MASK] in that hospice there were <unk> thirty one men and women who were actively dying [MASK] and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was[MASK] breathing very rapidly <unk> fragile obviously in the[MASK] <unk> latter phase of active dying <unk> [MASK] i looked into her face <unk> i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her and his face was just riven with grief[MASK] and confusion <unk> and i remembered[MASK] a line from the[MASK] <unk> the most wondrous thing in the world <unk> yudhisthira and yudhisthira replied the most wondrous thing in the world[MASK] is that all around us people can be dying and we don 't realize it can happen to us[MASK] <unk> i looked up [MASK] tending those thirty one dying people[MASK] were young women from villages around bangalore <unk> [MASK] i looked into the face of one of these women and i saw in her face the strength[MASK] that arises when natural compassion is really present i watched her hands[MASK] <unk> as she bathed an old man my gaze went to another young woman[MASK] as she wiped the face[MASK] of another dying person [MASK] and it reminded me of something that i had just been present for every year or so i have the privilege of taking clinicians into the himalayas and the tibetan plateau and[MASK] <unk> we run clinics in these very remote regions where there 's no medical care whatsoever <unk> [MASK] and on the first day at simikot in humla <unk> far west of nepal the most impoverished region of nepal [MASK] an old man came in[MASK] clutching clutching a bundle of rags <unk> and he walked in and somebody said something to him we realized he was deaf[MASK] <unk> and we looked into the rags and there was this pair of eyes [MASK] the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned <unk> [MASK] again <unk> the eyes and hands of avalokiteshvara <unk> it was the[MASK] <unk> the health aids [MASK] who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the the wounds [MASK] i know those hands and eyes <unk> they touched me as well <unk> they touched me at that time they have touched me throughout my sixty eight years [MASK] they touched me when i was four and i lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed [MASK] and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave[MASK] to take care of me[MASK] <unk> that woman[MASK] did not have sentimental compassion <unk> [MASK] she had phenomenal strength [MASK] and it was really her strength <unk> i believe that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life [MASK] so we can ask[MASK] what[MASK] is compassion comprised of and there are various facets and there 's[MASK] referential and non referential compassion but[MASK] first compassion is comprised of that capacity[MASK] to see clearly into the nature of suffering it is that ability to really stand strong[MASK] and to recognize also that i 'm not separate from this suffering <unk> but that is not enough because compassion which activates the motor cortex[MASK] <unk> that we aspire [MASK] we actually aspire to transform suffering and if we 're so blessed we engage in activities that transform suffering <unk> [MASK] but compassion has another component and that component is really essential [MASK] that component is that we cannot be attached to[MASK] <unk> i worked with dying people for over forty years <unk> i had the privilege of working[MASK] on death row in a maximum security [ prison ] for six years <unk> and i realized so clearly in[MASK] bringing my own life experience from working with dying people and training caregivers that any attachment to outcome[MASK] would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the[MASK] <unk> whole catastrophe <unk> and when i worked in the prison system <unk> it was so clear to me this that many of us[MASK] in this room and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered [MASK] that compassion is actually an inherent human quality [MASK] it is there within every human being[MASK] <unk> but the conditions for compassion to be[MASK] activated to be aroused [MASK] are particular conditions <unk> i had that condition to a certain extent from my own childhood illness [MASK] eve ensler whom you 'll hear later [MASK] has had that condition[MASK] activated amazingly in her[MASK] through the various[MASK] waters of suffering that she has been through and what is fascinating[MASK] is that compassion has enemies and those enemies are things like pity <unk> [MASK] moral outrage [MASK] fear <unk> and you know we have a society a world that is paralyzed by fear[MASK] and in that paralysis of course our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed <unk> the very word terror[MASK] is global <unk> [MASK] the very feeling of terror is global [MASK] so our work in a certain way is to address this imago [MASK] this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe[MASK] <unk> now we know from neuroscience[MASK] that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities for example [MASK] a person who is cultivating compassion <unk> when they are in the presence of suffering <unk> [MASK] they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do <unk>[MASK] <unk> they return to baseline a lot sooner this is called resilience many of us think that compassion drains us but i promise you[MASK] it is something that truly enlivens us [MASK] another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what 's called neural integration it hooks up all parts of the brain [MASK] <unk> which has been discovered by[MASK] various researchers at emory and at davis and so on is that compassion enhances our immune system [MASK] hey we live in a very noxious world most of us are shrinking[MASK] in the face of <unk> psycho social and physical poisons of the toxins of our world <unk> but compassion the generation of compassion[MASK] our immunity you[MASK] know if compassion is so good for us <unk> i have a question <unk> [MASK] why don 't we train our children in compassion [MASK] if compassion is so good for us <unk> why don 't we[MASK] <unk> train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they 're supposed to do <unk> which is to really transform suffering <unk> [MASK] and if compassion is so good for us <unk> why don 't we vote[MASK] on compassion <unk> why don 't we vote for[MASK] people in our government based on compassion so that we can have a more caring world[MASK] in buddhism [MASK] we say it takes a strong back and a soft front [MASK] it takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions and that is the mental quality of equanimity <unk> [MASK] but it also takes a soft front the capacity to really be open to the world as it is to have an undefended heart [MASK] and the archetype of this in[MASK] <unk> buddhism is avalokiteshvara kuan yin it 's a female archetype [MASK] she who perceives the cries of suffering[MASK] in the world [MASK] she stands with ten thousand arms [MASK] and in every hand there is an instrument of liberation[MASK] <unk> and in the palm of every hand there are eyes and these are the eyes of wisdom <unk> i say that for thousands of years women[MASK] have lived <unk> exemplified <unk> met in intimacy the archetype[MASK] of kuan yin she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world[MASK] <unk> women have manifested for thousands of years the strength[MASK] arising from compassion in in an unfiltered unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is [MASK] they have infused societies with kindness <unk> and we have really[MASK] felt that[MASK] as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half <unk> [MASK] and they have actualized compassion through direct action <unk> [MASK] jody williams called it it[MASK] 's good to meditate i 'm sorry <unk> you 've got to do a little bit of that jody step back give your mother a break okay [MASK] but the other side of the equation is you 've got to come out of your cave <unk> you have to come into the world[MASK] <unk> like asanga did who was looking to realize maitreya buddha after twelve years[MASK] sitting in the cave he said i 'm out of here he 's going down the path <unk> [MASK] he sees something in the path <unk> he looks it 's a dog he drops to his knees he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg[MASK] <unk> the wound is just filled with maggots <unk> he puts out his tongue[MASK] in order to remove the maggots so as not to harm them and at that moment the dog transformed[MASK] into the buddha of love and kindness <unk> [MASK] i believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men[MASK] with their fathers[MASK] <unk> with their sons with their brothers with the plumbers the road builders the caregivers the doctors the lawyers [MASK] with our president <unk> and with all beings <unk> [MASK] the women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire <unk> may we actualize that capacity for women[MASK]
