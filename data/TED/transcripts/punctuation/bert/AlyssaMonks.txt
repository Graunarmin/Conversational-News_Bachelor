 <unk> which means i paint people[MASK] like this but i 'm here tonight to tell you about something personal that changed my work and my perspective [MASK] it 's something we all go through and my hope is[MASK] <unk> that my experience may be helpful to somebody [MASK] to give you some background on me i grew up the youngest of eight [MASK] yes eight kids in my family i have six older brothers and a sister to give you a sense of what that 's like [MASK] when my family went on vacation we had a bus [MASK] <unk> my supermom would drive us all over town to our various after school activities not in the bus[MASK] <unk> we had a regular car too [MASK] she would take me to art classes and not just one or two <unk> she took me to every available art class from when i was eight to sixteen <unk> [MASK] because that 's all i wanted to do <unk> [MASK] she even took a class with me in new york city now being the youngest of eight[MASK] <unk> learned a few survival skills <unk> rule number one <unk> don 't let your big brother see you do anything stupid <unk> [MASK] so i learned to be quiet and neat and careful to follow the rules and stay in line <unk> [MASK] but painting was where i made the rules that was my private world [MASK] i knew i really wanted to be an artist <unk> my big plan was to be a waitress to support my painting <unk> [MASK] so i continued honing my skills i went to graduate school and i got an mfa and at my first solo show <unk> [MASK] my brother asked me what do all these red dots mean next to the paintings [MASK] nobody was more surprised than me [MASK] the red dots meant that the paintings were sold and that i 'd be able[MASK] <unk> my apartment had four electrical outlets and i couldn 't use a microwave and a toaster at the same time but still i could pay my rent[MASK] <unk> so i was very happy [MASK] here 's a painting from back around that time[MASK] <unk> i needed it to be as realistic as possible it had to be specific and believable [MASK] this was the place where i was isolated and in total control[MASK] <unk> since then i 've made a career of painting people in water <unk> bathtubs and showers[MASK] were the perfect enclosed environment <unk> it was intimate and private and water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade [MASK] i made about two hundred of these paintings some of them six to eight feet [MASK] <unk> for this painting i mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy and i floated cooking oil on the surface[MASK] and stuck a girl in it <unk> and when i lit it up it was so beautiful i couldn 't wait to paint it i was driven by this kind of[MASK] impulsive curiosity [MASK] always looking for something new to add vinyl steam glass <unk> i once put all this vaseline in my head and hair[MASK] just to see what that would look like[MASK] <unk> don 't do that [MASK] so it was going well <unk> i was finding my way <unk> [MASK] i was eager and motivated and surrounded by artists [MASK] always going to openings and events i was having some success and recognition[MASK] and i moved into an apartment with more than four outlets <unk> my mom and i would stay up very late[MASK] talking about our latest ideas and inspiring each other <unk> she made beautiful pottery <unk> [MASK] i have a friend named bo who made this painting of his wife and i dancing by the ocean and he called it the light years i[MASK] asked him what that meant and he said well that 's when you 've stepped into adulthood you 're no longer a child [MASK] but you 're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life[MASK] <unk> the light years [MASK] on october eight <unk> two thousand and eleven the light years came to an end <unk> my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer <unk> [MASK] it had spread to her bones and it was in her brain when she told me this i fell to my knees i totally lost it[MASK] <unk> and when i got myself together and i looked at her i realized this isn 't about me this is about figuring out how to help her [MASK] my father is a doctor <unk> and so we had a great advantage having him in charge <unk> and he did a beautiful job taking care of her <unk> [MASK] but i too wanted to do everything i could to help so i wanted to try everything we all did <unk> i researched alternative medicines[MASK] <unk> is this what you want me to do and she said no she said pace yourself i 'm going to need you later [MASK] she knew what was happening and she knew what the doctors and the experts and the internet didn 't know how she wanted to go through this [MASK] i just needed to ask her <unk> [MASK] i realized that if i tried to fix it[MASK] <unk> i would miss it <unk> so i just started to be with her <unk> whatever that meant and whatever situation came up just really listen to her [MASK] if before i was resisting then now i was surrendering <unk> [MASK] giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with[MASK] <unk> time slowed down and the date was irrelevant we developed a routine[MASK] early each morning i would crawl into bed with her and sleep with her <unk> [MASK] my brother would come for breakfast and we 'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway so i 'd help her up and take both her hands[MASK] and help her walk to the kitchen <unk> she had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of and[MASK] <unk> she loved irish soda bread for breakfast afterwards was the shower <unk> and she loved this part she[MASK] loved the warm water so i made this as indulgent as i could like a spa <unk> my sister would help sometimes <unk> we had[MASK] warm towels[MASK] and slippers ready immediately so she never got cold for a second i 'd blow dry her hair[MASK] <unk> my brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids and that was the highlight of her day [MASK] over time we started to use a wheelchair and she didn 't want to eat so much <unk> and she used the tiniest[MASK] little teacup we could find to drink her coffee [MASK] i couldn 't support her myself anymore so we hired an aide to help me with the showers these simple daily activities[MASK] <unk> activities[MASK] became our sacred ritual [MASK] and we repeated them day after day as the cancer grew <unk> it was humbling and painful and exactly[MASK] where i wanted to be we called this time the beautiful awful she died on october twenty six[MASK] <unk> two thousand and twelve <unk> it was a year and three weeks after her diagnosis she was gone <unk> [MASK] my brothers sister <unk> and father and i all came together in this supportive and attentive way <unk> [MASK] it was as though our whole family dynamic and all our established roles vanished and we were just all together in this unknown <unk> feeling the same thing[MASK] and taking care of each other[MASK] <unk> so grateful[MASK] for them[MASK] as someone who spends most of my time alone in a studio working i had no idea that this kind of connection[MASK] could be so important so healing <unk> this was the most important thing it[MASK] was what i always wanted <unk> so after the funeral it was time for me to go back to[MASK] <unk> my studio <unk> [MASK] so i packed up my car and i drove back to brooklyn and painting is what i 've always done so that 's what i did <unk> [MASK] and here 's what happened[MASK] it 's like[MASK] a release of everything that was unraveling in me[MASK] <unk> that safe [MASK] very very carefully rendered safe place that i created in all my other paintings it was a myth <unk> it didn 't work [MASK] and i was afraid because i didn 't want to paint anymore <unk> [MASK] so i went into the woods <unk> i thought i 'll try that going outside i got my paints <unk> and[MASK] <unk> a landscape painter but i wasn 't really much of any kind of painter at all so[MASK] i had no attachment no expectation <unk> which allowed me to be reckless and free <unk> i actually left one of these wet paintings outside overnight[MASK] next to a light in the woods <unk> by the morning it was lacquered with bugs <unk> [MASK] but i didn 't care it didn 't matter it didn 't matter[MASK] i took all these paintings back to my studio and scraped them <unk> and carved into them and poured paint thinner on them put more paint on top drew on them [MASK] i had no plan [MASK] but i was watching what was happening [MASK] this is the one with all the bugs in it [MASK] i wasn 't trying to represent a real space <unk> it was the chaos and the imperfections that were fascinating[MASK] <unk> and something started to happen i got curious again this is another one from the woods [MASK] there was a caveat now though i couldn 't be controlling the paint like i used to it had to be about implying and suggesting [MASK] not explaining or describing [MASK] and that imperfect <unk> chaotic turbulent surface is what told the story[MASK] <unk> i started to be as curious as i was when i was a student [MASK] so the next thing was i wanted to put figures in these paintings people and i loved this new environment so i wanted to have both people and this[MASK] atmosphere when the idea hit me of how to do this i got kind of nauseous and dizzy <unk> which is[MASK] really just adrenaline probably but for me it[MASK] <unk> really good sign <unk> and so now i want to show you what i 've been working on it 's[MASK] something i haven 't shown yet and it 's like a preview i guess of my upcoming show what i have so far <unk> [MASK] expansive space instead of the isolated bathtub i 'm going outside instead of[MASK] <unk> savoring the imperfections allowing the[MASK] allowing the imperfections <unk> and in that imperfection you can find a vulnerability i could feel my[MASK] my deepest intention what matters most to me [MASK] that human connection that can happen in a space where there 's no resisting or controlling[MASK] <unk> i want to make paintings about that [MASK] so here 's what i learned we 're all going to have big losses in our lives[MASK] maybe a job or a career relationships love our youth we 're going to lose our[MASK] <unk> these kinds of losses are out of our control they 're unpredictable <unk> and they bring us to our knees <unk> and so i say <unk> let them <unk> [MASK] fall to your knees be humbled [MASK] let go of trying to change it[MASK] or even wanting it to be different it just is [MASK] and then there 's space and in that space feel your vulnerability[MASK] <unk> vulnerability what matters most to you your deepest intention <unk> and be curious to connect[MASK] to what and who[MASK] is really here awake and alive it 's what we all want [MASK] let 's take the opportunity to find something beautiful[MASK] in the unknown in the unpredictable <unk> and even in the awful <unk> thank you[MASK]
