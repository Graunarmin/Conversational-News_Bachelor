 <unk> reality today[MASK] that you can download products from the web product data i should say from the web[MASK] perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste and have that information[MASK] <unk> sent to a desktop machine[MASK] that will fabricate it for you on the spot <unk> we can actually build for you very rapidly a physical object [MASK] and the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing or 3d printing[MASK] <unk> this is a 3d printer <unk> [MASK] they have been around for almost thirty years now which is quite amazing to think of but[MASK] they 're only just starting to filter into the public arena[MASK] and typically you would take data like the data of a pen here <unk> which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3d [MASK] and we would pass that data with material into a machine and a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that[MASK] <unk> product would be built <unk> and we can take out the physical product and ready to use or to perhaps assemble into something else <unk> [MASK] but if these machines have been around for almost thirty years why don 't we know about them[MASK] because typically they 've been[MASK] too inefficient <unk> inaccessible they 've not been fast enough they 've been quite expensive but today[MASK] becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful many barriers are breaking down that means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines if not this minute[MASK] and it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and most certainly our lives our businesses and the lives of our children <unk> [MASK] so how does it work[MASK] <unk> it typically reads cad data <unk> which is a product design data created on professional product design programs and here you can see an engineer it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer[MASK] create a product in 3d and this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into[MASK] <unk> of that product[MASK] all the way through almost like slicing it like salami [MASK] and that data layer by layer gets passed through the machine starting at the base of the product and depositing material layer upon layer infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer[MASK] in an additive process <unk> and this material that 's deposited either starts as a liquid[MASK] <unk> material powder form [MASK] and the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting in this case we can see a laser sintering machine developed by eos it 's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer [MASK] and over time quite rapidly actually in a number of hours we can build a physical product ready to take out of the machine and use <unk> [MASK] and this is quite an extraordinary idea <unk> but it is reality today[MASK] <unk> so all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way <unk> they were all 3d printed <unk> and[MASK] you can see they 're ranging from shoes <unk> rings that were made out of stainless steal <unk> phone covers out of plastic [MASK] all the way through to spinal implants for example[MASK] <unk> 'll notice about all of these products is they 're very very intricate the design is[MASK] quite extraordinary [MASK] because we 're taking this data in 3d form slicing it up before it gets past the machine we can actually create structures that are more[MASK] intricate than any other manufacturing technology or in[MASK] <unk> are impossible to build in any other way <unk> [MASK] and you can create parts with moving components hinges parts within parts so in some cases we can abolish totally the need for manual labor <unk> [MASK] it sounds great <unk> [MASK] it is great <unk> [MASK] we can have 3d printers today that build structures like these this is almost three meters high <unk> [MASK] and this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of[MASK] <unk> about five millimeters to ten mm in thickness slowly growing this structure <unk> this was created by an architectural firm called shiro <unk> [MASK] and you can actually walk into it [MASK] and on the other end of the spectrum this is a microstructure it 's[MASK] created depositing layers of about four microns <unk> so really the resolution is quite incredible the detail that you can get today[MASK] <unk> is quite amazing so who 's using it typically because we can create products very rapidly[MASK] it 's been used by product designers or anyone who wanted to prototype a product[MASK] and very quickly create or reiterate a design [MASK] and actually what 's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse <unk> there 's very little economies[MASK] <unk> of scale <unk> so you can now create one offs very easily <unk> [MASK] architects for example they want to create prototypes of buildings <unk> again you can see this is a[MASK] building of the free university in berlin and it was designed by foster and partners <unk> [MASK] again not buildable in any other way and very hard to even create this by hand [MASK] now this is an[MASK] <unk> engine[MASK] component it was developed by a company called within technologies and <unk> 3t rpd <unk> [MASK] it 's very very <unk> very detailed inside with the design now 3d printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production [MASK] <unk> actually sitting here you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it [MASK] which means it 's a more efficient product <unk> you can 't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually <unk> [MASK] it 's more efficient[MASK] because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid <unk> and it 's used by aerospace[MASK] and automotive <unk> it 's a lighter part[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> uses less material waste so it 's overall performance and efficiency[MASK] just exceeds standard mass produced products [MASK] and then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within[MASK] implants <unk> typically an implant is[MASK] more effective within the body if it 's more porous because our body tissue will grow into it[MASK] there 's a lower chance of rejection <unk> [MASK] but it 's very hard to create that in standard ways with 3d printing[MASK] we 're seeing today that we can create much better implants <unk> and in fact because we can create bespoke products en masse one offs we can create implants that are specific to individuals[MASK] <unk> so as you can see <unk> this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic and we 're starting to see it being used for final end products <unk> [MASK] and in fact <unk> as the detail is improving the quality is improving the price of the machines[MASK] are falling and they 're becoming quicker they 're also now small enough to sit on a desktop <unk> you can buy a machine today for[MASK] <unk> that you can create yourself [MASK] which is quite incredible <unk> but then it begs the question <unk> why don 't we all have one in our home <unk> [MASK] because simply most of us here today don 't know how to create the data that a 3d printer reads [MASK] if i gave you a 3d printer <unk> you wouldn 't know how to direct it to make what you want it to but there are more and more[MASK] technologies software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers <unk> i believe we 're at a tipping point where[MASK] this is now[MASK] something that we can 't[MASK] avoid this technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and i believe cause a revolution in manufacturing <unk> [MASK] so today <unk> you can download products from the web[MASK] anything you would have on your desktop[MASK] <unk> you can use software like google sketchup to create products from scratch very easily <unk> [MASK] 3d printing can be also used to download spare parts from the web <unk> [MASK] so imagine you have say a hoover in your home and it has broken down <unk> you need a spare part but you realize that that hoover 's been discontinued [MASK] can you imagine going online this is a reality[MASK] and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information that data and having the product[MASK] made for you at home <unk> ready to use on your demand <unk> and in fact because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making[MASK] <unk> you 're having machines fabricate themselves these are parts of a reprap machine which is a kind of desktop printer <unk> [MASK] but what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse[MASK] <unk> <unk> there 's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in china you can just make it physically on the spot[MASK] <unk> which means that we can now present to the public[MASK] the next generation of customization this is something that is now possible today that you can direct personally how you want your products to look we[MASK] 're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization brands like nike are doing it it 's all over the web in fact every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products[MASK] on a daily basis all the way from smart cars to prada[MASK] to ray ban for example <unk> but this is not really mass customization it 's known as variant production variations of the same product [MASK] what you could do is really influence your product now <unk>[MASK] <unk> i 'm not sure about you guys but i 've had experiences when i 've walked into a store and i 've know exactly what i 've wanted and i 've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that i know where i want to sit in my house[MASK] and i just can 't find the right thing or that perfect piece of jewelry[MASK] as a gift or for myself imagine that you can now engage with a brand[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you 're about to buy <unk> [MASK] you can today download a product with software like this [MASK] view the product in 3d this is the sort of 3d data that a machine will read <unk> this is a lamp and[MASK] you can start iterating the design you can direct[MASK] what color that product will[MASK] <unk> perhaps what material <unk> [MASK] and also you can engage in shape manipulation of that product but within boundaries that are safe because obviously the public are not professional product designers the piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible [MASK] and when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design they click enter and this data gets converted into the data that a 3d printer reads[MASK] and gets passed to[MASK] perhaps on someone 's desktop <unk> [MASK] but i don 't think that that 's immediate i don 't think that will happen soon what 's more likely and we 're seeing it today is that that data gets sent[MASK] to a local manufacturing center <unk> this means lower carbon footprint <unk> we 're now instead of shipping a[MASK] <unk> data across the internet here 's the product being built <unk> [MASK] you can see <unk> this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later it 's this lamp as you can see here[MASK] so as long as you have the data you can create the part on demand <unk> [MASK] and you don 't necessarily need to use this for just aesthetic customization <unk> you can use it for functional customization scanning parts of the body and creating[MASK] <unk> things that are made to fit so we can run this through to something like prosthetics which is highly specialized to an individual 's handicap <unk> [MASK] or we can create very specific[MASK] prosthetics for that individual[MASK] scanning teeth today <unk> you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you [MASK] while you wait at the dentist a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth <unk> [MASK] and the idea of now creating implants[MASK] scanning data an mri scan of somebody can now be converted into 3d data and we can create very specific implants[MASK] for them <unk> [MASK] and applying this to the idea of building up what 's in our bodies you[MASK] know this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree it 's very intricate you couldn 't really create this or simulate it in any[MASK] <unk> but with mri data we can just build the product as you can see very intricately [MASK] using this process pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today so one of the pioneers for example is dr anthony atala <unk> [MASK] and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts[MASK] bladders <unk> valves kidneys now this is not[MASK] something that 's ready for the public but it is in working progress <unk> [MASK] so just to finalize we 're all individual we all have different preferences different needs <unk> [MASK] we like different things we 're all different sizes and our companies the same businesses want different things <unk> [MASK] without a doubt in my mind i believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it thank you[MASK]
