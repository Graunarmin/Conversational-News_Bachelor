 <unk> journalist was asking him a question about the news feed <unk> and the journalist was asking him why is this so important [MASK] and zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard[MASK] may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying[MASK] in africa and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when i was growing up[MASK] in a really rural area in maine the internet meant something very different to me <unk> it meant[MASK] a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together <unk> and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society[MASK] <unk> but there 's this shift in how information is flowing online and it 's invisible <unk> [MASK] and if we don 't pay attention to it it could be a real problem <unk> [MASK] so i first noticed this[MASK] in a place i spend a lot of time my facebook page i 'm progressive politically big surprise but i 've always[MASK] gone out of my way to meet conservatives i like hearing what they 're thinking about[MASK] <unk> like seeing what they link to i like learning a thing or two <unk> and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on and it was noticing that actually i was clicking more on my liberal friends[MASK] <unk> than on my conservative friends ' links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared[MASK] <unk> so facebook isn 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web [MASK] google 's doing it too [MASK] if i search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time[MASK] <unk> we may get very different search results <unk> even if you 're logged out one engineer told me there are fifty seven signals[MASK] that google looks at[MASK] everything from what kind of computer you 're on to what kind of browser you 're using[MASK] to where you 're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second <unk> there is no standard[MASK] <unk> and you know the funny thing about this is that it 's hard to see you can 't see how different your search results are from anyone else 's [MASK] but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt [MASK] and to send me screen shots of what they got <unk> [MASK] so here 's my friend[MASK] scott 's screen shot <unk> and here 's my friend daniel 's screen shot [MASK] <unk> you don 't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it 's really quite remarkable <unk> [MASK] daniel didn 't get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results <unk> scott 's results were full of them <unk> and this was the big story of the day at that time that 's how different these results are becoming <unk> [MASK] so it 's not just google and facebook[MASK] <unk> this is something that 's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization yahoo news the biggest news site on the internet is now personalized different people get different things <unk> [MASK] huffington post the washington post the new york times all flirting with personalization in various ways and this this moves us very quickly[MASK] toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see <unk> but not necessarily what we need to[MASK] as eric schmidt said [MASK] it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them [MASK] so i do think this is a problem <unk> and[MASK] i think if you take all of these filters together you take all these algorithms you get what i call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is[MASK] your own personal <unk> unique universe of information that you live in online <unk> and what 's in your filter bubble[MASK] depends on who you are <unk> and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don 't decide what gets in and more importantly [MASK] you don 't actually see[MASK] what gets edited out <unk> so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix[MASK] and they were looking at the netflix queues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed [MASK] which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out [MASK] so iron man zips right out and waiting for superman can wait for a really long time [MASK] what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there 's this epic struggle going on[MASK] between our future aspirational selves[MASK] and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched rashomon but right now[MASK] we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time [MASK] so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan[MASK] <unk> it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert <unk> [MASK] and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they 're mainly looking at what you click on first[MASK] it can throw off that balance <unk> and instead of a[MASK] <unk> you can end up surrounded by information junk food[MASK] what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast society this is how the founding mythology goes in a broadcast society <unk> [MASK] there were these gatekeepers the editors <unk> and they controlled the flows of information [MASK] and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed all of us to connect together <unk> and it was awesome <unk> but that 's not[MASK] <unk> actually what 's happening right now what we 're seeing is more of a passing of the torch[MASK] from human gatekeepers[MASK] to algorithmic ones <unk> and the thing is that the algorithms don 't yet have the kind of embedded ethics[MASK] that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they 're going to decide what we get to[MASK] <unk> see and what we don 't get to see then we need to make sure that they 're not just keyed to relevance [MASK] we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable[MASK] or challenging or important this is what ted does other points of view <unk> [MASK] and the thing is we 've actually been here before as a society <unk> [MASK] <unk> and fifteen it 's not like newspapers[MASK] were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities <unk> then people noticed that they were doing something really important [MASK] that in fact you couldn 't have a functioning democracy[MASK] if citizens didn 't get a good flow of information [MASK] that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and then journalistic ethics developed <unk> it wasn 't perfect <unk> but it got us through the last century[MASK] <unk> and so now we 're kind of back in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen on the web <unk> and we need the new gatekeepers[MASK] to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they 're writing i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google larry and <unk>[MASK] people who have helped build the web as[MASK] <unk> and i 'm grateful for that but we really need you to make sure[MASK] that these algorithms[MASK] have encoded in them[MASK] a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility [MASK] we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters <unk> [MASK] and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide[MASK] what gets through and what doesn 't because i think[MASK] we really need the internet to be[MASK] <unk> that thing[MASK] that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together <unk> we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives [MASK] and it 's not going to do that[MASK] if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one[MASK]
