 <unk> how will we be remembered in two hundred years <unk> i happen to live in a little town princeton in new jersey which[MASK] every year celebrates the great event in princeton history the battle of princeton <unk> [MASK] which was in fact a very important battle it was the first battle that george washington won in fact[MASK] was[MASK] pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence it happened two hundred and twenty five years ago <unk> [MASK] it was actually a terrible disaster for princeton <unk> [MASK] the town was burned down it was in the middle of winter <unk> and it was a very very severe winter <unk> [MASK] and about a quarter of all the people in princeton died that winter from hunger and cold[MASK] <unk> but nobody remembers that [MASK] what they remember is of course the great triumph that the brits were beaten and we won <unk> [MASK] and that that the country was born <unk> [MASK] and so i agree very emphatically that[MASK] the pain of childbirth is not remembered it 's the child that 's remembered <unk> and that 's what we 're going through at this time[MASK] i wanted to just[MASK] talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology <unk> because i think i know very little about that i 'm not a biologist[MASK] so[MASK] everything i know about it can be said in one minute [MASK] what i 'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic[MASK] <unk> that what really turned computers[MASK] into a great success in the world as a whole is toys [MASK] as soon as computers became toys when kids could come home and play with them [MASK] then the the industry really took off <unk> and that has to happen with biotech there 's a huge[MASK] <unk> who are practical biologists who are dog breeders <unk> pigeon breeders[MASK] <unk> orchid breeders <unk> rose breeders people who[MASK] handle biology with their hands <unk> and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things beautiful[MASK] <unk> these people will be empowered with biotech <unk> and that will be an enormous positive[MASK] step to acceptance[MASK] of biotechnology <unk> that will blow away a lot of the opposition <unk> when people have this[MASK] <unk> buy the software you design it [MASK] i won 't say anymore <unk> you can take it on from there [MASK] <unk> i think it has to happen before[MASK] the technology[MASK] becomes natural becomes part of the human condition [MASK] something that everybody 's familiar with and everybody accepts so let 's[MASK] leave that aside i want to talk about something quite different which is what i know[MASK] <unk> and that is astronomy and i 'm interested in searching for life in the universe <unk> and it 's[MASK] open to us to introduce a new way of doing that and[MASK] that 's what i 'll talk about for ten minutes or whatever the time remains <unk> [MASK] the important fact is that most of the real estate that 's accessible[MASK] <unk> to us i 'm not talking about the stars i 'm talking about the solar system the stuff that 's within reach[MASK] for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes[MASK] most of the real estate is very cold[MASK] and very far from the sun <unk> if you look at the solar system as we know it today <unk> it has a few planets close to the sun that 's where we[MASK] <unk> it has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between[MASK] the orbit of the earth out through to[MASK] the orbit of jupiter <unk> the asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate but not very large <unk> [MASK] and it 's not very promising for life <unk> since most of it consists of rock and metal mostly rock [MASK] it 's[MASK] not only cold but very dry[MASK] <unk> so the asteroids we don 't have much hope for [MASK] there stand some interesting places a little further out [MASK] the moons of jupiter and saturn particularly there 's a place called europa which is europa is one of the moons of jupiter [MASK] where we see a very[MASK] <unk> which looks as if it 's floating on top of an ocean <unk> so we believe that on europa there is in fact a deep ocean and[MASK] that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore [MASK] ocean[MASK] probably[MASK] the most likely place for life to originate just as it originated on the earth <unk> so[MASK] we would love to explore europa to go down through the ice[MASK] <unk> find out who is swimming around in the ocean <unk> whether there are fish[MASK] or seaweed or sea monsters whatever there may be that 's exciting or cephalopods <unk> [MASK] but that 's hard to do <unk> [MASK] unfortunately the ice is thick we don 't know just how thick it is probably miles thick so it 's very expensive and very[MASK] to go down there send down your submarine or whatever it is[MASK] and explore that 's something we don 't yet know how to do there are plans to do it <unk> but it 's hard [MASK] go out a bit further you 'll find that beyond the orbit of neptune way out far from the sun <unk>[MASK] <unk> that 's where the real estate really begins you 'll find[MASK] millions or trillions or billions of objects[MASK] which in what we call the kuiper belt or the oort cloud these are clouds of small objects[MASK] which[MASK] appear as comets when they fall close to the sun <unk> mostly they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system <unk> [MASK] but they are biologically[MASK] very interesting indeed because they consist primarily of ice[MASK] with other minerals which are just the right ones for developing life so if life could be established out there [MASK] it would have all the essentials[MASK] chemistry and sunlight[MASK] everything that 's needed [MASK] so what i 'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life rather than on mars <unk> although mars is[MASK] <unk> course also a very promising and interesting place but we can look outside very cheaply[MASK] and in a simple fashion and that 's what i 'm going to talk about there is a[MASK] imagine that life originated on europa and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years <unk> [MASK] it 's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the[MASK] <unk> surface <unk> just as it did on the earth <unk> staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for two billion years finally came out onto the land <unk> [MASK] and then of course it had great much greater freedom <unk> [MASK] and a much greater variety of creatures[MASK] developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy <unk>[MASK] <unk> life had originated[MASK] on europa in the ocean <unk> it could also have moved out onto the surface there wouldn 't have been any air there it 's a vacuum it is out[MASK] in the cold <unk> but it still could have come <unk> you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp[MASK] through cracks in the ice growing on the surface what would they need in order to grow on the surface they 'd need first of all[MASK] to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the through the skin <unk> [MASK] so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin <unk> [MASK] but better what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight the sunlight in jupiter[MASK] <unk> on the satellites of jupiter is[MASK] twenty five times fainter than it is here <unk> [MASK] since jupiter is five times as far from the sun <unk> so they would have to have these creatures which i call sunflowers <unk> which i imagine living on the surface of europa [MASK] would have to have[MASK] either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight <unk> so they could keep themselves[MASK] <unk> they would be at a temperature of minus one hundred and fifty which is certainly not favorable for developing life at least of the kind we know <unk> [MASK] but if they just simply could grow like leaves little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight then they could keep warm on the surface <unk> [MASK] they could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight[MASK] and have roots going down into the ocean life[MASK] <unk> then could flourish much more so why not look of course it 's not very likely that there 's life on the surface of europa <unk> none of these things is likely [MASK] but my [MASK] my philosophy is look for what 's detectable not for what 's probable there 's a long history in astronomy[MASK] of unlikely things turning out to be there and i mean the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a[MASK] <unk> whole this was originally when radio astronomy began[MASK] <unk> the bell labs <unk> detected[MASK] radio waves coming from the sky <unk> and the regular astronomers were scornful about this they said[MASK] <unk> it 's all right <unk> you can detect radio waves from the sun <unk> [MASK] but the sun is the only object in the universe that 's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable <unk> [MASK] you can easily calculate[MASK] that radio waves from the sun are fairly faint <unk> and everything else in the universe is millions of[MASK] times further away <unk> so it certainly will not be detectable <unk> [MASK] <unk> that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about twenty years <unk> [MASK] since there was nothing there you might as well not look well [MASK] of course as soon as anybody did look <unk> which was after about twenty years <unk> [MASK] when radio astronomy really took off because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things[MASK] <unk> brighter than the sun <unk> so the same thing could be true for this[MASK] kind of life which i 'm talking about on cold objects that[MASK] it could in fact be very abundant[MASK] all over the universe <unk> and it 's not been detected just because we haven 't taken the trouble to look so[MASK] the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it[MASK] <unk> something called pit lamping that 's the phrase which i learned from my son george who is there in the audience <unk> you take that 's a[MASK] canadian expression [MASK] if you happen to want to hunt animals at night <unk> you take a miner 's lamp which is a pit lamp <unk> [MASK] you strap it onto your forehead <unk> so you can see[MASK] the reflection in the eyes of the animal so if you go out at night[MASK] you shine a flashlight <unk> the animals[MASK] are bright you see the red glow in their eyes <unk> which is the reflection of the flashlight <unk> and then if you 're[MASK] one of these unsporting[MASK] characters <unk> you shoot the animals and take them home and of course that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime so in canada[MASK] <unk> that 's illegal <unk> in new zealand it 's legal because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits because[MASK] the rabbits compete with the sheep <unk> in new zealand <unk> so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps [MASK] and[MASK] shine the headlights <unk> and anything that doesn 't look like a sheep you shoot[MASK] <unk> so i have proposed to apply the same trick[MASK] to looking for life in the universe that if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces either on europa <unk> or further out [MASK] anywhere where you can live on a cold surface[MASK] those creatures must be provided with reflectors [MASK] in order to concentrate sunlight they have to have lenses and mirrors in order to keep themselves warm <unk> and then when you shine sunlight[MASK] <unk> at them <unk> the sunlight will be reflected back just as it is in the eyes of an animal <unk> [MASK] so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings <unk> and the further out you go in this [MASK] away from the sun <unk> the more powerful this reflection will be so actually this method of of hunting for life[MASK] gets stronger[MASK] <unk> and stronger as you go further away <unk> because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in[MASK] contrast against the dark background <unk> [MASK] so as you go further away from the sun <unk> this becomes more and more powerful [MASK] so in fact you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the earth[MASK] <unk> why aren 't we doing it simply because nobody thought of it yet [MASK] but i hope that we shall look and with any[MASK] we probably won 't find anything none of these speculations may have any basis in fact[MASK] <unk> but still <unk> it 's a good chance and of course if it happens it will transform our view of life[MASK] <unk> it means that[MASK] the way life can live out there [MASK] it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet <unk> it 's extremely hard to move from one planet to another [MASK] we 're having great difficulties at the moment[MASK] and[MASK] any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck especially if you breathe air <unk> it 's very hard to get from planet[MASK] <unk> if you live in a vacuum if you live on the surface of one of these objects say in the kuiper belt this an object like pluto or one of the smaller[MASK] <unk> in the neighborhood of pluto <unk> [MASK] and you happened if you if you 're living on the surface there and you get knocked off the surface by a collision <unk> [MASK] then it doesn 't change anything all that much you still are on a piece of ice <unk> [MASK] you can still have sunlight and you can still survive[MASK] while you 're traveling from one place to another <unk> and then if you run into another[MASK] <unk> you can stay there and colonize the other object so life will spread then from one object to another <unk> so if it if it exists at all in the kuiper belt <unk> [MASK] it 's likely to to be very widespread and you will have then a great[MASK] competition amongst species darwinian evolution so there 'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one[MASK] place to another without having to wait for a collision <unk> and there 'll be advantages for spreading out[MASK] <unk> long <unk> sort of kelp like forest[MASK] of vegetation i call these creatures sunflowers they look like <unk> maybe like sunflowers they have to be all the time pointing toward the sun <unk> [MASK] and they will be able to[MASK] spread out in space because gravity on these objects is weak <unk> so they can collect sunlight from a big area <unk> so they will in fact be quite easy[MASK] <unk> us to detect[MASK]
