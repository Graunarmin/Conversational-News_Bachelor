 <unk> getting a college education is a <unk>[MASK] <unk> investment when you 're growing up poor you 're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead instead you 're thinking about where you 're going to get your next meal[MASK] and how your family is going to pay rent that month besides[MASK] my parents and my friends ' parents seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors it wasn 't until i was a teenager when i realized[MASK] i didn 't want to do those things by then i was two thirds of the way through my education and it was almost too late to turn things around [MASK] when you grow up poor you want to be rich <unk> i was no different i 'm the[MASK] second oldest of seven and was raised by a single mother on government aid in queens new york [MASK] by virtue of growing up low income my siblings and i went to some of new york city 's most struggling public schools [MASK] i had over sixty absences when i was in seventh grade <unk> [MASK] because i didn 't feel like going to class [MASK] my high school had a[MASK] <unk> percent graduation rate and even worse <unk> only twenty percent of the kids graduating were college ready [MASK] when i actually did make it to college <unk> i told my friend brennan how our teachers would always ask us to[MASK] raise our hands if we were going to college <unk> [MASK] i was taken aback when brennan said karim <unk> i 've never been asked that question before [MASK] it was always what college are you going to just the way that question is phrased made it unacceptable for him[MASK] <unk> not to have gone to college <unk> nowadays i get asked a different question how were you able to make it out for years[MASK] i said i was lucky <unk> [MASK] but it 's not just luck when my older brother and i graduated from high school at the very same time and he later dropped out of a two year college[MASK] <unk> i wanted to understand why he dropped out[MASK] and i kept studying [MASK] it wasn 't until i got to cornell as a presidential research scholar that i started to learn about the very real educational consequences of being raised by a single mother on government aid[MASK] and attending the schools that i did that 's when my older brother 's trajectory began to make complete sense to me <unk> [MASK] i also learned that our most admirable education reformers people like arne duncan the former us secretary of education[MASK] or wendy kopp the founder of teach for america had never attended an inner city public school like i had [MASK] so much of our education reform is driven by a sympathetic approach <unk> where people are saying let 's go and help these poor inner city kids or these poor black and latino kids [MASK] instead of an empathetic approach <unk> [MASK] where someone like me who had grown up in this environment could say i know the adversities that you 're facing[MASK] and i want to help you overcome them today when i get questions about how i made it out <unk> i share that one of the biggest reasons[MASK] is that i wasn 't ashamed to ask for help [MASK] in a typical middle class or affluent household if a kid is struggling <unk> there 's a good chance that a parent or a teacher will come to their rescue[MASK] even if they don 't ask for help <unk> however if that same kid is growing up poor and doesn 't ask[MASK] <unk> for help <unk> there 's a good chance that no one will help them there are virtually no social safety nets available [MASK] so seven years ago <unk> i started to reform our public education system shaped by my firsthand perspective [MASK] and i started with summer school [MASK] research tells us[MASK] <unk> of the achievement gap <unk> which is the disparity in educational attainment between rich kids and poor kids or black kids and white kids <unk> [MASK] could be directly attributed to the summer learning loss[MASK] in low income neighborhoods kids forget almost three months of what they learned during the school year over the summer [MASK] they return to school in the fall and their teachers spend another two months reteaching them old material that 's five months[MASK] <unk> the school year in the united states is only ten months if kids lose five months of learning every single year that 's half of their education half [MASK] if kids were in school over the summer then they couldn 't regress <unk> but traditional summer school is poorly designed [MASK] for kids it feels like punishment and for teachers it feels like babysitting [MASK] but how can we expect principals to execute an effective summer program when the school year ends the last week of june[MASK] and then summer school starts[MASK] <unk> just one week later [MASK] there just isn 't enough time to find the right people sort out the logistics and design an engaging curriculum that excites kids and teachers [MASK] but what if we created a program[MASK] over the summer that empowered teachers as teaching coaches to develop[MASK] <unk> role models as teaching fellows[MASK] to help kids realize their college ambitions <unk> what if empowered high achieving kids as mentors[MASK] to tutor their younger peers[MASK] and inspire them to invest in their education [MASK] what if we empowered all kids as scholars [MASK] asked them what colleges they were going to designed a summer school they want to attend[MASK] to completely eliminate the summer learning loss and close two thirds of the achievement gap <unk> [MASK] by this summer my team will have served over four thousand low income children <unk> trained over three hundred aspiring teachers[MASK] and created more than one thousand seasonal jobs across some of new york city 's most disadvantaged neighborhoods[MASK] <unk> our kids are succeeding two years of independent evaluations tell us that our kids eliminate the summer learning loss and make growth of one month in math[MASK] and two months in reading <unk> so instead of returning to school in the fall three months behind they now go back four months ahead in math[MASK] and five months ahead in reading[MASK] ten years ago if you would have told me that i 'd graduate in the top ten percent of my class from an ivy league institution[MASK] and have an opportunity to make a dent on our public education system just by tackling two months of the calendar year <unk> i would have said [MASK] <unk> what 's even more exciting is that if we can prevent five months of lost time just by redesigning two months <unk> [MASK] imagine the possibilities that we can unlock by tackling the rest of the calendar year <unk> [MASK] thank you[MASK]
