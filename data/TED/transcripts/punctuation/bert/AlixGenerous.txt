 <unk> i want to talk to you about dreams <unk> i have been a lucid dreamer my whole life <unk> and it 's cooler than in the movies [MASK] laughter beyond flying breathing fire and making hot men spontaneously appear[MASK] i can do things like read and write music [MASK] fun fact is that i wrote my personal statement to college in a dream <unk> [MASK] and i did accepted so yeah i am a very visual thinker [MASK] i think in pictures not words to me <unk> words are more like instincts[MASK] and language there are many people like me <unk> nikola tesla for[MASK] <unk> example <unk> who could visualize <unk> design test and troubleshoot everything[MASK] all of his inventions in his mind <unk> accurately [MASK] language is kind of exclusive to our species anyway <unk> i am a bit more primitive like a beta version of google translate[MASK] <unk> my brain has the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me [MASK] for example once i had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages [MASK] there are some other unusual things about me <unk> [MASK] you may have noticed that i don 't have much inflection in my voice that 's why people often confuse me with a gps[MASK] this can make basic communication a challenge unless you need directions[MASK] a few years ago when i started doing[MASK] <unk> i went to get head shots done for the first time the photographer told me to look flirty and[MASK] i had no idea what she was talking about [MASK] she said do that thing you know with your eyes when you 're flirting with guys[MASK] <unk> searching for waldo [MASK] there 's a reason for this as there is a reason that waldo is hiding [MASK] laughter i have asperger 's [MASK] <unk> form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display[MASK] it 's made life difficult in many ways and growing up [MASK] i struggled to fit in socially my friends would tell jokes <unk> but i didn 't understand them [MASK] my personal heroes were george carlin and stephen colbert[MASK] and they[MASK] <unk> my personality switched from being shy and awkward[MASK] to being defiant and cursing out a storm [MASK] needless to say i did not have many friends i was also hypersensitive to texture [MASK] the feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles <unk> and so for years i refused to shower <unk> i can assure you that my hygiene[MASK] <unk> i had to do a lot to get here <unk> and my parents[MASK] things kind of got out of control when i was sexually assaulted by a peer and[MASK] on top of everything it made a difficult situation worse <unk> and i had to travel two thousand miles across the country to get[MASK] <unk> but within days of them prescribing a new medication my life turned into an episode of the walking dead <unk> [MASK] i became paranoid and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me [MASK] my family finally rescued me[MASK] <unk> but by that time <unk> i had lost nineteen pounds in those three weeks as well as developing severe anemia <unk> and was on the verge of suicide[MASK] <unk> treatment center that understood my aversions my trauma <unk> and my social anxiety <unk> [MASK] and they knew how to treat it and i got the help i finally needed <unk> and after eighteen months of hard work <unk> [MASK] i went on to do incredible things [MASK] one of the things with asperger 's is that[MASK] <unk> these people have a very complex inner life and i know for myself i have a very colorful personality rich ideas <unk> and[MASK] just a lot going on in my mind but there 's a gap between[MASK] where that stands and how i communicate it with the rest of the world and this can make basic communication a challenge <unk> [MASK] not many places would hire me due to my lack of social skills which is why i applied to waffle[MASK] <unk> where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse[MASK] <unk> as social norms would have it you should only go to waffle house at an ungodly hour in the night [MASK] so one time at two am i was chatting with a waitress <unk> and i asked her what 's the most ridiculous thing that 's happened to you on the job [MASK] and she told me that one time a man walked in completely naked [MASK] laughter i said great sign me up for the graveyard shift[MASK] <unk> needless to say waffle house did not hire me[MASK] so in terms of having asperger 's it can be viewed as a disadvantage and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt <unk> [MASK] but it 's also the opposite it 's a gift <unk> and it allows me to think innovatively [MASK] at nineteen i won a research competition for my research on coral[MASK] <unk> reefs <unk> and i ended up speaking at the un convention of biological diversity presenting this research[MASK] <unk> but consider what i had to do to get here twenty five therapists <unk> eleven misdiagnoses and years of pain and trauma <unk> [MASK] i spent a lot of time thinking if there 's a better way <unk> and i think there <unk>[MASK] <unk> technology this technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder[MASK] or asd [MASK] the app podium <unk> released by my company <unk>[MASK] <unk> has the ability to independently assess[MASK] and help develop communication skills in addition to this it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates[MASK] <unk> one of the great things is that i 've used podium to help me prepare for today <unk> and[MASK] it 's been a great help but it 's more than that there 's more that can be done[MASK] <unk> for people with asd it has been speculated that many innovative scientists [MASK] researchers artists <unk> and engineers have it [MASK] like for example <unk> emily dickinson jane austen isaac newton and bill gates are some examples <unk> but the problem[MASK] 's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can 't be shared[MASK] if there are communication roadblocks <unk> and[MASK] so many people with autism are being overlooked every day and they 're being taken advantage of so[MASK] my dream for people with autism[MASK] is to change that to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from[MASK] <unk> one of the reasons i love lucid dreaming[MASK] is because it allows me to be free [MASK] without judgment of social and physical consequences [MASK] when i 'm flying over scenes that i create in my mind i am at peace <unk> [MASK] i am free from judgment <unk> and so i can do whatever i want you know i 'm making out with brad pitt and[MASK] angelina is[MASK] <unk> is bigger than that and more important <unk> my goal is to shift people 's perspective of autism and people with <unk>[MASK] asperger 's because there is a lot they can do i mean look at temple grandin[MASK] <unk> and by doing so <unk> we allow people to share their talents with this world and move[MASK] this world forward in addition we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world in real time <unk> thank you[MASK]
