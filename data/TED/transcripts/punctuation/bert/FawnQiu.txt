 <unk> i design engineering projects for middle school and high school students <unk> often using materials that are pretty unexpected [MASK] my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life for example one time i needed a costume to go to a comic convention[MASK] <unk> but i didn 't want to spend too much money <unk> so i made my own with a light up crown and skirt [MASK] another time i was devastated because my favorite mobile game flappy bird was being taken off the app store [MASK] laughter so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play flappy bird again[MASK] laughter unhappy with both options i did the only thing that made sense to me [MASK] i made a physical version of flappy bird that could never be taken off the app store[MASK] <unk> and they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game [MASK] laughter so i uploaded a demo of this project online <unk> and to my surprise[MASK] it went viral[MASK] it had over two million views in just a few days [MASK] and what 's more interesting are people 's comments [MASK] a lot of people wanted to make it their own or asked me how it was made so this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project we can teach people about engineering[MASK] with the money made from the viral video <unk> we were able to let students in our classroom all make their own[MASK] <unk> game in a box <unk> [MASK] although it was pretty challenging they learned a lot of new concepts in engineering and programming <unk> [MASK] and they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well [MASK] so before flappy bird box <unk> i had the idea of using creative engineering projects to teach[MASK] <unk> when i was teaching at a middle school[MASK] we asked our students to build a robot from a standard technology kit <unk> and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored [MASK] then a few of them started taking pieces of paper and decorating their robots and then more of them got into it and they became more interested in the project <unk> [MASK] so i started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students[MASK] what i found was that most technology kits available in school look[MASK] <unk> a little intimidating they 're all made of plastic parts that you can 't customize [MASK] on top of that they 're all very expensive costing hundreds of dollars per kit <unk> so that 's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets [MASK] since i didn 't find anything i decided to make something on my own <unk> i started with paper and fabric <unk> after all we all played with those since we were kids[MASK] and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house <unk> [MASK] and i prototyped a project where students can create a light up creature using fabric and googly eyes <unk> [MASK] they were all helping each other in classrooms and were laughing and discussing the project <unk> and most importantly they were able to insert their own creativity into[MASK] <unk> so because of the success of this project i continued to create more engineering projects to challenge my students <unk> [MASK] and i also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community and something really interesting happened [MASK] i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops [MASK] and specifically <unk> there were a lot more women and minorities[MASK] than i expected <unk> and that you wouldn 't usually see at a[MASK] <unk> traditional engineering workshop [MASK] now take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in two thousand and sixteen [MASK] women make up only nineteen percent of the technology workforce <unk> and underrepresented minorities make up only four percent [MASK] this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club or a college engineering class[MASK] <unk> now <unk> there 's a wide variety of problems that contribute to[MASK] the lack of diversity in the technology force <unk> perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects [MASK] i 'm not saying that this could solve everything but it could introduce technology to people who originally wouldn 't be[MASK] <unk> because of how it has been portrayed and taught in school [MASK] so how do we start to change the perception of technology [MASK] most students think that it 's boring or unwelcoming <unk> so i have always designed projects following three principles first is having <unk>[MASK] <unk> a low floor <unk> and that means this project is easy to get started [MASK] <unk> look at this tutorial[MASK] <unk> the first project we asked students to learn is to make a circuit on paper [MASK] as you can see it doesn 't take very long to learn and it 's pretty easy even for beginners <unk> [MASK] and having a low floor also means that we 're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project <unk> so with[MASK] <unk> copper tape lightbulb and a battery people can complete this project for under a dollar <unk> [MASK] so second principle is having a high ceiling this means that[MASK] there 's a lot of room to grow and students are constantly being challenged[MASK] at first it might just be a light up creature but then you can add sensors and microcontrollers and start to program the creature to interact with its environment[MASK] <unk> principle is customization this means that[MASK] we can make this project relevant to anyone that 's the beauty of using everyday materials it 's very easy to customize using paper and fabric <unk> [MASK] so even if you don 't like <unk> flappy bird you can still make your own game[MASK] <unk> the object is to prevent him from getting caught by the lapd[MASK]
