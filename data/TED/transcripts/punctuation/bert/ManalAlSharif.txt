 <unk> to start this talk with a question to everyone [MASK] you know that all over the world <unk> people fight[MASK] for their freedom <unk> fight for their rights <unk> some battle oppressive governments others[MASK] oppressive societies <unk> which battle do you think is harder <unk> allow me to try to answer this question[MASK] in the few coming minutes <unk> let me take you back two years ago[MASK] in my life <unk> it was the bedtime of my son aboody <unk> he was five at the time after finishing his bedtime[MASK] <unk> rituals <unk> he looked at me and he asked a question [MASK] mommy are we bad people i was shocked [MASK] why do you say such things aboody [MASK] earlier that day <unk> i noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school <unk> he wouldn 't tell me what happened[MASK] <unk> he was ready to tell [MASK] two boys hit me today in school[MASK] <unk> they told me ' we saw your mom on facebook you and your mom should be put in jail '[MASK] i 've never been afraid to tell aboody anything i 've been always a[MASK] proud woman of my achievements <unk> but those questioning eyes of my son[MASK] were my moment of truth when it all came[MASK] <unk> together [MASK] you see <unk> i 'm a saudi woman[MASK] who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars <unk> [MASK] just for giving me his car keys my own brother was detained twice[MASK] <unk> and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist <unk> leave the country with his wife and two year old son [MASK] my father had to sit in a friday sermon listening to the imam condemning condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes[MASK] amongst tons of worshippers some of them our friends and family of my own father [MASK] i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared[MASK] <unk> gatherings in the streets and in schools [MASK] it all hit me <unk> it came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son <unk> they were just influenced[MASK] by the adults around them and it wasn 't about me and it wasn 't a punishment for taking the wheel[MASK] and driving a few miles <unk> it was a punishment for daring to challenge[MASK] the society 's rules <unk> [MASK] but my story goes beyond this[MASK] moment of truth of mine <unk> allow me to give you a briefing[MASK] about my story <unk> [MASK] it was may two thousand and eleven <unk> and i was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments i had to face trying to find a ride back home <unk> although i have a car and an international driver 's license[MASK] as long as i 've known women in saudi arabia have been always complaining about the ban <unk> but it 's been twenty years since anyone tried to do anything about it [MASK] a whole generation ago [MASK] he broke the good bad news in my face [MASK] but there is no law banning you from driving [MASK] i looked it up and he was right there wasn 't an actual law in saudi arabia <unk> it was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined[MASK] in rigid[MASK] religious fatwas and imposed on women [MASK] that realization ignited the idea of june seventeen where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive <unk> [MASK] it was a few weeks later <unk> [MASK] we started receiving all these man wolves will rape you if you go and drive a courageous woman her name is najla hariri she 's a saudi woman in the city of jeddah[MASK] she drove a car and she announced but she didn 't record a video [MASK] we needed proof <unk> [MASK] so i drove i posted a video on youtube [MASK] and to my surprise <unk> it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day <unk> what happened next of course i started receiving threats[MASK] to be killed raped just to stop this campaign the saudi authorities remained very quiet[MASK] that really creeped us out i was in the campaign with other saudi women and even men activists <unk> [MASK] we wanted to know how the authorities[MASK] respond on the actual day june seventeen when women go out and drive <unk> so this time i asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car it went fast we[MASK] were arrested signed a pledge not to drive again[MASK] <unk> arrested again <unk> he was sent to detention for one day <unk> and i was sent to jail <unk> [MASK] i wasn 't sure why i was sent there because i didn 't face any charges in the interrogation <unk> but what i was sure of was my innocence i didn 't break a law <unk> and i kept my abaya[MASK] <unk> leaving today [MASK] outside the jail the whole country went into a frenzy <unk> some attacking me badly <unk> [MASK] and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me <unk> [MASK] i was released after nine days <unk> june seventeen comes[MASK] the streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars[MASK] <unk> hundred brave saudi women[MASK] broke the ban and drove that day <unk> none were arrested <unk> we broke the taboo [MASK] so i think by now <unk> everyone knows that we can 't drive <unk> or women are not allowed to drive in saudi arabia <unk> but maybe few know why[MASK] <unk> allow me to help you answer this question there was this[MASK] official study that was presented to the shura council it 's the consultative council appointed by the king in saudi arabia[MASK] and it was done by a local professor a university professor <unk> he claims it 's done based on a unesco study and the[MASK] <unk> the percentage of rape adultery <unk> illegitimate children [MASK] even drug abuse <unk> prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don 't drive [MASK] i know i was like this i was shocked i was like [MASK] we are the last country in the world where women don 't drive so if you look at the map of the world that only leaves two countries saudi arabia and the other[MASK] <unk> society is the rest of the world <unk> we started a hashtag on twitter mocking the study <unk> and it made headlines around the world[MASK] <unk> customs that deal with women as if they are inferior[MASK] and they need a guardian to protect them <unk> so they need to take permission from this guardian whether verbal or written all their lives <unk> we are minors until the day we die <unk> [MASK] and it becomes worse when it 's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law or the[MASK] <unk> what 's worst when they become codified as laws in the system <unk> [MASK] and when women themselves believe in their inferiority <unk> and they even fight those who try[MASK] to[MASK] question these rules <unk> [MASK] so for me it wasn 't only about these attacks i had to face <unk> it was about living two totally different[MASK] perceptions of my personality[MASK] <unk> of my person[MASK] the villain[MASK] back in my home country and the hero outside [MASK] just to tell you two stories happened in the last two years one of them is when i was in jail <unk> i 'm pretty sure when i was in jail everyone[MASK] saw titles in the international media something like this[MASK] during these nine days i was in jail <unk> but in my home country <unk> it was a totally[MASK] <unk> it was more like this manal <unk> al sharif faces charges of disturbing public order[MASK] and[MASK] inciting women to drive i know [MASK] manal <unk> al sharif withdraws from the campaign ah it 's okay this is my favorite [MASK] manal <unk> al sharif breaks down and confesses ' foreign forces incited me ' [MASK] and it goes on[MASK] <unk> trial and flogging me in public [MASK] so it 's a totally different picture <unk> i was asked last year to give a speech at the oslo freedom forum <unk> [MASK] i was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me and they looked at me as an inspiration at the[MASK] same time i flew back to my home country [MASK] they hated that speech so much <unk> the way they called it a betrayal to the saudi country and the saudi people and they even started a hashtag called # oslotraitor[MASK] on twitter some ten thousand tweets were written in that hashtag <unk> while the opposite hashtag[MASK] there was like a handful of tweets written they even started a poll more than thirteen thousand voters answered this poll <unk> whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech ninety percent said yes <unk> she 's a traitor <unk> [MASK] so it 's these two totally different perceptions of my personality[MASK] for me i 'm a proud saudi woman and i do love my country and because i love my country <unk> i 'm doing this [MASK] because i believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free[MASK] <unk> you learn lessons from these things that happen to you <unk> i learned to be always there [MASK] the first thing i got out of jail of course after i took a shower i went online <unk> i opened my twitter account and my facebook page <unk> [MASK] and i 've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me i would listen to what they say and i would never defend myself with words only[MASK] <unk> i would use actions when they said i should withdraw from the campaign <unk> i filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver 's license [MASK] there are a lot of people also very big support like those three thousand people who signed the petition to release me[MASK] we sent a petition to the shura council in favor of lifting the ban on saudi women and there were like three thousand five hundred[MASK] <unk> believed in that and they signed that petition [MASK] there were people like that i just showed some examples who are amazing who are believing in women 's rights in saudi arabia and trying <unk> and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views [MASK] saudi arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women 's rights the shura council that 's appointed by the king by royal decree of[MASK] king abdullah last year there were thirty women assigned to that council like twenty percent[MASK] <unk> twenty percent of the council [MASK] the same time finally that council after rejecting our petition four times for women driving they finally accepted it last february [MASK] after being sent to jail or sentenced lashing or sent to a[MASK] <unk> the spokesperson of the traffic police said we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers <unk> [MASK] the grand mufti who is the head of the religious establishment in saudi arabia he said it 's not recommended for women to drive it[MASK] used to be haram forbidden by the previous grand mufti <unk> [MASK] so for me it 's not about only these[MASK] <unk> 's about women themselves a friend once asked me she said so when do you think this women driving will happen [MASK] i told her only if women stop asking ' when ' and take action to make it now [MASK] so it 's not only about the system it 's also about us women to drive our own life i 'd say <unk> [MASK] so i have no clue really how i became an activist[MASK] <unk> know how i became one now <unk> [MASK] but all i know and all i 'm sure of in the future when someone asks me my story <unk> i will say i 'm proud[MASK] to be amongst those women who lifted <unk>[MASK] <unk> the ban and celebrated everyone 's freedom so[MASK] the question i started my talk with who do you think is more difficult to face oppressive governments or oppressive societies[MASK] <unk> hope you find clues to answer that from my speech <unk> thank you everyone[MASK]
