 <unk> it 's an amazing thing that we 're here to talk about the year of patients rising [MASK] you heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases [MASK] patients who are saying you know what i know what the odds are <unk> but i 'm going to look for more information i 'm going to define[MASK] <unk> define what the terms of my success are [MASK] i 'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago i almost died found out i was in fact <unk> already almost dead and what i then found out about what 's called the <unk>[MASK] <unk> explain what that term means i had been blogging under the name patient dave and when i discovered this i just renamed[MASK] <unk> when i first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer i noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who 's not in <unk>[MASK] <unk> the room here somebody out there some of our talks today we still act like that but i 'm here to tell you [MASK] <unk> you yourself will find yourself in a hospital bed or your mother your child there are heads nodding people who say yes i know exactly what you mean [MASK] so when you hear what i 'm going to talk about here today first of all i want to say that i am here on behalf of all the patients that i have ever met all the ones i haven 't met <unk> [MASK] this is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care in fixing health care [MASK] one of the senior doctors at my hospital charlie safran and[MASK] <unk> his colleague warner slack have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient <unk> they have been saying that since the <unk>[MASK] <unk> going to step back in history <unk> this is from july one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine i was a freshman in college <unk> and this was when we first landed on the moon <unk> [MASK] and it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface that 's the place where[MASK] <unk> you and i are right now where we live the world was changing it was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee [MASK] a few weeks later woodstock happened <unk> [MASK] three days of fun and music here just for historical authenticity is a picture of me in that year [MASK] <unk> the wavy hair <unk> the blue eyes it was really something that fall of one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine the whole earth catalog came out it was a hippie journal of <unk>[MASK] we think of hippies of being just hedonists <unk> but there 's a very strong component i was in that movement a very strong component of being responsible for yourself this book 's title 's subtitle is access to tools [MASK] it talked about how to build your own house how to grow your own food all kinds of things[MASK] <unk> in the 1980s this young doctor tom ferguson was the medical editor of the whole earth catalog <unk> he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves [MASK] in fact he said it was seventy to eighty percent of how we actually take care of our bodies <unk> well <unk> [MASK] he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease <unk> the key thing[MASK] <unk> that holds us back is access to information <unk> and when the web came along <unk> that changed everything because not only could we find information we could find other people like ourselves <unk>[MASK] who could gather who could bring us information <unk> and he coined this term e patients equipped engaged empowered enabled obviously at this stage of[MASK] <unk> life he was in a somewhat more dignified[MASK] form than he was back then now i was an engaged patient long before i ever heard of the term [MASK] in two thousand and six i went to my doctor for a regular physical and i had said i have a sore shoulder well <unk> i got an x ray and the next morning[MASK] you may have noticed those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this this morning some of the speakers named the date[MASK] when they found out about their condition for me it was[MASK] <unk> on january three two thousand and seven <unk> i was at the office my desk was clean i had the blue partition carpet on the walls <unk> the phone rang and it was my doctor [MASK] he said <unk> <unk> dave i pulled up the x ray image on the screen on the computer at home he said your shoulder is going to be fine but dave there 's something in your[MASK] <unk> if you look in that red oval that shadow was not supposed to be there [MASK] to make a long story short i said so you need me to get back in there he said yeah we 're going to need to do a ct scan of your chest[MASK] <unk> in parting i said is there anything i should do he said[MASK] think about this one this is the advice your doctor gives you just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife [MASK] i went in for the cat scan it turns out there[MASK] <unk> were five of these things in both my lungs <unk> so at that point we knew that it was cancer we knew it wasn 't lung cancer <unk> that meant it was metastasized from somewhere[MASK] <unk> the question was where from [MASK] so i went in for an ultrasound i got to do what many women have the jelly on the belly and the bzzzz [MASK] my wife came with me she 's a veterinarian so she 's seen[MASK] <unk> lots of ultrasounds i mean she knows i 'm not a dog[MASK] this is an mri image this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be what we saw in that kidney[MASK] was that big blob there there were actually two of these one was growing out the front and had already erupted and latched onto the bowel one was growing out the back and it attached to the <unk> psoas muscle which is a big muscle in the back that i[MASK] <unk> 'd never heard of but all of a sudden i cared about it [MASK] i went home <unk> now i 've been googling i 've been online since one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine on compuserve <unk> i went home and i know you can 't read the details here that 's not important [MASK] my point is i went to a respected medical website webmd because i know how to filter out junk i also found[MASK] <unk> before i met her <unk> i went through some suboptimal search results [MASK] so i looked i looked for quality information there 's so much about trust what sources of information can we trust where does my body[MASK] end and an invader start <unk> a cancer a tumor is something you grow out of your own tissue how does that happen where does[MASK] <unk> so what i read on webmd [MASK] the prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer almost all patients are incurable [MASK] i 've been online long enough to know if i don 't like the first results i get i go look for more [MASK] and what i found on other websites was even by the third page of google results[MASK] <unk> the heck i didn 't feel sick at all i mean <unk> i 'd been getting tired in the evening but i was fifty six years old you know <unk> i was slowly losing weight but for me that was what the doctor told me to do[MASK] it was really something and this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug i eventually got totally by[MASK] <unk> there 's that thing in my lung [MASK] in the left femur the left thigh bone there 's another one i had one my leg eventually snapped i fainted and landed on it and it broke there 's one in the skull and then[MASK] <unk> for good measure i had these other tumors including by the time my treatment started one was growing out of my tongue <unk> i had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue <unk> and what i read was that my median survival was twenty four weeks [MASK] <unk> mother 's face going to look like on the day of my funeral i had to sit down with my daughter and say [MASK] here 's the situation her boyfriend was with her i said i don 't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while dad 's still alive it[MASK] 's really serious if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help think about this well my doctor prescribed a[MASK] a network of cancer patients of all amazing things [MASK] very quickly they told me kidney cancer is an uncommon disease get yourself to a specialist center there is no cure but there 's something that sometimes works it usually doesn 't called high dosage interleukin most hospitals don 't offer it[MASK] so they won 't even tell you it exists[MASK] don 't let them give you anything else first and by the way here are four doctors in your part of the united states who offer it and their phone numbers how amazing is that <unk>[MASK] here 's the thing here we are four years later you can 't find a website that gives patients that information <unk> government approved american cancer society <unk> but patients know what patients want to know <unk> [MASK] it 's the power of patient networks[MASK] this amazing substance again <unk> i mentioned where does my body end my oncologist and i talk a lot these days because i try to keep my talks technically accurate <unk> [MASK] and he said you know the immune system is good at detecting invaders[MASK] <unk> bacteria coming from outside but when it 's your own tissue that you 've grown it 's a whole different thing and i went through a mental exercise actually because i[MASK] <unk> started a patient support community of my own[MASK] on a website <unk> and one of my friends one of my relatives actually said look dave who grew this thing [MASK] are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself so we went into it the story of how all that happened is in the book <unk> [MASK] anyway this is the way the numbers unfolded me being me i put the numbers from my hospital 's website[MASK] <unk> my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet don 't worry about the numbers you see that 's the immune system amazing thing those two yellow lines are where i got the two doses of interleukin <unk>[MASK] two months apart <unk> and look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between just incredible who knows what we 'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it[MASK] <unk> daughter [MASK] got married and when she came down those steps <unk> [MASK] and it was just her and me for that moment <unk> i was so glad that she didn 't have to say to her mother i wish dad could have been here [MASK] and this is what we 're doing when we make health care better [MASK] now i want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care <unk> this is regina holliday <unk> a painter[MASK] in washington dc whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease she 's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital one of the things that she discovered[MASK] was that her husband 's medical record in this paper folder[MASK] was just disorganized and she thought you know if i have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box <unk> why can 't there be something that simple[MASK] <unk> telling every new nurse who comes on duty every new doctor the basics about my husband 's condition so she painted this medical facts mural[MASK] with a nutrition label something like that in a diagram of him she then last year painted this diagram she studied health care like me she came to realize there were[MASK] <unk> that you just don 't hear about at medical conferences patients are such an underutilized resource [MASK] well as it said in my introduction i 've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data i actually said at one conference a couple of years ago give[MASK] me my damn data because you people can 't be trusted to keep it clean and here she has our damned data it 's a pun[MASK] which is starting to break out starting to break through the water symbolizes[MASK] and in fact i want to do a little something improvisational for you there 's a guy on twitter that i know a health it guy outside boston <unk> and he wrote the e patient rap [MASK] and it goes like this [MASK] gimme my damn data[MASK] <unk> i wanna be an e patient just like dave gimme my damn data ' cause it 's my life to[MASK] <unk> ipads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family <unk> here 's a website <unk>[MASK] that i stumbled across and i thought you know i wonder what my psoas muscle is so you can click on things and remove it and i saw aha [MASK] that 's the kidney and the psoas muscle i was[MASK] <unk> and then i realized it reminded me of google earth where you can fly to any address <unk> [MASK] and i thought why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data[MASK] and have google earth for my body [MASK] what did google come out with this year now there 's google body browser <unk> but you see it 's still generic it 's not my[MASK] <unk> but if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it the way software innovators like to do who knows what we 'll be able to come up with [MASK] one final story this is kelly young a rheumatoid arthritis patient from florida[MASK] <unk> this is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks ra patients as they call themselves her blog[MASK] <unk> have a big problem because forty percent of them have no visible symptoms[MASK] and that makes it really hard to tell how the disease is going and some doctors think yeah right you 're really in pain [MASK] well <unk> she found through her online research a nuclear bone scan that 's usually used for cancer <unk> [MASK] but it can also reveal inflammation <unk> and she saw that[MASK] if there is no[MASK] <unk> then the scan is a uniform gray <unk> so she took it and the radiologist 's report[MASK] said no cancer found well that 's not what he was supposed to do with it so[MASK] <unk> she wanted to have it read again and her doctor fired her [MASK] she pulled up the cd he said if you don 't want to follow my instructions go away so she pulled up the cd of the scan images and look at[MASK] <unk> she 's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care [MASK] see that is an empowered patient no medical training we are you are the most underused resource in health care what she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data how big a deal was this well at[MASK] tim <unk> berners lee himself inventor[MASK] <unk> gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser[MASK] find other people 's articles about the data but the raw data and he got them chanting by the end of the talk raw data now <unk> raw data now <unk>[MASK] and i ask you three words <unk> please to improve health care <unk> [MASK] <unk> patients around the world watching this on the webcast god bless you everyone let patients help[MASK]
