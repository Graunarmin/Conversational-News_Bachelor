 <unk> i was living in a tiny house behind someone else 's house in los angeles it was this guest house it had[MASK] <unk> kind of been dilapidated not taken care of for a long time <unk> and one night i was sitting there and i[MASK] got this really spooky feeling kind of the feeling like you 're being watched <unk> [MASK] but no one was there except my two dogs and they were just chewing their feet <unk>[MASK] <unk> just my imagination <unk> but the feeling just kept getting worse and[MASK] i started to feel this[MASK] this pressure in my chest <unk> sort of like the feeling when you get bad news <unk> but it started to sink lower and lower[MASK] and almost hurt <unk> and over the course of that week this feeling got worse and worse[MASK] <unk> and i started to become convinced[MASK] that something was there[MASK] in my little guest house haunting me <unk> [MASK] and i started to hear these sounds [MASK] this whoosh kind of whisper like something passing through me <unk>[MASK] <unk> i don 't think you 're crazy <unk> i think you just need to do a cleansing ritual[MASK] <unk> get some sage and burn it and tell it to go away so i said ok and[MASK] i went and i bought sage i had never done this before so i set the sage on fire <unk> waved it about and said go away [MASK] this is my house <unk> i live here you don[MASK] <unk> but the feeling stayed nothing got better <unk> and then i started to think ok well now this thing is probably just laughing at me <unk> because[MASK] it hasn 't left <unk> and i probably just look like this impotent powerless thing that couldn 't get it to go away so[MASK] every day i 'd come home and you guys this feeling got[MASK] <unk> laughing at it now but i would i would sit there in bed and cry every night <unk> and the feeling[MASK] on my chest got worse and worse <unk> it was was physically painful <unk> and[MASK] i even went to a psychiatrist and tried to get her to prescribe me medicine <unk> and she wouldn 't just because i[MASK] <unk> so finally i got on the internet <unk> and i googled hauntings [MASK] and i came upon this forum of ghost hunters but these were a special kind of ghost hunters they were skeptics[MASK] they believed that every case of ghosts that they had investigated so far had been explained away by science <unk> and i was like[MASK] <unk> this is what 's happening to me <unk> and if you have an explanation for me <unk> i would love to hear it and one of them said ok um [MASK] have you heard of carbon monoxide poisoning[MASK] <unk> leak leaking into your home i looked it up and the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning[MASK] include a pressure on your chest <unk> auditory hallucinations whoosh[MASK] and an unexplained feeling of dread <unk> [MASK] <unk> so that night i called the gas company i said i have an emergency i need you to come out i don 't want to get into the story now but i need you to come out [MASK] they came out i said i suspect a gas leak [MASK] they brought their carbon monoxide detector <unk> [MASK] and the man said it 's a really good thing that you called us tonight <unk> because you could have been dead very soon[MASK] <unk> haunted houses <unk> and i wonder how many of them have been in one[MASK] and how many of them have been in danger <unk> [MASK] so that haunting story has led me to my job <unk> i 'm an investigator and i 'm an investigator in two senses i 'm an investigative[MASK] <unk> and i 'm also an investigator of the claims of the paranormal and claims of the spiritual <unk> and that means a few things[MASK] <unk> sometimes that means that i 'm pretending to need an exorcism so i can get[MASK] yes that 's right so i can go to an exorcist[MASK] and see if he 's using gimmicks or psychological tricks to try to convince someone that they 're possessed [MASK] sometimes that means i 'm going undercover in a fringe group[MASK] which i report on for a podcast that i[MASK] <unk> i 've done over seventy investigations like this with my co host ross <unk>[MASK] i would love to tell you that nine times out of ten science wins saves the day it 's[MASK] all explained that 's not true <unk> the truth is [MASK] ten times out of ten science wins it saves the day[MASK] <unk> mean there 's no such thing as a mystery of course there are mysteries <unk> but a mystery is a mystery <unk> it is not a ghost <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i believe there are two kinds of truth[MASK] <unk> me a while to get to this place <unk> but i think this is right so hear me out i think there is outer truth and there 's inner truth <unk> so[MASK] if you say to me [MASK] there was a man named jesus and he once existed [MASK] that 's outer truth right <unk> and we can go and look at the historical record we can determine whether that seems to be true <unk> [MASK] and i would argue <unk> it does seem to be true[MASK] <unk> i would say that 's an outer truth claim <unk> because he physically rose or he didn 't i 'm not going to get into whether he rose or he didn 't [MASK] but i would say that 's an outer truth claim it happened or it didn 't happen[MASK] but if you say i don 't care whether he rose from the dead it 's symbolically important to me <unk> and that metaphor[MASK] <unk> is so meaningful so purposeful to me <unk> and i 'm not going to try to persuade you of it [MASK] now you 've moved it from outer truth to inner truth from science to art <unk> and i think we have a tendency to not be clear about this to try to move our inner truths to outer truths [MASK] or to not be fair about it to each other and when people are telling us their inner truths to try to make them defend them by[MASK] <unk> 'm talking here about outer truth about objective things[MASK] and there was an objective reality in my haunted house right <unk> now that i 've told you about the gas leak <unk> i doubt a single person here would be like i still think there was a ghost too [MASK] because as soon as we have these scientific explanations <unk> we know to give up the ghost[MASK] <unk> we use these things as <unk>[MASK] for things that we can 't explain we don 't believe them because of evidence <unk> we believe them because of a lack of evidence[MASK] so there is a group in los angeles[MASK] called the independent investigations group or the iig and they do great work they 'll give[MASK] a $ ten thousand prize to anyone who can show <unk> under scientific[MASK] <unk> that they have a paranormal ability no one 's done it yet <unk> but[MASK] they 've had a couple people who claim that they were clairaudients which means that they can hear voices either from the great beyond or they can read minds <unk> [MASK] and they had one person[MASK] who was very sincere who believed that he could he could read minds <unk> so they set up a test with him[MASK] <unk> this is the way it always works the group says ok we have a protocol we have a way to scientifically test this do you agree with it the person says yes <unk> then they test it it 's very important that both sides agree [MASK] they did that they tested him they said ok <unk> you know what [MASK] you weren 't able to predict what lisa was thinking <unk> [MASK] it matched up about the same as chance looks like you don 't have the power and that gave them the opportunity to compassionately sit down with him and have[MASK] a very difficult discussion which basically amounted to hey <unk> [MASK] we know you 're sincere <unk> and what that means is [MASK] you do hear something in your head and that guy got to make the very difficult decision[MASK] <unk> but really the <unk>[MASK] <unk> decision about whether to go get help we 're actually helping people[MASK] <unk> these these connections that maybe before seemed like otherworldly explanations <unk> help draw us into reality[MASK] and maybe change our lives for the better <unk> [MASK] now on the other hand <unk> maybe one time it 'll turn out to be true <unk> [MASK] <unk> respect them enough to ask these good questions challenge and see how you can examine them together <unk> because there 's this idea that you can 't respect[MASK] <unk> a belief and still challenge it but that 's not true <unk> when we jiggle the lock when we test the claim we 're saying ok i respect you i 'm listening to what you 're saying i 'm going to test it out with you we 've all had that experience where you 're telling someone something and[MASK] oh that 's really interesting yeah you know you 're being had but when someone says really huh [MASK] sounds a little sketchy to me <unk>[MASK] you at least know you 're being engaged and respected <unk> and that 's the kind of attitude we should have with these claims that 's showing someone that you care what they 're saying[MASK] <unk> most of these searches will come up[MASK] empty <unk> but that 's how all of science works every cure for cancer so far has not panned out <unk> but we don 't stop looking <unk>[MASK] for two reasons because[MASK] number one the answer matters whether it 's looking at the afterlife or the paranormal or the cure for cancer it all amounts to the same question[MASK] <unk> how long will we be here[MASK] and two <unk> because looking for the truth [MASK] being open minded and being willing to be wrong and to change your whole worldview[MASK] is[MASK] i still get excited at ghost stories every single time i still consider that every group i join might be right and i hope i never lose that hope[MASK] let 's all never lose that hope because searching for what 's out there[MASK] helps us understand what 's in here <unk> and also please have a carbon monoxide detector in your[MASK]
