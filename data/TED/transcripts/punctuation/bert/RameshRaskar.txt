 <unk> and curiosity with this photo of a bullet[MASK] piercing through an apple and exposure just a millionth of a second <unk> [MASK] <unk> now <unk> fifty years later we can go a million times faster[MASK] and see the world[MASK] not at a million[MASK] or a billion but one trillion frames per second <unk> i present to you[MASK] a new type of photography [MASK] <unk> a new imaging technique so fast[MASK] that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion <unk> [MASK] and with that we can create cameras that can look around corners <unk> beyond line of sight <unk> or see inside our body[MASK] without an x ray and really challenge what we mean by a camera now if i take a laser pointer[MASK] and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second which is several femtoseconds[MASK] i 'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide [MASK] and that packet of photons that bullet will travel at the speed of light <unk> and again a million times faster than an ordinary[MASK] <unk> if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire[MASK] into this bottle <unk> how will those photons shatter into this bottle <unk> how does light look in slow motion[MASK] <unk> now remember the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond that 's how much time it takes for light to travel but i 'm slowing[MASK] <unk> down[MASK] in this video by a factor of ten billion <unk> so you can see the light in motion [MASK] but coca cola did not sponsor this research [MASK] now there 's a lot going on in this movie so let me break this down and show you what 's going on so the pulse enters the bottle our bullet with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside some of the light leaks[MASK] <unk> leaks goes on the table and you start seeing these ripples of waves <unk> [MASK] many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions <unk> as you can see there 's a bubble of air and it 's bouncing around inside meanwhile <unk>[MASK] <unk> the ripples are traveling on the table and because of the reflections at the top you see at the back of the bottle <unk> [MASK] <unk> now if you take an ordinary bullet[MASK] and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of ten billion do you know how long you 'll have to sit here[MASK] to watch that movie [MASK] a day a week actually a whole year <unk> it 'll be a very boring movie[MASK] <unk> slow ordinary bullet in motion <unk> and what about some[MASK] photography [MASK] you can watch the ripples again <unk> washing over the table[MASK] <unk> the tomato and the wall in the back it 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water [MASK] i thought this is how nature[MASK] paints a photo one femto frame at a time <unk> but of course our eye sees an integral composite <unk> [MASK] but if you look at this tomato one more time you will notice as the light washes over the tomato <unk> it continues to glow it doesn 't become dark why is that[MASK] because the tomato is actually ripe and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato and it comes out after several trillionths of a second <unk> [MASK] so in the future <unk> [MASK] when this femto camera is in your camera phone you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it [MASK] so how did my team at mit create this camera[MASK] now as photographers you know if you take a short exposure photo you get very little light <unk> [MASK] but we 're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure so you[MASK] 're going to get hardly any light <unk> [MASK] so what we do is we send that bullet that packet of photons millions of times and record again and again with very clever synchronization and from the gigabytes of data <unk> we computationally weave together to create[MASK] femto videos i showed you [MASK] and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways [MASK] so superman can fly some other heroes can become invisible [MASK] but what about a new power for a future superhero to see around corners <unk> [MASK] the idea is that we could shine some light on the door it 's going to[MASK] <unk> bounce go inside the room some of that is going to reflect back on the door <unk> and then back to the camera <unk> and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light <unk> [MASK] and it 's not science fiction we have actually built it on the left you see our femto camera [MASK] there 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall <unk> and we 're going to bounce light off the door <unk> [MASK] <unk> going to fire those bullets of light <unk> and they 're going to hit this wall <unk> [MASK] and because of the packet of the photons <unk> they will scatter in all the[MASK] <unk> some of them will reach our hidden mannequin which in turn will again scatter that light[MASK] <unk> and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light <unk> [MASK] and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera <unk> but most interestingly they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot [MASK] and because we have a camera that can run so fast our[MASK] <unk> some unique abilities <unk> it has very good time resolution <unk> and it can look at the world at the speed of light <unk> [MASK] and this way we know the distances [MASK] of course to the door but also to the hidden objects <unk> but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance [MASK] by shining one laser we can record one raw photo <unk> which if you look on the screen[MASK] 't really make any sense [MASK] but then we will take a lot of such pictures <unk> dozens of such pictures <unk> put them together and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light <unk> and from that [MASK] can we see the hidden object can we see it in full 3d [MASK] so this is our reconstruction[MASK] <unk> we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road <unk> but in the future we could create cars that avoid collisions with what 's around the bend <unk> [MASK] or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows <unk> or we can build endoscopes[MASK] that can see deep inside the body around occluders <unk> [MASK] and also for cardioscopes <unk> but of course because of tissue and blood this is quite challenging <unk> so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about <unk> femto photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of[MASK] <unk> all the gigabytes of data that we 're collecting every time are not just for scientific imaging <unk> [MASK] but we can also do a new form of computational photography <unk> [MASK] with time lapse and color coding <unk> [MASK] and we look at those ripples remember <unk> the time between each of[MASK] <unk> ripples is only a few trillionths of a second <unk> [MASK] but there 's also something funny going on here <unk> when you look at the ripples under the cap the ripples are moving away from us <unk> [MASK] the ripples should be moving towards us what 's going on here <unk> it turns out because we 're recording[MASK] nearly at the speed of light <unk> [MASK] we have strange effects[MASK] <unk> effects and einstein would have loved to see this picture [MASK] the order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order [MASK] so by applying the corresponding space and time warp we can correct for this distortion <unk> [MASK] so whether it 's for photography around corners[MASK] <unk> or creating the next generation of health imaging <unk> or creating new visualizations <unk> [MASK] since our invention <unk> we have open sourced all the data and details on our website and our hope[MASK] is that the diy the creative[MASK] and the research communities[MASK] will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels[MASK] in cameras and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging <unk> it 's about time <unk> thank you[MASK]
