 <unk> this story is about taking imagination seriously <unk> [MASK] fourteen years ago <unk> i first encountered this ordinary material fishnet used the same way for centuries <unk> [MASK] <unk> i 'm using it to create permanent billowing voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world [MASK] i was an unlikely person to be doing this i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture [MASK] in fact after college i applied to seven art schools[MASK] and was rejected by all seven <unk> i went off on my own to become an artist and i painted for ten years[MASK] <unk> years <unk> when i was offered a fulbright to india [MASK] promising to give exhibitions of paintings i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram the deadline for the show arrived[MASK] my paints didn 't [MASK] i had to do something this fishing village was famous for sculpture <unk> so i tried bronze casting <unk> [MASK] but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive[MASK] <unk> went for a walk on the beach <unk> watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand i 'd seen it every day <unk> but this time i saw it differently[MASK] a new approach to sculpture a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials [MASK] my first satisfying sculpture was made[MASK] <unk> we hoisted them on poles to photograph <unk> [MASK] i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns i was mesmerized <unk> [MASK] i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans next in lithuania[MASK] <unk> with lace makers <unk> i liked the fine detail it gave my work <unk> [MASK] but i wanted to make them larger to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in [MASK] returning to india to work with those fishermen <unk> we made a net of a million and a half[MASK] thousands of people saw it [MASK] and one of them was the urbanist manual <unk> sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto portugal[MASK] <unk> he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city <unk> i didn 't know if i could do that and preserve my art <unk> durable <unk>[MASK] <unk> those are in opposition to idiosyncratic delicate and ephemeral [MASK] for two years i searched for a fiber[MASK] that could survive ultraviolet rays salt air <unk> pollution and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind [MASK] we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic[MASK] <unk> we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds <unk> [MASK] but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving <unk> [MASK] i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america 's cup racing yachts named peter heppel <unk> [MASK] he helped me tackle the twin[MASK] <unk> challenges of precise shape[MASK] and gentle movement <unk> [MASK] i couldn 't build this the way i knew because hand tied knots weren 't going to withstand a hurricane [MASK] so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory <unk> learned the variables of their machines and figured out a way to make lace with[MASK] <unk> there was no language to translate this ancient idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce <unk> [MASK] so we had to create one <unk> three years and two children later[MASK] <unk> we raised this <unk>[MASK] lace net it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built permanent and had lost nothing in[MASK] <unk> translation [MASK] this intersection had been bland and anonymous [MASK] now it had a sense of place <unk> [MASK] i walked underneath it for the first time [MASK] as i watched the wind 's choreography unfold <unk> i felt sheltered and at the same time connected to limitless sky[MASK] my life was not going to be the same [MASK] i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to share[MASK] two directions that are new in my work <unk> historic philadelphia city hall[MASK] <unk> its plaza i felt needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting <unk> [MASK] so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind[MASK] and in testing discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet[MASK] <unk> i 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time[MASK] like an x ray of the city 's circulatory system unfolding <unk> [MASK] next challenge [MASK] the biennial of the americas in denver asked could i represent the thirty five nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture[MASK] i didn 't know where to begin <unk> but i said yes <unk> [MASK] i read about the recent earthquake in chile[MASK] and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean [MASK] it shifted the earth 's tectonic plates <unk> sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened[MASK] <unk> so i contacted noaa and i asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami and translated it into this [MASK] its title one point two six refers to the number of microseconds that the earth 's day was shortened <unk> [MASK] i couldn 't build this with a steel ring the way i knew <unk> its shape was too complex now so i replaced the metal armature with a soft[MASK] <unk> fine mesh of a fiber fifteen times stronger than steel [MASK] the sculpture could now be entirely soft <unk> which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings[MASK] literally becoming part of the fabric of the city [MASK] there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity <unk> so we had to create it[MASK] then i got a call from new york city[MASK] asking if i could adapt these concepts[MASK] to times square or the high line [MASK] this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers [MASK] they don 't have funding yet[MASK] <unk> now of bringing these to cities around the world where they 're most needed <unk> [MASK] fourteen years ago <unk> i searched for beauty[MASK] in the traditional things in craft forms [MASK] <unk> materials and engineering[MASK] to create voluptuous billowing forms the scale of buildings [MASK] my artistic horizons continue to grow i 'll leave you with this story i got a call from a friend in phoenix [MASK] an attorney in the office who 'd never been interested in art never visited the local art museum <unk> [MASK] dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down[MASK] <unk> underneath the sculpture there they were in their business suits laying in the grass noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn 't know [MASK] sharing the rediscovery of wonder <unk> [MASK] thank you[MASK]
