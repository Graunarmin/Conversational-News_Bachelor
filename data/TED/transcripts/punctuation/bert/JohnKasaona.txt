 <unk> god gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time [MASK] i think how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in eighteen minutes[MASK] be quite a challenge for me [MASK] most african stories these days <unk> they talk about famine hiv and aids poverty[MASK] or war but my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success [MASK] it is about a country in the southwest of africa[MASK] called namibia namibia[MASK] has got two point one million people <unk> but it is only twice the size of california <unk> i come from a region[MASK] in the remote northwest part of the country it 's called kunene region [MASK] and in the center of kunene region is the village of sesfontein this is where i was born this is where i 'm coming from[MASK] <unk> most people that are following the story of angelina jolie[MASK] and brad pitt[MASK] will know where namibia is [MASK] they love namibia for its beautiful dunes [MASK] that are even taller than the empire state building <unk> [MASK] wind[MASK] and time have twisted our landscape[MASK] into very[MASK] <unk> and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land [MASK] i 'm a himba you might wonder why are you wearing these western clothes i 'm[MASK] a himba and namibian a himba is one of the twenty nine ethnic groups in namibia <unk> we live a very[MASK] traditional lifestyle[MASK] <unk> i grew up herding looking after our livestock goats sheep and cattle <unk> [MASK] and one day my father actually took me into the bush he said john <unk> i want you to become[MASK] a good herder <unk> boy <unk> if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah[MASK] eating our goat[MASK] <unk> and he will let go of the goat and run off [MASK] but then he said boy <unk> if you run into a lion[MASK] <unk> don 't move <unk> don 't move <unk> stand your[MASK] <unk> imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after in this way[MASK] in this way i actually started to learn about nature <unk> in addition to being an ordinary namibian and[MASK] in addition to being a himba i 'm also a trained conservationist [MASK] and it is very important[MASK] if you are in the field to know what to confront[MASK] <unk> the whites could farm <unk> graze and hunt as they wished <unk> but we black we were not regarded as responsible to to use wildlife <unk> whenever we tried to hunt <unk> [MASK] we were called poachers <unk> and as a result we were fined and[MASK] <unk> and soviet interests[MASK] fought for control over my country <unk> [MASK] and you know during war time <unk> there are militaries <unk> armies that are moving around <unk> and the army hunted for valuable rhino horns[MASK] and tusks <unk> they could sell these things for anything between[MASK] <unk> every himba had a rifle because it was wartime <unk> the british <unk> 303 rifle was just all over the whole country <unk> [MASK] then in the same time around one thousand nine hundred and eighty we had a very big drought <unk> it killed almost everything that was left [MASK] our livestock was was[MASK] <unk> i remember a night when a hungry leopard[MASK] went into the house of one of our[MASK] neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed it 's a very sad story[MASK] but even today that memory is still in people 's minds they can pinpoint the exact location where[MASK] <unk> almost lost everything and my father said [MASK] why don 't you just go to school and they sent me off to school just to get busy somewhere there [MASK] and the year i went to school my father actually got a job with a non governmental organization called irdnc integrated rural development and nature conservation <unk> [MASK] they actually spend a lot of time[MASK] a year in the communities they were trusted by the local communities[MASK] like our leader joshua kangombe <unk> joshua kangombe saw what was happening wildlife disappearing <unk> poaching[MASK] was skyrocketing <unk> and the situation seemed very hopeless <unk> death and despair surrounded joshua[MASK] and and our entire communities <unk> [MASK] <unk> proposed to joshua what if we pay people that you trust[MASK] to look after wildlife <unk> do you have anybody in your communities <unk> or people that know the bush very well[MASK] and that know wildlife very well[MASK] my father has been a poacher for quite a long time <unk> instead of shooting poachers dead[MASK] like they were doing elsewhere in africa irdnc has helped helped men reclaim their abilities[MASK] to manage their peoples and their rights to own and[MASK] <unk> people started feeling ownership over wildlife wildlife numbers started coming back and that 's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia [MASK] with independence the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government [MASK] three things that actually help to build on this foundation the very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas <unk> [MASK] here is our tradition[MASK] at every himba village <unk> there is a sacred fire <unk> [MASK] and at this sacred fire <unk> the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman[MASK] and advise us where to get water where to get grazings <unk> and where to go and hunt <unk> [MASK] and i think this is the best way of regulating ourselves[MASK] on the environment[MASK] <unk> and here are the new ideas <unk> [MASK] transporting rhinos using helicopters i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can 't see isn 't it [MASK] and these things we were taught by outsiders <unk> we learned these things[MASK] from outsiders we needed new boundaries to describe our[MASK] <unk> we needed to learn more things like gps just to see whether[MASK] can gps really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere[MASK] in the west <unk> and we we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world [MASK] and through this we actually started realizing our dreams <unk> and we maintained honoring our[MASK] <unk> traditions but we were still open to new ideas <unk> [MASK] the second element is that we wanted to have a life a better life where we can benefit through many things most poachers [MASK] like my father [MASK] were people from our own community they were not people from outside these were our own people [MASK] and sometimes once they were caught <unk> they were treated with respect [MASK] <unk> back into the communities[MASK] and they were made part of the bigger dreams <unk> the best one like my father i 'm not campaigning for my father [MASK] laughter they were put in charge to stop others from from poaching <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] when this thing started going on we started becoming one community renewing our connection to nature <unk> and that was a very[MASK] <unk> in namibia <unk> [MASK] the last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships[MASK] <unk> our government has given legal status over our traditional lands <unk> [MASK] the other partners that we have got is business communities <unk> [MASK] business communities helped bring namibia onto the world map[MASK] and they have also helped make[MASK] <unk> wildlife a very[MASK] valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture <unk> [MASK] and most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in namibia have been trained through the initiative through the involvement of world wildlife fund[MASK] in the most <unk> up to date conservation practices they have also given funding for two decades to this whole program[MASK] and so far with the support of world wildlife fund we 've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today <unk> [MASK] namibia <unk> or sesfontein[MASK] was no more an isolated village somewhere hidden away in namibia <unk> with these assets we are now part of the global village <unk> [MASK] thirty years have passed since[MASK] <unk> father 's first job as a community game guard it 's very unfortunate that he passed away[MASK] and he cannot see the success as i and my children see it today <unk> when i finished school in <unk>[MASK] <unk> were only twenty lions in the entire northwest in our area <unk> but today <unk> there are more than one hundred and thirty lions[MASK] so please if you go to namibia make sure that you stay in the tents <unk> don 't walk out at night [MASK] the black rhino[MASK] they were almost extinct in[MASK] <unk> they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village <unk> because the natural plain has multiplied [MASK] like zebras <unk> springboks and everything they stay very much far away[MASK] <unk> this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals[MASK] what started as very small community rangers getting community involved [MASK] has now grown into something that we call conservancies conservancies[MASK] are legally[MASK] instituted institutions by the government <unk> and these are run by the communities themselves for their benefit today we have got[MASK] sixty conservancies[MASK] that manage and protect over thirteen million hectares of land in namibia <unk> [MASK] we have already reshaped conservation in the[MASK] <unk> conservancy generated five point seven million dollars this is our new[MASK] economy an economy based on the respect of our natural resources <unk> and we are able to use this money for many things very importantly we put it in education <unk> [MASK] secondly <unk> we put it for infrastructure <unk> food very important[MASK] <unk> you know that africa is being affected by these viruses <unk> [MASK] and this is the good news from africa that we have to shout from the rooftops [MASK] and now what[MASK] <unk> to help me and our partners[MASK] take some of what we have learned in namibia[MASK] to other places[MASK] with similar problems places like[MASK] mongolia [MASK] or even in your own backyards <unk> the northern great plains where buffalo and other animals have suffered[MASK] and many communities are in decline <unk> i like that one [MASK] namibia serving as a model to africa [MASK] and africa serving as a model to the united states [MASK] we were successful in namibia[MASK] <unk> because[MASK] we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife <unk> we knew[MASK] conservation would fail[MASK] if <unk>[MASK] to improve the lives of the local communities [MASK] so [MASK] come and talk to me about namibia[MASK] <unk> and better yet <unk> come to namibia and see for yourself how we have done it and please <unk> do visit our website[MASK] to learn more and see how you can help cbnrm[MASK] in africa and across the world <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
