 <unk> i grew up in this neighborhood when i was fifteen years old i went from being what i think was a strapping young athlete [MASK] over four months <unk> slowly wasting away until i was basically a famine victim[MASK] with an unquenchable thirst[MASK] <unk> i had basically digested away my body <unk> and[MASK] this all came to a head when i was on a backpacking trip my first one ever actually on old rag mountain in west virginia and[MASK] was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog that night[MASK] i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type one diabetic in[MASK] and i recovered thanks to the miracles of modern medicine <unk> insulin and other things and[MASK] gained all my weight back and more <unk> and[MASK] something festered inside me after this happened [MASK] what i thought about was what caused the diabetes you see diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself and at the time people thought[MASK] <unk> that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen[MASK] had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin and this is what i thought for a long period of time and that 's in fact what[MASK] <unk> medicine and people have focused on quite a bit the microbes that do bad things and that 's where i need my[MASK] so i went yesterday i apologize i skipped a few of the talks and i went over to the national academy of sciences building[MASK] <unk> and they[MASK] sell toys <unk> giant microbes and[MASK] here we go <unk> so you you have caught <unk> flesh eating disease if you[MASK] <unk> i gotta get back out my baseball ability here [MASK] so[MASK] <unk> unfortunately or not surprisingly <unk> most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens [MASK] everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that 's what i was focusing on [MASK] and[MASK] it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes and those microbes actually[MASK] do us good much of the time rather than killing us <unk> [MASK] and so we 've known about this for some period of time people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us i know you 're not paying attention to me but [MASK] the microbes that cover us <unk> and[MASK] if you look at them in the microscope you can see that we actually have ten times as many cells of microbes on us as we have[MASK] human cells there 's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain [MASK] we are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms <unk> [MASK] and unfortunately if you want to learn about the microorganisms just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient and so we just heard about the dna sequencing it turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their dna[MASK] <unk> and that 's what i 've been doing for twenty years using dna sequencing <unk> collecting samples from various places including the human body <unk> [MASK] reading the dna sequence and then using that dna sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place <unk> and what 's amazing when you use this technology for example looking at humans we 're not just covered in a sea of[MASK] <unk> there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us <unk> [MASK] we have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us <unk> and so this microbial diversity differs between <unk>[MASK] <unk> people <unk> and what people have been thinking about in the last ten maybe fifteen years is maybe these microbes this microbial cloud in and on us <unk> [MASK] and illness differences between us <unk> and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you it turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type one diabetes is not fighting <unk>[MASK] <unk> a pathogen <unk> but is in fact trying to miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you [MASK] <unk> killing the cells that make insulin in my body <unk> [MASK] and so what i want to tell you about for a few minutes is what people have learned using dna sequencing techniques in particular to study the microbial cloud <unk>[MASK] that lives in and on us <unk> and i want to tell you a story about a personal project my first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came[MASK] <unk> corner from here at georgetown i gave a talk and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk and came up to me afterwards saying [MASK] they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people and they wanted to look at the microbes[MASK] after the transplants <unk> and so i started a collaboration with this person michael zasloff and thomas fishbein to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea[MASK] after they were transplanted into a recipient <unk> [MASK] and i can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there but the reason i want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project <unk> they take the donor ileum <unk> [MASK] which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community say crohn 's disease [MASK] and they sterilized the donor ileum[MASK] cleaned out all the microbes and then put it in the recipient <unk> they did this because this was common practice in medicine even though it was[MASK] obvious[MASK] that this was not a good idea <unk> and fortunately in the course of this project the transplant surgeons and the other people decided <unk> forget common[MASK] <unk> we have to switch so they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum [MASK] they leave the microbes with the donor and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this[MASK] ileal transplant <unk> and so people this is a study that i did now in the last few years there 's been a great expansion in using dna technology to study the microbes[MASK] <unk> and on people there 's something called the human microbiome project that 's going on in the united states and metahit going on in europe and a lot of other projects and when people have done[MASK] a variety of studies they have learned things[MASK] such as when a baby is born during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother there are risk factors associated with cesarean sections some of those risk factors may be due to <unk>[MASK] <unk> when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal <unk> [MASK] and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system <unk> [MASK] helps in fighting off pathogens helps in our metabolism <unk> and determining our metabolic rate probably determines our odor <unk> and may even shape our behavior[MASK] in a variety of ways and so these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety[MASK] <unk> of important functions for the microbial community this cloud the <unk>[MASK] that live in and on us <unk> and one[MASK] area that i think is very interesting <unk> which many of you may have now that we 've thrown microbes into the crowd is[MASK] something that i would call germophobia so people are really into[MASK] <unk> we have antibiotics in our kitchen counters people are washing every part of them all of the time we pump antibiotics into our food into[MASK] our communities we take antibiotics[MASK] excessively <unk> and killing pathogens is a good thing if you 're sick <unk> but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world that <unk>[MASK] <unk> we 're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us <unk> and excessive use of antibiotics in particular in children has been shown to be associated[MASK] <unk> with <unk> again risk factors for obesity for autoimmune diseases for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of[MASK] the microbial community <unk> so the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not or we can kill it with antibiotics <unk> but what can we do to[MASK] <unk> i 'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics [MASK] probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases there 's a project going on at uc davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat [MASK] prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants premature infants have real problems with their microbial community [MASK] <unk> may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants[MASK] but probiotics are sort of a very very simple solution most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them <unk> [MASK] maybe five species in them and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species [MASK] so what can we do to restore our microbial community[MASK] when we have thousands and thousands of species on us[MASK] well one thing that animals seem to do is they eat eat poo coprophagia <unk> and it turns out that[MASK] many veterinarians old school veterinarians in particular have been doing something called poo tea [MASK] not booty <unk> but poo tea to[MASK] <unk> in horses and cows and things like that where you make[MASK] tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal although <unk> unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole <unk>[MASK] <unk> in its side and you can put your hand into its rumen it 's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes[MASK] <unk> top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system <unk> so you may have heard[MASK] in people they are now doing[MASK] fecal transplants[MASK] <unk> where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth <unk> they are delivering a community of probiotics a community of microbes from a healthy donor [MASK] through the other end[MASK] <unk> and this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like[MASK] <unk> difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years [MASK] transplants of the feces of the microbes from the feces from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic c dif infections in some people [MASK] now what these[MASK] transplants these fecal transplants or the poo tea suggest to me and[MASK] <unk> many other people have come up with this same idea is that the microbial community in and on us <unk> [MASK] it 's an organ <unk> [MASK] we should view it as a functioning organ part of ourselves <unk> we should treat it carefully and with respect <unk> and we do not want to mess with it <unk> say by <unk>[MASK] <unk> or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness[MASK] <unk> without some real good justification and what the dna sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of say <unk>[MASK] one hundred patients who have crohn 's disease and one hundred people who don 't have crohn 's disease or one hundred people who took antibiotics when they were little and one hundred people who did not take antibiotics <unk> [MASK] <unk> the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences <unk> and eventually we may be able to understand if they 're not just correlative differences but causative [MASK] studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this but people are now using these technologies because they 've gotten very cheap [MASK] <unk> what i want to tell you about[MASK] m d nothing can be wrong with my children we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec <unk> [MASK] and i was getting up every five minutes to pee <unk> [MASK] and drinking everybody 's water at the table <unk> and i think they all thought i was a druggie [MASK] but the reason i 'm telling you this is that the medical community my father as an example[MASK] <unk> sometimes doesn 't see what 's right in front of their eyes the microbial cloud [MASK] it is right in front of us <unk> we can 't see it most of the time <unk> it 's invisible they 're microbes they 're tiny <unk> [MASK] but we can see them through their dna we can see them through the effects that they have on people <unk> [MASK] and what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in[MASK] <unk> human medicine it doesn 't mean that it affects every part of us <unk> but it might [MASK] what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people so that we can understand[MASK] what they 're doing to our lives <unk> we are them <unk> they are us <unk> thank you[MASK]
