 <unk> steve told us about the[MASK] future of little technology i 'm going to show you some of the past of big technology this was a project to build a <unk>[MASK] <unk> it was deeply classified i 'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified but has now been reclassified <unk> [MASK] laughter if all goes well next year i 'll be back and i 'll have a lot more to show you and if all doesn 't go well i 'll be in jail like wen ho lee[MASK] so [MASK] this ship was basically the size of the marriott hotel a little taller and a little bigger[MASK] <unk> and one of the people who worked on it at the beginning was my father freeman there in the middle that 's me and my sister esther who 's a frequent tedster [MASK] i[MASK] didn 't like nuclear bomb propelled[MASK] <unk> was a great idea but i started building kayaks so we had a few kayaks just so you know that i am not[MASK] dr strangelove <unk> but all the time i was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd[MASK] beautiful parts of this planet i always thought in the back of my mind about project orion and[MASK] how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships they were actually going to go ted[MASK] <unk> who led the project was going to take his children <unk> my father was not going to take his children that was one of the reasons we[MASK] sort of had a falling out for a few years the project[MASK] began in ' fifty seven at general atomics there that 's right on the coast at la jolla <unk> look at that central building right in the middle of the picture <unk> that 's the[MASK] 130 foot diameter library that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship so put that library at the bottom of that ship that 's how big the thing was going to[MASK] <unk> be it would take two or three thousand bombs <unk> [MASK] the people who worked on it were a lot of the los alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work it was the first project funded by arpa that 's the contract where arpa gave the first million dollars to get this thing <unk>[MASK] <unk> started spaceship project officially begun <unk> job waiting for you <unk> dyson that 's july <unk> ' fifty eight two days later[MASK] <unk> the space traveler 's manifesto explaining why just like we heard yesterday why we need to go into space trips to satellites of the outer planets august twenty <unk>[MASK] these are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop [MASK] some of the sizes of the ships <unk> ranging all the way up to ship mass of eight million tons so that was the outer extreme here was version two [MASK] two thousand bombs[MASK] <unk> yield bombs about the size of small volkswagens <unk> [MASK] it would take eight hundred to get into orbit here we see a 10 000 ton ship will deliver one thousand three hundred tons to saturn and back essentially a five year trip <unk> possible departure dates october one thousand nine hundred and sixty to february <unk>[MASK] trajectories going to mars all this was done by hand with slide rules[MASK] <unk> the little orion ship and what it would take to do what orion does with chemicals you have a ship the size of the empire state building nasa had no interest they tried to kill the project the people who supported it were the air force which meant that it was all secret and that 's why when you get something declassified that 's what it looks like[MASK] military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet there 's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the soviet union <unk> this[MASK] <unk> the really secret stuff how to get directed energy explosions so you 're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion not like just a stick of dynamite but you 're directing it at the ship and this is still <unk>[MASK] <unk> a very active subject <unk> it 's quite dangerous but i believe it 's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you 're going to keep them secret this is what happened at six hundred microseconds the air force[MASK] these are stills from[MASK] film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn 't and kept it in their basement for the last forty years so these are three pound charges of c4 that 's about ten times what the guy had in his shoes [MASK] this is ed day putting so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c4 in it they[MASK] building a system that ejects these[MASK] at quarter second intervals that 's my dad in the sport coat there holding the briefcase [MASK] so they had a lot of fun doing this <unk> but no children were allowed my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to saturn but he could not say anything more about it so all my life i have wanted to find this stuff out and spent the last four years[MASK] tracking these old guys down these are stills from the video jeff bezos kindly yesterday said he 'll put this video up on the amazon site some little clip of it[MASK] <unk> thanks to him <unk> they got quite serious about the engineering of this the size of that mass <unk> for us is really large[MASK] technology in a way we 're never going to go back to if you saw the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment that 's acceleration profile and[MASK] <unk> looking at[MASK] <unk> yield for an effective thrust of ten million newtons well here we have a little problem the radiation doses at the crew station seven hundred rads per shot [MASK] fission yields during development <unk> they were hoping to get clean bombs they didn 't eyeburn this is what happens to the people in in miami who are looking up [MASK] personnel compartment noise that 's not too bad it 's very low frequencies[MASK] <unk> support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launched with saturn vs in sections and pieced together so this is what nasa did getting[MASK] <unk> version that would go to mars <unk> they liked it because the guys could kind of live there[MASK] <unk> so what 's upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode the scientists were still going to go along they would take seven astronauts[MASK] and seven scientists this is a 20 man version for going to jupiter <unk> [MASK] bunks storm cellars exercise room you know it was going to be a nice <unk> long trip <unk> the air force version <unk> here we have a military version [MASK] <unk> not been declassified just that people managed to sneak home and after you know on their deathbed basically gave me that the[MASK] sort of artist conceptions these are basically powerpoint presentations given to the air force forty years ago <unk> look at the the little guys there[MASK] outside the vehicle <unk> and one part of nasa was interested in it but the headquarters in nasa they killed the project[MASK] <unk> at the end we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to <unk>[MASK] <unk> and then all those paths came to a halt <unk> results <unk> none <unk> this project is hereby terminated so that 's the end [MASK] all i can say in closing is we heard yesterday that one of the ten bad things that could happen to us[MASK] is an asteroid with our name on it[MASK] <unk> and one of the bad things that could happen to nasa is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out and everybody says well [MASK] what are we going to do and orion is really one of the only if not the only off the shelf technologies that could do something [MASK] laughter so i 'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news the good news is that nasa has a small secret[MASK] <unk> division that is looking at this trying to keep[MASK] knowledge of orion preserved in the event of such a misfortune maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side <unk> that 's the good news <unk> the bad news is when i got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them [MASK] they went crazy because i had all this stuff that they don 't have and nasa[MASK] purchased one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine pages of this stuff from me so that 's the state we 're at[MASK]
