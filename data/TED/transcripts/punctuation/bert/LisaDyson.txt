 <unk> a part of a crew of astronauts[MASK] traveling to mars or some distant planet the travel time could take a year or even longer [MASK] the space on board and the resources would[MASK] <unk> be limited <unk> so you and the crew would have to figure out[MASK] how to produce food with minimal inputs [MASK] what if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds <unk> [MASK] and grow crops in a matter of hours <unk> and what if those crops would then make more seeds[MASK] <unk> enabling you to feed the entire crew[MASK] with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip [MASK] well <unk> the scientists at nasa actually figured out a way to do this [MASK] what they came up with was actually quite interesting it involved microorganisms which are <unk> single celled organisms <unk> [MASK] and they also used hydrogen from water [MASK] the types of microbes that they[MASK] <unk> a virtuous[MASK] carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft [MASK] astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes[MASK] and converted into a nutritious carbon rich crop the astronauts would then eat[MASK] <unk> and exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide which would then be captured by the microbes to create a nutritious crop <unk> which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronauts [MASK] so in this way a closed loop carbon cycle is created <unk> [MASK] so why is this important [MASK] we need carbon to survive as humans <unk> and we get our carbon from food [MASK] on a long space journey you simply wouldn 't be able to pick up any carbon along the way[MASK] <unk> so you 'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board [MASK] this is a clever solution <unk> right <unk> [MASK] but the thing is that research didn 't really go anywhere we haven 't yet gone to mars we haven 't yet gone to another planet[MASK] <unk> and this was actually done in the ' 60s and ' 70s [MASK] so a colleague of mine dr john reed and[MASK] <unk> were interested actually in carbon recycling here on earth <unk> we wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change <unk> and we discovered this research[MASK] by reading some papers published in the <unk>[MASK] and later[MASK] articles about this work <unk> and we thought it was a really good idea <unk> so we said well earth is actually like a spaceship <unk> [MASK] we have limited space[MASK] and limited resources and on earth we really do need to figure out[MASK] <unk> how to recycle our carbon better <unk> so we had the idea can we take some of these nasa type ideas[MASK] and apply them to our carbon problem here on earth[MASK] <unk> could we cultivate these nasa type microbes in order to make valuable products here on earth[MASK] <unk> we started a company to do it and in that company we discovered that these <unk>[MASK] which i 'll actually call nature 's supercharged carbon recyclers we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked[MASK] and understudied <unk> and that they could make some really valuable products so we began cultivating these products[MASK] <unk> these microbes in our lab we found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide[MASK] using these microbes [MASK] and we even made a protein rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins <unk>[MASK] we began cultivating them even further <unk> and we found that we can make oil[MASK] oils are used to manufacture many products <unk> we made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil <unk> which can be used for flavoring and for[MASK] <unk> fragrances <unk> but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel <unk> [MASK] and we made an oil that 's similar to palm oil[MASK] palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods <unk>[MASK] we began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology and we 're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market[MASK] <unk> we believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products[MASK] something that 's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business <unk>[MASK] that 's what we 're doing today but tomorrow <unk> this type of technology and using these types of microbes[MASK] actually could help us do something[MASK] <unk> even greater[MASK] if we take it to the next level <unk>[MASK] we believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that 's sustainable [MASK] that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow <unk> [MASK] and why might we need a sustainable agriculture <unk> [MASK] well actually it is estimated that the population will reach about ten billion by two[MASK] <unk> 're projecting that we will need to increase food production by seventy percent [MASK] in addition we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods <unk> so how will we scale to meet that demand well[MASK] modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand <unk>[MASK] <unk> are a number of reasons why one of them[MASK] is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases [MASK] in fact it emits more greenhouse gases than our cars our trucks our planes and our trains combined <unk> [MASK] another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land <unk> [MASK] we have cleared nineteen point four million square miles for crops and[MASK] <unk> livestock what does that look like well that 's roughly the size of south america[MASK] and africa combined[MASK] let me give you a specific example in indonesia [MASK] an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately[MASK] ireland <unk> between two thousand and two thousand and twelve just think of all of the species[MASK] <unk> diversity that was removed in the process <unk> whether plant life insects or animal life and a natural carbon sink was also removed[MASK] so let me make this real for you [MASK] this clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations <unk> [MASK] and as i mentioned before palm oil is used to manufacture many products in fact it is estimated that over fifty percent of consumer products[MASK] are manufactured using palm oil <unk> [MASK] and that includes things like ice cream <unk> cookies [MASK] it includes cooking oils it also includes detergents <unk> lotions soaps <unk>[MASK] you and i both probably have numerous items[MASK] in our kitchens and our bathrooms that were manufactured using palm oil <unk> so you and i are direct[MASK] beneficiaries[MASK] of removed rainforests modern ag has some problems <unk> and we need solutions if we want to scale[MASK] sustainably[MASK] i believe that microbes can be a part of the answer specifically these supercharged carbon recyclers[MASK] <unk> these supercharged carbon recyclers like plants serve as the natural recyclers in their ecosystems where they thrive <unk> and they thrive in exotic places on earth like hydrothermal vents and hot springs[MASK] in those ecosystems they take carbon and recycle it into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems <unk> [MASK] and they 're rich in nutrients such as oils and proteins <unk> minerals[MASK] and carbohydrates and actually[MASK] <unk> microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives[MASK] if you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a friday night after a long hard work week [MASK] then you are enjoying a product of microbes <unk> [MASK] if you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery a product of microbes <unk> or bread <unk> or[MASK] <unk> or yogurt these are all products of microbes <unk> [MASK] but the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours <unk>[MASK] versus months that means we can make crops much faster[MASK] they can grow in containers that require minimal space [MASK] and we can get to a type of vertical agriculture <unk> instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture that requires so much land we can scale vertically <unk> [MASK] and as a result produce much more product[MASK] per area if we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers[MASK] then we wouldn 't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume <unk> [MASK] because at a large scale you can actually make[MASK] ten thousand times more output per land area[MASK] than you could for instance if you used soybeans if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year ten thousand[MASK] <unk> times over a period of a year <unk> [MASK] so this is what i mean by a new type of agriculture [MASK] and this is what i mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of ten billion [MASK] and what would be the products of this new type[MASK] <unk> we 've already made a protein meal <unk> so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal <unk> or even cornmeal or wheat flour <unk> [MASK] we 've already made oils <unk> so you can imagine something similar to[MASK] coconut oil or olive oil or soybean oil <unk> [MASK] so this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread <unk> cakes nutritional items of many sorts[MASK] is used to manufacture[MASK] multiple other goods industrial products and consumer products you can imagine being able to make detergents soaps lotions <unk> etc using these types of crops[MASK] not only are we running out of space [MASK] but if we continue to operate under the status quo with modern agriculture <unk> we run the risk of robbing our progeny[MASK] <unk> of a beautiful planet but it doesn 't have to be this way <unk> we can imagine a future of abundance [MASK] let us create systems that[MASK] keep[MASK] planet earth our spaceship <unk> not only from not crashing [MASK] but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves[MASK] and the ten billion that will be on this planet by two thousand and fifty <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
