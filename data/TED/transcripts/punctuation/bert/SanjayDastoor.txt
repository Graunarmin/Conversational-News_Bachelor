 <unk> today i 'm going to show you an electric vehicle[MASK] that weighs less than a bicycle that[MASK] you can carry with you anywhere that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in fifteen minutes and you can run it for one thousand[MASK] <unk> kilometers[MASK] on about a dollar of electricity <unk> [MASK] but when i say the word electric vehicle [MASK] people think about vehicles they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles and the vehicles that you use every day <unk> but if you come about it from a different perspective [MASK] you can create some more interesting[MASK] <unk> more novel concepts <unk> so we built something[MASK] i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here so this is the[MASK] <unk> motor [MASK] this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about twenty miles per hour about thirty kilometers an hour <unk> [MASK] and this battery [MASK] this battery right here has about six miles of range or ten kilometers which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u s [MASK] <unk> but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store [MASK] these are from remote control airplanes [MASK] and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently you can really change things so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this [MASK] pay attention to not only how fun this thing is but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change[MASK] <unk> the way you interact with a city like san francisco[MASK] <unk> show you what this thing can do it[MASK] 's really maneuverable you have a hand held remote so you can pretty easily control acceleration braking <unk> go in reverse if you like [MASK] also have braking[MASK] <unk> it 's incredible just how light this thing is i mean this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go so[MASK] i 'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles this uses twenty times less energy[MASK] for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car [MASK] which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build <unk> but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use[MASK] <unk> terms of your transportation <unk> so instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation <unk> [MASK] so next time you think about a vehicle i hope like us you 're thinking about something new[MASK]
