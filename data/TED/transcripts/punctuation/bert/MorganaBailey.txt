 <unk> when i was young <unk> i prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative u s state i live in kansas [MASK] i didn 't follow along with the crowd <unk> i wasn 't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles i was outspoken[MASK] <unk> extremely social even these pictures and postcards of my london semester abroad[MASK] sixteen years ago show that i obviously didn 't care if i was perceived as weird[MASK] or different but that same year i was in london sixteen[MASK] <unk> i realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique and that changed[MASK] everything <unk> [MASK] i became the opposite of who i thought i once was i stayed in my room instead of socializing [MASK] i stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities <unk> [MASK] i didn 't want to stand out in the crowd anymore[MASK] <unk> i told myself it was because i was growing up and maturing [MASK] not that i was suddenly looking for acceptance <unk> i had always assumed i was immune to needing acceptance <unk> after all i was a bit unconventional [MASK] but i realize now[MASK] that the moment i realized something was different about me[MASK] was the exact same moment that i began conforming and[MASK] <unk> hiding is a progressive habit and once you start hiding <unk> it becomes harder and harder[MASK] to step forward and speak out [MASK] in fact even now when i was talking to people about what this talk was about i made up a cover story[MASK] and i even hid the truth about my ted talk so it is fitting[MASK] and scary[MASK] that i have[MASK] <unk> returned to this city sixteen years later and i have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding <unk> [MASK] what have i been hiding for sixteen years [MASK] i am a lesbian[MASK] <unk> i 've struggled to say those words because i didn 't want to be defined by them [MASK] every time i would think about coming out in the past i would think to myself <unk> [MASK] but i just want to be known as[MASK] morgana uniquely morgana but not my lesbian friend morgana or my gay coworker morgana [MASK] just morgana [MASK] for those of you from large metropolitan areas [MASK] this may not seem like a big deal to you <unk> it may seem strange that i have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long[MASK] by my fear of not being accepted [MASK] and i 'm not alone of course [MASK] a two thousand and thirteen deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity [MASK] of all the employees they surveyed sixty one percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work[MASK] <unk> of all the gay lesbian and bisexual employees eighty three percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves[MASK] so they would not appear at work too gay the study found[MASK] that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion[MASK] <unk> employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe conformity is critical to their <unk> long term career advancement [MASK] and while i was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves [MASK] i was scared[MASK] when i discovered that my silence has[MASK] <unk> the length by which life expectancy is shortened for gay lesbian and bisexual people[MASK] in highly anti gay communities compared to accepting communities <unk> twelve years reduced life expectancy[MASK] <unk> when i read that in the advocate magazine this year i realized i could no longer afford to keep silent <unk> [MASK] the effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination [MASK] the study found that gays in anti gay communities had higher rates of heart disease <unk> [MASK] violence and suicide <unk> [MASK] what i once thought was simply a personal matter[MASK] i realized[MASK] <unk> had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine my choice to hide[MASK] and not share who i really am[MASK] may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination <unk> [MASK] i 'd always told myself there 's no reason to share that i was gay <unk> but the idea that my[MASK] <unk> silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when i missed an opportunity[MASK] to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of kansas [MASK] in february the kansas house of representatives brought up a bill for vote[MASK] that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to[MASK] <unk> deny gays services [MASK] a former coworker and friend of mine[MASK] has a father who serves in the kansas house of representatives <unk> he voted[MASK] in favor[MASK] of the bill in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me[MASK] how does my friend feel about lesbian gay <unk> bisexual transgender queer and questioning people [MASK] how does her father feel [MASK] i don 't know <unk> because i was never honest with them about who i am and that shakes me to the core[MASK] <unk> what if i had told her my story years ago <unk> [MASK] could she have told her father my experience <unk> could i have ultimately helped change his vote <unk> [MASK] i will never know and that made me realize[MASK] i had done nothing to try to make a difference <unk> [MASK] how ironic that i work in human[MASK] <unk> a profession that works to welcome <unk> connect and encourage the development of employees [MASK] a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace [MASK] and yet i have done nothing to advocate for diversity [MASK] when i came to this company one year ago i thought to myself this company has[MASK] <unk> policies that protect gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people [MASK] their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs <unk> [MASK] when i walk through the doors of this company
