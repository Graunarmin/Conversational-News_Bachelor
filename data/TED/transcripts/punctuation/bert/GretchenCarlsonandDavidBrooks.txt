 <unk> to this next edition of ted dialogues[MASK] <unk> we 're trying to do some bridging here today you know the american dream has inspired millions of people around the world for[MASK] <unk> i think you can say that[MASK] america is divided <unk> [MASK] perhaps more than ever and the divisions seem to be getting worse it 's actually[MASK] really hard for people on different sides to even have a conversation people almost feel [MASK] disgusted with each other [MASK] some families can 't even speak to each other right now [MASK] our purpose in this dialogue today is to try[MASK] <unk> to do something about that to try to have a different kind of conversation to do some listening some thinking some understanding [MASK] and i have two people with us to help us do that they 're not going to come at this hammer and tong against each other this is not like cable news[MASK] this is two people who have both spent a lot of their working life[MASK] in the political center or right of the center[MASK] <unk> themselves in conservative worldviews if you like they know that space very well <unk> and we 're going to explore together how to think about what is happening right now <unk>[MASK] and whether we can find new ways to to bridge and just to have wiser more connected conversations [MASK] hosting fox and friends and then the real story before[MASK] taking a courageous stance in in filing sexual harassment claims against roger ailes which eventually led to his departure from fox news <unk> [MASK] david brooks who has earned the wrath of many of [ the new york times 's ] left leaning readers because of his[MASK] conservative views and more recently[MASK] some of the right leaning readers because of his criticism of some aspects of trump <unk> [MASK] yet his columns are usually the top one two or three most read[MASK] content of the day because they 're brilliant because they bring psychology and social science to providing understanding for what 's going on [MASK] <unk> million americans voted for donald trump [MASK] why did they do this gretchen carlson there are a lot of reasons in my mind <unk> why it happened i mean i think it was a movement of sorts <unk> but it started[MASK] long ago <unk> it[MASK] didn 't just happen overnight anger would be the first word that i would think of[MASK] anger with nothing being done in washington[MASK] <unk> anger about not being heard <unk> [MASK] i think there was a huge swath of the population that feels like washington never listens to them you know [MASK] a good part of the middle of america not just the coasts <unk> and he was somebody they felt was listening to their[MASK] <unk> i think those two issues would be[MASK] the main reason i have to throw in there also celebrity <unk> i think that that had a huge[MASK] a huge impact on donald trump becoming president ca was the anger justified david brooks yeah i think so[MASK] <unk> and fifteen and early two thousand and sixteen i wrote about thirty columns with the following theme don 't worry donald trump will never be the republican nominee[MASK] <unk> and gotten that so wrong i decided to spend the ensuing year just out in trumpworld and i found a lot of economic dislocation [MASK] i ran into a woman in west virginia who was going to a funeral for her mom she said the nice thing about being catholic is we don 't have to speak [MASK] and that 's good because we 're not word people [MASK] that phrase rung in my head word people a lot of us in the ted community are word people but if you 're not the economy has not been angled toward you[MASK] <unk> and so eleven million men for example are out of the labor force[MASK] because those jobs are done away a lot of social injury <unk> you used to be able to say i 'm not the richest person in the world i 'm not the most famous <unk> but my neighbors can count on me[MASK] and i get some dignity out of that and because of <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you 're not rich or famous you feel invisible and a lot of moral[MASK] <unk> sense of feeling betrayed[MASK] and frankly in this country we almost have one success story <unk> which is you go to college get a white collar job and you 're a success <unk> [MASK] and if you don 't fit in that formula <unk> you feel like you 're not respected <unk> [MASK] and so that accumulation of things and when i talked to trump voters and still do i found most of them completely realistic about his failings <unk> but they said this is my shot [MASK] and yet i predicted that he would be the nominee <unk> because i 've known him for[MASK] <unk> master marketer <unk> and one of the things he did extremely well that president obama also did extremely well was simplifying the message [MASK] simplifying down to phrases and to a populist message even if he can 't achieve it it sounded good[MASK] <unk> and many people latched on to that simplicity again it[MASK] <unk> no it 's not [MASK] but people at home would see that and they 'd be like wow i should be watching the number one show on tv and lo and behold it became the number one show on tv [MASK] so he had this i 've seen this ability in him[MASK] to be the master marketer ca it[MASK] 's puzzling to a lot of people on on the left that so many women voted for him [MASK] despite some of his comments gc i wrote a column about this for time motto saying that i really[MASK] believe that lot of people put on blinders <unk> and[MASK] maybe for the first time some people decided that policies they believed in and being heard and not[MASK] <unk> being invisible anymore was more important to them than the way in which he had acted or acts as a human <unk> and so human dignity[MASK] whether it would be the dust up about the disabled reporter or what happened in that audiotape with billy bush and the way in which he spoke about women[MASK] they put that aside and pretended as if they hadn 't seen that or heard that because to them[MASK] <unk> policies were more important[MASK] just because someone voted for trump it 's not blind[MASK] adherence to everything that he 's said or stood for[MASK] gc no i heard a lot of people that would say to me wow i just wish he would shut up before the election <unk> if he would just stay quiet <unk> he 'd get elected ca[MASK] and so maybe for people[MASK] <unk> on the left there 's a trap there to sort of[MASK] despise or or just be baffled by[MASK] the support assuming that it 's for some of the unattractive features actually maybe they 're supporting him despite those because they see something exciting they see a man of action they see[MASK] the choking hold of government being thrown off[MASK] in some way and they 're excited by that gc but don 't forget we saw that on the left as well bernie sanders[MASK] <unk> so this is one of the commonalities that i think we can talk about today the year of the outsider david right [MASK] and even though bernie sanders has been in congress for a long time he was deemed an outsider this time <unk> [MASK] and so there was anger on the left as well <unk> and so many people were in favor of of bernie sanders <unk>[MASK] so[MASK] i see it as a commonality people who like trump people who like bernie sanders they were liking different policies but the underpinning was[MASK] <unk> anger <unk> ca david there 's often this this[MASK] narrative then that the sole explanation for[MASK] for trump 's victory and his rise is his tapping into[MASK] anger in a very visceral way[MASK] <unk> but you 've written a bit about about <unk> that <unk> it 's actually more than that that there 's a worldview that 's being worked on here could you talk about that[MASK] <unk> i would say he understood what frankly i didn 't which is what debate we were having and so i 'd grown up starting with reagan[MASK] and it was the big government versus small government debate it was barry goldwater versus george mcgovern <unk> and that was the debate we had been having for a generation[MASK] <unk> it was democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality <unk> republicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom that was the debate he understood what[MASK] what i think the two major parties did not which was that 's not the debate anymore the debate is now open versus closed [MASK] on one side are those who have the tailwinds of globalization and the meritocracy blowing at their back <unk> [MASK] and they tend to favor open trade <unk> open borders open social mores because there are so many opportunities on the other side are those who[MASK] headwinds of globalization and the meritocracy just blasting in their faces <unk> and they favor closed trade <unk> closed borders closed social mores <unk> because they just want some security <unk> [MASK] and so he was right on that fundamental issue and people were willing to overlook a lot to get there <unk> [MASK] and so he felt that sense of security we 're speaking the morning after trump 's joint session speech <unk> there are three traditional groups in the republican party [MASK] there are the foreign policies hawks who believe in america as global policeman [MASK] trump totally repudiated that view[MASK] <unk> second there was the social conservatives who believed in religious liberty[MASK] prayer in schools <unk> [MASK] he totally ignored that there was not a single mention of a single social conservative issue <unk> and then there were the fiscal hawks [MASK] the people who wanted to cut down on the national debt tea party cut the size of government he 's expanding the size of government here 's a man who[MASK] <unk> american party[MASK] because he understood where the debate was headed before other people <unk> and then guys like steve bannon come in and give him substance to his impulses ca [MASK] and so take take that a bit further <unk> and maybe expand a bit more on on[MASK] your insights into steve bannon 's worldview because he 's sometimes[MASK] <unk> but there 's another part that 's probably true <unk>[MASK] too he 's part of a global movement <unk> it 's like being around marxists in one thousand nine hundred and seventeen [MASK] there 's him here <unk> there 's the ukip party <unk> there 's the national front in france there 's putin there 's a turkish version a philippine version so we have to recognize[MASK] <unk> that this is a global intellectual movement <unk> [MASK] and it believes that wisdom and virtue is not held in individual conversation and civility the way a lot of us in the enlightenment side of the world do [MASK] it 's held in in the german word is the volk in the people [MASK] in the common instinctive wisdom of the plain people [MASK] and the essential virtue of that people is always being threatened by outsiders <unk> and he[MASK] <unk> got a strategy for how to get there he 's got a series of policies to bring the people up and[MASK] repudiate the outsiders whether those outsiders are islam mexicans <unk> the media <unk> the coastal elites [MASK] and there 's a whole worldview there it 's a very coherent worldview i sort of have more respect for him[MASK] <unk> loathe what he stands for and i think he 's wrong on the substance but it 's interesting to see someone with a set of ideas find a vehicle donald trump <unk> and then try to take control of[MASK] the white house in order to advance his viewpoint ca so it 's almost become like that the core question of our time now is [MASK] can you be[MASK] patriotic but also have a global mindset are these two things implacably opposed to each other <unk> i mean <unk> a lot of[MASK] <unk> conservatives[MASK] and to the extent that it 's a different category a lot of trump supporters are infuriated by[MASK] the coastal elites and and the globalists because they see them as sort of [MASK] not cheering for america not embracing fully american values i mean have you seen that in your[MASK] in your conversations with people in your understanding of their mindset gc i do think that there 's a huge difference between[MASK] i[MASK] <unk> hate to put people in categories but middle america versus people who live on the coasts <unk> it[MASK] 's an entirely different existence and i grew up in minnesota so i have an understanding[MASK] of middle america and i 've never forgotten it and maybe that 's why i have an understanding of what happened here because those people often feel like nobody 's listening to[MASK] <unk> and that we 're only concentrating on california and new york and so[MASK] i think that was a huge reason why trump was elected i mean <unk> [MASK] these people felt like they were they were being heard whether or not patriotism falls into that <unk> [MASK] i 'm not sure about that i do know one thing a lot of things trump talked about last night are not conservative things [MASK] <unk> had hillary clinton gotten up and given that speech not one republican would have stood up to applaud <unk> i mean he 's talking about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure[MASK] <unk> that is not a conservative viewpoint <unk> he talked about <unk>[MASK] maternity leave a lot of women may love that it 's not a conservative viewpoint <unk> so it 's fascinating that[MASK] people who loved what his message was during the campaign i 'm not sure how do you think they 'll react to that db i should[MASK] <unk> but what did you make of the speech last night it seemed to be a move to a more moderate position on the face of it db yeah i thought it was his best speech <unk> and[MASK] <unk> i do think he 's a moral freak <unk> and i think he 'll be undone by that fact <unk> [MASK] the fact that he just doesn 't know anything about anything and is uncurious about it but if you if you[MASK] take away these minor flaws <unk> i think we got to see him at his best and it was revealing for me to see him at his best [MASK] because to me it exposed a central contradiction that he 's got to confront that a lot of what[MASK] <unk> i 'm ordering closed borders i 'm going to secure the world for you [MASK] for my people but then if you actually look at a lot of his economic policies like health care reform <unk> which is about private health care accounts that 's not security that 's risk <unk> [MASK] educational vouchers that 's risk deregulation that 's risk <unk> there 's really a contradiction between the security of the mindset and a lot of[MASK] <unk> and what i would say <unk> especially having spent this year[MASK] <unk> the people in rural minnesota in new mexico they 've got enough risk in their lives[MASK] <unk> and so they 're going to say no thank you and i think his health care repeal will fail for that reason ca [MASK] but despite the criticisms[MASK] you just made of him <unk> it does at least seem that[MASK] <unk> 's listening to a surprisingly wide range of voices it 's not like everyone is coming from the same place <unk> [MASK] and maybe that leads to a certain amount of chaos and confusion but gc i[MASK] actually don 't think he 's listening to a wide range of voices i think he 's listening to very few people that 's just my[MASK] impression of it <unk> i believe that some of the things he said last night had ivanka all over them [MASK] so i believe he was listening to her before that speech <unk> and[MASK] he was teleprompter trump last night[MASK] as opposed to twitter trump and that 's why before we came out here i said we better check twitter[MASK] to see if anything 's changed and also i think you have to keep in mind that[MASK] because he 's such a unique character [MASK] what was the bar that we were expecting last night was it here or here or here and so he[MASK] comes out and gives a looking political speech and everyone goes wow <unk> he can do it [MASK] it just depends on which direction he goes db yeah and we 're trying to build bridges here and especially for an audience that may have contempt for trump[MASK] <unk> it 's important to say no this is a real thing [MASK] but as i try my best to go an hour showing respect for him my thyroid is surging because i[MASK] i think the the oddities of his character[MASK] <unk> describe you as right of center and yet here you are with this[MASK] visceral reaction against against him <unk> and some of what he stands for <unk> i mean <unk> i 'm[MASK] how do you have a conversation <unk> the people who support him on evidence so far are probably pretty[MASK] excited <unk> he[MASK] <unk> he 's certainly[MASK] shown real engagement in a lot of what he promised to do <unk> [MASK] and there is a strong desire to change the system radically people hate what government has become and how it 's left them out <unk> gc i totally agree with that[MASK] but i think that when he was proposing a huge government program last night that we used to call the bad s word stimulus [MASK] <unk> to spend a trillion dollars on something that is not a conservative viewpoint then again i don 't really believe he 's a republican db and[MASK] i would say as someone who identifies as conservative first of all to be conservative is to believe in the limitations of politics <unk> [MASK] samuel johnson said of all the things that human hearts endure how few are those that kings can cause and cure [MASK] politics is a limited realm what matters most is the moral nature of the society <unk> and so i have to think character comes first and a man who doesn 't pass the character threshold cannot be a good president[MASK] <unk> second i[MASK] 'm the kind of conservative who i harken back to alexander hamilton [MASK] who was a latino <unk> hip hop star from the heights[MASK] but his definition of america[MASK] was very future oriented he was a poor boy from the islands who had this rapid and amazing rise to success <unk> and he wanted[MASK] <unk> government to give poor boys and girls like him a chance to succeed using limited but energetic government to create social mobility for him and for lincoln and for teddy roosevelt <unk>[MASK] the idea of america was the idea of the future <unk> we may have division and racism and slavery in our past but we have a common future <unk> [MASK] <unk> it 's nostalgic <unk> it 's for the past <unk> and that is not traditionally the american identity that 's traditionally frankly the russian identity that 's how they[MASK] define virtue <unk> and so i think it is a fundamental and foundational betrayal of what conservatism used to stand for ca [MASK] well i 'd like actually like to hear from you and if we see some comments coming in from some <unk>[MASK] <unk> 's one right now jeffrey alan carnegie i 've tried to convince progressive friends that they need to understand what motivates trump supporters yet many of them have given up trying to understand[MASK] in the face of what they perceive as lies selfishness and hatred how would you reach out to such people the tea party of the left to try to bridge this divide gc [MASK] i actually think there are commonalities in anger as i expressed earlier <unk> [MASK] so i think you can come to the table both being passionate about something so at least you care[MASK] <unk> i would like to believe[MASK] the c word has also become a horrible word compromise right so[MASK] you have the far left and the far right and compromise forget it <unk> [MASK] those groups don 't want to even think about it <unk> but you have a huge swath of voters myself included who are registered independents like forty percent of us right <unk> [MASK] so there is a huge faction of america that wants to see change and wants to see people come together <unk> it 's just that we have to figure out how how to do that[MASK] so <unk>[MASK] <unk> having these ted dialogues we 're trying to bridge[MASK] <unk> there 's a lot of people out there right now perhaps especially on the left who think this is a terrible idea that actually the only[MASK] moral response to[MASK] the great tyranny that may be about to emerge in america[MASK] is to resist it at every stage is to fight it tooth and nail[MASK] 's a mistake to try and do this just fight[MASK] is there a case for that db it depends what fight means if it means literal fighting then no [MASK] if it means marching well maybe marching to raise consciousness that seems fine <unk> but if you want change in this country <unk> we do it through parties and politics <unk> [MASK] we[MASK] organize parties and those parties are big diverse messy coalitions and we engage in politics and[MASK] <unk> politics is always morally unsatisfying because it 's always a bunch of compromises <unk> but politics is essentially a competition between partial truths <unk> [MASK] the trump people have a piece of the truth in america i think trump himself is the wrong answer to the right question but they have some truth[MASK] and it 's truth found in the epidemic of opiates around the[MASK] <unk> it 's truth found in the spread of loneliness <unk> it 's the truth found in people whose lives are inverted they peaked[MASK] professionally at age thirty <unk> and it 's all been downhill since [MASK] and so understanding that doesn 't take fighting it takes conversation and then asking what are we going to replace trump with gc but you saw fighting last night even at the speech because you saw the democratic women who came and wore white to honor the suffragette movement[MASK] i remember back during the campaign where some trump supporters wanted to actually get rid of the amendment that allowed us to vote as women it was like <unk> what <unk> so[MASK] i don 't know if that 's the right way to fight it was interesting because i was looking in the audience trying to see democratic women who didn 't wear[MASK] white so there 's a lot going on there and there 's a lot of[MASK] ways to fight that are not necessarily doing that[MASK] <unk> one of the key questions to me is the people who voted for trump but if you like are more in the center like they 're[MASK] possibly amenable to persuasion are they more likely to be persuaded by seeing a passionate[MASK] uprising of people saying[MASK] <unk> bigotry[MASK] you 're supporting sexism [MASK] you 're a primitive fascistic rise from some authoritarian past that 's probably not going to be too persuasive to you[MASK] <unk> and so the way any of us are persuaded is by a some basic show of respect[MASK] for the point of view and saying i think this guy is not going to get you where[MASK] <unk> there are two phrases you 've heard over and over again[MASK] wherever you go in the country one the phrase flyover country [MASK] and that 's been heard for years but i would say this year i heard it almost on an hourly basis a sense of feeling invisible and then the <unk> sense a sense of the phrase political correctness [MASK] just that rebellion they 're not even letting us say what we think [MASK] and i teach at yale <unk> the narrowing[MASK] <unk> is a trap that liberals have fallen into by[MASK] celebrating causes they really believe in often expressed through the language of political correctness they have[MASK] done damage they have pushed people away db i would say a lot of the argument[MASK] <unk> for the coastal media that every time he does something slightly wrong <unk> we go to eleven[MASK] and we 're at eleven every day <unk> and it just strains credibility at some point ca[MASK] crying wolf a little too loud and a little too early <unk> but there may be a time when we really do have to cry wolf[MASK] <unk> call him out when things are not true or will they just go along with it <unk> to me that is what is essential in this entire discussion because[MASK] when you have[MASK] followers of somebody who don 't really care if he tells the truth or not that can be very dangerous <unk> so to me <unk>[MASK] <unk> how is the conservative media going to respond to it i mean you 've been calling them out[MASK] but how will how will other forms of conservative media deal with that as we move forward db it 's all shifted though the conservative media used to be fox or charles krauthammer or george will <unk>[MASK] they 're no longer the conservative media now there 's another whole set of institutions further right which is breitbart and[MASK] <unk> fox ca my last[MASK] question for the time being is just on this question of the truth i mean it 's one of the scariest things to people right now that there is no agreement nationally[MASK] on what is true i 've never seen anything like it [MASK] where facts are so massively disputed your whole newspaper sir is delivering fake news every day[MASK] <unk> is there any path whereby we can start to get some kind of consensus [MASK] to believe the same things can online communities play a role here <unk> how do we fix this gc see i understand how that happened that 's another[MASK] <unk> groundswell kind of emotion that was going on in the middle of america and not being heard in thinking that the mainstream media was biased[MASK] there 's a difference though between being biased and being fake [MASK] to me that is a very important distinction in this conversation <unk> so let 's just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media [MASK] ok <unk> so there are ways to try and mend that but what what trump 's doing[MASK] <unk> that 's where it gets dangerous ca do you think enough of his supporters have[MASK] a greater loyalty to the truth than to any like the principle of[MASK] not supporting something that is demonstrably not true actually matters so there will be a correction at some point db i think the truth eventually comes[MASK] <unk> so for example <unk> donald trump has based a lot of his economic policy on this supposition that americans have lost manufacturing jobs because they 've been stolen by the chinese <unk> [MASK] that is maybe thirteen percent of the jobs that left the truth is that eighty seven percent of the jobs were replaced by technology that is just the truth[MASK] <unk> and so as a result when he says i 'm going to close tpp and all the jobs will come roaring back they will not come roaring[MASK] <unk> what his supporters think is the truth <unk> no matter how many times you might say that they still believe him db but eventually either jobs will come back or they will not come back[MASK] and at that point either something will work or it doesn 't work <unk> and it doesn 't work or not work because of great marketing it works because it actually addresses a real problem and so[MASK] <unk> hear a lot of this talk about how we all need to start talking to each other more and understanding each other more and i 've even written about this published on this subject as well [MASK] but now today i keep hearing[MASK] liberals yes i live in new york i can be considered a liberal we sit here and[MASK] <unk> what did we do to not understand the rust belt or what can we do to understand middle america better and what i 'd like to know [MASK] have you seen any attempts or conversations from middle america of what can i do to understand the so called coastal elites better because i 'm just offended as being[MASK] put in a box as a coastal elite as someone in middle america is as being considered a flyover state and not listened to[MASK] i would say and[MASK] this is someone who has been conservative all my adult life when you grow up conservative you learn to speak both languages <unk> [MASK] because if i 'm going to listen to music <unk> i 'm not going to listen to ted nugent[MASK] a lot of my favorite rock bands are all on the left <unk> [MASK] <unk> if i 'm going to go to a school i 'm going probably to school where the culture is liberal <unk> if i 'm going to watch a sitcom or a late night comedy show it 's going to be liberal if i 'm going to read a good newspaper it 'll be the new york times <unk> as a result you learn to speak both languages[MASK] <unk> and that that actually at least for a number of years when i started at national review with william f buckley it made us sharper <unk> [MASK] because we were used to arguing against people every day <unk> the problem now that 's happened is you have ghettoization on the right and you can live entirely in[MASK] so as a result the quality of argument on the right has diminished <unk> because you 're not in the other side all the time <unk> [MASK] but i do think if you 're living in minnesota or iowa[MASK] or arizona the coastal elites make themselves aware to you so you know that language as well but it 's not the reverse[MASK] <unk> if you could plant one piece of truth from the mindset of someone in this room for example[MASK] <unk> what would you say to them db just how insanely wonderful we are laughter[MASK] no i reject the category <unk> the problem with populism is the same problem with elitism <unk> [MASK] it 's just a prejudice on the basis of probably an over generalized social class distinction[MASK] which is too simplistic to apply in reality [MASK] those of us in new york know there are some people in new york who are completely awesome and some people who are pathetic <unk> and if you live in iowa some people are awesome and some people are pathetic[MASK] <unk> not a question of what degree you have or where you happen to live in the country <unk> the distinction is just a crude simplification to arouse political power gc but i would encourage people to watch[MASK] a television news show or read a column that they normally wouldn 't [MASK] so if you are a trump supporter watch the other side for a day because you need to come out of the bubble[MASK] if you 're ever going to have a conversation and[MASK] <unk> both sides so if you 're a liberal then watch something that 's very conservative read a column that is not something you would normally read [MASK] because then you gain perspective of what the other side is thinking and to me that 's a start of coming together i worry about the same thing you worry about <unk> these bubbles <unk> i think if you only watch certain entities you have no idea what the rest of the world is talking about[MASK] <unk> watching being part of an organization that meets at least once a month that puts you in direct contact with people completely unlike yourself is something we all have a responsibility for i may get this a little wrong <unk>[MASK] but i think of the top selling automotive models in this country <unk> i think the top three or four are all pickup trucks <unk> [MASK] <unk> that 's sort of a warning sign kind of a problem where can i join a club where i 'll have a lot in common with a person who drives a pickup truck because we have a common interest in whatever [MASK] ca and so the internet is definitely[MASK] contributing to this a question here from chris ajemian how do you feel structure of communications especially the prevalence of social media[MASK] and individualized content can be used to bring together a political divide <unk> instead of just filing communities into[MASK] <unk> echo chambers i mean it looks like facebook and google since the election are working hard on this question they 're trying to[MASK] change the algorithms so that[MASK] they don 't amplify fake news to the extent that it happened last time round do you see any other promising signs of[MASK] <unk> on the left[MASK] <unk> to figure out how to[MASK] <unk> but i think that[MASK] <unk> have an understanding of[MASK] <unk> he 's a[MASK] <unk> he 's got a[MASK] <unk> i may[MASK]
