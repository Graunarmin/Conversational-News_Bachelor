 <unk> i 'm going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in the[MASK] the journal of ultrasound in medicine <unk> i 'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting[MASK] <unk> paper ever published in the journal of ultrasound in medicine <unk> the title is observations of[MASK] okay <unk> now on the left you can see the hand that 's the big arrow and the penis on the right the hand hovering <unk> [MASK] and over here we have[MASK] <unk> in the words of radiologist israel meisner the hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements [MASK] bear in mind this was an ultrasound so it would have been moving images [MASK] orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system now this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don 't consciously control like digestion heart rate and sexual arousal <unk> [MASK] and the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input[MASK] genital stimulation duh [MASK] but also kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow <unk> [MASK] people with spinal cord injuries like paraplegias quadriplegias will often develop a very very sensitive area[MASK] right above the level of[MASK] <unk> wherever that is there is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature <unk> i think the most[MASK] the most curious one that i came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth[MASK] he checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste but no it happened with[MASK] any brand they stimulated her gums with a toothpick to see if that was doing it no it was the whole <unk> you know <unk> motion[MASK] and the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral[MASK] <unk> this is what it said in the journal paper she believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care it 's so sad <unk>[MASK] when i was working on the book i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm she was part of a study at[MASK] <unk> i interviewed her in oakland in a sushi restaurant and i said so could you do it right here and she said yeah but you know i 'd rather finish my meal if you don 't mind laughter[MASK] but afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside it was remarkable it took about one minute[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] i said to her[MASK] <unk> when i get home i 'm usually too tired [MASK] she said that the last time she had done it was on the disneyland tram [MASK] the headquarters for orgasm along the spinal nerve is something called the sacral[MASK] <unk> which is back here <unk> and if you trigger if you stimulate with an electrode the precise spot <unk> you will trigger[MASK] an orgasm <unk> [MASK] and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people a certain kind of dead person a beating heart cadaver <unk> now this is somebody who is brain dead legally dead definitely checked out [MASK] but is being kept alive on[MASK] <unk> so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation now in one of these brain dead people [MASK] if you trigger the right spot <unk> you will see something every now and then there is a reflex called the lazarus reflex and this is i[MASK] 'll demonstrate as best i can not being dead it 's[MASK] like this you trigger the spot <unk> the dead guy or gal goes like that very unsettling for people working in pathology labs[MASK] now if[MASK] you can trigger the lazarus reflex in a dead person <unk> why not the orgasm reflex i asked this question to a[MASK] a brain death expert stephanie mann who was foolish enough to return my emails [MASK] i said so could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person she said yes if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated[MASK] you conceivably could obviously it wouldn 't be as much fun[MASK] for the person <unk> but it would be an orgasm nonetheless[MASK] there is a researcher at the university of alabama who does[MASK] orgasm research i said to her you should do an experiment you know you can get cadavers if you work at a university i said you should actually do this[MASK] <unk> the human subjects review board approval for this one according to 1930s marriage manual author theodoor van de velde a[MASK] slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse <unk> [MASK] theodoor van de velde was something of a semen[MASK] <unk> very heavy hetero guy <unk> but he wrote in this book ideal marriage he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man <unk> [MASK] which he said had a a fresh exhilarating smell[MASK] and the semen of mature men whose semen smelled quote remarkably like that of the flowers of the spanish[MASK] <unk> in the state of israel a man began hiccupping <unk> and this was one of those cases that went on and on he tried everything his friends suggested nothing seemed to help <unk> [MASK] days went by at a certain point the man <unk> still[MASK] <unk> had sex with his wife and lo and behold the hiccups went away he told his doctor who[MASK] published a case report in a canadian medical journal under the title sexual intercourse as a potential treatment for intractable hiccups [MASK] i love this article because[MASK] at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation <unk> i love that[MASK] <unk> a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really[MASK] <unk> if you go all the way back to hippocrates [MASK] physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception but necessary doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of[MASK] pleasuring their[MASK] <unk> theodoor van de velde has[MASK] a line in his book <unk> i loved this guy <unk> i got a lot of mileage out <unk> of theodoor van de velde <unk> [MASK] he had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the the habsburg monarchy <unk> where there was an[MASK] empress maria theresa who was having trouble conceiving and apparently the royal court physician said to her i am of the opinion that the[MASK] <unk> vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse it 's apparently i don 't know on the record somewhere [MASK] masters and johnson now we 're moving forward to the 1950s masters and johnson were upsuck skeptics [MASK] which is also really fun to say <unk> [MASK] they didn 't buy it <unk> and they decided being masters and johnson that they would get to the bottom of it[MASK] <unk> brought women into the lab[MASK] and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen and in the artificial semen was a <unk>[MASK] substance such that it would show up on an[MASK] to see if the semen was being sucked up did not find any evidence of upsuck <unk> you may be wondering how do you make artificial semen [MASK] i have an answer for you i have two answers you can use flour and water or cornstarch and water i actually found three separate recipes in the literature [MASK] my favorite being the[MASK] <unk> one that says[MASK] you know they have the ingredients listed and then[MASK] in a recipe it will say for example yield <unk> two dozen cupcakes this one said yield one ejaculate [MASK] there 's another way that orgasm might boost fertility this one involves men [MASK] sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head banging their way into the egg[MASK] <unk> british sexologist roy levin has speculated that[MASK] this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators <unk> he said if i keep tossing myself off i get fresh sperm being made [MASK] which i thought was an interesting[MASK] idea theory so now you have an evolutionary excuse[MASK] <unk> all righty there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom[MASK] pigs for instance in denmark the danish national committee for pig production found out that <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate[MASK] <unk> you will see a six percent increase in the farrowing rate which is the number of piglets produced so they came up with this five point stimulation plan for <unk>[MASK] <unk> the sows there is posters they put in the barn and they[MASK] have a dvd and i got a copy of this dvd this is my unveiling because i am going to show you a clip[MASK] it all looks very innocent <unk> he 's going to be doing things with his hands that the the boar would use his snout [MASK] lacking hands okay [MASK] this is it the boar has a very odd courtship repertoire this is[MASK] to mimic the weight of the boar[MASK] <unk> you should know <unk> the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina so this may be sort of titillating for her[MASK] <unk> i love this video <unk> there is a point in this video towards the beginning where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring as if to say it 's okay it 's just his job[MASK] <unk> denmark my host was named anne marie and i said so[MASK] why don 't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig why don 't you have the farmers do that that 's not one of your five steps [MASK] i have to read you what she said because i love it she said it was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva so we thought let 's not mention the[MASK] <unk> shy but ambitious pig farmers however can purchase a this is true a sow vibrator that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate [MASK] because as i mentioned <unk> the clitoris is inside the vagina so possibly you know a little more arousing than it looks and[MASK] i also said to her now these sows i mean you may have noticed[MASK] <unk> the sow doesn 't look to be in the throes of ecstasy and she said <unk> you can 't make that conclusion because[MASK] animals don 't register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do pigs for example are more like dogs they use the upper half of the face [MASK] the ears are very expressive so you 're not really sure what 's going on with the pig primates on the other hand we use our mouths more[MASK] <unk> this has been observed in female macaques <unk> but only when mounting another female [MASK] masters and johnson in the 1950s they decided okay we 're going to[MASK] figure out the entire human sexual response cycle from arousal all the way through orgasm in[MASK] <unk> men and women everything that happens in the human body [MASK] okay with women a lot of this is happening inside this did not stop masters and johnson they developed[MASK] an artificial coition machine this is[MASK] basically a penis camera on a motor there is a phallus <unk> clear acrylic phallus with a camera and a light source attached to a motor that is kind of going like this [MASK] and[MASK] the woman would have sex with it that is what they would do pretty amazing[MASK] this device has been dismantled this just kills me not because i wanted to use it i wanted to see[MASK] one fine day <unk> alfred kinsey decided[MASK] to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen this was not idle curiosity doctor kinsey[MASK] <unk> had heard and there was a theory going around at the time this being the <unk> 1940s[MASK] that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility[MASK] kinsey thought it was bunk so he got to work he got together in[MASK] his lab[MASK] three hundred men a measuring[MASK] <unk> in fact he found that[MASK] in three quarters of the men the stuff[MASK] just kind of slopped out it wasn 't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force <unk> however [MASK] the record holder landed just shy of the eight foot mark which is impressive[MASK] <unk> of this experiment in his book kinsey wrote two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets [MASK] which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of alfred kinsey my favorite being[MASK] <unk> cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female <unk> but not the male[MASK]
