 <unk> the language i 'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world 's universal language for better or for worse <unk> let 's face it <unk>[MASK] <unk> it 's the language of the internet <unk> it 's the language of finance <unk> it 's the language of air traffic control[MASK] <unk> popular music <unk> diplomacy english is everywhere [MASK] now mandarin chinese is spoken by more people <unk> but more chinese people are learning english than english speakers are learning chinese [MASK] last i heard there are two dozen universities in china right now teaching[MASK] <unk> is taking over and in addition to that it 's been predicted that at the end of the century[MASK] almost all of the languages that exist now there are about six thousand will no longer be spoken there will only be some hundreds left <unk> [MASK] and on top of that it 's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible[MASK] but it gets better every year [MASK] the reason i 'm reciting those things to you is because i can tell that we 're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked which is why should <unk>[MASK] <unk> we learn foreign languages other than if english happens to be foreign to one why bother to learn another one when it 's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate[MASK] <unk> i think there are a lot of reasons <unk> but i first want to address the one that you 're probably most likely to have heard of because actually it 's more dangerous than you might think [MASK] and that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages gives everybody a different kind[MASK] acid trip so to speak that is a marvelously enticing idea [MASK] but it 's kind of fraught so it 's not that it 's untrue completely <unk> [MASK] so for example in french and spanish the word for table is for some reason <unk> marked as feminine so la table la mesa you just have to deal with it [MASK] it has been shown that if you are a speaker of one of those languages and you happen to be[MASK] <unk> asked how you would imagine a table talking [MASK] then much more often than could possibly be an accident a french or a spanish speaker says that the table would talk with a high[MASK] and feminine voice <unk> so if you 're french or spanish to you a table is kind of a girl as opposed to if you are an english speaker <unk> [MASK] it 's hard not to love data like that and many[MASK] <unk> will tell you that that means that there 's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages but you[MASK] have to watch out because imagine if somebody put us under the microscope the us being those of us who speak english natively <unk> what is the worldview[MASK] from english <unk> so for example let 's take an english speaker up on the screen that is[MASK] <unk> he speaks english i presume he has a worldview now [MASK] that is donald trump in his way he speaks english as well [MASK] and here is ms kardashian <unk> and she is an english speaker too [MASK] <unk> here are three speakers of the english language what worldview do those three people have in common [MASK] what worldview is shaped through the english language that unites them it 's a highly fraught concept and so[MASK] gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought <unk> but it tends to be in rather darling <unk> obscure psychological flutters <unk>[MASK] <unk> it 's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world [MASK] if that 's the case <unk> then why learn languages if it isn 't going to change the way you think <unk> what would the other reasons be there are some [MASK] one of them is[MASK] that if you want to imbibe[MASK] a culture if you want to drink it in if you want to become part of it then whether or not the language channels the culture and that seems doubtful[MASK] <unk> if you want to imbibe the culture you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in there 's no other way there 's an interesting <unk>[MASK] illustration of this i have to go slightly obscure but really you should seek it out there 's a movie by the canadian film director denys <unk> arcand read out in english on the page <unk>[MASK] if you want to look him up he did a film called[MASK] <unk> jesus of montreal and many of the characters are vibrant <unk> funny passionate interesting[MASK] <unk> women there 's one scene closest to the end where they have to take a friend to an anglophone hospital [MASK] in the hospital they have to speak english now they speak english but it 's not their native language <unk> they 'd rather not speak english <unk> and they speak it more slowly[MASK] they have accents they 're not idiomatic suddenly these characters that you 've fallen in love with become husks of themselves they 're shadows of themselves [MASK] to go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture and so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be[MASK] <unk> one reason to learn them is because they are tickets to being able to participate in the culture of the people who speak them just by virtue of the fact that it is their code <unk> so that 's one reason [MASK] second reason <unk> [MASK] it 's been shown that if you speak two languages dementia is less likely to set in [MASK] and that you are probably a better multitasker <unk> and these are factors that set in early <unk> and so that ought to give you some sense of when[MASK] <unk> when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language <unk> bilingualism is healthy <unk> and then third[MASK] languages are just an awful lot of fun much more fun than we 're often told <unk> so for example[MASK] <unk> have in common all those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars they stay still and the vowels dance around <unk>[MASK] <unk> the consonants who wouldn 't want to roll that around in their mouths you can get that from hebrew you can get that from ethiopia 's main language amharic that[MASK] <unk> languages have different word orders learning how to speak with different word order is like[MASK] driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country or the feeling that you get when you put witch hazel around your eyes and you feel the tingle a language <unk>[MASK] can do that to you so for example the cat in the hat comes back a book that i 'm sure we all[MASK] <unk> do you know where i found him do you know where he was he was eating cake in the tub yes he was fine [MASK] now if you learn that in mandarin chinese then you have to master you can know i did where him find <unk> he was tub inside gorging cake no mistake gorging chewing that just feels good imagine being able to do that[MASK] for years and years at a time or have you ever[MASK] learned any cambodian[MASK] me either but if i did i would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker 's dozen of vowels like english has but a <unk>[MASK] good thirty different vowels scooching and oozing around in the cambodian mouth like bees in a hive that is what a language can get you [MASK] <unk> when it 's never been easier to teach yourself another language it used to be that you had to go to a classroom [MASK] and there would be some diligent teacher some genius teacher in there but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then and then was not most times you had to go to class [MASK] if you didn 't have that you had something called a record <unk> i cut my teeth on those[MASK] <unk> there was only so much data on a record <unk> or a cassette or even that antique object known as a cd other than that you had books that didn 't work that 's just the way it was <unk>[MASK] today you can lay down lie on your living room floor sipping bourbon and teach yourself any language that you want to with wonderful sets such as rosetta stone i highly recommend the lesser known[MASK] <unk> as well you can do it any time therefore you can do it more and better [MASK] you can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages i take some dilbert in various languages every single morning it can increase your skills <unk> couldn 't have done <unk>[MASK] <unk> it twenty years ago when the idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket coming from your phone would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people [MASK] that you teach yourself languages other than the one that i 'm speaking because there 's never been a better time to do it <unk> it 's an awful lot of fun <unk> it won 't change your mind but it will most certainly blow your mind <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
