 <unk> when i was a kid i was obsessed with the guinness book of world records <unk> and i really wanted to set a world record myself [MASK] but there was just one small problem [MASK] i had absolutely no[MASK] <unk> i decided to set a world record in something that demanded absolutely no skill at all i decided to set a world record[MASK] in crawling [MASK] laughter now the record at the time was twelve and a half miles[MASK] <unk> and for some reason this seemed totally manageable[MASK] <unk> recruited my friend anne and together we decided we didn 't even need to train [MASK] and on the day of our record attempt we put furniture pads on the outside of our good luck jeans and we set off [MASK] and right away we were in trouble[MASK] <unk> because the denim was against our skin and it began to chafe <unk> and soon our knees were being chewed up[MASK] hours in it began to rain <unk> then <unk> anne dropped out <unk> [MASK] then it got dark [MASK] now by now my knees were bleeding through my jeans and i was hallucinating from the cold and the pain and the monotony <unk> [MASK] and to give you an idea of the suffer fest that i was undergoing[MASK] <unk> the first lap around the high school track took ten minutes the last lap took almost thirty <unk> after[MASK] twelve hours of crawling <unk> i stopped <unk> and i had gone eight and a half miles <unk> [MASK] so i was short[MASK] <unk> for many years i thought this was a story of abject failure <unk> but today i see it differently <unk> because[MASK] when i was attempting the world record i was doing three things i was getting outside my comfort zone i was calling upon my resilience <unk> and i was finding confidence in myself and my own decisions <unk> [MASK] i didn 't know it then but[MASK] <unk> i became a san francisco firefighter <unk> [MASK] and i was the 15th woman in a department of one thousand five hundred men [MASK] and as you can imagine when i arrived there were many doubts about whether we could do the job <unk> so even though i was a five[MASK] <unk> ten 150 pound collegiate rower and someone who could endure twelve hours of searing knee pain [MASK] i knew i still had to prove my strength and fitness [MASK] so one day a call came in for a fire and sure enough when my engine group pulled up <unk> there was black smoke billowing from a building off an alleyway[MASK] <unk> and i was with a big guy named skip and he was on the nozzle and i was right behind and it was a typical sort of fire it was smoky it was hot <unk> [MASK] and all of a sudden <unk> [MASK] there was an explosion [MASK] and skip and i were blown backwards my mask was knocked sideways <unk> and there was this moment of confusion <unk> and then[MASK] i picked myself up <unk> i groped for the[MASK] <unk> and i did what a firefighter was supposed to do i lunged forward <unk> opened up the water and i tackled the fire myself [MASK] the explosion had been caused by a water heater so nobody was hurt and ultimately it was not a big deal but later skip came up to me and said [MASK] nice job caroline in this surprised sort of voice [MASK] and i was confused because the fire hadn 't been difficult physically so why was he looking[MASK] <unk> at me with something like astonishment [MASK] and then it became clear skip <unk> who was by the way a really nice guy and an excellent firefighter [MASK] not only thought that women could not be strong he thought that they could not be brave either <unk> [MASK] and he wasn 't the only one [MASK] <unk> and strangers men and women throughout my career ask me over and over caroline <unk> all that fire all that danger aren 't you scared [MASK] honestly i never heard a male firefighter asked this <unk> [MASK] and i became curious [MASK] why wasn 't bravery expected of women [MASK] now the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me that her young daughter was a big scaredy cat and so i began to[MASK] <unk> notice and yes <unk> the daughter was anxious <unk> but more than that the parents were anxious [MASK] most of what they said to her when she was outside began with be careful watch out or no [MASK] now my friends were not bad parents they were just doing what most parents do which is cautioning their daughters much more than they caution their sons[MASK] there was a study involving a playground fire pole ironically [MASK] in which researchers saw that little girls were very likely to be warned by both their moms and dads about the fire pole 's risk <unk> [MASK] and if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pole [MASK] a parent was very likely to assist[MASK] but the little boys [MASK] they were encouraged to play on the fire pole despite any trepidations that they might have and often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own <unk> [MASK] so what message does this send to both boys and girls well that girls are fragile and more in need of help [MASK] and that boys can and should master difficult tasks by themselves it says that girls[MASK] <unk> should be fearful and boys should be gutsy[MASK] <unk> now the irony is that at this young age girls and boys are actually very alike physically in fact girls are often stronger until puberty and more mature <unk> [MASK] and yet we adults act[MASK] as if girls are more fragile and more in need of help[MASK] <unk> and they can 't handle as much [MASK] this is the message that we absorb as kids and this is the message that fully permeates as we grow up we women believe it men believe it <unk> and guess what [MASK] as we become parents we pass it on to our children and so it goes <unk> well so now i had my answer this is why women even <unk>[MASK] were expected to be scared this is why women often are scared[MASK] <unk> now i know some of you won 't believe me when i tell you this but i am not against fear [MASK] i know it 's an important emotion and it 's there to keep us safe <unk> [MASK] but the problem is when fear is the primary reaction that we teach and encourage in girls whenever they face something outside their comfort zone <unk> [MASK] so i was a paraglider pilot for many years[MASK] <unk> paraglider is a parachute like wing and it does fly very well[MASK] but to many people i realize it looks just like a bedsheet with strings attached [MASK] laughter and i spent a lot of time on mountaintops inflating this bedsheet running off and flying <unk> and i know[MASK] <unk> you 're thinking you 're like caroline a little fear would make sense here [MASK] and you 're right it does i assure you i did feel fear <unk> [MASK] but on that mountaintop waiting for the wind to come in just right i felt so many other things too exhilaration confidence <unk> [MASK] i knew i was a good pilot <unk> i knew the conditions were good[MASK] but i would take a good hard look at it assess just how relevant it was[MASK] and then put it where it belonged <unk> which was more often than not behind my exhilaration my anticipation and my confidence <unk> [MASK] so i 'm not against fear i 'm just[MASK] <unk> not saying your girls must be firefighters or that they should be paragliders <unk> [MASK] but i am saying that we are raising our girls to be timid even helpless <unk> [MASK] and it begins when we caution them against physical risk <unk> [MASK] the fear we learn and the experiences we don 't stay with us as we become women and morphs into all those things that we face and try to shed [MASK] our hesitation in speaking out our deference so that we can be liked[MASK] <unk> and our lack of confidence in our own decisions <unk> [MASK] so how do we become brave [MASK] well here 's the good news bravery is learned and like anything learned it just needs to be practiced <unk> so first [MASK] we have to take a deep breath and encourage our girls to skateboard climb trees and clamber around on that playground[MASK] <unk> fire pole [MASK] this is what my own mother did [MASK] she didn 't know it then <unk> [MASK] but researchers have a name for this they call it risky play [MASK] and studies show that risky play is really important for kids all kids because it teaches hazard assessment <unk> it teaches delayed gratification <unk> it teaches[MASK] <unk> it teaches confidence [MASK] in other words when kids get outside and practice bravery <unk> they learn valuable life lessons [MASK] second <unk> we have to stop cautioning our girls willy nilly [MASK] so notice next time you say watch out you 're going to get hurt or don 't do that it 's dangerous and remember[MASK] that often what you 're really telling her is that she shouldn 't be pushing herself[MASK] that she 's really not good enough that she should be afraid <unk> [MASK] third [MASK] we women have to start practicing bravery too we cannot teach our girls until we teach ourselves <unk> [MASK] so here 's another thing fear and exhilaration[MASK] feel very similar[MASK] the shaky hands[MASK] <unk> heightened heart rate <unk> the nervous tension <unk> and i 'm betting that for many of you the last time you thought you were scared out of your wits you may have been feeling mostly exhilaration <unk> [MASK] and now you 've missed an opportunity <unk> [MASK] so practice and while girls should be getting outside to learn to be gutsy i get that adults don 't want to get on[MASK] <unk> we all should be practicing[MASK] at home in the office and even right here getting up the guts to talk to someone that you really admire <unk> [MASK] finally [MASK] when your girl is let 's say <unk> on her bike on the top of the steep hill that she insists she 's too scared to go down [MASK] guide her to access her bravery <unk> [MASK] ultimately maybe that hill[MASK] <unk> really is too steep <unk> but she 'll come to that conclusion through courage not fear <unk> [MASK] because this is not about the steep hill in front of her this is about the life ahead of her[MASK] and that she has the tools to handle and assess[MASK] all the dangers that we cannot protect her from all the challenges that we won 't be there to guide her through[MASK] <unk> everything that our girls here and around the world face in their future <unk> [MASK] so by the way the world record for crawling today [MASK] <unk> point one eight miles <unk> and i would really love to see a girl go break that[MASK]
