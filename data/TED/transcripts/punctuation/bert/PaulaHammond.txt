 <unk> affects all of us especially the ones that come back over and over again the highly invasive and <unk>[MASK] the ones that defy medical treatment even when we throw our best drugs at them engineering at the molecular level[MASK] <unk> working at the smallest of scales can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer [MASK] cancer is a very clever disease [MASK] there are some forms of cancer which fortunately <unk> we 've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery [MASK] but there are some forms of cancer that[MASK] <unk> 't respond to these approaches and the tumor survives or comes back even after an onslaught of drugs [MASK] we can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer[MASK] as kind of supervillains in a comic book they 're clever they 're adaptable and they 're very good at staying alive[MASK] <unk> these days their superpowers come from a genetic mutation <unk> [MASK] the genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival <unk>[MASK] allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments [MASK] <unk> the cell to push the drug out [MASK] before the drug can have any effect <unk> imagine the cell effectively spits out the drug [MASK] this is just one example of the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain cancer all due to mutant genes <unk> [MASK] <unk> we have a supervillain[MASK] with incredible superpowers <unk> and we need a new and powerful mode of attack [MASK] actually we can turn off a gene the key is a set of molecules known <unk>[MASK] as sirna sirna are short sequences of genetic code[MASK] that guide a cell to block a certain gene each sirna molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell[MASK] <unk> for many years since its discovery scientists have been very excited about how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine <unk> but there is a <unk>[MASK] <unk> works well inside the cell <unk> but if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues <unk> it degrades within seconds[MASK] <unk> it has to be packaged protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell[MASK] here 's our strategy first we 'll dose the cancer cell with sirna the gene blocker <unk> and silence those survival genes <unk> and then we 'll whop it with a chemo drug <unk> [MASK] but how do we carry that out using molecular engineering [MASK] <unk> that can travel through the bloodstream <unk> it has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream it 's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue <unk> [MASK] and it 's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell [MASK] to do this job well <unk> it has to be about one one <unk> one hundredth the size of a human hair <unk> [MASK] let 's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle [MASK] first let 's start[MASK] <unk> with the nanoparticle core <unk> it 's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug [MASK] this is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell 's life around this core[MASK] <unk> nice protective layer of positively charged polymer <unk> [MASK] the two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction [MASK] and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the sirna from degrading in the bloodstream [MASK] we 're almost done [MASK] but there is one more big obstacle we have to think about in fact it may be the biggest obstacle of all how do we deploy[MASK] this superweapon i mean every good weapon needs to be targeted we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor [MASK] but our bodies have a natural immune defense system [MASK] cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don 't belong so that it can destroy or eliminate[MASK] <unk> and guess what our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object [MASK] we have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system <unk> [MASK] we have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it [MASK] so[MASK] we add one more negatively charged layer[MASK] around this nanoparticle which serves two purposes [MASK] <unk> this outer layer is one of the naturally charged highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body <unk> [MASK] it creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle[MASK] that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect [MASK] this invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle to travel through the bloodstream long and far enough to reach the tumor <unk> without getting eliminated by the body[MASK] molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell <unk> [MASK] once bound the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle [MASK] and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell and ready to deploy <unk> [MASK] alright i feel the same way[MASK] <unk> it acts for hours <unk> giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes <unk> [MASK] we have now disabled those genetic superpowers <unk> what remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses <unk> then the chemotherapy[MASK] drug comes out of the core[MASK] and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently [MASK] with sufficient gene blockers we can address many different kinds of mutations <unk> [MASK] allowing the chance to sweep out tumors without leaving behind any bad guys [MASK] how does our strategy work <unk> [MASK] we 've tested these nanostructure particles in animals using a highly aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer this[MASK] <unk> triple negative breast cancer exhibits the gene that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered usually doxorubicin[MASK] let 's call it dox is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer [MASK] so we first treated our animals with a dox core <unk> dox only [MASK] the tumor slowed their rate of growth <unk> but they still grew rapidly <unk> doubling in[MASK] <unk> size over a period of two weeks <unk> then we tried our combination <unk>[MASK] <unk> particle with sirna against the chemo pump <unk> plus <unk> we have the dox in the core and look we found that not only did the tumors stop growing <unk> they actually decreased in[MASK] <unk> and were eliminated in some cases the tumors were actually regressing [MASK] what 's great about this approach is that it can be personalized we can add many different layers of <unk>[MASK] to address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms <unk> and we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core as doctors[MASK] <unk> learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types [MASK] they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use [MASK] ovarian cancer strikes a special chord with me <unk> [MASK] it is a very aggressive cancer in part because it 's discovered at very late stages when it 's highly advanced and there are a number of genetic mutations[MASK] after the first round of chemotherapy this cancer comes back for seventy five percent of patients and it usually comes back in <unk>[MASK] ovarian cancer is one of the biggest supervillains out there and we 're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat [MASK] as a researcher <unk> i usually don 't get to work with patients[MASK] <unk> but i recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor mimi and her daughter paige [MASK] i was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength[MASK] that both mother and daughter displayed[MASK] and by their story of courage and support at this event <unk> we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer[MASK] and mimi was in tears as she explained how learning about these efforts gives her hope for future generations including her own daughter [MASK] this really touched me it 's not just about building really elegant science it 's about changing people 's lives it[MASK] 's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules i know that as students[MASK] <unk> like paige move forward in their careers [MASK] they 'll open new possibilities in addressing some of the big health problems in the world including ovarian cancer neurological disorders <unk> infectious disease[MASK] just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me and[MASK] has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale that of molecules to heal[MASK] <unk> on the human scale <unk> thank you[MASK]
