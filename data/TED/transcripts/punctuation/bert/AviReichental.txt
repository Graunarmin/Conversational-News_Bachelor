 <unk> was a cobbler <unk> [MASK] back in the day <unk> he made custom made shoes i never got to meet him <unk> he perished in the holocaust <unk> [MASK] but i did inherit his love for making[MASK] that it doesn 't exist that much anymore you see while the industrial revolution[MASK] did a great deal to improve humanity <unk> it eradicated the very skill[MASK] that my grandfather loved <unk> and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it <unk> but all of that is about to change[MASK] <unk> all started with[MASK] this the very first part that was ever printed it 's a little older than ted <unk> it was printed in one thousand nine <unk>[MASK] by[MASK] chuck hull <unk> who invented 3d printing but the thing that i want to talk to you about today the big idea that i want to discuss with you[MASK] <unk> to catapult us into the future <unk> [MASK] but rather that it 's actually going to connect us with our heritage <unk> and it 's going to usher in a new era of localized <unk>[MASK] distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication [MASK] <unk> you all know your shoe size how many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples [MASK] anybody <unk> [MASK] wouldn 't it be awesome if you could for the first time get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn[MASK] 't require[MASK] <unk> any hinge assembly <unk> so chances are the hinges are not going to break <unk> [MASK] but the implications of 3d printing go well beyond the tips of our noses <unk> [MASK] when i met amanda for the first time she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down <unk> [MASK] but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable <unk> it was a beautiful robotic[MASK] <unk> suit made by ekso bionics <unk> [MASK] but it wasn 't inspired by her body <unk> it wasn 't made to measure <unk> so she challenged me to make her something[MASK] that was a little bit more feminine a little bit more elegant <unk> [MASK] and lightweight <unk> and like good tailors we thought that we would measure her digitally <unk> [MASK] and we did we built her an amazing suit the incredible part about what[MASK] <unk> i learned from amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3d printing and we say to ourselves it 's going to replace traditional methods [MASK] amanda looked at it and she said it 's an opportunity for me[MASK] to reclaim my symmetry[MASK] and to embrace my authenticity and you know what she 's not standing still she now wants to walk in high heels[MASK] <unk> it doesn 't stop there 3d printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know[MASK] <unk> another opportunity to emotionally reconnect[MASK] with your symmetry and as we sit here today you can go wireless on your braces with clear[MASK] <unk> your dental restorations millions of in the ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today millions of people are served today from these devices[MASK] what about full knee replacements [MASK] from your data <unk> made to measure where all of the tools and guides are 3d printed[MASK] is using 3d printing to make the next generation leap engine that will save[MASK] fuel to the tune of about fifteen percent and cost[MASK] for an airline of about fourteen million dollars good for g e right <unk> and their customers and the environment but you know the even better news[MASK] is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep pocketed corporations <unk> planetary resources a startup[MASK] for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year[MASK] it was a fraction of a nasa spaceship <unk> it costs a fraction of its cost <unk> and it 's made with less than a dozen moving parts <unk> and it 's going to be out in space later this year <unk> [MASK] google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone the ara <unk> it 's only possible because of the development of[MASK] <unk> printing that for the first time will make functional [MASK] usable modules that will go into it a real moonshot <unk> powered by 3d printing [MASK] how about food <unk> [MASK] what if we could for the first time make incredible delectables like[MASK] <unk> what if we could completely change the experience like you see with that absinthe[MASK] serving that is completely 3d printed and[MASK] what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste <unk> which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized[MASK] <unk> nutrition around the corner <unk> [MASK] and that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3d printing with 3d printing complexity is free the printer doesn 't care[MASK] if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape <unk> [MASK] and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it [MASK] many people think that[MASK] <unk> be the end of manufacturing as we know it [MASK] i think that it 's the opportunity to put tomorrow 's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities [MASK] and with that everybody can become an expert maker and an[MASK] <unk> expert manufacturer that will take new tools not everybody knows how to use cad <unk> so we 're developing <unk>[MASK] perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay <unk> [MASK] when you do things like that and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable <unk> it will make it easier to create content[MASK] <unk> we will also have the unintended <unk> like democratized counterfeiting[MASK] and ubiquitous illegal possession <unk> [MASK] so many people ask me will we have a 3d printer in every home i think it 's the wrong question to ask the right question to ask is how will 3d printing change my life[MASK] <unk> in other words what room in my house will 3d printing fit in so everything that you see here has been 3d printed <unk> [MASK] including these shoes[MASK] at the amsterdam fashion show now these are not my grandfather 's shoes[MASK] these are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper local manufacturing my[MASK] grandfather didn 't get to see nike printing[MASK] <unk> cleats for[MASK] the recent super bowl [MASK] and my father didn 't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3d printed shoes he passed away three years ago <unk> [MASK] but chuck hull the man that invented it all is right here in the house today <unk> [MASK] and thanks to[MASK] <unk> i can say thanks to his invention i can say that i am a cobbler too <unk> and by standing in these shoes[MASK] i am honoring my past while manufacturing the future <unk> thank you[MASK]
