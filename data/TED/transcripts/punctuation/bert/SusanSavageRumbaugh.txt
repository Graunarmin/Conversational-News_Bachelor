 <unk> i work with a species called bonobo and i 'm happy most of the time because i think this is the happiest species on the planet [MASK] it 's kind of a <unk> well kept secret this species lives only in the congo[MASK] <unk> and they 're not in too many zoos <unk> because of their sexual behavior [MASK] their sexual behavior is too human like for most of us to be comfortable with but [MASK] actually <unk> we have a lot to learn from them because they 're[MASK] a very egalitarian society and they 're a very empathetic society [MASK] and sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they[MASK] sort of set aside it permeates their[MASK] <unk> entire life and it 's used for communication and it 's used for conflict resolution <unk> and[MASK] i think perhaps somewhere in our history[MASK] we sort of divided our lives up into lots of parts [MASK] we divided our world up with lots of categories <unk> and so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit <unk> [MASK] but i don 't think that we were that way initially [MASK] there are many[MASK] <unk> who think that the animal world is <unk> hard wired[MASK] and that there 's something very very special about man <unk> maybe it 's his ability to have causal thought <unk> [MASK] maybe it 's something special in his brain that allows him to have language <unk> [MASK] maybe it 's something special in his brain[MASK] <unk> i don 't know there were tasmanians[MASK] who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire [MASK] they had no stone tools to our knowledge they had no music <unk> [MASK] so when you compare them to the bonobo[MASK] <unk> the bonobo is a little hairier [MASK] <unk> doesn 't stand quite as upright <unk> but there are a lot of similarities <unk> and[MASK] i think that as we look at culture <unk> we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are [MASK] and i don 't really think it 's in our biology <unk> i think we 've attributed it to our biology <unk>[MASK] <unk> but i don 't really think it 's there so what i want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo <unk> [MASK] this is kanzi <unk> [MASK] he 's a bonobo right now he 's in a forest in georgia his mother originally came[MASK] from a forest in africa and she came to us when she was just at puberty about six or seven[MASK] <unk> years of age [MASK] now this shows a bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left <unk> clearly the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking [MASK] the bonobo <unk> although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright <unk> just as we are [MASK] this shows the bonobo compared to an australopithecine like lucy as you can see there 's not[MASK] <unk> a lot of difference between the way a bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked [MASK] as they turn toward us you 'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines[MASK] is a little flatter[MASK] and doesn 't have to rotate quite so much from side to side so the the bipedal gait is a little easier <unk> and now we see all[MASK] canopied trees as tall as forty meters one hundred and thirty feet <unk> grow densely in the area [MASK] it was a japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo <unk> almost three decades ago <unk>[MASK] <unk> by nature very gentle creatures long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them <unk> [MASK] one discovery was that wild bonobos often walk[MASK] <unk> go say hello to austin first and then go to the a frame ss [MASK] this is kanzi and i in the forest none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained[MASK] <unk> tricks they all happened to be captured on film spontaneously by nhk of japan[MASK] <unk> we need more sticks too [MASK] i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one [MASK] that 's a wasps ' nest you can get it out i[MASK] hope i have a lighter[MASK] <unk> can use the lighter to start the fire ss so kanzi[MASK] is very interested in fire <unk> he doesn 't do it yet without a lighter <unk> but i think[MASK] if he saw someone do it he might be able to do make a fire without a lighter <unk> he 's learning about how to keep a fire going he[MASK] <unk> very happy about this part you 've got to put some water on the fire you see the water[MASK] <unk> farther than we can hear <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's got the pedals down but not the wheel[MASK] <unk> she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel[MASK] <unk> knows that that individual in the mirror is her video narrator [MASK] by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human [MASK] and documenting their development across two decades [MASK] scientists are exploring how cultural[MASK] <unk> panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors in the wild[MASK] <unk> parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring[MASK] here panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to groom nyota [MASK] very impressive <unk> [MASK] subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this[MASK] <unk> nyota tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself[MASK] <unk> realizing that nyota might get hurt <unk> panbanisha like any human mother <unk> carefully tugs to get the scissors back[MASK] <unk> kanzi 's learned to make stone tools video kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them two and a half million years ago[MASK] by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other[MASK] <unk> he has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows <unk> he can make much larger sharper flakes [MASK] kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough [MASK] the tough hide is difficult to cut <unk> even with[MASK] <unk> is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making <unk> but difficult to handle <unk> requiring great skill [MASK] kanzi 's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two and a half million years ago [MASK] these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made <unk> the flat sharp edges are like knife[MASK] <unk> compare them to the tools our ancestors used [MASK] they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi 's [MASK] panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods[MASK] <unk> something we didn 't think they would do video for several days now panbanisha has not been outside ss [MASK] i normally talk about language video then panbanisha does something unexpected [MASK] ss but since i 'm advised not to do what i normally do i haven 't told you that these apes have language it 's a geometric language[MASK] <unk> she writing ss [MASK] she 's also saying the name of that with[MASK] her voice video now she comes up to dr sue and starts writing again ss these are her symbols on[MASK] her keyboard they speak when she touches them video panbanisha is communicating to dr sue where she wants to go[MASK] in the woods <unk> compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard[MASK] panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest[MASK] <unk> first we didn 't really realize what she was doing until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it video this lexigram[MASK] to a place in the woods <unk> the curved line is very similar to the lexigram[MASK] the next symbol panbanisha writes represents collar it indicates the collar that panbanisha must wear when she goes out[MASK] <unk> requirement video this symbol is not as clear as the others[MASK] but one can see panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines <unk> [MASK] researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk [MASK] panbanisha watched <unk> soon she began to write as well[MASK] the bonobo 's abilities have stunned scientists around the world [MASK] how did they develop ss we found that the most important thing for permitting bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them <unk> [MASK] it 's simply to use language around them <unk> [MASK] because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you[MASK] once you have that capacity <unk> the ability to produce language[MASK] comes rather naturally and rather freely [MASK] so we want to create an environment in which bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting we want to create an environment in which they have fun <unk> [MASK] and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them[MASK] <unk> this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha [MASK] panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica <unk> [MASK] until nyota now one year old steals it <unk> [MASK] then he peers eagerly into his mother[MASK] <unk> 's mouth is he looking for where the sound came from [MASK] dr sue thinks it 's important to allow such curiosity to flourish[MASK] this time panbanisha is playing the electric piano <unk> she wasn 't forced to learn the piano[MASK] <unk> saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest[MASK] <unk> kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun filled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities[MASK] <unk> stay away from them now [MASK] now you can chase them again time to chase[MASK] them now you have to stay away get away run away run [MASK] <unk> now we can chase them again[MASK] <unk> we 're learning how to become like them we 're learning how to communicate with them <unk> in really high pitched tones <unk> [MASK] we 're learning that they probably have a language in the wild <unk> and they 're learning to become like us because we believe that it 's not[MASK] <unk> it 's culture so we 're sharing tools and technology and language with another species[MASK]
