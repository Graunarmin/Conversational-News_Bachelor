 <unk> i 've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters dopamine[MASK] <unk> things like that all the way through circuit analysis so that 's what i normally do <unk> but then for some reason [MASK] i got into something else <unk> just recently <unk> and it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers <unk> [MASK] and so this would be the typical talk i would give and the question is how do you end up with a psychopathic killer what i mean by psychopathic killer are these people these types of people [MASK] and so some of the brains that i 've studied are people you know about when i get the brains i don[MASK] <unk> i 'm looking at it 's blind experiments they also gave me normal people <unk> and everything so i 've looked at about seventy of these and what came up was a number of pieces of data <unk> [MASK] so we look at these sorts of things theoretically on the basis of genetics [MASK] and brain damage <unk> and interaction with environment and exactly how that machine works so we 're interested in exactly where in the brain [MASK] and what 's the most important part of the brain so[MASK] we 've been looking at this[MASK] <unk> interaction of genes <unk> what 's called epigenetic effects [MASK] brain damage and environment <unk> and how these are tied together [MASK] and how you end up with a psychopath and a killer depends on exactly when the damage occurs it 's really a very precisely[MASK] timed thing you get different kinds of psychopaths <unk> [MASK] so we 're going along with this <unk> and here 's just to give you the pattern the pattern is that those people every one of them i looked at who was a murderer[MASK] and was a serial killer [MASK] had damage to their orbital cortex which is right above the eyes the orbits <unk> [MASK] and also the interior part of the temporal lobe so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too they had other sorts of brain damage [MASK] a key thing is that the major[MASK] violence genes it 's called the[MASK] <unk> population some of you have this <unk> and it 's sex linked it 's on the x chromosome <unk> and so in this way you can only get it from your mother <unk> [MASK] and in fact this is probably why mostly men boys are psychopathic killers or are very aggressive <unk> because a[MASK] daughter can get[MASK] one x from the father one x from the mother it 's kind of diluted out <unk> but for a son he can only get the[MASK] x chromosome from his mother so this is how it 's passed from[MASK] from mother to son <unk> and it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development which[MASK] is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed <unk> [MASK] but if you have this gene in utero your brain is bathed in this so your whole brain becomes insensitive to[MASK] <unk> so it doesn 't work later on in life [MASK] and i 'd given this one talk in israel <unk> just this past year <unk> and it does have some consequences theoretically[MASK] what this means is that in order to express this gene in a violent way [MASK] very early on before puberty you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic not a little stress not being spanked or something but really[MASK] <unk> the mirror neuron system works <unk> and so if you have that gene <unk> and you see a lot of violence[MASK] in a certain situation this is the recipe for disaster <unk> absolute disaster <unk> [MASK] and what i think might happen in these areas of the world where we have constant violence you end up having generations of kids[MASK] that are seeing all this violence <unk> and if i was a young girl somewhere in a violent area[MASK] <unk> fourteen year old and i want to[MASK] find a mate i 'd find some tough guy right to protect me <unk> well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes <unk> [MASK] and now the boys and the girls get them so i think after several generations <unk> and here is the idea we really have a tinderbox <unk> so that was[MASK] the idea <unk> but then my mother said to me i hear you 've been going around talking about psychopathic killers <unk> and you 're talking as if you come from[MASK] <unk> a normal family i said what the hell are you talking about she then[MASK] told me about our own family tree now she blamed this on my father 's side of course this was one of these cases because she has no violence in her background <unk> [MASK] but my father did <unk> well she said there is good news and bad news one of your cousins is ezra cornell founder of cornell university <unk> but the bad[MASK] <unk> no it gets worse read this book and here is this killed strangely and it 's this historical book <unk> and the first murder[MASK] of a mother by a son was my[MASK] great great great great great great grandfather okay so that 's the first case of matricide and that book is very interesting because it 's about[MASK] witch trials and how people thought back then <unk> but it doesn 't stop there[MASK] there were seven more men on my father 's side <unk> starting then cornells that were all murderers[MASK] okay <unk> now this[MASK] gives one a little pause <unk>[MASK] because my father himself and my three uncles in world war ii were all conscientious objectors all pussycats <unk> but every once in a while like lizzie[MASK] <unk> like three times a century[MASK] <unk> the bad news is[MASK]
