 <unk> these are my words but this is not my voice <unk> this is alex the best computer voice i 've been able to find which comes as standard equipment on every macintosh <unk> [MASK] for most of my life i never gave a second thought to my ability to speak <unk> it was like breathing in those days[MASK] <unk> i was living in a fool 's paradise <unk> after surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak <unk> eat or drink i was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me <unk> [MASK] for several days now we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at ted i used to be able to talk like that [MASK] <unk> maybe i wasn 't as smart <unk> but i was at least as talkative <unk> [MASK] i want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself <unk> and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one 's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away <unk> [MASK] however i 've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous <unk> so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me i will start with my wife chaz[MASK] it was chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak <unk> [MASK] going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in two thousand and six [MASK] i expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show ' ebert and roeper at the movies[MASK] i had pre taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation <unk> [MASK] the doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw [MASK] my tongue <unk> larynx and vocal cords were still[MASK] <unk> i was optimistic and all was right with the world [MASK] the first surgery was a great success i saw myself in the mirror and i looked pretty good [MASK] two weeks later <unk> i was ready to return home[MASK] <unk> home <unk> i was using my ipod to play the leonard cohen song ' i 'm your man ' for my doctors and nurses <unk> [MASK] suddenly i had an episode of catastrophic bleeding [MASK] my carotid artery had ruptured [MASK] thank god i was still in my hospital room and my[MASK] doctors were right there [MASK] chaz told me that if that song hadn 't played for so long i might have already been in the car on the way home <unk> and would have died right there and then [MASK] so thank you leonard cohen for saving my life [MASK] there was a second surgery which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart [MASK] <unk> then a third attempt <unk> which also patched me back together pretty well <unk> until it failed [MASK] a doctor from brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture <unk> [MASK] and before i left the hospital after a year of[MASK] <unk> i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery [MASK] there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again <unk> it just sort of became obvious [MASK] human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system[MASK] <unk> we need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds [MASK] therefore <unk> the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air <unk> [MASK] because i had lost my jaw <unk> i could no longer form a seal <unk> and therefore my tongue[MASK] and all of my other vocal equipment[MASK] <unk> i wrote messages in notebooks then i tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice <unk> this was faster and nobody had to try to read my handwriting <unk> [MASK] i tried out various computer voices that were available online and for several months i had a british accent <unk> which chaz called sir lawrence [MASK] it was the clearest i could find then apple released the alex voice which was the best i 'd heard[MASK] it knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark when it saw a period it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air <unk> [MASK] there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices and i 've experimented with them for me they share a fundamental problem they 're too[MASK] <unk> when i find myself in a conversational situation <unk> i need to type fast and to jump right[MASK] in people don 't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase <unk> [MASK] but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice <unk> how does that affect who you are as a person [MASK] when people hear alex speaking my words do they experience a disconnect does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next <unk> [MASK] how did i feel not being able to speak[MASK] <unk> i felt <unk> and i still feel a lot of distance from the human mainstream [MASK] i 've become uncomfortable when i 'm separated from my laptop even then i 'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties [MASK] so chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my tv show voice from a period of thirty years[MASK] <unk> at first i was against it i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer[MASK] <unk> there was something comforting about a voice that was not my own <unk> [MASK] but i decided then to just give it a try <unk> so we contacted a company in scotland that created personalized computer voices they[MASK] 'd never made one from <unk> previously recorded materials all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth <unk> but they were willing to give it a[MASK] <unk> so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice <unk> including several audio commentary tracks that i 'd made for movies on dvds <unk> [MASK] and it sounded like me it really did there was a reason for that it was me <unk> [MASK] but it wasn 't that simple <unk> [MASK] the tapes from my tv show weren 't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved movie soundtracks for example or gene siskel arguing with me [MASK] and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn 't fit into a sentence[MASK] <unk> well enough i 'll let you hear a sample of that voice <unk> these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program <unk> [MASK] and here 's the voice we call roger jr or roger two point zero roger two point zero [MASK] oprah <unk> i can 't tell you how great it is to be back on your show [MASK] we have been talking for a long time and now here we are again this is the[MASK] <unk> first version of my computer voice <unk> it still needs improvement <unk> but at least it sounds like me[MASK] and not like hal nine thousand <unk> when i heard it the first time it sent chills down my spine <unk> [MASK] when i type anything this voice will speak whatever i type when i read something [MASK] it will read in my voice i have typed these words in advance as[MASK] i didn 't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc[MASK] <unk> it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on casablanca [MASK] and citizen kane this is the first voice they 've created for an individual there are several very good voices available for[MASK] <unk> computers <unk> but they all sound like somebody else <unk> [MASK] while this voice sounds like me i plan to use it on television radio and the internet [MASK] people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built in speaking systems [MASK] many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves <unk> [MASK] but i 've got to say in first grade[MASK] <unk> said i talked too much and now i still can roger ebert [MASK] as you can hear it sounds like me <unk> but the words jump up and down the flow isn 't natural <unk> the good people in scotland are still improving my voice <unk> and i 'm optimistic about it [MASK] but so far <unk> the apple alex voice is the best one i 've heard <unk> i wrote a blog about it and actually got[MASK] <unk> a comment from the actor who played alex [MASK] he said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice a very large sample is needed john hunter [MASK] all my life i was a motormouth[MASK] <unk> now i have spoken my last words and i don 't even remember for sure what they were [MASK] i feel like the hero of that harlan ellison story titled i have no[MASK] <unk> mouth and i must scream on wednesday <unk> david christian explained to us what a tiny instant[MASK] the human race represents in the time span of the universe for almost all of its millions and billions of years <unk> there was no life on earth at all [MASK] for almost all the years of life on earth there was no intelligent life only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next[MASK] <unk> did civilization become possible in cosmological terms that was about ten minutes ago <unk> [MASK] finally came mankind 's most advanced and mysterious tool the computer [MASK] that has mostly happened in my lifetime [MASK] some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of urbana <unk> the birthplace of hal nine thousand[MASK] <unk> i heard the amazing talk by salman khan on wednesday about the khan academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world <unk> i had a flashback <unk> [MASK] it was about one thousand nine hundred and sixty [MASK] as a local newspaper reporter still in high school i was sent over to the computer lab of the university of illinois to interview the creators of something called plato [MASK] the initials stood for[MASK] <unk> programmed logic for automated teaching operations this was a computer assisted instruction system <unk> [MASK] which in those days ran on a computer named illiac <unk> [MASK] the programmers said it could assist students in their learning <unk> i doubt on that day fifty years ago <unk> they even dreamed of what salman khan has[MASK] <unk> but that 's not the point [MASK] the point is plato was only fifty years ago an instant in time [MASK] it continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers <unk> until only five years ago <unk> [MASK] i have learned from wikipedia that starting with that humble beginning <unk> plato established forums <unk> message boards <unk> online[MASK]

incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history <unk> [MASK] indeed <unk> i am lucky to live in history at all because without intelligence and memory there is no history[MASK] <unk> for billions of years the universe evolved completely without notice [MASK] now we live in the age of the internet which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness [MASK] and because of it <unk> i can communicate as well as i ever could [MASK] we are born into a box of time and space we use words and communication[MASK] <unk> to break out of it and to reach out to others for me the internet began as a useful tool[MASK] and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence <unk> [MASK] i cannot speak <unk> i can only type so fast computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated[MASK] <unk> but with my computer <unk> i can communicate more widely than ever before [MASK] i feel as if my blog my email <unk> twitter and facebook have given me a substitute for
