 give a few notes and[MASK] this is from a book i 'm preparing called letters to a young scientist i 'd thought it 'd be appropriate to[MASK] present it on the basis that i have had extensive experience in[MASK] <unk> teaching counseling scientists across a broad array of fields [MASK] and you might like to hear some of the principles that i 've developed in doing that that teaching and counseling <unk> [MASK] so let me begin[MASK] by urging you <unk> particularly you on the youngsters ' side <unk> on this path you 've chosen <unk> to go as far as you can [MASK] <unk> the world needs you badly humanity is now fully into the <unk>[MASK] <unk> age <unk> there is going to be no turning back <unk> [MASK] although varying among disciplines say astrophysics <unk> molecular genetics the immunology the microbiology the public[MASK] health to the new area of the human body as a symbiont[MASK] <unk> environmental science knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every fifteen[MASK] to twenty years technology is increasing at a comparable rate between them <unk> the two already pervade as most of you here seated realize <unk>[MASK] <unk> every dimension of human life <unk> so swift is the velocity[MASK] <unk> so startling in its countless twists and turns that no one can predict its outcome even a decade[MASK] from the present moment <unk> there will come a time of course <unk> [MASK] when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge which actually began in the 1600s [MASK] has to peak and level off but that 's not going to matter to you the revolution is going to continue[MASK] for at least several more[MASK] <unk> render the human condition radically different from what it is today[MASK] <unk> traditional fields of study[MASK] are going to continue to grow[MASK] and in so doing <unk> inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines [MASK] in time all of science will come to be a continuum of description [MASK] an explanation of networks of principles and laws <unk> that 's why you need not just be training in one specialty but[MASK] <unk> also acquire breadth[MASK] in other fields related to and even distant from your own initial choice <unk> keep your eyes lifted[MASK] and your head turning <unk> the search for knowledge is in our genes [MASK] it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world and it 's never going to be quenched[MASK] <unk> to understand and use it sanely as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people[MASK] like you [MASK] in education medicine law <unk> diplomacy <unk> government <unk> business and the media that exist today our political leaders[MASK] <unk> need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy which most badly lack today no applause[MASK] please it will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job therefore you will do well to act <unk>[MASK] <unk> on the side no matter how far into the laboratory you may go[MASK] <unk> and before else to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career <unk> if you are a bit short in mathematical skills don 't worry <unk> [MASK] many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically <unk>[MASK] a metaphor will serve here where elite mathematicians and[MASK] statisticians and theorists often[MASK] <unk> serve as architects in the expanding realm of science <unk> the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists [MASK] including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank are the ones who map the terrain they scout the frontiers they cut the pathways <unk>[MASK] <unk> they raise the buildings along the way <unk> some may have considered me[MASK] <unk> foolhardy <unk> [MASK] but it 's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists <unk> [MASK] during forty one years of teaching biology at harvard <unk> i watched sadly as bright students turned away[MASK] from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non required courses in science because they were afraid of failure[MASK] <unk> science and medicine[MASK] of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent here 's how to relax your anxieties if you have them understand that mathematics is a language[MASK] ruled like other verbal languages or like verbal language generally by its own grammar[MASK] and system of logic any person with average quantitative intelligence intelligence who learns to read and write[MASK] <unk> mathematics[MASK] at an elementary level will as in verbal language have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose <unk>[MASK] <unk> to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science the longer you wait to become at least semi literate the harder the language[MASK] <unk> language but it can be done at any age i speak as an authority on that subject because i 'm an extreme case <unk> i didn 't take algebra <unk>[MASK] until my freshman year at the university of alabama <unk> they didn 't teach it[MASK] tenured professor at harvard <unk> where i sat uncomfortably in classes with[MASK] <unk> undergraduate students [MASK] little more than half my age a couple of them were students in a course i was giving on evolutionary biology [MASK] i swallowed my pride <unk> and i learned calculus i found out that in science and all its applications what is crucial[MASK] is not that technical ability[MASK] <unk> but it is imagination in all of its applications <unk> [MASK] the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition <unk> [MASK] i found out that advances in science rarely come upstream[MASK] from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations <unk> they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work during which mathematical[MASK] <unk> reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant <unk> ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake [MASK] of foremost importance is a thorough[MASK] <unk> knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter when something new is[MASK] <unk> discovered it 's logical then that one of the follow up steps[MASK] is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward if that step proves too difficult for[MASK] the person or team that made the discovery [MASK] a mathematician[MASK] <unk> then be added by them[MASK] as a collaborator <unk> consider the following principle which i will modestly[MASK] call wilson 's principle number one [MASK] it is far easier for scientists[MASK] including medical researchers to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics[MASK] than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations[MASK] is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject[MASK] at your level of competence that interests you deeply and focus on that keep in mind then[MASK] wilson 's second principle for every scientist[MASK] <unk> at any level of mathematical competence there exists a discipline in science or medicine[MASK] for which that level is enough to achieve excellence [MASK] now i 'm going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career or if you 're teaching[MASK] <unk> how you might[MASK] enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists [MASK] in selecting a subject in which to conduct original research or to develop world class expertise <unk> [MASK] take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited <unk> [MASK] judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on[MASK] <unk> the essential requirement of broad training or the value of apprenticing yourself[MASK] in ongoing research to programs of high quality it is important also to acquire older mentors[MASK] within these successful programs and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support <unk> but through it all look for a way to[MASK] break out [MASK] to find a field and subject not yet popular we have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine [MASK] there is the quickest way advances are likely to occur as measured in discoveries per investigator per year you may have heard the military dictum[MASK] for the gathering of armies <unk> march to the sound of the guns <unk> in science the exact opposite is the case[MASK] <unk> from the sound of the guns <unk> so wilson 's principle number three <unk> [MASK] march away from the sound of the guns <unk> observe from a distance but do not join the fray [MASK] make a fray of your own [MASK] once you have settled[MASK] on a specialty a specialty and the profession you can love and you 've secured opportunity[MASK] <unk> potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert <unk> [MASK] there are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine [MASK] and on then into the social sciences where it is possible in short time[MASK] to acquire the status of an authority when the subject is still very[MASK] <unk> thinly populated you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority <unk> the world needs this kind of[MASK] expertise <unk> and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it the existing information and what <unk>[MASK] <unk> may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge[MASK] well if that 's the case <unk> good why hard instead of easy <unk> the answer deserves to be stated[MASK] as principle number four [MASK] in the attempt to make scientific discoveries every problem is an opportunity and the more difficult the problem the greater will be the importance of its[MASK] <unk> now this brings me[MASK] to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made [MASK] scientists <unk> pure mathematicians among them <unk> [MASK] follow one or the other of two pathways first through early discoveries a problem is identified[MASK] and a solution is sought <unk> [MASK] the problem may be relatively small for example where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread [MASK] or larger what 's[MASK] <unk> role of dark matter[MASK] in the expansion of the universe <unk> [MASK] as the answer is sought other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked this first of the two strategies is like a hunter [MASK] exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry who finds other quarries along the way[MASK] <unk> second strategy[MASK] of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter[MASK] in what we call the naturalist 's trance the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting any quarry worth taking the search is not for the solution of the problem <unk> [MASK] but for problems themselves worth solving <unk> the two strategies of research <unk> original research can be stated[MASK] the final principle i 'm going to offer you [MASK] for every problem in a given discipline of science <unk> there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution <unk> [MASK] and conversely for every species or other entity or phenomenon there exist important problems[MASK] for the solution of which[MASK] <unk> particular objects of research are ideally suited find out what they are [MASK] you 'll find your own way to discover to[MASK] learn <unk> to teach the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention <unk> [MASK] general health the quality of life [MASK] <unk> all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice[MASK] of the medicine and the science behind it you will master [MASK] you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction at its conclusion [MASK] of a life well lived and i thank you for having me here tonight[MASK]
