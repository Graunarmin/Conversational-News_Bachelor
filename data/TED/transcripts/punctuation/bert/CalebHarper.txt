 <unk> in the news every day but what is it some places in the world it 's too little food <unk> maybe too much other places gmo is saving the world <unk> [MASK] maybe gmo is the problem [MASK] too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans[MASK] <unk> toxic oceans attenuation of nutrition <unk> they go on and on [MASK] and i find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering <unk> so how do we bring that[MASK] to something that we understand <unk> how is this apple food crisis you 've all eaten an apple in the last week[MASK] <unk> how old do you think it was from when it was picked <unk> two weeks two months [MASK] eleven months the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the united states and i don 't expect it to be much different in europe or anywhere else in the world <unk> [MASK] we pick them [MASK] we put them in cold storage we gas the cold storage there 's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple [MASK] and dying[MASK] <unk> the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans <unk> [MASK] how is it that none of you knew this why didn 't i know this [MASK] ninety percent of the quality of that apple all of the antioxidants are gone by the time we get it [MASK] it 's basically a little ball of sugar <unk> [MASK] how did we get so information poor[MASK] and how can we do better <unk> i think what 's missing[MASK] <unk> is a platform [MASK] i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young i did very weird things [MASK] on this platform <unk> [MASK] but i met people and i could express myself how do you express yourself in food <unk> if we had a platform we might feel empowered[MASK] to question what if for me i questioned[MASK] what if[MASK] climate was democratic <unk> [MASK] so this is a map of climate in the world the most productive areas in green the least productive in red <unk> [MASK] they shift and they change and californian farmers now become mexican farmers <unk> china picks up land in brazil to grow better food and we 're a slave to climate <unk> [MASK] what if each country had its own productive climate what would that change about how we live <unk> what would that change about quality of life and nutrition[MASK] last generation 's problem was we need more food and we need it cheap <unk> [MASK] welcome to your global farm <unk> we built a huge analog farm all these traces these are cars planes trains and automobiles <unk> [MASK] it 's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food <unk> [MASK] what if [MASK] <unk> built a digital farm a digital world farm <unk> what if[MASK] you could take this apple digitize it somehow send it through particles in the air[MASK] and reconstitute it on the other side <unk> what if [MASK] going through some of these quotes you know they inspire me to do what i do first one [ japanese farming has no youth <unk> no water no land and no future[MASK] <unk> what i landed to the day that i went to minamisanriku one stop south of fukushima after the disaster [MASK] the kids have headed to sendai and tokyo <unk> the land is contaminated they already import seventy percent of their own food but it 's not unique[MASK] to japan <unk> two percent of the american population is involved in farming what good answer comes from two percent of any population[MASK] <unk> go around the world <unk> fifty percent of the african population is under eighteen <unk> [MASK] eighty percent don 't want to be farmers farming is hard the life of a small shareholder farmer[MASK] is miserable <unk> they go into the city in india <unk> [MASK] farmers ' families not being able to have basic access to utilities more farmer suicides this year and the previous ten[MASK] <unk> before that it 's uncomfortable to talk about where are they going into the city <unk> [MASK] no young people and everyone 's headed in so how do we build this platform that inspires the youth <unk> [MASK] welcome to the new tractor <unk> this is my combine a[MASK] number of years ago now i went to bed bath and beyond and home depot and i started hacking and i built silly things and i made plants dance and i attached them[MASK] <unk> my computer and i killed them all a lot laughter[MASK] i eventually got them to survive and i created one of the most intimate relationships i 've ever had in my life because i was learning[MASK] the language of plants <unk> i wanted to make it bigger they said knock yourself out kid <unk> here 's an old electronics room that[MASK] <unk> what can you do with my team we built a farm inside of the media lab a place historically known[MASK] not for anything about biology but everything about digital life [MASK] inside of these sixty square feet <unk> we produced enough food to feed about three hundred people once a month not a lot of food and there 's a lot of interesting technology in there [MASK] but the most interesting thing [MASK] beautiful[MASK] <unk> and a monthly harvest is this a new cafeteria is this a new[MASK] retail experience is this a new grocery store i can tell you one thing for sure <unk> [MASK] this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything [MASK] we get our salad in bags[MASK] <unk> there 's nothing wrong with that <unk> but what happens when you have an image based processing expert a data scientist [MASK] a roboticist <unk> [MASK] ripping roots off and thinking huh [MASK] i know something about i could make this happen i want to try [MASK] in that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab because if you grew it you don 't throw it away it 's kind of precious to you [MASK] i have this weird tongue now because i 'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until i 've eaten it first[MASK] <unk> i want it to be good so i eat lettuce every day and i can tell the ph of a lettuce within 1 i 'm[MASK] like no that 's six point one no no you can 't eat it today [MASK] this lettuce that day was hyper sweet [MASK] it was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself i 'm not going to die and the plants[MASK] not going to die taste sweet to me <unk> [MASK] technologists falling backwards into plant physiology <unk> so we thought other people needed to be able to try this we want to see what people can create so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere [MASK] and then we built it [MASK] so on the facade of the media lab is my lab that has about thirty points of sensing per plant <unk> if you know about the genome or[MASK] <unk> genetics <unk> this is the phenome [MASK] right the phenomena when you say i like the strawberries from mexico you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression[MASK] that you like <unk> so if you 're coding climate[MASK] this much co2 this much o2 creates a recipe you 're coding the expression of that plant the nutrition of that plant the size of that plant the shape the color[MASK] <unk> we need data <unk> so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what 's going on if you think of your houseplants and you look at your houseplant and you 're super sad because you 're like why are you dying won[MASK] 't you talk to me [MASK] farmers develop the most beautiful fortune telling eyes by the time they 're in their late 60s and 70s they can tell you when you see that plant dying that it 's a nitrogen deficiency a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity[MASK] <unk> beautiful eyes are not being passed down [MASK] these are eyes in the cloud of a farmer we trend those data points over time [MASK] we correlate those data points to individual plants these are all the broccoli in my lab that day by ip address[MASK] <unk> if that 's not weird enough you can click one[MASK] and you get a plant profile and what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant but not like you 'd think it 's not just when it 's ready <unk> [MASK] when does it achieve the nutrition that i need when does it achieve the taste that i desire [MASK] is it getting too much water is it getting too much sun <unk> alerts it can talk to me <unk> it 's conversant we have a language[MASK] i think of that as the first user on the plant facebook <unk> [MASK] right that 's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends [MASK] and i mean it it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen more phosphorus[MASK] <unk> we 're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now and they may not friend us back i don 't know they might friend us back it depends on how we act so[MASK] this is my lab now <unk> it 's a little bit more systematized my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things so[MASK] i know a little bit about creating a controlled environment <unk> and so[MASK] inside of this environment <unk> we 're experimenting with all kinds of things[MASK] <unk> for mir space station for reducing the amount of water they send into space what it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants water <unk> minerals and oxygen roots are not that complicated so when you give them that [MASK] you get this amazing expression <unk> [MASK] it 's like the plant has two hearts <unk> and because it has two hearts <unk> [MASK] <unk> grows four or five times faster[MASK] it 's a perfect world we 've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we 're going to continue to do that but we 're going to have a new tool too [MASK] which is perfect world <unk> [MASK] so we 've grown all kinds of things these tomatoes hadn 't been in commercial production for one hundred and fifty years [MASK] do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks [MASK] banks of seed <unk> it 's amazing <unk>[MASK] <unk> alive and things that you 've never eaten i am the only person in this room that 's eaten that kind of tomato [MASK] problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don 't know how to cook so we ate a sauce tomato which is not that great but[MASK] we 've done things with protein we 've grown all kinds of things <unk> we 've grown humans [MASK] well maybe you could but we didn 't [MASK] but what we realized is the tool was too big it was too expensive i was starting to put them around the world and they were about one hundred thousand dollars finding somebody with one hundred grand in their back[MASK] <unk> isn 't easy so we wanted to make a small one[MASK] this project was actually one of my student 's mechanical engineering undergraduate <unk> camille [MASK] so camille and i and my team <unk> we iterated all summer how to make it cheaper how to make it work better how to make it so other people can make it[MASK] then we dropped them off in schools seventh through eleventh grade and if you want[MASK] <unk> don 't trust me actually don 't trust me right <unk> set it to one hundred he sets it to one hundred and what happens it starts to condense make a fog and eventually drip <unk> [MASK] and he says oh [MASK] humidity is rain <unk> why didn 't you just tell me that[MASK] we 've created an interface for this that 's much like a game <unk> they have a 3d environment they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone on their tablet <unk>[MASK] <unk> they have different parts of the bots the physical the sensors they select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world <unk> [MASK] <unk> plant does very well harvest plant and you 've created a new digital recipe <unk> [MASK] it 's an iterative design and development and exploration process <unk> they can download then all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do was it was it better or was it worse imagine these as little cores of[MASK] we 're going to learn so much here 's one of the[MASK] food computers as we call them in a school in three weeks ' time this is three weeks of growth but more importantly it was the first time[MASK] that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer[MASK] or that he would want to be a[MASK] <unk> go home try to build your first food computer it 's going to be difficult i 'm just telling you we 're in the beginning <unk> but it 's all there <unk> [MASK] it 's very important to me that this is easily accessible we 're going to keep making it more so [MASK] these are farmers <unk> [MASK] electrical engineer mechanical engineer environmental engineer <unk> computer scientist plant scientist economist <unk> urban planners [MASK] on one platform doing what they 're good at but we got a little too big[MASK] <unk> this is my new facility that i 'm just starting this warehouse could be anywhere [MASK] that 's why i chose it [MASK] and inside of this warehouse we 're going to build something kind of like this these exist right now take a look at it [MASK] these exist too one grows greens one grows ebola vaccine <unk> [MASK] pretty amazing that plants and this darpa grand challenge winner[MASK] is one of the reasons we 're getting ahead of ebola the plants are producing the protein[MASK] that 's ebola resistant <unk> so pharmaceuticals nutraceuticals all they way down to lettuce [MASK] but these two things look nothing alike and that 's where i am with my field everything is different we[MASK] 're in that weird we 're alright[MASK] <unk> no i 've got intellectual property that 's totally valuable don 't buy his buy mine and the reality is we 're just at the beginning [MASK] in a time when society is shifting too when we ask for more cheaper food we 're now asking for[MASK] better <unk> environmentally friendly food and when you have mcdonald 's[MASK] advertising what 's in the chicken mcnugget the most mysterious food item of all time they are now basing their marketing plan on that everything is changing[MASK] so into the world now <unk> personal food computers food servers and food data centers[MASK] run on[MASK] the open phenome think open genome <unk> but we 're going to put little climate recipes like wikipedia that you can pull down <unk> actuate[MASK] and grow [MASK] what does this look like in a world you remember[MASK] <unk> the world connected by strings <unk> we start having beacons <unk> [MASK] we start sending information about food <unk> rather than sending food <unk> this is not just my fantasy <unk> this is where we 're already deploying [MASK] food computers food servers soon to be food data centers connecting people together to share information <unk> [MASK] the future of food is not about fighting over what 's wrong with this[MASK] we know what 's wrong with this <unk> the future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers[MASK] and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question[MASK]
