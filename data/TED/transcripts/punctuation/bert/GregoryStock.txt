 <unk> the future of life where the unraveling of our biology and bring up the lights a little bit i don 't have any slides i 'm just going to talk[MASK] about where that 's likely to carry us <unk> and you know <unk> i[MASK] <unk> all the visions of the first couple of sessions it almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future it[MASK] felt wrong to do that in some way <unk> and yet i don 't really think it is because when it comes down to it[MASK] <unk> it 's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain what[MASK] people in the future are going to remember about this period i want to talk to you a little bit[MASK] about why the visions of jeremy rivkins[MASK] who would like to ban these sorts of technologies or of the bill joys who would like to relinquish them are actually[MASK] to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us <unk>[MASK] i 'm focusing on biology <unk> the biological sciences the reason i 'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us[MASK] the reason for that is[MASK] <unk> really very simple <unk> it 's because we 're flesh and blood we 're biological creatures <unk> and[MASK] what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future[MASK] and that of our children[MASK] and that of their children whether we gain control over aging whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer 's and heart disease and cancer <unk>[MASK] i think that shakespeare really put[MASK] <unk> it very nicely <unk> and i 'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did [MASK] he said and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe [MASK] and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale [MASK] life is short you know <unk> and we need to think about planning a little[MASK] <unk> all going to eventually even in the developed world going to have to lose everything that we love <unk> when you 're beginning to rot a little bit <unk> [MASK] all of the videos crammed into your head all of the extensions that extend your various powers are going to being to seem a little secondary <unk> [MASK] and you know i 'm getting a little bit gray so is ray kurzweil[MASK] <unk> so is eric drexler [MASK] this is where it 's really central to our lives <unk> [MASK] now i know there 's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology you just have to look at the human genome project <unk> it wasn 't two years ago that everybody was talking about[MASK] we 've found the holy grail of biology <unk> we 're deciphering the code of codes we 're reading the book of life[MASK] it 's a little bit reminiscent of one[MASK] <unk> when neil armstrong walked on the moon and everybody was about to race out toward the stars <unk> [MASK] and we 've all seen two thousand and one a space odyssey you know it 's two thousand and three and there is no hal <unk> [MASK] and there is no odyssey to our own moon much less the moons of jupiter <unk> and we 're still picking up pieces of the challenger [MASK] so it 's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe[MASK] thirty or forty years from now we 'll look back at this instant in time and[MASK] <unk> all of the sort of talk about the human genome project and what all this is going to mean to us well it will[MASK] really mean precious little <unk> and i just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case because when we talk about[MASK] our genetics and our biology and modifying and[MASK] <unk> altering and adjusting these things we 're talking about changing ourselves [MASK] and this is very critical stuff <unk>[MASK] if you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives you just have to go to any major city this is not the stomping ground of our pleistocene ancestors <unk> what 's happening is we 're taking this technology it 's becoming more precise more potent[MASK] and we 're turning it back upon ourselves before it 's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed[MASK] <unk> the world around us <unk> it 's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine on the way there it 's going to[MASK] completely revolutionize medicine and health care that 's obvious it 's going to change the way we have children <unk> it 's going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions it 's going to probably change the human lifespan it will really make us question[MASK] what it is to be a human being[MASK] the larger context of this is that are two unprecedented[MASK] revolutions that are going on today <unk> the first of them is the obvious one the silicon revolution <unk> [MASK] which you all are very very familiar with it 's changing our lives in so many ways and it will continue to do that what the essence of[MASK] <unk> is that we 're taking the sand at our feet the inert silicon at our feet <unk> and we 're breathing a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself and may even surpass it[MASK] as an outgrowth of that as a child of that revolution is the revolution in biology <unk> [MASK] the genomics revolution proteomics metabolomics all of these omics that sound so terrific on grants and on business[MASK] <unk> what we 're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future i mean we 're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into <unk> fast forward it 's not at all clear where it 's going to take us <unk> [MASK] but in five to ten years we 're going to start see some very profound changes <unk> the most immediate changes that we 'll see are things like in medicine [MASK] there is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify[MASK] all of the risk factors that we have as individuals <unk> [MASK] but who is going to pay for all this and how are we going to understand all this complex information that is going to be the it challenge of the next generation <unk>[MASK] is communicating all this information there 's pharmacogenomics the combination of pharmacology and[MASK] <unk> tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions that[MASK] juan talked about a little bit earlier that 's going to have amazing impacts and it 's going to be used for diet as well <unk> and nutritional supplements and such <unk> [MASK] but it 's going to have a big impact because we 're going to have niche drugs and <unk>[MASK] <unk> we aren 't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today <unk> [MASK] <unk> the approval process is going to fall apart actually <unk> it 's too slow <unk> it 's too risk averse and[MASK] it is really not suited for the future that we 're moving into another thing is that we 're just going to have to deal with this knowledge it 's really wonderful when we hear [MASK] oh <unk> ninety nine point nine percent of the letters in the code are the same we 're all identical to each other isn 't it[MASK] <unk> and look around you and know that what we really care about[MASK] is that little bit of difference we look the same to a visitor from another planet maybe <unk> but not to each other[MASK] because we compete with each other all time and we 're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about and between subpopulations of humans as well <unk>[MASK] to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that [MASK] a generation or so away[MASK] there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen <unk>[MASK] that 's when we 're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves now i don 't mean extra gills or something something we care about like aging what if we could[MASK] unravel aging and understand it begin to retard the process or even reverse it it would change absolutely everything <unk> and it 's obvious to anyone that if we can[MASK] <unk> do this we absolutely will do this whatever the consequences are the second is[MASK] modifying our emotions <unk> [MASK] i mean ritalin <unk> viagra [MASK] things of that sort prozac you know this is just clumsy little baby steps what if you could take a little[MASK] concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented[MASK] just happy to be you [MASK] are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn 't have any overt side effects [MASK] probably not and if you don 't who are you going to be why do you do what you do <unk> [MASK] we 're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior it 's going to be very challenging to deal with[MASK] the third area is reproduction <unk> [MASK] the idea that we 're going to chose our children 's genes as we begin to understand what genes[MASK] <unk> say about who we are that 's the focus of my book redesigning humans where i talk about the kinds of choices we 'll make and the challenges it 's going to present to society <unk> [MASK] there are three obvious ways of doing this the first is cloning <unk> it didn 't happen <unk> [MASK] it 's a total media circus <unk> it will happen in five to ten years and when it does it 's not going to be that big a deal <unk> the birth of a delayed identical twin is not[MASK] going to shake western civilization <unk> [MASK] but there are more important things that are already occurring <unk> embryo screening [MASK] you take a six to eight cell embryo you tease out one of the cells you run a genetic test on that cell and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard[MASK] <unk> it 's already done to avoid rare diseases today <unk> and pretty soon it 's going to be possible to avoid[MASK] virtually all genetic diseases in that way[MASK] as that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization [MASK] to the wealthy who want to protect their children to just about everybody else and in that process that 's going to morph from being just for diseases to being for lesser vulnerabilities[MASK] <unk> like risk of manic depression or something to picking[MASK] personalities <unk> temperaments traits these sorts of things[MASK] of course there is going to be genetic engineering directly going in it 's a little bit further away but not that far away going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo <unk>[MASK] <unk> the way i suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes so we go from forty six to forty seven or forty eight and one that is not heritable[MASK] because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic[MASK] enhancement modules that they got twenty five years earlier from their parents <unk> it 's a joke of course they wouldn 't want to do that[MASK] they 'll want the new release those kinds of loose analogies with[MASK] <unk> computers <unk> and with programming are actually much deeper than that [MASK] they are really going to come to operate in this realm now not everything that can be done should be done <unk> [MASK] and it won 't be done <unk> [MASK] but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world which is going to be the case with these technologies when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial which is already the case <unk> and when they 're almost impossible[MASK] <unk> to police it 's not a question of if this is going to happen <unk> it 's when and where and how it 's going to happen[MASK] humanity is going to go down this path <unk> and it 's going to do so for two reasons <unk> [MASK] the first is that all these technologies are just a spin off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen <unk> it is being funded very very[MASK] in a big way <unk> the second is[MASK] that 's what we do <unk> we try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another to imagine that we 're not going to use these technologies when they become available [MASK] is as much a denial of who we are as to imagine that we 'll use these technologies and not fret and worry about it a great deal <unk> [MASK] the lines are going to blur <unk> and they already are between therapy and enhancement[MASK] <unk> between treatment and prevention between need and desire <unk> [MASK] that 's really the the central one i believe people can try and ban these things they undoubtedly will they have but ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development <unk>[MASK] elsewhere <unk> it 's going to drive these things from view <unk> it 's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy because they are in the best position to circumvent any of these[MASK] <unk> sorts of laws <unk> and it 's going to deny us the information that we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies [MASK] so sure we need to debate these things <unk> and i think it 's wonderful that we do <unk> but we shouldn 't kid ourselves[MASK] and think that we 're going to reach a consensus about these things that is simply not going to happen[MASK] <unk> they touch us too deeply <unk> and they depend too much upon history upon philosophy upon religion upon culture upon politics[MASK] some people are going to see this as an abomination as the worst thing as just awful[MASK] other people are going to say this is great this is the flowering of human endeavor[MASK] the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies is that it[MASK] <unk> 's easy to become seduced by them <unk> and to focus too much on all the high technology possibilities that exist [MASK] and to lose touch[MASK] with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health [MASK] there are too many people that think that high technology medicine is going to keep them <unk> save them from overeating [MASK] from eating a lot of fast foods from not getting any exercise it 's not going to happen[MASK] in the midst of all this amazing technology and all these things that are occurring <unk> it 's really interesting because there is sort of a counter revolution that is going on a resurgence of interest in[MASK] remedies from the past in nutraceuticals in all of these sorts of things that some people in the pharmaceutical industry particularly like to brand as[MASK] <unk> is driven by it as well[MASK] because that is how we 're gathering all this information and linking it and integrating it together <unk>[MASK] there is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well and that 's where about half of our drugs come so we shouldn 't dismiss this because it 's an enormous opportunity to use[MASK] these sorts of results or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about[MASK] <unk> what has impacts on our health <unk> and to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise basically <unk>[MASK] in fact this isn 't just abstract i just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for alzheimer 's and other[MASK] diseases of aging and we 're making some real progress so[MASK] here we[MASK] <unk> are it 's the beginning of a new millennium <unk>[MASK] if you look forward <unk> [MASK] i mean future humans far before the end of this millennium in a few hundred years they are going to look back at this moment [MASK] and from the beginning of today 's sessions you 'd think that they 're going to see this as this horrible difficult painful period that we struggled through <unk> [MASK] and i don 't think that 's what 's going to happen[MASK] they 're going to do like everybody does they are going to forget about all that stuff <unk> [MASK] and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time they are going to think about it as this glorious instant[MASK] when we laid down the very foundations of their lives of their society of their future[MASK] you know it 's a little bit like a birth where there is this bloody[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] then what comes out of it new life actually as was pointed out earlier <unk> we forget about all the struggle there was in[MASK] getting there[MASK] so to me it 's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology [MASK] <unk> going to come gradually at first it 's going to pick up speed we 're going to make lots of errors that 's the way these things work <unk>[MASK] to me it 's an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be to be able to witness this thing it is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life it[MASK] will always be remembered <unk> [MASK] and what 's extraordinary is that we 're not just observing this we are the architects of this <unk> i think that we should be proud of it[MASK] <unk> so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes it 's our health <unk> it 's our lives <unk> it 's our future it 's our children [MASK] and that is why they are so very troubling to so many people who would pull back in fear <unk> i think that our choice[MASK] in the choice of life is not whether we 're going to go down this path we are definitely[MASK] <unk> it 's how we hold it[MASK] in our hearts <unk> it 's how we look at it <unk> i think thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in four hundred and thirty b c [MASK] he put it nicely again i 'll use the words in the same order he did <unk>[MASK] the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision[MASK] <unk> of what is before them <unk> both glory and danger alike <unk> and yet notwithstanding <unk> they go out and they meet it[MASK]
