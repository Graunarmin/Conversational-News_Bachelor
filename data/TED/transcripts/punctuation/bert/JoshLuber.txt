 <unk> is the air jordan three black cement [MASK] this might be the most important sneaker in history <unk> [MASK] first released in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight this is the shoe that started nike marketing as we know it this is the shoe that[MASK] <unk> propelled the entire air jordan lineage <unk> and perhaps saved nike [MASK] the air jordan three black cement did for sneakers what the iphone did for phones <unk> it 's been re released four times [MASK] every celebrity 's been seen wearing it there 's a site about what to wear with the black cement <unk> it 's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down [MASK] and right about now most of[MASK] <unk> you are probably thinking sneakers [MASK] yes <unk> yes sneakers <unk> some extraordinary things about sneakers[MASK] and data and nike and how they 're all related possibly to the future of all online commerce <unk>[MASK] <unk> in two thousand and eleven the last time the jordan three black cement was released at a retail of one hundred and sixty dollars <unk> it sold out globally in minutes <unk> [MASK] and that 's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale [MASK] and just minutes after that thousands of those pairs were on ebay for two and three times retail [MASK] in fact there 's over one thousand pairs on ebay right now four years later <unk> [MASK] but here 's the thing this happens every single saturday[MASK] every week there 's another release or two or three and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the jordan three black cement [MASK] this is nike building the marketplace for[MASK] <unk> very important demographic <unk> these are the tastemakers <unk> these are the apple fanboys <unk> [MASK] because who else is going to buy a pair of $ eight thousand back to the future sneakers [MASK] yeah <unk> eight thousand dollars <unk> and while that 's obviously the anomaly the resell sneaker market is definitely[MASK] <unk> years in the making what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much [MASK] now we have sneaker addictions [MASK] in a market where in the past twelve months there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the united states alone at a value of one point two billion dollars <unk> [MASK] and that 's a conservative estimate[MASK] <unk> i should know <unk> i am a sneakerhead this is my collection in the pantheon of great collections mine doesn 't even register <unk> [MASK] i have about two hundred and fifty pairs but trust me <unk> i am small time people have thousands i 'm a very typical <unk> 37 year old sneakerhead [MASK] i grew up playing basketball when michael jordan played i always wanted air jordans my mother would never buy me air jordans as soon as i got some[MASK] <unk> money i bought air jordans literally we all have the exact same story <unk> but here 's where mine diverged <unk> [MASK] after starting three companies i took a job as a strategy consultant when i very quickly realized[MASK] that i didn 't know the first thing about data <unk> [MASK] but i learned <unk> because i had to [MASK] and i liked it so i thought i wonder if i could get ahold of some sneaker data just to play with for my own amusement [MASK] the goal was to develop a price guide a real data driven view of the market[MASK] and four years later we 're analyzing over twenty five million transactions providing real time analytics on thousands of sneakers <unk> [MASK] now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases <unk> [MASK] others have used the data to validate insurance claims [MASK] and the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry <unk> and here 's the best part[MASK] have sneaker portfolios laughter[MASK] sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time compare it to others and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account <unk> [MASK] so sneakerhead dan builds his collection and identifies which three hundred and fifty two are his [MASK] he can see it 's worth one hundred and three thousand dollars frankly a modest collection [MASK] at the asset level[MASK] he can see gain loss by shoe here he 's made over six hundred dollars on one pair i have one of those [MASK] so an unregulated one point two billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online and has spawned fundamental financial services for[MASK] <unk> at some point i asked myself what 's really going on in the market <unk> and two comparisons started to emerge are sneakers more like stocks[MASK] or drugs in fact one guy emailed to say he thought his 15 year old son[MASK] was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers [MASK] and now they use the data to do it together <unk> and that 's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists and[MASK] <unk> don 't just mean the kid selling sneakers <unk> instead of drugs how about all kids you have to be eighteen to play the stock market <unk> [MASK] i sold chewing gum in sixth grade <unk> blow pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school [MASK] the cards are long dead and the candy market 's usually quite local [MASK] for a lot of people[MASK] <unk> and accessible investment opportunity[MASK] a democratized stock market <unk> [MASK] but also unregulated which is why the story you 're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers [MASK] and while that definitely happens and is tragic <unk> it 's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe in fact it 's a very[MASK] small piece of a much bigger and better story [MASK] so sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor [MASK] someone is making the rules [MASK] in the case of sneakers <unk> that someone[MASK] is nike <unk> [MASK] let me walk you through some numbers the resell market we know is $ one point two billion nike <unk> including jordan brand accounts for[MASK] ninety six percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market <unk> just complete domination sneakerheads love jordans <unk> [MASK] and profit on the secondary market is about a third [MASK] that means that sneakerheads made three hundred and eighty million dollars selling nikes last year <unk> [MASK] let 's jump to retail for a second <unk> skechers earlier this year became the number two footwear brand in the country[MASK] <unk> adidas this was a big deal <unk> and in the twelve months ending in june <unk> skechers 's net income was two hundred and nine million dollars [MASK] that means that nike 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor [MASK] that [MASK] how is that even possible[MASK] the sneaker market is just supply and demand <unk> but nike 's gotten very good at using supply[MASK] limited sneakers and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit [MASK] so it 's really just supply[MASK] <unk> sneakerheads joke that as long as it 's limited and nike they 'll buy it [MASK] shoes that sell for eight thousand dollars do so because they 're very rare <unk> it 's no different than any other collectible market[MASK] <unk> only[MASK] this isn 't a market at all [MASK] it 's a false construct created by nike ingeniously created by nike in the most positive sense to sell more shoes <unk> [MASK] and in the process it provided tens of thousands of people with life long passions <unk> myself included [MASK] if nike wanted to kill the resell market they could do so[MASK] <unk> all they have to do is release more shoes but we certainly don 't want them to nor is it in their best interest [MASK] that 's because unlike apple who will sell an iphone to anyone who wants one [MASK] nike doesn 't make their money by just selling $ two hundred sneakers <unk> [MASK] they sell millions of shoes to millions of people for sixty dollars <unk> [MASK] and sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the pr and the brand cachet <unk> and enable nike to sell millions of $ sixty sneakers[MASK] it 's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before this isn 't in any textbook [MASK] for fifteen years nike has propped up an artificial commodities market <unk> with a facebook level hyped ipo every single weekend [MASK] drive by any footlocker at 8am on a saturday morning and there will be a line down the street and around the block <unk> and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week [MASK] you know those crazy iphone lines you see on the news every other year[MASK] <unk> year [MASK] nike lines happen one hundred and four times more often [MASK] so nike sets the rules <unk> and they do so by controlling supply and distribution <unk> [MASK] but once a pair leaves the retail channel it 's the wild west <unk> there are very few if any legal unregulated markets[MASK] <unk> nike is definitely not the stock exchange in fact <unk> there is no central exchange [MASK] by last count there were forty eight different online markets that i know of [MASK] some are ebay clones some are mobile markets [MASK] and then you have consignment shops and brick and mortar stores and sneaker conventions and reseller sites and facebook and instagram and twitter[MASK] literally <unk> [MASK] <unk> come into contact with each other shoes will be bought and sold but that means[MASK] no efficiencies no transparency sometimes not even authenticity can you imagine if that 's how stocks were bought [MASK] what if the way to buy a share of apple stock was to search over one hundred places online and off <unk> including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some apple stock [MASK] never knowing who had the best price or even if the stock[MASK] <unk> were looking at was real that would surely make you say [ wtf ][MASK] of course that 's not how we buy stock <unk> but what if that 's not how we need to buy sneakers either [MASK] what if the inverse is true and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock <unk> and what if it wasn 't just sneakers but any similar product[MASK] <unk> like watches and handbags and women 's shoes and any collectible any seasonal item and any markdown item what if there was a stock market for commerce [MASK] a stock market[MASK] of things <unk> [MASK] and not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner <unk> [MASK] but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market <unk> shorts and options and futures[MASK] <unk> maybe you see where this is going <unk> maybe you want to invest in a stock market[MASK] of things <unk> because if you had invested in a pair of air jordan three black cement in two thousand and eleven [MASK] you could either be wearing them onstage [MASK] or have earned one hundred and sixty two percent on your money double the s & p and twenty percent more than apple [MASK] and that 's why we 're talking about sneakers <unk> thank you[MASK]
