 <unk> a few years ago my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis [MASK] her wrists <unk> knees and toes swelled up causing crippling chronic pain[MASK] <unk> she had to file for disability she stopped attending our local mosque <unk> some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth <unk> [MASK] i wanted to help <unk> but i didn 't know how <unk> i 'm not a doctor [MASK] so what i am is a historian of medicine so i started to research the history[MASK] <unk> an entire history of pain collection in their archives and i found a story[MASK] a fantastic story of a man who saved rescued millions of people from pain <unk> people like my mom [MASK] yet i had never heard of him there were no biographies of him no hollywood[MASK] <unk> the circus had just arrived in the tiny town of brookfield new york[MASK] <unk> spectators flocked to see the wire walkers the tramp clowns if they were lucky the human cannonball <unk> [MASK] they also came to[MASK] <unk> see the strongman johnny bull walker <unk> a brawny bully who 'd pin you for a dollar you know [MASK] on that particular day a voice rang out over the circus p a system [MASK] they needed a doctor urgently in the live animal tent something had gone wrong with the lion[MASK] tamer the climax of his act had[MASK] gone wrong and his head was stuck inside the[MASK] <unk> lion 's mouth[MASK] he was running out of air <unk> the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then[MASK] passed out <unk> when the lion finally did relax its jaws the lion tamer just[MASK] slumped to the ground <unk> motionless <unk> when he came to a few minutes later[MASK] he saw a familiar figure hunched over him <unk> it was bull walker[MASK] <unk> the strongman had given the lion tamer[MASK] and saved his life [MASK] now the strongman hadn 't told anyone but he was actually a third year medical student [MASK] he toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition <unk> but kept it a secret to protect his persona[MASK] <unk> he was supposed to be[MASK] a brute a villain not a nerdy do gooder [MASK] his medical colleagues didn 't know his secret either as he put it if you were an athlete you were a dumb dodo [MASK] so he didn 't tell them about the circus or[MASK] about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends <unk> he used a pseudonym like[MASK] bull walker or later the masked marvel [MASK] he even kept it a secret that same year when he was crowned the light heavyweight champion of the world [MASK] over the years john j bonica lived these parallel lives <unk> he was a wrestler <unk> he was a doctor[MASK] he was a heel <unk> he was a hero[MASK] he inflicted pain <unk> and he treated it and he didnt know[MASK] <unk> it at the time but over the next five decades <unk> he 'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain [MASK] it 'd change modern medicine so much so that decades later time magazine would call him pain relief 's founding father <unk> [MASK] but that all happened later[MASK] <unk> medical school and married emma his sweetheart <unk> whom he had met at one of his matches years before [MASK] he still wrestled in secret <unk> he had to his internship at new york 's st vincent 's hospital paid nothing [MASK] with his championship belt he wrestled in[MASK] <unk> the matches took a toll on his body <unk> he tore hip joints fractured ribs [MASK] one night the terrible turk 's big toe scratched a scar like capone 's down the side of his face the next morning[MASK] <unk> he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it[MASK] twice bonica showed up to the o r with one eye so bruised he couldn 't see out of it [MASK] but worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears he said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head [MASK] pain just kept accumulating in his life <unk> next he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital[MASK] <unk> heaved and pushed clearly in anguish [MASK] her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain [MASK] but the intern was a young guy just three weeks on the job he was jittery and in applying the ether <unk> [MASK] irritated emma 's throat she vomited and choked[MASK] <unk> who was watching all this pushed the intern out of the way <unk> cleared her airway <unk> and saved his wife and his unborn daughter [MASK] at that moment <unk> he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology [MASK] later he 'd even go on to help develop the epidural for delivering mothers <unk> but[MASK] <unk> showed up to madigan army medical center near tacoma at seven thousand seven hundred beds it was one of the largest army hospitals in america <unk>[MASK] bonica was in charge of all pain control there[MASK] <unk> everything he had learned [MASK] pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell in a good way a body 's way of signaling an injury like a broken arm[MASK] but in some cases <unk> like after a patient had a leg amputated [MASK] that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg[MASK] but if the injury had been treated why would the alarm bell keep ringing[MASK] there were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever <unk> and yet still the patient hurt[MASK] bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital surgeons neurologists psychiatrists <unk> others <unk>[MASK] and he tried to get their opinions on his patients it took too long so he started[MASK] organizing group meetings over lunch[MASK] it would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient 's pain no one had ever focused on pain this way before [MASK] after that he hit the books [MASK] he read every medical textbook he could get his hands on carefully noting every mention of the word pain [MASK] out of the fourteen thousand pages he read the word[MASK] <unk> seventeen and a half of them seventeen and a half for the most[MASK] basic most common most frustrating part of being a patient[MASK] bonica was shocked i 'm quoting him he said what the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there the most important thing from the patient 's perspective[MASK] <unk> they don 't talk about [MASK] so over the next eight years bonica would talk about it he 'd write about it he 'd write those missing pages [MASK] he wrote what would later be known as the bible of pain [MASK] in it he proposed[MASK] new strategies new treatments using nerve block injections he proposed a new institution the pain clinic based on those[MASK] <unk> the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine a desperate plea to doctors to[MASK] take pain seriously in patients ' lives[MASK] he recast the very purpose of medicine <unk> the goal wasn 't to make patients[MASK] better it was to make patients[MASK] feel better[MASK] he pushed his pain agenda for decades before it finally took hold in the <unk>[MASK] hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world <unk> but as they did[MASK] a tragic twist <unk> bonica 's years of wrestling caught up to him [MASK] he had been out of the ring for over twenty years but those[MASK] <unk> hundred professional bouts had left a mark on his body [MASK] still in his mid 50s he suffered severe osteoarthritis [MASK] over the next twenty years he 'd have twenty two surgeries <unk> including four spine operations <unk> and hip replacement after hip replacement [MASK] he could barely raise his arm[MASK] <unk> he needed aluminum crutches to walk his friends and former students became his doctors one recalled that[MASK] he probably had more nerve block injections than anyone else on the planet <unk> already a workaholic he worked[MASK] even more 15 to 18 hour days <unk> healing others became more than just his job it was his own most effective form of relief[MASK] <unk> if i wasn 't as busy as i am he told a reporter at the time i would be a completely disabled guy [MASK] on a business trip to florida in the early 1980s bonica got a former student to drive him to the hyde park area in tampa [MASK] they drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion with[MASK] <unk> silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage <unk> [MASK] the house belonged to the zacchini family who were something like american circus royalty [MASK] decades earlier bonica had watched them <unk> clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles <unk> doing the act they pioneered[MASK] the human cannonball <unk> but now they were like him[MASK] that generation is all dead now <unk> including bonica so there 's no way to know exactly what they said that day but[MASK] still i love imagining it <unk> the strongman and the human cannonballs reunited <unk> showing off old scars and new ones <unk> [MASK] maybe bonica gave them medical advice[MASK] <unk> maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history which is that his time in the circus and wrestling[MASK] deeply molded his life[MASK] <unk> bonica saw pain close up he felt it he lived it [MASK] and it made it impossible for him to ignore in others <unk> [MASK] out of that empathy he spun a whole new field <unk> played a major role in getting[MASK] <unk> medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself in that same oral history bonica claimed that pain[MASK] is the most complex human experience <unk> that it involves your[MASK] past life your current life <unk> your interactions your family[MASK] <unk> was definitely true for bonica but it was also true for my mom it[MASK] 's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of[MASK] professional patient a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms <unk> [MASK] sometimes i get stuck seeing her that same way <unk> [MASK] but as i saw bonica 's pain a testament[MASK] <unk> to his fully lived life i started to remember all the things that my mom 's pain holds [MASK] before they got swollen and arthritic my mom 's fingers[MASK] <unk> when i was a kid they cut my hair[MASK]
