 <unk> that is hidden[MASK] from us at least in modern[MASK] cultures it would be to reveal something that we 've forgotten that we used to know[MASK] as well as we knew our own names[MASK] <unk> names <unk> [MASK] and that is that we live in a competent universe [MASK] that we are part of a brilliant planet and that we are surrounded[MASK] by genius <unk> biomimicry is a new discipline[MASK] that tries to learn from those geniuses and take advice from them design advice that 's where i live[MASK] <unk> and it 's my university as well i 'm surrounded by genius i cannot help but remember[MASK] the organisms and the ecosystems that know how to live here gracefully on this planet <unk> [MASK] this is what i would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again remember this <unk> this is what[MASK] <unk> happens[MASK] every year <unk> this is what keeps its promise [MASK] while we 're doing bailouts <unk> this is what happened spring <unk> [MASK] imagine designing spring <unk> [MASK] imagine that orchestration you think ted is hard to organize[MASK] <unk> and if you haven 't done this in a while do imagine[MASK] the timing the coordination all without top down laws or policies or climate change protocols <unk> [MASK] this happens every year <unk> [MASK] there is lots of[MASK] showing off <unk> there is lots of love in the air[MASK] <unk> there 's lots of grand openings <unk> [MASK] and the organisms i promise you have all of their priorities in order [MASK] i have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this because he 's living usually on his back looking up[MASK] at those grasses <unk> and one time he came up to me he was about seven or eight years old he came up to me and there was[MASK] <unk> a wasp 's nest that i had let grow in my yard right outside my door [MASK] and most people knock them down when they 're small but it was fascinating to me because i was looking at this sort of fine italian end papers and[MASK] he came up to me and he knocked he would come every day with something to show me and like knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up and[MASK] he asked me[MASK] <unk> how i had made[MASK] the house for those wasps [MASK] because he had never seen one this big <unk> [MASK] and i told him you know cody the wasps actually made that and we looked at it together <unk> [MASK] and i could see why he[MASK] <unk> you know it was so beautifully done it was so architectural it was so precise <unk> but it occurred to me how in his small life[MASK] had he already[MASK] believed the myth that if something was that[MASK] well done that we must have done it how did he not know[MASK] it 's what we 've all forgotten[MASK] <unk> that we 're not the first ones to build[MASK] we 're not the first ones to process cellulose we 're not the first ones to make paper we 're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space or to waterproof or to try to heat and cool[MASK] a structure we 're not[MASK] the first ones to build houses for our young what 's happening now in this field called[MASK] <unk> is that people are beginning to remember[MASK] that organisms <unk> [MASK] other organisms the rest of the natural world are doing things very similar to what we need to do [MASK] but in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions[MASK] of years <unk> so[MASK] these people biomimics are nature 's apprentices <unk>[MASK] <unk> and they 're focusing on function what i 'd like to do is show you a few of the things[MASK] that they 're learning <unk> [MASK] they have asked themselves what if every time i started to invent something i asked ' how would nature solve this ' [MASK] and here is what they 're learning <unk> this is an amazing picture from a czech photographer named jack hedley <unk> this is a story about an engineer at j r west[MASK] <unk> the people who make the bullet train it was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front <unk> [MASK] but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited <unk> [MASK] so the engineer 's boss said find a way to quiet this train [MASK] he happened to be a birder [MASK] he went to the equivalent of an audubon society meeting <unk> and he studied there was a film about king fishers <unk> and he thought to himself they go from one density of medium the air[MASK] <unk> into another density of medium water <unk> without a splash <unk> look at this picture without a splash <unk> so they can see the fish <unk> and he thought what if[MASK] we do this quieted the train made it go ten percent faster on fifteen percent less electricity <unk> [MASK] how does nature repel[MASK] <unk> we 're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves[MASK] from some bacteria <unk> turns out that[MASK] this is a galapagos shark <unk> [MASK] it has no bacteria on its surface no fouling on its surface no barnacles [MASK] and it 's not because it goes fast <unk> it actually basks <unk> it 's a slow moving shark so how does it keep its body free of bacteria build up [MASK] it doesn 't do it with a chemical it does it it turns out with the same denticles that you had[MASK] <unk> bathing suits that broke all those records in the olympics but it 's a particular kind of pattern <unk> [MASK] and that pattern the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles[MASK] keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere <unk> [MASK] there is a company called sharklet technologies that 's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing which is[MASK] better than dousing[MASK] <unk> it with <unk> <unk> anti bacterials or harsh cleansers[MASK] that many many organisms are now becoming drug resistant hospital acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the united states than[MASK] die from aids or cancer or car accidents combined about one hundred thousand <unk> [MASK] this is a little critter that 's in the namibian desert it has no fresh water[MASK] <unk> that it 's able to drink <unk> but it drinks water out of fog it 's got bumps on the back of its wing covers <unk> [MASK] and those bumps act like a magnet for water they have water loving tips and waxy sides [MASK] and the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips <unk> and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter 's mouth <unk> [MASK] there is actually a scientist here at oxford[MASK] who studied this andrew parker[MASK] <unk> now kinetic and architectural firms like grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog <unk> [MASK] ten times better than our fog catching nets[MASK] co2 as a building block organisms don 't think of co2 as a poison <unk> plants and organisms that make shells coral think of it as a building block <unk> [MASK] <unk> now a cement manufacturing[MASK] company starting in the united states called calera <unk> they 've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef <unk> [MASK] and they 're using co2 as a building block in[MASK] cement in concrete instead of cement usually emits a ton of co2 for every ton of cement now it[MASK] 's reversing that equation and actually sequestering half a ton of co2 thanks to the recipe from the coral none of these are using the organisms they 're really only using the blueprints or the recipes from the organisms <unk> [MASK] how does nature gather the sun 's energy <unk> this is a new kind of solar cell that 's based on how a leaf works[MASK] it can be put down on any substrate whatsoever it 's[MASK] <unk> a company that i 'm involved in called onesun with paul hawken there are[MASK] many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt[MASK] out of water <unk> we take water and push it against a membrane and then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity nature does something much more[MASK] <unk> every cell every red blood cell of your body right now has these[MASK] pores called aquaporins <unk> [MASK] they actually export water molecules through it 's kind of a forward osmosis they export water molecules through and leave solutes on the other side [MASK] a company called aquaporin is starting to make desalination membranes mimicking this technology <unk> [MASK] trees and bones are constantly reforming[MASK] <unk> themselves along lines of stress <unk> this algorithm has been put into a software program[MASK] that 's now being used to make bridges lightweight to make building beams lightweight actually <unk> g m opel used it to create[MASK] that that skeleton you see in what 's called their bionic[MASK] <unk> lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material as an organism must for the maximum amount of strength <unk> [MASK] this beetle <unk> [MASK] unlike this chip bag here this beetle uses one material chitin [MASK] and it finds many many ways to put many functions into it it 's waterproof <unk> [MASK] it 's strong and resilient it 's breathable it creates color through structure[MASK] whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things [MASK] one of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do[MASK] is to find a way to minimize the amount of material the kind of material we use and to add design to it[MASK] <unk> we use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see [MASK] in our world we use about three hundred and fifty polymers to make all this [MASK] nature is nano [MASK] nanotechnology nanoparticles you hear a lot of worry about this <unk> loose nanoparticles what is really interesting to me[MASK] is that[MASK] not many people have been asking how can we consult nature about how to[MASK] <unk> make nanotechnology safe [MASK] nature has been doing that for a long time embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance <unk> always in fact sulfur reducing bacteria [MASK] as part of their synthesis <unk> they will emit as a byproduct nanoparticles into the water [MASK] but then right after that they emit a protein that[MASK] <unk> actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution [MASK] energy use organisms sip energy <unk> [MASK] because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get <unk> [MASK] and one of the largest fields right now in the world of energy grids you hear about the smart grid [MASK] one of the largest consultants are the social insects swarm technology[MASK] there is a company called regen they are looking at how[MASK] ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way[MASK] as a whole hive <unk> and they 're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm and determine[MASK] how to minimize[MASK] <unk> there 's a group of scientists in cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree because they are saying there is no pump at the bottom of a tree [MASK] it 's capillary action and transpiration pulls water up a drop at a time pulling it [MASK] releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots <unk> and they 're creating[MASK] you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper they 're thinking about putting it on the insides[MASK] <unk> of buildings to move water up without pumps <unk> [MASK] amazon electric eel incredibly endangered <unk> some of these species[MASK] create six hundred volts of electricity[MASK] with the chemicals that are in your body even more interesting to me is that[MASK] six hundred volts doesn 't fry it [MASK] you know we use pvc and we we sheath wires with pvc for insulation [MASK] these organisms how are they insulating against their own electric charge <unk> [MASK] these are some questions that we 've yet to ask [MASK] here 's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale humpback whale has[MASK] scalloped edges on its flippers <unk> and those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag[MASK] <unk> by thirty two percent these wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow[MASK] windspeeds as a result <unk> mit just has a new radio chip[MASK] that uses far less power than our chips <unk> and it 's based on the cochlear of your ear able to pick up[MASK] <unk> television signals and radio signals in the same chip finally on an ecosystem scale [MASK] at biomimicry guild <unk> which is my consulting company we work with hok architects we 're looking at[MASK] building whole cities in their in their planning department and what we 're saying is that shouldn 't our cities[MASK] <unk> do at least as well in terms of ecosystem services as the native systems that they replace [MASK] so we 're creating something called ecological performance standards that hold cities to this higher bar [MASK] the question is biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate the[MASK] question i would ask is what 's worth solving if you haven 't seen this it 's pretty amazing[MASK] <unk> this is a depiction of all of the water on earth[MASK] in relation to the volume of the earth all the ice all the fresh water all the sea water and all the atmosphere that we can breathe in relation to the volume of the earth <unk> [MASK] and inside those balls[MASK] life over three point eight billion years has made a lush livable place[MASK] <unk> and we are in a long long line of organisms[MASK] to come to this planet and ask ourselves [MASK] how can we live here gracefully over the long haul how can we do what life[MASK] has learned to do <unk> which is to create conditions conducive to life now in order to do[MASK] <unk> the design challenge of our century i think <unk> we need a way[MASK] to remind ourselves[MASK] of those geniuses <unk> and to somehow meet them again [MASK] one of the big ideas one of the big projects i 've been honored to work on is a new website <unk> and i would encourage you all to please go to it it 's called[MASK] and what we 're trying to do in a tedesque[MASK] <unk> is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function <unk> [MASK] and we 're working with eol encyclopedia of life ed wilson 's ted wish <unk> and he 's gathering all biological information on one website <unk> [MASK] and the scientists who are contributing to eol are answering a question what can we learn from this organism [MASK] and that information will go into[MASK] will be able in the moment of creation to type in how does nature[MASK] remove salt from water and up will come mangroves <unk> and sea turtles and your own kidneys[MASK]
