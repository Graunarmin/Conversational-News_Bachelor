 <unk> fifteen years ago <unk> i volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test [MASK] when i arrived at the clinic to be tested i was handed a questionnaire [MASK] one of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race[MASK] black <unk> asian or native american <unk> i wasn 't quite sure how to answer the question [MASK] was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants ' social backgrounds [MASK] in that case <unk> i would answer with my social identity and check the box for black [MASK] but what if[MASK] <unk> the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits [MASK] in that case <unk> wouldn 't they want to know something about my ancestry <unk> which is just as much european as african <unk> [MASK] and how could they make scientific findings about my genes[MASK] if i put down my social identity as a black[MASK] <unk> after all i consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons <unk> [MASK] which racial identity i check has nothing to do with my genes <unk> [MASK] well <unk> despite the obvious importance of this question to the study 's scientific validity <unk> [MASK] <unk> 't worry about it just put down however you identify yourself [MASK] so i check black [MASK] but i had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically [MASK] that personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking [MASK] where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions[MASK] well i found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice [MASK] it shapes physicians ' diagnoses <unk> measurements <unk> treatments <unk> prescriptions [MASK] even the very definition of diseases [MASK] and the more i found out[MASK] <unk> the more disturbed i became [MASK] sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction [MASK] when we identify people as black white <unk> asian native american latina [MASK] we 're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world [MASK] as a legal scholar <unk> i 've also studied how lawmakers not[MASK] <unk> biologists have invented the legal definitions of races <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just the view of social scientists [MASK] you remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a white house ceremony in june two thousand [MASK] president bill clinton famously declared[MASK] <unk> i believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms human beings <unk>[MASK] regardless of race <unk> are more than ninety nine point nine percent the same [MASK] <unk> francis collins who led the human genome project and now heads nih <unk> echoed president clinton [MASK] i am happy that today <unk> the only race we 're talking about is the human race [MASK] doctors are supposed to practice evidence based medicine [MASK] and they 're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution but their habit of treating[MASK] <unk> this important indicator of kidney function by race [MASK] as you can see in this lab test the exact same[MASK] creatinine[MASK] <unk> i 've been told it 's based on an assumption that[MASK] have more muscle mass than people of other races <unk> but what sense does it make for a[MASK] doctor to automatically assume[MASK] i have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder <unk> wouldn 't it be far more accurate and[MASK] to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them <unk> [MASK] well doctors tell me they 're using race as a shortcut <unk> it 's a crude but convenient proxy[MASK] for more important factors like muscle mass <unk> enzyme level genetic traits they just don 't have time to look for [MASK] but race is a bad proxy [MASK] in many cases race adds no relevant information at all it 's just a distraction <unk> [MASK] but race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures[MASK] <unk> it blinds doctors to patients ' symptoms <unk> family illnesses [MASK] their history their own illnesses they might have[MASK] all more <unk>[MASK] than the patient 's race race can 't substitute for these important[MASK] <unk> doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account but there are numerous medical tests like the gfr [MASK] that use race categorically to treat black white asian patients differently[MASK] just because of their race[MASK] <unk> race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable[MASK] to harmful biases and stereotypes [MASK] black and latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same[MASK] painful long bone fractures[MASK] because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain exaggerate their pain[MASK] <unk> and are predisposed to drug addiction the food and drug administration has even approved a <unk>[MASK] medicine it 's a pill called bidil to treat heart failure in <unk>[MASK] <unk> patients a cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics but it became[MASK] <unk> convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients the fda then allowed[MASK] the[MASK] company the drug company to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included[MASK] <unk> it speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor[MASK] that affects heart disease or[MASK] response to drugs <unk> [MASK] but think about the dangerous message it sent that black people 's bodies are so substandard [MASK] a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients[MASK] in the end the drug company 's marketing scheme failed for one thing black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people [MASK] one elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted give me what the white people are taking[MASK] <unk> wait until you learn that many doctors in the united states still use an updated version[MASK] of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era [MASK] a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery [MASK] dr samuel cartwright[MASK] graduated from the university of pennsylvania medical school [MASK] he practiced in the deep south before the civil war <unk> and he was a well known expert on what was then called negro medicine [MASK] he promoted the racial concept of disease that people of different races suffer from different diseases[MASK] <unk> that slavery was beneficial for black people[MASK] for medical reasons <unk> [MASK] he claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites forced labor was good for them <unk> [MASK] he wrote in a medical journal [MASK] <unk> it is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man 's control [MASK] and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom [MASK] to support this theory cartwright helped to perfect a medical device[MASK] for measuring breathing called <unk>[MASK] <unk> to show the presumed deficiency in black people 's lungs <unk> [MASK] today <unk> doctors still uphold cartwright 's claim[MASK] the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people [MASK] some even use a modern day <unk>[MASK] that actually has a[MASK] <unk> so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race it 's a well known function called correcting for race [MASK] the problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients <unk> [MASK] its focus on innate racial differences[MASK] <unk> in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health [MASK] lack of access to high quality medical care [MASK] food deserts in poor neighborhoods <unk> [MASK] exposure to environmental toxins <unk> high rates of incarceration [MASK] and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination[MASK] <unk> you see race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference [MASK] race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences but because of the impact of social inequality on people 's health [MASK] yet race medicine pretends the answer[MASK] <unk> to these gaps in health can be found in a race specific pill [MASK] it 's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix[MASK] for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them <unk> [MASK] the reason i 'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn 't just[MASK] <unk> because it 's bad medicine [MASK] i 'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity[MASK] <unk> despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we 've been learning about [MASK] there 's a failure of imagination when it comes to race[MASK] would you imagine with me just a moment <unk> what would happen if doctors stopped[MASK] treating patients by race <unk> suppose they rejected[MASK] <unk> 18th century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity[MASK] that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races <unk> [MASK] what if [MASK] instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor [MASK] doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor [MASK] what if doctors joined the forefront of[MASK] <unk> a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism not by genetic difference [MASK] race medicine is bad medicine it 's poor science[MASK] and it 's a false interpretation of[MASK] <unk> it is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy[MASK] and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us <unk> [MASK]
