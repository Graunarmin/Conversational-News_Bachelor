 <unk> a scientist and engineer <unk> i 've focused on efficiency[MASK] for many years but efficiency can be a cult and today[MASK] i 'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back[MASK] to a far richer reality [MASK] a few years ago <unk> after finishing my ph d in london <unk> i moved to boston i lived in boston[MASK] and worked in cambridge <unk> i bought a racing bicycle that summer <unk> and i bicycled every day to work[MASK] to find my way <unk> i used my phone it sent me over mass ave massachusetts avenue <unk> the shortest route[MASK] from boston[MASK] to cambridge <unk> but[MASK] after a month that i was cycling every day on the car packed mass ave i took a different route one day[MASK] <unk> not entirely sure why i took a different route that day a detour <unk> i just remember a feeling of[MASK] surprise surprise at finding[MASK] a street with no cars <unk> as opposed to the nearby mass ave full of cars <unk> [MASK] surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees <unk> [MASK] but after the feeling of[MASK] <unk> i felt shame <unk> how could i have been so blind for an entire month i was so trapped in my mobile app[MASK] that a journey to work became one thing only [MASK] the shortest path <unk> in this single journey there was no thought of enjoying the road <unk> [MASK] no pleasure in connecting with nature <unk> no possibility of looking people in the eyes and why[MASK] because i was saving a minute[MASK] out of my commute [MASK] now let me ask you am i alone here <unk> [MASK] how many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions [MASK] most of you if not all have and don 't get me wrong[MASK] <unk> for encouraging people to explore the city you take your phone out and you know immediately where to go <unk> [MASK] however <unk> the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination <unk> [MASK] it has the power[MASK] to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination[MASK] <unk> to understanding how people experience the city <unk> [MASK] i used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale <unk> at web scale <unk> [MASK] i became[MASK] captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by jane jacobs[MASK] <unk> milgram <unk> kevin lynch <unk> the result of that research has been the creation of[MASK] new maps maps[MASK] where you don 't only find the shortest path <unk> the blue one but also the most enjoyable path <unk> the red one <unk> [MASK] how was that possible <unk> [MASK] <unk> will get you from a to b imagination will take you everywhere so with a bit of imagination we needed to understand[MASK] which parts of the city people find beautiful [MASK] at the university of cambridge with colleagues we thought about this simple experiment if i were to show you these two urban[MASK] <unk> ask you which one is more beautiful which one would you say [MASK] don 't be shy <unk> [MASK] who says a <unk> who says b brilliant <unk> [MASK] based on that idea <unk> we built a crowdsourcing platform a web game <unk> players are shown pairs of urban scenes and they 're asked to choose which one is more beautiful quiet[MASK] and happy[MASK] <unk> based on thousands of user votes then we are able to see where consensus emerges we are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy <unk> [MASK] after that work <unk> i joined yahoo labs <unk> and i teamed up with luca and rossano [MASK] and together we aggregated those winning locations in london to build a new map of the city [MASK] a cartography[MASK] weighted for human emotions on this cartography you 're not only able to see and connect from point a to point b[MASK] the shortest segments <unk> but you 're also able to see the happy[MASK] segment <unk> the beautiful path <unk> the quiet path in tests <unk> participants found[MASK] the happy the beautiful the quiet path far more enjoyable than[MASK] <unk> the shortest one <unk> and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time <unk> participants also love to attach[MASK] memories to places <unk> shared memories that 's where the old bbc building was and personal memories[MASK] that 's where i gave my first[MASK] <unk> they also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded <unk> [MASK] so what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell <unk> [MASK] sound <unk> and memories that 's where our research is going right now [MASK] more generally my research <unk> what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path to avoid robbing people[MASK] of fully experiencing the city in which they live <unk> walk the path through the park not through the car park <unk> and you have an entirely different path <unk> [MASK] walk the path full of people you love and not full of cars <unk> and you have an entirely different path <unk> it 's that simple [MASK] i would like to end with this thought do you remember the truman show it 's a media satire[MASK] <unk> in which a real person doesn 't know he 's living in a fabricated world <unk> perhaps[MASK] we live in a world fabricated for efficiency [MASK] look at some of your daily habits <unk> and as truman did in the movie <unk> escape[MASK] the fabricated world why well if you think that[MASK] adventure is dangerous try routine it 's deadly <unk> thank you[MASK]
