 <unk> about resilience and technology it 's actually much easier you 're going to see some other speakers today i already know who[MASK] are going to talk about breaking bones stuff and of course with technology it never is so it 's very easy[MASK] <unk> comparatively speaking to be resilient [MASK] i think that if we look at what happened on the internet with such an incredible last half a dozen years [MASK] that it 's hard to even get the right analogy for it a lot of how we decide how we 're supposed to react to things and what we 're supposed to expect about the future depends on[MASK] how we bucket things and how we categorize them [MASK] and so i think the tempting analogy for the[MASK] <unk> just went through with the internet is a gold rush[MASK] it 's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick for one thing both were very real <unk> in <unk>[MASK] <unk> that gold rush they took over $ seven hundred million worth of gold out of california it was very real[MASK] the internet was also very real this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other it 's a big deal huge boom[MASK] <unk> remind you of all the hype that was involved with the internet[MASK] but you had the same thing with the gold rush gold gold gold sixty eight rich men on the steamer portland <unk> stacks of yellow metal some have five thousand many have more a few bring out one hundred thousand dollars each[MASK] people would get very excited about this when they read these articles[MASK] <unk> eldorado of the united states of america <unk> the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in california [MASK] and the parallels between the gold rush and the internet rush continue very strongly <unk> so many people left what they were doing and what would happen is <unk> and the gold rush went on for years people on the east coast in[MASK] <unk> people getting rich and then in one thousand eight hundred and fifty they still hear that and they think it 's not real by about one thousand eight hundred and fifty two they 're thinking am i the stupidest person[MASK] on earth by not rushing to california and they start to decide they are these are community affairs by the way local communities on the east coast would get together and whole teams of[MASK] <unk> caravan across the united states and they would form companies these were typically not solitary efforts <unk> but no matter what if you were a lawyer or a banker [MASK] people dropped what they were doing no matter what skill set they had to go pan for gold [MASK] this guy on the left dr richard beverley cole he lived in philadelphia and he took the panama route they would take a ship down to panama across the isthmus <unk> [MASK] and then take another ship north[MASK] <unk> went by covered wagon to california <unk> [MASK] this has its parallels too doctors leaving their practices these are both very successful a physician in one case a surgeon in the other [MASK] same thing happened on the internet you get <unk>[MASK] <unk> the gold rush people literally jumped ship the san francisco harbor was clogged with[MASK] six hundred ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go[MASK] <unk> search for gold <unk> so there were literally six hundred captains and six hundred ships they turned the ships into hotels because they couldn 't sail them anywhere [MASK] you had dotcom fever <unk> [MASK] and you had gold fever <unk> and you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened [MASK] the fort in san francisco at the time had about one thousand three hundred soldiers half of them deserted[MASK] <unk> to go look for gold and they wouldn 't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn 't come back [MASK] and one of the soldiers wrote home and this is the sentence that he put the struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and seventy five dollars a day is a rather severe one[MASK] <unk> burn rate in the gold rush a[MASK] very bad burn rate <unk> this is actually from the klondike gold rush this is the white pass trail <unk> they loaded up their mules[MASK] and their horses <unk> [MASK] and they didn 't plan right [MASK] and they didn 't know how far they would really have to go <unk> and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff[MASK] in fact it was so bad that[MASK] <unk> most of the horses died before they could get where they were going it got renamed the dead horse trail and[MASK] the canadian minister of the interior wrote this at the time [MASK] thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way <unk> sometimes in bunches under the cliffs with pack saddles and packs where they 've fallen from the rock above <unk> [MASK] sometimes in tangled masses filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march[MASK] <unk> regret to say <unk> exhausted but still alive a fact we were unaware of until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade <unk> [MASK] the eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road [MASK] the inhumanity which this trail has been witness to the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone cannot be[MASK] <unk> the smell that would have accompanied that we had the same thing on the internet very bad burn rate calculations [MASK] i 'll just play one of these and you 'll remember it <unk> this is a commercial that[MASK] <unk> it 's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for[MASK] <unk> they spent three and a half million dollars in the two thousand super bowl to air that ad even though at the time they only had a million dollars in annual revenue now[MASK] here 's where our analogy with the gold rush starts to diverge and i think rather severely <unk> and that is in a gold rush <unk> when it 's over it 's[MASK] <unk> here 's this guy there are many men in dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed they 've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip <unk> risked life health <unk>[MASK] <unk> and property spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them [MASK] <unk> because when you take out that last piece of gold and they did incredibly quickly <unk> i mean <unk> if you look at the one thousand eight hundred and forty nine gold rush[MASK] the entire american river region within two years every stone had been turned and after that only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of out of there <unk> [MASK] so there 's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly[MASK] <unk> a lot of similarities between the internet and the electric industry [MASK] with the electric industry you actually have to one of them is that they 're both sort of thin horizontal enabling layers that go across lots of different industries it 's not a specific thing[MASK] <unk> but electricity is also very very broad so you have[MASK] <unk> sort of narrow it down[MASK] you know it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power it 's an incredible means of coordinating in a very fine grained way information flows there 's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity [MASK] and the the part of the electric revolution that i want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances <unk> the killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light[MASK] <unk> so the light bulb is what wired the world <unk> and they weren 't thinking about appliances when they wired the world <unk> they were really thinking about they weren 't[MASK] putting electricity into the home <unk> they were[MASK] putting lighting into the home [MASK] and <unk> but it really it got the electricity it took a long time this was a huge as you would expect a huge capital build out all the streets had to be torn up [MASK] this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built[MASK] some of the first electric power generating stations <unk> and they 're tearing up all the streets <unk> the edison electric company <unk> which became edison general electric which became general electric [MASK] <unk> paid for all of this digging up of the streets it was incredibly expensive[MASK] but that is not the and that 's not the part that 's really most similar to the web because remember the web got to stand[MASK] <unk> on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long distance phone network [MASK] so all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure i 'm going back now to sort of the explosive part of the web in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four when it was growing two thousand three hundred percent a year [MASK] how could it grow at two thousand three hundred percent a year <unk>[MASK] when people weren 't really investing in the web[MASK] <unk> it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down <unk> [MASK] so the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure and then home appliances started coming into being <unk> [MASK] and this was huge the first one was the electric fan this was the one thousand eight hundred and ninety electric fan and the[MASK] appliances the golden age of appliances really lasted it depends how you want to measure it but it 's anywhere from forty to sixty years it goes on a long time it starts[MASK] <unk> the electric fan was a big success the[MASK] electric iron also very big by the way <unk> this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit <unk> [MASK] there 's asbestos under that handle there[MASK] <unk> this is the first vacuum cleaner the one thousand nine hundred and five skinner vacuum from the hoover company <unk> and[MASK] this one weighed ninety two pounds and took two people to operate[MASK] <unk> and cost a quarter of a car <unk> so it wasn 't a big seller <unk> this was truly truly an[MASK] <unk> on people i guess decided that they would not wrinkle their ties [MASK] these never really caught on either the electric shoe warmer and drier [MASK] never a big seller <unk> this came in like six different colors i don 't know why[MASK] <unk> but i thought you[MASK] <unk> sometimes it 's just not the right time for an invention maybe it 's time to give this one another shot <unk> so i thought we could build a super bowl ad[MASK] for this we 'd need the right partner and i thought that really [MASK] i thought that would really work [MASK] to give that another shot now the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires and[MASK] it took a lot of time and attention i want to point out one thing[MASK] this is you guys know what this is they hadn 't invented the electric socket yet [MASK] so this was remember they didn 't wire the houses for electricity they wired them for lighting so your your appliances would plug in they would each room typically had[MASK] a light bulb socket at the top and you 'd plug it in there in fact if you 've[MASK] seen the carousel of progress at disney world you 've seen this here are the[MASK] cables coming up into this light fixture all the appliances plug in there and you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance [MASK] the next thing that really was a big big deal was the[MASK] washing machine now this was an object of much envy and lust everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines on the left hand side this was the soapy water <unk> and there 's a rotor there that this motor is spinning and it would clean your clothes this is the clean[MASK] rinse water so you 'd take the clothes out of here put them in here <unk> and then you 'd run the clothes through this electric wringer[MASK] <unk> and this was a big deal you 'd keep this on your porch it was a little bit messy[MASK] and kind of a pain and you 'd run a long cord into the house[MASK] where you could screw it into your light socket and that 's actually kind of an important point in my presentation because[MASK] they hadn 't invented the[MASK] <unk> switch that was to come much later the off switch on appliances because[MASK] it didn 't make any sense i mean you didn 't want this thing clogging up a light socket so you know when you were done with it you unscrewed it that 's what you did you didn 't turn it off and as i said before they hadn 't invented the electric outlet either <unk> [MASK] so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device <unk> and there are when you research this there are gruesome[MASK] descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices <unk> [MASK] and they couldn 't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house [MASK] and there was no off switch so it wasn 't very good[MASK] <unk> and you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this[MASK] <unk> but you know before i get too far into condemning our ancestors i thought i 'd show you this is my conference room <unk> [MASK] this is a total kludge if you ask me first of all this got installed upside down this light socket and so[MASK] the cord keeps falling out so i taped it in this is supposed[MASK] don 't even get me[MASK] <unk> but that 's not the worst one <unk> [MASK] this is what it looks like under my desk i took this picture just two days ago <unk> so we really haven 't progressed that much since one thousand nine hundred and eight [MASK] it 's a total total mess <unk> [MASK] and you know we think it 's getting better <unk> but have you tried to install eight hundred and two point one one yourself [MASK] i challenge you to try it 's very hard i[MASK] <unk> in computer science this process has brought them to tears <unk> absolute tears [MASK] laughter and that 's assuming you already have dsl in your house <unk> try to get dsl installed in your house <unk> [MASK] the engineers who do it everyday can 't do it they have to typically they come three times <unk> and one friend of mine was telling me a story <unk> not only did they get there and have to wait <unk>[MASK] but then the the engineers when they finally did get there for the third time they had to call[MASK] <unk> somebody and they were really happy that[MASK] the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there <unk> so[MASK] we 're not we 're pretty kludge y ourselves <unk> by the way dsl is a kludge i mean this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it 's being put[MASK] to you know it[MASK] <unk> the whole thing we 're very very primitive [MASK] and that 's kind of the point because you know [MASK] resilience if you think of it in terms of the gold rush <unk> then you 'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone <unk> [MASK] but the good thing is with innovation there isn 't a last nugget every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities <unk> [MASK] and if you believe that [MASK] then you believe that where we are this is what i think i believe that where we are with the incredible kludge[MASK] <unk> and i haven 't even talked about user interfaces on the web[MASK] but there 's so much kludge so much terrible stuff we are at the one thousand nine hundred and eight hurley washing machine stage with the internet that 's where we are [MASK] we don 't get our hair caught in it but that 's the level of primitiveness of where we are <unk>[MASK] and if you believe that then[MASK] <unk> all the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble[MASK]
