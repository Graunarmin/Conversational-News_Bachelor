 <unk> this is my[MASK] grandfather <unk> salman schocken who was born[MASK] into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed <unk> and when he was fourteen years old[MASK] he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table <unk> he never went back to school [MASK] instead <unk> he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores <unk> [MASK] salman was the consummate perfectionist and every one of his stores[MASK] <unk> and like everything else he did it in grand style[MASK] he surrounded himself with an entourage[MASK] of young unknown scholars like martin buber and shai agnon and franz kafka <unk> [MASK] and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace <unk> [MASK] and yet[MASK] <unk> he fled germany <unk> together with his family leaving everything else behind [MASK] his department stores confiscated <unk> he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture [MASK] this high school dropout[MASK] died at the age of eighty two a formidable intellectual[MASK] <unk> cofounder and first ceo of the hebrew university of jerusalem and founder of schocken books an acclaimed imprint[MASK] that was later acquired by random house such is the power of self study [MASK] and these are my parents [MASK] they too did not enjoy the privilege of college education <unk> they were too busy building a family and a country[MASK] <unk> and our home was stacked with thousands of books <unk> records[MASK] and artwork [MASK] i remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a tv set [MASK] then we 'll buy a normal f m radio [MASK] and that 's me i was going to say holding my first abacus but actually holding[MASK] what my father would consider an ample substitute to an ipad so one thing that i took from home is this notion[MASK] that educators don 't necessarily have to teach <unk> instead they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own[MASK] <unk> virtues of a great education <unk> so i 'd like to share with you a story about a <unk>[MASK] computer science course that i built together with my brilliant colleague noam nisan <unk> [MASK] as you can see from the pictures <unk> both noam and i had an early fascination with first principles <unk> and over the years[MASK] <unk> as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated this early awe with the basics has only intensified <unk> [MASK] so it 's not surprising that about twelve years ago when noam noam and i were already computer science professors <unk> [MASK] we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon <unk> [MASK] as computers became increasingly more complex our students were losing the forest for the trees <unk> [MASK] and indeed it is impossible to connect with[MASK] <unk> soul of the machine[MASK] if you interact with a black box p c or a mac which is shrouded by numerous layers of closed proprietary software <unk> [MASK] so noam and i had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work [MASK] and understand it in the marrow of their bones then perhaps the best way to go about it is[MASK] <unk> useful computer hardware and software from the ground up from first principles [MASK] now we had to start somewhere <unk> and so noam and i[MASK] decided to base our cathedral <unk> so to speak on the simplest possible building block which is something called nand [MASK] <unk> so we now start this journey by telling our students that god gave us nand and told us to build a computer [MASK] and when we asked how god said one step at a time [MASK] and then following this advice <unk> we start with this lowly <unk> humble nand gate and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build[MASK] <unk> set a hardware platform an assembler a virtual machine a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple [MASK] java like language that we call jack the students celebrate the end of this tour de force by using jack to write all sorts of cool games[MASK] <unk> and tetris [MASK] you can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a tetris game that you wrote in jack and then compiled into machine language in a compiler that you wrote also [MASK] and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand nand gates it 's a tremendous personal triumph <unk>[MASK] <unk> of going from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex and useful system[MASK] noam and i worked five years[MASK] to facilitate this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure that will enable students to build it in one semester <unk> [MASK] and this is the great team that helped us make it happen the trick was to decompose the computer 's construction[MASK] <unk> each of which could be individually specified built and unit tested in isolation from the rest of the project <unk> [MASK] and from day one noam and i decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the web <unk> [MASK] so chip specifications[MASK] <unk> of hundreds of slides <unk> lectures[MASK] we laid out everything on the web and invited the world to come over take whatever they need <unk> and do whatever they want with it [MASK] and then[MASK] something fascinating happened the world came <unk> and in short order thousands of people[MASK] <unk> one of the first[MASK] massive <unk> open online courses <unk> [MASK] although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called moocs[MASK] <unk> we just observed how self organized courses were kind of spontaneously spawning[MASK] out of our materials for example <unk> pramode c e an engineer from kerala india has organized groups of self learners who build our computer[MASK] under his good guidance <unk> and parag shah <unk> another engineer from mumbai has unbundled our projects into smaller more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do it yourself computer science program [MASK] the people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality they want to figure[MASK] <unk> out how things work and they want to do it in groups like this hackers club in washington d c that uses our materials to offer community courses <unk> [MASK] and because these materials are widely available and open source different people take them to very different and unpredictable directions <unk> for example <unk> [MASK] yu fangmin from guangzhou has used fpga technology to build our computer and show others how to do the same[MASK] using a video clip and[MASK] <unk> craddock developed[MASK] a very nice computer game[MASK] that unfolds inside our cpu architecture <unk> [MASK] which is quite a complex 3d maze that ben developed using the minecraft 3d simulator engine [MASK] the minecraft community went bananas over this project <unk> and ben became an[MASK] <unk> if you will has turned into a life changing experience [MASK] for example <unk> take dan rounds who is a music and math major from east lansing <unk> michigan [MASK] a few weeks ago dan posted a victorious post on our website and i 'd like to read it to you [MASK] so here 's what[MASK] <unk> i did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me just like literacy and numeracy [MASK] and i made it through i never worked harder on anything never been challenged to this degree <unk> [MASK] but given what i now feel capable of doing i would certainly do it again [MASK] to anyone considering nand2tetris it 's a tough journey <unk> but you 'll be profoundly changed[MASK] <unk> who take this course off the web on their own traction on their own initiative <unk> [MASK] and it 's quite amazing because these people[MASK] cannot care less about grades <unk> they are doing it[MASK] because of one motivation only they have a tremendous[MASK] <unk> and with that in mind i 'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading i 'm sick of it[MASK] <unk> we are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data <unk> and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing <unk> [MASK] and a huge part of education is about failing <unk> [MASK] courage <unk> according[MASK] <unk> is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm and[MASK] <unk> said that mistakes are the portals of discovery <unk> [MASK] and yet we don 't tolerate mistakes and we worship grades <unk> so we collect your b pluses and your a minuses[MASK] and we aggregate them into a number like three point four <unk> which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are well in my opinion we went too far with this[MASK] <unk> nonsense and grading became degrading <unk> [MASK] so with that i 'd like to say a few words about upgrading <unk> and share with you a glimpse from my current project [MASK] which is different from the previous one but it shares exactly the same characteristics of[MASK] <unk> beginning with early age math <unk> and we do it on tablets[MASK] because we believe that math like anything else should be taught hands on [MASK] so here 's what we do basically we developed numerous mobile apps every one of them explaining a particular concept in math <unk> so for example let 's take[MASK] area when you deal with a concept like area[MASK] well <unk> we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn <unk> so[MASK] if area is what interests us then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape[MASK] and simply count how many tiles[MASK] <unk> it takes to cover it completely <unk> and this little exercise here gives you a first[MASK] good insight of the notion of area <unk> moving along what about the area of this figure <unk> well if you try to tile it it[MASK] doesn 't work too well <unk> does it <unk> so instead <unk> you can experiment with these different tools here by some process of guided trial and error <unk> [MASK] and at some point you will[MASK] <unk> discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one you can cut the figure <unk> you can rearrange the parts [MASK] you can glue them[MASK] and then proceed to tile just like we did before [MASK] now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure[MASK] <unk> so a six year old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram [MASK] we don 't replace teachers by the way we believe that teachers should be empowered not replaced moving along what about the area of a triangle <unk> [MASK] so after some guided trial and error the child will discover with or without help[MASK] <unk> that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result <unk> transpose it glue it to the original[MASK] and then proceed [ with ] what we did before cut rearrange paste oops[MASK] paste[MASK] and glue and tile now this transformation has doubled the area of the[MASK] <unk> original figure and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two <unk> [MASK] but we discovered it by <unk> self exploration [MASK] so [MASK] in addition to[MASK] learning some useful geometry the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated[MASK] science strategies[MASK] <unk> reduction <unk> which is the the art of[MASK] transforming a complex problem into a simple one or generalization which is at the heart of any[MASK] scientific discipline or the fact that some properties are invariant under some[MASK] transformations and all this is something that a very young child can pick up using[MASK] such mobile[MASK] apps so presently <unk> we are doing the following first of all we are decomposing the k 12 math curriculum into numerous such apps <unk> [MASK] and because we cannot do it on our own <unk> we 've developed a very fancy authoring tool[MASK] that any author any parent or actually anyone[MASK] <unk> interest in math education can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps[MASK] on tablets without programming <unk> and finally we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem[MASK] that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style[MASK]
