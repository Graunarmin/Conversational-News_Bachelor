 <unk> a few years ago <unk> i broke into my own house [MASK] i had just driven home it was around midnight in the dead of montreal winter i had been visiting my friend jeff across town <unk> and[MASK] the thermometer on the[MASK] porch read minus forty degrees[MASK] and don 't bother asking if that 's celsius or fahrenheit <unk> minus forty is where the two scales meet[MASK] it was very cold and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets <unk> i found i didn 't have my keys [MASK] in fact i could see them through the window <unk> lying on the dining room table where i had left them <unk> [MASK] so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cellphone but at midnight it could take[MASK] <unk> a while for a locksmith to show up and[MASK] it was cold[MASK] i couldn 't go back to my friend jeff 's house for the night because i had an early flight to europe the next morning and i needed to get my passport and my suitcase [MASK] so desperate and freezing cold <unk> i found a large rock and i broke through the basement window <unk> cleared out the shards of glass i crawled through <unk> i found a piece of cardboard and taped it up[MASK] <unk> over the opening figuring that in the morning on the way to the airport i could call my contractor and ask him to to fix it this was going to be expensive but probably no more expensive than <unk>[MASK] <unk> a middle of the night locksmith so i figured under the circumstances i was coming out even [MASK] <unk> raises your heart rate it[MASK] modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking <unk> [MASK] so the next morning <unk> [MASK] when i woke up on too little sleep <unk> worrying about the hole in the window <unk> and a mental note that i had to call my contractor and the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had upcoming in europe[MASK] <unk> you know with all the cortisol in my brain my thinking was cloudy <unk> but i didn 't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy and[MASK] it wasn 't until i got to the airport check in counter that i realized i didn 't have my passport [MASK] so i raced home in the snow and ice forty minutes got my passport raced back to the airport <unk> i made it just in[MASK] <unk> but they had given away my seat to someone else so i got stuck in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms in a seat that wouldn 't recline on an eight hour flight well[MASK] i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep [MASK] and i started wondering are there things that i can do systems that i can put into place that will prevent bad things from happening [MASK] or at least if bad things happen will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe <unk> [MASK] <unk> about that but my thoughts didn 't crystallize until about a month later i was having dinner with my colleague danny kahneman the nobel prize winner [MASK] and i somewhat <unk> embarrassedly told him about having broken my window and [MASK] you know forgotten my passport and danny shared with me that he 'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight [MASK] <unk> it 's something that he had gotten from the psychologist gary klein who had written about it a few years before also called the pre mortem now you all know what the postmortem is whenever there 's a disaster <unk>[MASK] <unk> a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong <unk> right well in the pre mortem danny explained you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong <unk> [MASK] <unk> to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre mortem [MASK] some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious i 'll start with the obvious ones around the home <unk> [MASK] designate a place for things that are easily lost [MASK] now this sounds like common sense and it is <unk> but there 's a lot of science to back this up based on the way our spatial memory works[MASK] there 's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus that evolved over tens of thousands of years to keep track of the locations of important things[MASK] where the well is where fish can be found that stand of fruit trees[MASK] <unk> where the friendly and enemy tribes live the hippocampus is the part of the brain that in london taxicab drivers becomes enlarged <unk> it 's the part of the brain that allows[MASK] <unk> squirrels to find their nuts <unk> and if you 're wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts they weren 't using smell <unk>[MASK] they were using the hippocampus this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things [MASK] <unk> car keys and reading glasses and passports [MASK] so in the home designate a spot for your keys a hook by the door <unk> maybe a decorative bowl for your passport a particular drawer for your reading glasses a particular table if you designate a spot and you 're scrupulous about it [MASK] your things will always be there when you look for them [MASK] what about travel take a cell phone picture of your credit cards your driver 's license your passport[MASK] mail it to yourself so it 's in the cloud if these things are lost or stolen you can facilitate replacement now these are some rather obvious things[MASK] <unk> remember when you 're under stress the brain releases cortisol cortisol is toxic <unk> and it causes cloudy thinking so part of the practice of the pre mortem[MASK] is to recognize that under stress you 're not going to be at your best and you should put systems in place[MASK] and there 's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you 're confronted with a medical decision to make [MASK] and at some point all of us are going to be in that position where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one to help them with a decision [MASK] and so i want to talk about that and i 'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition [MASK] but this stands as a proxy for all kinds of[MASK] decision making and indeed for financial decision making and social decision making any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts [MASK] so suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says i just got your lab work back [MASK] your cholesterol 's a little high [MASK] now you all know[MASK] <unk> high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke <unk> and so you 're thinking having high cholesterol isn 't the best thing and so the <unk>[MASK] <unk> doctor says you know i 'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol a statin [MASK] <unk> give me the statin [MASK] but there 's a question you should ask at this point a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don 't like talking about and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less[MASK] <unk> it 's for the number needed to treat [MASK] now what is this the nnt it 's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure[MASK] before one person[MASK] <unk> you 're thinking what kind of crazy statistic is that the number should be one my doctor wouldn 't prescribe something to me if it 's not going to help [MASK] but actually medical practice doesn 't work that way and it 's not the doctor 's fault if it 's anybody 's fault it 's the fault of scientists like me we haven 't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough [MASK] <unk> but glaxosmithkline estimates that ninety percent of the drugs work in only thirty to fifty percent of the people [MASK] what do you suppose it is how many people have to take it before one person is helped <unk>[MASK] this is according to research by research practitioners jerome groopman and pamela hartzband independently confirmed by bloomberg com i ran through the numbers myself[MASK] <unk> three hundred people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack stroke or other adverse event is prevented now you 're probably[MASK] <unk> thinking well ok [MASK] one in three hundred chance of lowering my cholesterol why not doc <unk> give me the prescription anyway but you should ask at this point for another statistic and that is tell me about the side effects right <unk>[MASK] <unk> so for this particular drug the side effects occur in five percent of the patients <unk> [MASK] <unk> gastrointestinal distress[MASK] but now you 're thinking five percent not very likely it 's going to happen to me i 'll still take the drug but wait a minute <unk> remember under stress you 're not thinking clearly so think about how you 're going to work through this ahead of <unk>[MASK] <unk> time so you don 't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot three hundred people take the drug right one person 's helped <unk> five percent of those three hundred have side effects that 's fifteen people [MASK] fifteen times more likely to be harmed by the drug[MASK] than you are to be helped by the drug [MASK] now <unk> i 'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not i 'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor medical ethics requires it it 's part of the principle of informed consent <unk>[MASK] you have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not now you might be thinking i 've pulled this number out of the air for shock value[MASK] <unk> needed to treat for the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of fifty [MASK] removal of the prostate for cancer the number needed to treat is forty nine [MASK] that 's right forty nine surgeries are done for every one person who 's helped <unk> and the side effects in that case[MASK] occur in fifty percent of the patients <unk> they include impotence erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence <unk> rectal tearing[MASK] <unk> incontinence <unk> and if you 're lucky and you 're one of the fifty percent who has these they 'll only last for a year or two so[MASK] the idea of the pre mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward you don 't want to have to manufacture all of this <unk>[MASK] <unk> on the spot and you also want to think about things like quality of life because you have a choice oftentimes[MASK] <unk> shorter life that 's pain free or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end [MASK] these are things to talk about and think about now with your family and your loved ones you might change your mind in the heat of the moment but at least you 're practiced with this kind of thinking <unk> [MASK] remember <unk> our brain[MASK] under stress releases cortisol and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down there 's an[MASK] <unk> evolutionary reason for this face to face with a predator you don 't need your digestive system or your libido or your immune system <unk> because if you 're body is expending metabolism <unk>[MASK] <unk> on those things and you don 't react quickly you might become the lion 's lunch and then none of those things matter[MASK] <unk> colleagues have shown <unk> so we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations <unk> i think the important point here[MASK] is recognizing that all of us are flawed we all are going to fail now and then [MASK] the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be[MASK] <unk> put systems in place[MASK]
