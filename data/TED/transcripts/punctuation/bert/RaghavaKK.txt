 <unk> years ago my grandfather a young man walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that [MASK] and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen <unk> none other than mae west[MASK] <unk> heartthrob of the ' 30s [MASK] and he could never forget her in fact when he had his daughter many years later [MASK] he wanted to name her after mae west but can you imagine an indian child name mae west [MASK] the indian family said <unk> no way so when my twin brother kaesava was born [MASK] he decided to tinker with the spelling of keshava[MASK] <unk> so he changed kaesava 's spelling <unk> [MASK] now kaesava had a baby boy called rehan a couple of weeks ago <unk> he decided to spell or rather misspell raehan with an a e [MASK] you know my grandfather died many years ago when i was little <unk> but his love for mae west lives on as a misspelling in the dna of his progeny [MASK] that for me is[MASK] <unk> legacy you know[MASK] as for me my wife and i have our own crazy legacy project <unk> [MASK] we actually sit every few years <unk> argue <unk> disagree <unk> fight <unk> and actually come up with our very own <unk> 200 year plan [MASK] our friends think we 're mad our parents think we 're cuckoo <unk> because you know we both come from families that[MASK] <unk> really look up to humility and wisdom <unk> but we both like to live larger than life i believe in the concept of a raja yogi be a dude <unk>[MASK] before you can become an ascetic this is me being a rock star even if it 's in my own house <unk> [MASK] <unk> what do we mean by beyond ourselves <unk> [MASK] well two hundred years we calculated is at the end of our direct contact with the world there 's nobody i 'll meet in my life[MASK] will ever live beyond two hundred years [MASK] so we thought that 's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight <unk> you know i never really believed in legacy what am i going to leave behind i 'm an artist[MASK] <unk> i made a cartoon about nine eleven it caused so much trouble for me i was so upset <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week[MASK] ended up staying so much longer <unk> now i 'm in the business of creating art[MASK] that will definitely even outlive me <unk> and i think about what i want to leave behind[MASK] through those paintings <unk>[MASK] <unk> the nine eleven cartoon upset me so much[MASK] that i decided i 'll never cartoon again <unk> i said i 'm never going to make any honest public commentary again <unk> [MASK] but of course i continued creating artwork that was honest and raw <unk> [MASK] because i forgot about how people reacted to my work you know sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic <unk> [MASK] perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings[MASK] <unk> most important things in my 200 year plan that netra and i write[MASK] is what to forget about ourselves you know we carry so much baggage from our parents from our society from so many people fears <unk> insecurities[MASK] and our 200 year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire[MASK] <unk> we actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems [MASK] the latest date i put was i said <unk> i am going to expire my fear of my leftist feminist mother in law [MASK] and this today is the date [MASK] laughs she 's watching [MASK] you know <unk> i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself and that 's the most important[MASK] <unk> kind of decisions i make [MASK] and this directly translates into my paintings <unk> [MASK] but like my friends <unk> i can do that really well on facebook pinterest twitter flickr <unk> youtube name it i 'm on it [MASK] i 've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world <unk> you know <unk> but that comes with a problem <unk> it 's so easy to think of technology[MASK] <unk> as a metaphor for memory <unk> but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology we only remember what we want to at least i do <unk> [MASK] and i rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> and if technology is not a metaphor for memory what is it [MASK] netra and i use our technology as a tool in our[MASK] <unk> that is a picture of my mother <unk> and she recently got a facebook account <unk> you know where this is going <unk> [MASK] and i 've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page [MASK] and[MASK] i actually untagged myself first then i picked up the phone i said mom you will never put a picture of me in a bikini[MASK] <unk> you just don 't understand maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves <unk> [MASK] maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> whether you agree with [MASK] you know legacy or not we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time so netra and i really wanted to use our[MASK] <unk> digital legacy <unk> and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future [MASK] how you may ask [MASK] when i think of the future <unk> i never see myself moving forward in time i actually see time moving backward towards me [MASK] i can actually visualize my future approaching <unk> i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want[MASK] like a video game obstacle course <unk> and i 've gotten better and better at doing this even when i make a painting <unk> i actually imagine[MASK] i 'm behind the painting it already exists and someone 's looking at it <unk> [MASK] and i see whether they 're feeling it from their gut are they feeling it from their heart or is it just a cerebral thing and it really informs my[MASK] <unk> even when i do an art show i really think about what should people walk away with[MASK] i remember when i was nineteen i did <unk> [MASK] i wanted to do my first art exhibition <unk> and i wanted the whole world to know about it i didn 't know ted then <unk> [MASK] but what i did was i closed my eyes tight and i started dreaming <unk> [MASK] i could imagine people coming in dressed up looking beautiful my paintings with all the light [MASK] and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous[MASK] launching my show giving credibility to me <unk> [MASK] and i woke up from my visualization and i said <unk> who was that i couldn 't tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha two very famous indian actresses like the meryl streeps of india [MASK] as it turned out <unk> next morning i wrote a letter to both of them <unk> and[MASK] <unk> and shabana azmi replied <unk> and came and launched my very first show twelve years ago <unk> and what a bang it started my career with <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> when we think of time in this way <unk> we can curate not only the future[MASK] but also the past this is a picture of my family and that is netra my wife she 's the co creator of my[MASK] <unk> netra 's a high school history teacher <unk> i love netra <unk> but i hate history <unk> [MASK] i keep saying nets <unk> you live in the past while i 'll create the future and when i 'm done you can study about it [MASK] she gave me an indulgent smile <unk> and as punishment she said tomorrow i 'm teaching a class on indian history <unk> and you are sitting in it and i 'm grading you[MASK] she started by giving students[MASK] primary source documents from india <unk> pakistan from britain and i said wow [MASK] then she asked them to separate fact from bias[MASK] <unk> as an imaging tool [MASK] i was so inspired <unk> i went and created my own version of indian history <unk> i actually included stories from my grandmother she used to work for the telephone exchange <unk> and she used to actually overhear conversations between nehru and edwina mountbatten <unk> [MASK] and she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn 't have[MASK] <unk> i include things like that this is my version of indian history <unk> you know <unk> [MASK] if this is so it occurred to me that maybe just maybe the primary objective of our brains[MASK] is to serve our dignity <unk> go tell facebook to figure that out <unk> netra and i don 't write[MASK] <unk> for someone else to come and execute it[MASK] in one hundred and fifty years imagine receiving a parcel saying [MASK] from the past okay now you 're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this no we actually write it only to set our attitudes right <unk> [MASK] you know[MASK] i used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy [MASK] education is great it really teaches us who we are and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world[MASK] <unk> but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am [MASK] i 'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have it lets us create who we are [MASK] and curate what is to come [MASK] i like to think thank you i like to think of myself as a storyteller where my past[MASK] <unk> my future[MASK] are only stories my stories <unk> waiting to be told and retold [MASK] i hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own 200 year story thank you so much[MASK]
