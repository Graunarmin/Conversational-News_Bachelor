 <unk> military commander[MASK] of the netherlands <unk> with troops stationed around the world <unk> i 'm really honored[MASK] to be here today when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue <unk> i see[MASK] <unk> very special audience [MASK] you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today [MASK] when i look around <unk> i see people who want to make a contribution i see people who want to make a[MASK] <unk> by doing groundbreaking scientific work by creating impressive works of art by writing critical articles[MASK] or inspiring books by starting up sustainable businesses <unk> [MASK] and you all have chosen your own instruments[MASK] to fulfill this mission of creating[MASK] <unk> a better world <unk> some chose the microscope[MASK] as their instrument <unk> others chose dancing[MASK] or painting or making music like we just heard <unk> some chose the pen <unk> others work[MASK] through the instrument of money <unk> ladies and gentlemen <unk> i made a different choice[MASK] <unk> ladies and gentlemen[MASK] <unk> i share the goals of the speakers you heard before [MASK] i did not[MASK] choose to take up[MASK] the pen <unk> the brush <unk> the camera <unk> i chose[MASK] this[MASK] <unk> and you heard already <unk> being so close to this gun[MASK] may make you feel uneasy <unk> it may even feel scary a real gun[MASK] at a few feet 's distance <unk> let us stop for a moment[MASK] and feel this uneasiness you could even hear it let us[MASK] the fact that probably most of you[MASK] have never been close to a gun <unk> it means[MASK] the netherlands is a peaceful country the netherlands is not at war <unk> [MASK] it means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets [MASK] guns[MASK] are not a part of our lives[MASK] in many countries <unk> it is a different story in many[MASK] countries people are confronted with guns <unk> they are oppressed they are intimidated[MASK] by warlords by terrorists by criminals weapons can do a lot of harm[MASK] <unk> they are the cause of much distress why then am i standing before you with this weapon [MASK] why did i choose the gun as my instrument [MASK] today i want to tell you why today i want to tell you why i chose the gun to create a better[MASK] <unk> and i want to tell you how this gun can help [MASK] my story starts in the city of nijmegen[MASK] in the east of the netherlands <unk> the city where i was born [MASK] my father was a hardworking baker <unk> [MASK] but when he had finished work in the bakery[MASK] <unk> often told me and my brother stories and most of the time <unk> he told me this story i 'm going to share with you now [MASK] the story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier[MASK] in the dutch armed forces[MASK] at the beginning of the second world war <unk> the nazis invaded the netherlands their grim plans were evident[MASK] they meant to rule by means of repression <unk> diplomacy[MASK] had failed to stop the germans only brute force[MASK] remained <unk> it was our last resort [MASK] my father was there to provide it as the son of a farmer[MASK] who knew how to hunt[MASK] <unk> my father was an excellent marksman when he aimed <unk> he never missed [MASK] at this decisive moment in dutch history my father was positioned[MASK] on the bank of the river waal near the city of nijmegen [MASK] he had a clear shot at the german soldiers who came to occupy a free country <unk> his country[MASK] our country <unk> [MASK] he fired <unk> nothing happened he fired again no german soldier fell to the ground [MASK] my father[MASK] had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank <unk> [MASK] hitler 's troops marched on[MASK] my father could do about it [MASK] until the day my father died <unk> he was frustrated about missing these shots <unk> [MASK] he could have done something but with an old gun not even the best marksman in the armed forces[MASK] could have hit the mark so this story[MASK] stayed with me[MASK] <unk> then in high school i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers[MASK] soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country[MASK] and a people that they didn 't know they liberated my birth town[MASK] <unk> it was then that i decided i would take up the gun[MASK] out of respect and gratitude[MASK] for those men and women who came to liberate us <unk> from the awareness that sometimes[MASK] only the gun[MASK] can stand between good and evil <unk> and that is why i took up the gun[MASK] <unk> not to shoot not to kill not to destroy <unk> but to stop those who would do evil [MASK] to protect the vulnerable [MASK] to defend democratic values [MASK] to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in amsterdam[MASK] about how we can make the world a better place[MASK] ladies and gentlemen <unk> i do not stand here today[MASK] to tell you about the glory of weapons <unk> i do not like guns <unk> and once[MASK] you have been under fire yourself <unk> it brings home even more clearly[MASK] that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about[MASK] <unk> i stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability [MASK] the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world[MASK] <unk> now this may sound[MASK] contradictory to you but not only have i seen with my own eyes[MASK] during my deployments in lebanon sarajevo and as the netherlands ' chief of defence [MASK] this is also supported by cold hard statistics [MASK] violence has declined dramatically[MASK] over the last five hundred years <unk> despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news[MASK] between developed countries are no longer commonplace <unk> the murder rate in europe has dropped by a factor of thirty[MASK] since the middle ages <unk> and occurrences of civil war and repression have declined[MASK] since the end of the cold war <unk> statistics show that we are living in a relatively[MASK] peaceful era why[MASK] <unk> why has violence decreased has the human mind changed <unk> well we were talking about the human mind this morning [MASK] did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge [MASK] for violent rituals for pure rage [MASK] or is there something else [MASK] in his latest book <unk> harvard professor steven pinker[MASK] and many other thinkers before him concludes that one of <unk>[MASK] the the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state[MASK] and the introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence[MASK] legitimized by a democratically[MASK] elected government legitimized by checks and balances[MASK] and an independent judicial system in other words a state monopoly[MASK] that has the use of violence well under control [MASK] such a state monopoly on violence first of all serves as a reassurance[MASK] it removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies <unk> [MASK] secondly <unk> the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence[MASK] tips the balance even further <unk> abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war[MASK] <unk> now[MASK] nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel <unk> it enhances peace even further <unk> [MASK] where there is no conflict <unk> trade flourishes <unk> [MASK] and trade is another important incentive against violence with trade there 's mutual interdependency[MASK] and mutual gain between parties[MASK] <unk> and when there is mutual gain both sides stand to lose more than they would gain[MASK] if they started a war [MASK] war is simply no longer the best option <unk> and that is why violence[MASK] has decreased [MASK] <unk> ladies and gentlemen is the rationale behind the existence[MASK] of my armed forces [MASK] the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence [MASK] we do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us[MASK] to do so <unk> it is this legitimate <unk> controlled use of the gun[MASK] that has contributed greatly to reducing[MASK] <unk> the statistics of war conflict[MASK] and violence around the globe <unk> it is this participation in peacekeeping missions[MASK] that has led to the resolution of many civil wars my soldiers[MASK] use the gun as an instrument of peace and this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous[MASK] <unk> failed states have no legitimized democratically controlled use of force failed states do not know of the gun[MASK] as an instrument of peace and stability [MASK] that is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict [MASK] that is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state[MASK] <unk> is such an important aspect[MASK] of our foreign missions that is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in afghanistan [MASK] that is why we train police officers we train judges <unk> we train public prosecutors around the world <unk> [MASK] and that is why and in the netherlands we are very unique in that[MASK] <unk> dutch constitution states[MASK] that one of the main tasks of the armed forces[MASK] is to uphold and promote the international rule of law <unk> [MASK] ladies and gentlemen <unk> looking at this gun we are confronted with the ugly side of the[MASK] <unk> development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat[MASK] into hope <unk> and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded[MASK] and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression[MASK] we will have to make ideals and human failure[MASK] meet somewhere in the middle until that day comes <unk> i stand for my father[MASK] who tried to shoot the nazis with an old gun <unk> i stand for my men and women[MASK] who are prepared to risk their lives for a less[MASK] <unk> violent world for all of us <unk> i stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss[MASK] and sustained permanent injuries to her leg <unk> when she was hit[MASK] by a rocket on a mission in afghanistan <unk> [MASK] <unk> until the day comes when we can do away with the gun <unk> i hope we all agree[MASK] that peace and stability do not come free of charge <unk> [MASK] it takes hard work <unk> often behind the scenes <unk> it takes good equipment[MASK] and well trained dedicated soldiers[MASK] <unk> i hope[MASK] you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain[MASK] and provide her with a good gun <unk> instead of the bad gun my father was given i hope you will support our soldiers[MASK] when they are out there when they come home[MASK] and when they are injured and need our care they put their lives on the line[MASK] <unk> for us for you and we cannot let them down i hope[MASK] you will respect my soldiers this soldier[MASK] with this gun <unk> because she wants a better world <unk> because she makes an active contribution[MASK]
