 <unk> ten years ago from chicago with an interest in cancer[MASK] and in chemistry you might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules or to my taste new drugs for[MASK] <unk> and you might also know that for science and medicine boston is a bit of a candy store[MASK] <unk> you can 't roll a stop sign in cambridge without hitting a graduate student the bar is called the miracle of science the[MASK] billboards say lab space available and it 's fair to say that in these ten years we 've witnessed[MASK] absolutely the start of a scientific revolution that of genome medicine <unk> we know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever[MASK] <unk> before and we 're able finally to answer the question that 's been so pressing for so many years <unk> why do i have cancer <unk> [MASK] this information is also pretty staggering [MASK] you might know that so far in just the dawn of this revolution we know that there are perhaps forty thousand unique mutations[MASK] affecting more than ten thousand genes and that there are five hundred of these genes that[MASK] <unk> cancer <unk> yet comparatively <unk> we have about a dozen targeted medications <unk> and this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home[MASK] when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer <unk> we didn 't fly him to boston we didn 't sequence his genome <unk> it 's been known for decades what[MASK] <unk> this is old information we 've known since about the 80s yet there 's no medicine i can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three[MASK] <unk> horsemen of the apocalypse that is cancer <unk> there 's no ras no myc no p53 drug and you might fairly ask <unk> why is that [MASK] and the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is[MASK] <unk> too hard that for whatever reason these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that 's called the undruggable genome[MASK] which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the moon unwalkable it 's a horrible term of trade <unk> [MASK] but what it means is that we 've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins into which we like molecular locksmiths can fashion an active small[MASK] <unk> or drug substance [MASK] now as i was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation what we had instead <unk> [MASK] cascading through the regulatory network at the fda were these substances arsenic [MASK] thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard[MASK] <unk> and so i guess you 'd say dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines i went back to school in chemistry [MASK] with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open source <unk> the crowd source <unk> [MASK] the collaborative network that we have access to within[MASK] <unk> that we might more quickly bring[MASK] powerful and targeted therapies[MASK] to our patients <unk> [MASK] and so <unk> please consider this a work in progress but i 'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma [MASK] about the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer called brd4 and about a molecule developed at my lab at dana farber cancer institute[MASK] <unk> which we affectionately named for jun qi the chemist that made this molecule <unk> [MASK] now brd4 is an interesting protein you might ask with all the things cancer 's trying to do to kill our patient how does it remember it 's cancer <unk> [MASK] when it winds up its genome <unk> divides into two cells and unwinds again <unk> [MASK] why does it not turn into an eye into a liver as it has all the genes necessary to do this it remembers that it 's cancer [MASK] and the reason is that cancer <unk> like every cell in the body places little molecular[MASK] <unk> bookmarks little post it notes that remind the cell i 'm cancer <unk> i should keep growing [MASK] and those post it notes involve this and other proteins of its class so called bromodomains [MASK] so we developed an idea a rationale that perhaps if we made a molecule that prevented the post it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein [MASK] then maybe we could convince cancer cells certainly[MASK] <unk> those addicted to this brd4 protein that they 're not cancer <unk> [MASK] and so we started to work on this problem we developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called <unk> jq1 [MASK] now not being a drug company we could do certain things we had certain flexibilities that[MASK] i respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn 't have we just started mailing it to our friends <unk> i have a small lab[MASK] <unk> we thought we 'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves we sent it to oxford england where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture which helped us understand exactly how this molecule <unk>[MASK] <unk> is so potent for this protein target it 's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity or hand in glove now [MASK] <unk> and so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at brigham and women 's hospital and as we treated these cells with this molecule <unk> we observed something really striking [MASK] the cancer cells small round and rapidly dividing [MASK] grew these arms and extensions they were changing shape [MASK] in effect <unk> the cancer cell[MASK] was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell this got us very excited[MASK] <unk> next step would be to put this molecule into mice the only problem was there 's no mouse model of this rare cancer <unk> [MASK] and so at the time we were doing this research i was caring for a 29 year old firefighter from connecticut[MASK] who was very much at the end of life[MASK] with this incurable cancer [MASK] this brd4 addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung <unk> and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris and every nursing shift we would throw this[MASK] <unk> material out <unk> and so we approached this patient[MASK] and asked if he would collaborate with us could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube[MASK] and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug well that would be of course impossible and rightly illegal to do in[MASK] <unk> and he obliged us [MASK] at the lurie family center for animal imaging our colleague andrew kung <unk> [MASK] grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic <unk> and you can see this pet scan of a mouse what we call a pet pet [MASK] the cancer is growing as this red huge mass in the hind limb of this animal [MASK] and as we treat it with our compound [MASK] this addiction to sugar this rapid growth faded and on the animal on the right you see that the cancer was responding [MASK] <unk> completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease and every time we see the same thing the mice with this cancer that get the drug live <unk> and the ones that don 't rapidly perish [MASK] so we started to wonder what would a drug company do at this point well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn the prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance <unk>[MASK] so we did just the opposite[MASK] <unk> published a paper[MASK] that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage <unk> [MASK] we gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule <unk> typically a secret in our discipline we told people exactly how to make it [MASK] we gave them our email address suggesting that if they write us we 'll send them a free molecule [MASK] laughter we basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible and this was unfortunately successful[MASK] because now <unk> we 've shared this molecule just since december of last year with forty laboratories in the united states and thirty more in europe[MASK] many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space to target this rare cancer that <unk> thankfully right now[MASK] <unk> is quite desirable to study in that industry <unk> [MASK] but the science that 's coming back from all of these laboratories[MASK] <unk> about the use of this molecule[MASK] has provided us insights we might not have had on our own <unk> leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells [MASK] mice with multiple myeloma an incurable malignancy of the bone marrow <unk> respond dramatically[MASK] to the treatment with this drug you might know that[MASK] <unk> in fact this molecule prevents this[MASK] adipocyte this fat stem cell from remembering[MASK] how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet <unk> like the folks in my hometown of chicago [MASK] fail to develop fatty liver <unk> which is a major medical problem [MASK] what this research taught us not just my lab <unk> but our institute <unk> and harvard medical school more generally is[MASK] <unk> that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery that our center which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other [MASK] never made one of its own [MASK] for all the reasons you see listed here we think there 's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest [MASK] conceptually tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery[MASK] so what next we have this molecule but it 's not a pill yet it 's not orally <unk>[MASK] we need to fix it so we can deliver it to our patients and everyone in the lab <unk> especially following the interaction with these patients feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance based on this molecule <unk> [MASK] it 's[MASK] 's here where i 'd say that that we could use your help and your insights your collaborative participation unlike a drug company <unk> [MASK] we don 't have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into we don 't have a team of salespeople and marketeers to tell us how to position this drug against the other [MASK] what we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent [MASK] motivated enthusiastic <unk> hopefully well funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide[MASK] this molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small start up company called tensha therapeutics and really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery [MASK] two of which[MASK] a topical drug[MASK] for lymphoma of the skin and an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma will actually come to the[MASK] <unk> trial in july of this year for us a major and exciting milestone [MASK] i want to leave you with just two ideas[MASK] the first is if anything is unique about this research <unk> it 's less the science than the strategy this for us was a social experiment[MASK] an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we[MASK] <unk> could be this string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses[MASK] that can be texted i suppose or twittered worldwide [MASK] is the chemical identity of our pro compound it 's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies the information on how[MASK] these early prototype drugs might work yet this information is largely a secret and so we[MASK] <unk> seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles that of open source and that of crowdsourcing[MASK] to quickly responsibly[MASK] accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer <unk> now the business model[MASK] involves all of you this research is funded by the public <unk> it 's funded by foundations[MASK] <unk> one thing i 've learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer and i love that you bike across the state you walk up and down the river [MASK] laughter i 've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research <unk> and so i want to thank you[MASK] for your[MASK] participation your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas[MASK]
