 <unk> i 'd like you to imagine for a moment that you 're a soldier in the heat of battle [MASK] maybe you 're a roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you 're a zulu warrior <unk> [MASK] regardless of your time and place there are some things that are constant your adrenaline is elevated[MASK] and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes <unk> reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy <unk> [MASK] so now i 'd like you to imagine playing a very different role that of the scout <unk>[MASK] the scout 's job is not to attack or defend the scout 's job is to understand [MASK] the scout[MASK] is the one going out mapping the terrain <unk> identifying potential obstacles [MASK] and the scout may hope to learn that say there 's a bridge in a convenient location across a river <unk> [MASK] but above all the scout wants to know what 's really there as accurately as possible [MASK] and in a real <unk> actual army <unk> both the soldier and the scout are essential <unk> but you can also think of each of these roles[MASK] <unk> as[MASK] a mindset[MASK] a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives[MASK] what i 'm going to argue today is that having good judgment <unk> making accurate predictions <unk> making good decisions [MASK] is mostly about which mindset you 're in[MASK] to illustrate these mindsets in action i 'm going to take you back to[MASK] <unk> where this innocuous looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history it was discovered in <unk>[MASK] by officers in the french general staff[MASK] it was torn up in a wastepaper basket <unk> but when they pieced it back together <unk> [MASK] they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to germany [MASK] so they launched a big investigation[MASK] <unk> suspicions quickly converged on this man alfred dreyfus [MASK] he had a sterling record <unk> no past history of wrongdoing <unk> no motive as far as they could tell <unk> [MASK] but dreyfus was the only jewish officer at that rank in the army <unk> and unfortunately at this time the french army was highly <unk>[MASK] they compared dreyfus 's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match[MASK] <unk> even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity but never mind that [MASK] they went and searched dreyfus 's apartment <unk> looking for any signs of espionage <unk> they went through his files <unk> [MASK] and they didn 't find anything <unk> this just convinced them more that dreyfus was not only guilty but sneaky as well <unk> because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it [MASK] next <unk> they went and looked through his personal history for[MASK] <unk> any incriminating details <unk> they talked to his teachers they found that he had studied foreign languages in school [MASK] which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments[MASK] later in life his teachers also said that dreyfus <unk>[MASK] <unk> known for having a good memory which was highly suspicious right[MASK] <unk> a spy has to remember a lot of things so the case went to trial <unk> and dreyfus was found guilty[MASK] afterwards they took him out into this public square[MASK] and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two this was called the degradation of dreyfus <unk> [MASK] and they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named devil 's island which is this barren rock off the coast of south america <unk> so there he[MASK] <unk> went and there he spent his days alone <unk> writing letters and letters to the french government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence [MASK] but for the most part france considered the matter closed[MASK] one thing that 's really interesting to me about the dreyfus affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that dreyfus was guilty i[MASK] mean you might even assume that[MASK] <unk> that they were setting him up that they were intentionally framing him[MASK] but historians don 't think that 's what happened as far as we can tell the officers genuinely believed that the case against dreyfus was strong which[MASK] makes you wonder <unk> what does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man <unk>[MASK] <unk> this is a case of what scientists call motivated reasoning it 's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations our desires and fears <unk> shape the way we interpret information[MASK] some information some ideas feel like our allies we want them to win we want to defend them [MASK] and other information or ideas are the enemy <unk> and we want to shoot them down <unk> [MASK] so this is why i call motivated reasoning[MASK] <unk> you have never persecuted a french jewish officer for high treason i assume[MASK] <unk> but maybe you 've followed sports or politics so you might have noticed that[MASK] when the referee judges that your team committed a foul for example you 're highly motivated to find reasons why he 's wrong <unk> but if he judges[MASK] <unk> that the other team committed a foul awesome that 's a good call let 's not examine it too closely [MASK] or maybe you 've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy like capital punishment [MASK] and as researchers have demonstrated if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it 's not effective[MASK] <unk> then you 're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed <unk> [MASK] but if it shows that capital punishment works it 's a good study and vice versa if you don 't support capital punishment same thing[MASK] our judgment is strongly influenced <unk> unconsciously <unk> by which side we want to win and this is ubiquitous this shapes[MASK] how we think about our health our relationships how we decide how to vote <unk> what we consider fair or ethical[MASK] what 's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset is how unconscious it is we can think we 're being objective and[MASK] fair minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man <unk> [MASK] however fortunately for dreyfus his story is not over [MASK] this is colonel picquart he 's another high ranking officer in the french army <unk> and like most people he assumed dreyfus was guilty [MASK] also like most people in the army he was at least casually anti semitic [MASK] but[MASK] <unk> what if we 're all wrong about dreyfus what happened was he had discovered evidence that the spying for germany had continued <unk> even after dreyfus was in prison [MASK] and he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo much closer than dreyfus 's handwriting [MASK] so he brought these discoveries to his superiors[MASK] <unk> to his dismay <unk> they either didn 't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings like [MASK] well <unk> all you 've really shown picquart is that there 's another spy who learned how to mimic dreyfus 's handwriting and he picked up the torch of spying after dreyfus left <unk> [MASK] but dreyfus is still guilty [MASK] eventually picquart managed to get dreyfus[MASK] <unk> but it took him ten years <unk> and for part of that time he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army <unk>[MASK] a lot of people feel like picquart can 't really be the hero of this story[MASK] because he was an anti semite and that 's bad <unk> which i agree with <unk> but personally for me the fact that picquart was anti semitic[MASK] actually makes his actions[MASK] <unk> because he had the same prejudices the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it[MASK] trumped all of that[MASK] <unk> so to me <unk> picquart is a poster child for what i call scout mindset [MASK] it 's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose <unk> but just to see what 's really there as as honestly and accurately as you can even if it 's not[MASK] pretty or convenient or pleasant[MASK] this mindset is what i 'm personally passionate about and i 've spent the last few years[MASK] examining and and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset why are some people <unk> sometimes at least able to cut through their own prejudices <unk>[MASK] <unk> and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can[MASK] <unk> emotional so just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like[MASK] defensiveness or tribalism [MASK] scout mindset is too it 's just rooted in different emotions[MASK] for example <unk> scouts are curious <unk> they 're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new[MASK] <unk> itch to solve a puzzle[MASK] they 're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that that contradicts their expectations <unk> [MASK] scouts also have different values <unk> they 're more likely to say[MASK] they think it 's virtuous to test your own beliefs <unk> and they 're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak [MASK] and above all scouts are grounded which means[MASK] <unk> as a person isn 't tied[MASK] to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic <unk> [MASK] so they can believe that capital punishment works if studies come out showing that it doesn 't they can say huh looks like i might be wrong [MASK] doesn 't mean i 'm bad or stupid[MASK] <unk> this cluster of traits is what researchers have found and i 've also found anecdotally[MASK] <unk> and the key takeaway i want to leave you with about those traits is that[MASK] they 're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know[MASK] in fact they don 't correlate very much with iq at all they 're about how you feel[MASK] there 's a quote that i keep coming back to <unk> by saint exupry he 's the author of the little prince he said if you want to build[MASK] <unk> don 't drum up your men to collect wood and and give orders and distribute the work [MASK] instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea [MASK] in other words <unk> i claim [MASK] if we really want to improve our judgment as as individuals and as societies what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric[MASK] <unk> probability or economics even though those things are quite valuable[MASK] but what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset <unk> we need to change the way we feel [MASK] we need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something [MASK] we need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts[MASK] <unk> the question i want to leave you with is what do you most yearn for [MASK] do you yearn to defend your own beliefs or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can thank you[MASK]
