 <unk> debate is over the proposition what the world needs now is nuclear energy [MASK] true or false <unk> and before we have the debate <unk> i 'd like to actually take a show of hands[MASK] <unk> hands down those who are against raise your hands <unk> okay i 'm reading that at about[MASK] in favor at the start which means[MASK] we 're going to take a vote at the end and see see how that shifts if at all [MASK] so here 's the format they 're going to have six minutes each and then after one little quick exchange between them i want two people on each side[MASK] <unk> of this debate in the audience to have thirty seconds to make one short crisp pungent powerful point [MASK] so in favor of the proposition possibly shockingly is one of truly the founders of the environmental movement[MASK] tedster <unk> the founder of the whole earth catalog someone we all know and love stewart brand[MASK] <unk> those who know the most[MASK] are the most worried <unk> [MASK] with nuclear <unk> those who know the most are the least worried [MASK] a classic example is james hansen a nasa climatologist pushing for three hundred and fifty parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere he came out with a wonderful book recently called storms of my grandchildren [MASK] and hansen is hard over for nuclear power <unk> as are most climatologists who are engaging[MASK] this issue seriously <unk> this is the design situation a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban [MASK] look at the client base for this five out of six of us live in the developing world [MASK] we are moving to cities we are moving up in the world <unk> and[MASK] <unk> we are educating our kids having fewer kids basically good news all around but we move to cities toward the bright lights and one of the things that is there that we want besides jobs is electricity <unk> [MASK] and if it isn 't easily gotten we 'll go ahead and steal it <unk> [MASK] this is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world <unk> in the cities and in the countryside [MASK] electricity for cities at its best is what 's called[MASK] <unk> that 's where it is on all the time <unk> and so far there are only three major sources of that[MASK] coal and gas hydro electric which in most places is maxed out and nuclear <unk> [MASK] i would love to have something in the fourth place here but in terms of constant clean <unk> scalable energy [ solar[MASK] ] and wind and the other renewables aren 't there yet because they 're inconstant [MASK] nuclear is and has been for forty years[MASK] <unk> standpoint <unk> the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal the two major sources of electricity <unk> [MASK] if all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a coke can a pretty heavy coke can about two pounds <unk>[MASK] <unk> but one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal <unk>[MASK] then what happens to the waste the nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don 't have underground storage yet it 's just as well because[MASK] it can stay where it is while the carbon dioxide vast quantities of it[MASK] <unk> gigatons goes into the atmosphere where we can 't get it back yet and where it is causing the problems that we 're most concerned about <unk> [MASK] so when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime[MASK] of these various energy sources nuclear is down there with wind and hydro below solar and way below[MASK] <unk> all the fossil fuels wind is wonderful i love wind i love being around these[MASK] big wind generators <unk> [MASK] but one of the things we 're discovering is that wind like solar is an actually relatively dilute source of energy <unk> [MASK] and so it takes a very large footprint on the land a very large footprint in terms of materials five to ten times what you 'd use for nuclear [MASK] and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of two hundred and fifty square miles[MASK] of wind farm [MASK] in places like denmark and germany they 've maxed out on wind already they 've run out of good sites the power lines[MASK] are getting overloaded <unk> and you you peak out likewise with solar <unk> especially here in california we 're discovering that[MASK] the eighty solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze one thousand square miles[MASK] of southern california desert well [MASK] as an environmentalist we would rather that didn 't happen <unk> it 's okay on frapped out agricultural land solar 's wonderful on rooftops <unk> [MASK] but out in the landscape one gigawatt is on the order of fifty square miles of bulldozed desert <unk> when you add all these things up[MASK] saul griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take[MASK] to get[MASK] <unk> thirteen clean terawatts of energy[MASK] from wind solar and biofuels <unk> [MASK] and that area would be roughly the size of the united states an area he refers to as renewistan a[MASK] guy who 's added it up all this very well is david mackay a physicist in england and in his wonderful[MASK] <unk> in terms of weapons <unk> the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy <unk> we have been taking down the russian warheads <unk> [MASK] turning it into electricity ten percent of american electricity comes from decommissioned warheads <unk> [MASK] we haven 't even started[MASK] <unk> i think of most interest to a ted audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small [MASK] down around ten to one hundred and twenty five megawatts <unk> this is one from toshiba <unk> here 's one the russians are already building that floats on a barge <unk> [MASK] and that would be very interesting in the developing world <unk> typically these things are put in the ground <unk> they 're referred to as nuclear batteries they 're incredibly safe weapons <unk>[MASK] <unk> a commercial version from new mexico called the hyperion <unk> and another one from oregon called nuscale <unk> [MASK] babcock & wilcox that make nuclear reactors here 's an integral fast reactor [MASK] thorium reactor that nathan myhrvold 's involved in the governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive and these will go[MASK] <unk> been at the nitty gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years in two thousand he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming after co2 [MASK] his team have been making detailed[MASK] <unk> calculations[MASK] of the relative impacts of different energy sources <unk> his first time at ted possibly a disadvantage we shall see from stanford [MASK] professor mark jacobson good luck mark jacobson thank you [MASK] so my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide[MASK] puts out more air pollutants enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems namely wind solar [MASK] geothermal power hydro tidal wave power <unk> [MASK] and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation <unk> so let 's start just by looking at the co2 emissions from the life cycle[MASK] <unk> co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted[MASK] <unk> and if you look wind and concentrated solar have the lowest co2 emissions if you look at the graph nuclear there are two bars here one is a low estimate and one is a high estimate the low estimate is the nuclear <unk>[MASK] <unk> energy industry estimate of nuclear <unk> the high is the average of one hundred and three scientific peer reviewed studies <unk> [MASK] <unk> years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation this includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit and another two and a half to four years for a construction permit and issue <unk> and then four to nine years for[MASK] actual construction and in china right now they 're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear and the average just for the construction time of these is seven point one years <unk>[MASK] on top of any planning times while you 're waiting around for your nuclear <unk> you have to run the regular electric[MASK] <unk> power grid which is mostly coal in the united states and around the world <unk> and the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid[MASK] resulting if you use nuclear or anything else versus wind <unk> csp[MASK] or photovoltaics wind takes about two to five years on average <unk> same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics[MASK] so the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind or something else so if you add these two together alone <unk> you can see a separation that <unk>[MASK] <unk> nuclear puts out at least nine to seventeen times more co2 equivalent emissions than wind energy <unk> [MASK] <unk> to battery electric vehicles hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on[MASK] <unk> right now in the united states fifty to one hundred thousand people die per year from air pollution and vehicles are about twenty five thousand of those in two thousand and twenty the number will go down to fifteen thousand <unk>[MASK] <unk> due to improvements <unk> and so on the right you see gasoline emissions the death rates of two thousand and twenty <unk> if you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol you 'd actually increase the death rate slightly[MASK] if you go to nuclear <unk> you do get a big reduction but it 's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar now if you consider the fact that nuclear[MASK] weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation [MASK] because we know for example india and pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities <unk> north korea did that to some extent[MASK] <unk> iran is doing that right now <unk> and venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities[MASK] <unk> if you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world <unk> and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb[MASK] created that was used to destroy a city such as mumbai or or some other big city megacity the additional death[MASK] <unk> rates due to this averaged over thirty years and then scaled to the population of the u s would be this so do we need this[MASK] <unk> the next thing is what about the footprint <unk> stewart mentioned the footprint actually the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world <unk> that because the footprint <unk>[MASK] as you can see is just the pole touching the ground <unk> and you can power the entire u s vehicle fleet with seventy three thousand to one hundred and[MASK] <unk> thousand five megawatt wind turbines that would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground entirely <unk> the spacing is something else that 's the footprint that[MASK] is always being confused people confuse footprint with spacing as you can see from these pictures <unk> the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land <unk> range land or open space over the ocean[MASK] <unk> look at nuclear <unk> [MASK] with nuclear what do we have we have facilities around there you also have a buffer zone that 's seventeen square kilometers <unk> and you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with now <unk>[MASK] if we go to the area <unk> lots is worse than nuclear or wind for example cellulosic ethanol to power the entire u s vehicle[MASK] <unk> this is how much land you would need that 's cellulosic second generation biofuels from prairie grass here 's corn ethanol[MASK] it 's smaller this is based on[MASK] ranges from data but if you look at nuclear it would be the size of rhode island to power the u s vehicle fleet for wind <unk> there 's a larger area but much smaller footprint [MASK] and of course with wind <unk> you could put it all over the east coast <unk> offshore theoretically or you can split it up <unk> and now if you go back to[MASK] looking at geothermal it 's even smaller[MASK] <unk> than both and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing <unk> but it 's still pretty small and this is to power the entire u s vehicle fleet to power the entire world with fifty percent <unk>[MASK] <unk> wind <unk> you would need about one percent of world land <unk> matching the reliability <unk> base load is actually irrelevant we want to match the hour by hour[MASK] and it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand here are the world wind resources there 's five to ten times more wind available worldwide than <unk>[MASK] we need for all the world so then here 's the final ranking <unk> and one last slide i just want to show <unk> this is the choice[MASK] <unk> you guarantee ice will last nuclear <unk> the time lag alone will allow the arctic to melt and other places to melt more and we can guarantee a clean <unk> blue sky[MASK] or an uncertain future[MASK] with nuclear power [MASK] all right so while they 're having their comebacks on each other and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran i need two people from either side[MASK] if you 're for this <unk> if you 're for nuclear power <unk> put up two hands if you 're against put up one [MASK] and i want two of each for the mics now then you guys have[MASK] you have a minute comeback on him to[MASK] pick up a point he said challenge it whatever sb [MASK] i think a point of difference we 're having mark[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] energy <unk> [MASK] these diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases a lot of those studies include well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we 'll have cities burning and stuff like that which[MASK] is kind of finessing it a little bit i think the reality is that there 's what twenty one nations that have[MASK] <unk> of those seven have nuclear weapons in every case they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power <unk> [MASK] there are two nations north korea and israel that have nuclear weapons and don 't have nuclear power at all [MASK] the places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are china <unk> india <unk> europe <unk> north america all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons [MASK] so that leaves a couple of places like iran maybe venezuela[MASK] <unk> venezuela that you would like to have very close[MASK] surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff [MASK] pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is and we can move toward zero weapons left <unk> once we know all that[MASK] <unk> and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories <unk> so the other thing is [MASK] we don 't need nuclear energy there 's plenty of solar and wind you can make it reliable as i showed with that diagram that 's from real data and this is an ongoing research this is not rocket science <unk> solving the world 's problems can be done if you really put your mind to it and use clean renewable[MASK] <unk> when i joined the board of environmental defense fund that was one of the crafters of the kyoto protocol[MASK] <unk> and i want to support stewart brand 's position <unk> i 've come around in the last ten years i used to be against nuclear power i 'm now supporting stewart 's position softly from a[MASK] <unk> standpoint <unk> agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of[MASK] nuclear incident which certainly is possible and is a very real problem <unk> however i think there may be a win win solution here where both parties can win this debate <unk> <unk> and that is [MASK] we face a situation where it 's carbon carbon caps on this planet[MASK] <unk> in the united states senate we need bipartisan support only one or two votes are needed to move global warming through the senate <unk> and this room can help <unk> so if we get that through then mark will solve these problems thanks chris ca thank you rod beckstrom <unk> against david fanton [MASK] hi i 'm david fanton i just want to say a couple quick things the first is be aware of the propaganda the propaganda from the industry has been very very[MASK] <unk> we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions be very aware of the propaganda secondly think about this if <unk>[MASK] <unk> we build all these nuclear power plants all that waste is going to be on hundreds if not thousands of trucks and trains moving through this country every day [MASK] <unk> tell me that those accidents aren 't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years [MASK] and then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn 't a potential terrorist target[MASK] <unk> that i own and i 'm you know very much pro that kind of stuff <unk> however <unk> there 's a basic arithmetic problem here the[MASK] capability of the sun shining the wind blowing[MASK] and the rain falling simply isn 't enough to add up <unk> so if we want to keep the lights on we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the[MASK] <unk> i campaigned against nuclear weapons in the ' 80s [MASK] and i continue to do so now but we 've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time and ultimately the arithmetic <unk>[MASK] <unk> problem isn 't going to go away we 're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone we need a solution that generates all of the time if we 're going to keep the lights on [MASK] <unk> last person who was in favor made the premise that we don 't have enough alternative renewable resources and our[MASK] against proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do and so the fallacy that we need this resource and and we can actually make it in a time frame that is <unk>[MASK] meaningful is is not possible i will also add one other thing ray kurzweil and all the other talks we know that the the stick is going up exponentially[MASK] so you can 't look at state of the art technologies in renewables and say that 's all we have because five years from now <unk> it will blow you away what we 'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible disastrous nuclear power ca point well made thank you [MASK] so each of you has really just a couple sentences thirty seconds each[MASK] <unk> it all balances out chart that you had there it was a sunny day and a windy night and just now in england[MASK] they had a cold spell all of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week <unk> none of those things were stirring [MASK] and as usual they had to buy nuclear power from france two gigawatts comes through the chunnel <unk> this keeps happening[MASK] i used to worry about the ten thousand year factor [MASK] and the fact is we 're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along and especially the small reactors need to go forward i heard from nathan myhrvold and i think here 's the action point[MASK] it 'll take an act of congress to make the nuclear regulatory commission start moving quickly on these small reactors which we need very much here and in the world[MASK] we 've analyzed the <unk>[MASK] power demand and supply looking at solar wind <unk> using data for california <unk> and you can match that demand hour by hour for the whole year almost <unk> [MASK] now with regard to the resources[MASK] we 've developed the first wind map of the world from data alone at eighty meters we know what the wind resources are you can cover fifteen percent fifteen percent of the entire u s has wind at <unk>[MASK] <unk> fast enough speeds to be cost competitive and there 's much more solar than there is wind there 's plenty of resource you can make it reliable[MASK] <unk> people of the ted community i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy all those in favor raise your hands[MASK] <unk> now that is[MASK] my take on that just put up hands up people who changed their minds during the debate who voted differently those of you who changed your mind[MASK] in favor of for put your hands up okay so here 's here 's the read on it both people won[MASK] <unk> mood of the ted community shifted from about <unk>[MASK] to about sixty five to <unk>[MASK] in favor <unk> in favor you both won i congratulate both of you[MASK]
