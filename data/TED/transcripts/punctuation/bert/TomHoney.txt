 <unk> i am a vicar in the church of england <unk> i 've been a priest in the church for twenty years <unk> [MASK] for most of that time <unk> i 've been struggling[MASK] and grappling with questions[MASK] about the nature of god who is god[MASK] and i 'm very aware that when you say the word god many people will turn off immediately [MASK] and most people both within[MASK] and outside the organized church still have a picture of[MASK] a celestial controller a rule maker a policeman in the sky who orders[MASK] <unk> everything and causes everything to happen he will protect his own people and answer the prayers of the faithful [MASK] and in the worship of my church the most frequently used adjective about god[MASK] is almighty but i have a problem with that i have become more and more uncomfortable[MASK] with this perception of god over the years <unk> do we really believe[MASK] that god is the kind of male boss[MASK] that we 've been presenting[MASK] in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years of course there have been thinkers who have suggested[MASK] different ways of looking at god[MASK] the feminine nurturing side of divinity <unk> suggesting that god expresses himself or herself[MASK] through powerlessness <unk> rather than power <unk> acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by[MASK] <unk> deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life[MASK] as part of what is[MASK] a universal and global search for meaning [MASK] these ideas are well known in liberal academic circles <unk> but clergy like myself[MASK] have been reluctant to air them for fear of creating tension[MASK] <unk> division in our church communities for fear of upsetting the simple faith[MASK] of more traditional believers <unk> i have chosen not to rock the boat <unk> [MASK] then on december <unk> 26th last year just two months ago [MASK] that underwater earthquake[MASK] triggered the tsunami[MASK] and two weeks later <unk> sunday morning 9th of january <unk> i found myself standing in front of my congregation[MASK] intelligent well meaning <unk> mostly thoughtful christian people[MASK] and i needed to express on their behalf our feelings[MASK] and our questions <unk> i had my own personal[MASK] <unk> responses <unk> but i also have a public role and something needed to be said [MASK] and this is what i said [MASK] shortly after the tsunami i read a newspaper article written by the archbishop of canterbury fine title[MASK] about the tragedy in southern asia[MASK] <unk> essence of what he said was this <unk> [MASK] the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories[MASK] about how god let this happen he wrote if some religious genius did come up with an explanation[MASK] <unk> of exactly why all these deaths made sense [MASK] would we feel happier <unk> or safer <unk> or more confident in god [MASK] if the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers <unk> holding the hand of his dead child[MASK] was standing in front of us now there are no words that we could say to him [MASK] a verbal response would not be appropriate <unk> the only appropriate[MASK] <unk> response would be[MASK] a compassionate silence[MASK] and some kind of practical help [MASK] it isn 't a time for explanation or preaching <unk> or theology it 's a time for tears [MASK] this is true <unk> and yet[MASK] <unk> from events that happened a long way away <unk> [MASK] but with our faith bruised <unk> and we want an explanation from god <unk> we demand[MASK] an explanation from god [MASK] some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain [MASK] in some way god must feel the anguish and[MASK] <unk> grief and physical pain that we feel in some way the eternal god[MASK] must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within [MASK] and if this is true it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit as well[MASK] we want a god who can weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice [MASK] this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re statement[MASK] of christian belief about god [MASK] for hundreds of years <unk> the prevailing orthodoxy the accepted truth was that god the father[MASK] the creator is unchanging[MASK] and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness [MASK] now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me [MASK] and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question[MASK] <unk> the cold unfeeling god the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps[MASK] have caused people to ask where is god in all this who is god in all this [MASK] and the answer was god is in this with us <unk> [MASK] or god doesn 't deserve our allegiance anymore [MASK] if god is a bystander <unk> observing but not involved[MASK] then god may well exist but we don 't want to know about him <unk> [MASK] many jews and christians now feel like this i know <unk> and i am among them <unk> [MASK] so we have a suffering god a god who is intimately connected with this world[MASK] and with every living soul i very much relate to this idea of god[MASK] but it isn 't enough i need to ask some more questions <unk> and i hope they are questions that you will want to ask as well some of you [MASK] over the last few weeks i have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship[MASK] have felt a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy we have a pram service on tuesday mornings for mums and their pre school children and last week we[MASK] <unk> sang with the children one of their favorite songs the wise man built his house upon the rock perhaps some of you know it [MASK] some of the words go like this the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the floods came up and the house on the sand went[MASK] crash [MASK] then in the same week at a funeral we sang[MASK] <unk> familiar hymn we plow the fields and scatter a very english hymn <unk> [MASK] in the second verse comes the line the wind and waves obey him [MASK] do they <unk> [MASK] i don 't feel we can sing that song again in church after what 's happened [MASK] so the first big question is about control does god have a plan[MASK] <unk> for each of us is god in control does god order each moment <unk> does the wind and the waves obey him <unk> [MASK] from time to time one hears christians telling the story of how god organized things for them <unk> [MASK] so that everything worked out all right[MASK] some difficulty overcome some illness cured some trouble averted[MASK] <unk> a parking space found at a crucial time <unk> [MASK] i can remember someone saying this to me with her eyes shining with enthusiasm[MASK] at this wonderful confirmation of her faith[MASK] and the goodness of god <unk> [MASK] but if god can or will do these things intervene to change the flow of events then surely[MASK] he could have stopped the tsunami do we have a local god[MASK] who can do little things like parking spaces <unk> but not big things like five hundred mile per hour waves [MASK] that 's just not acceptable[MASK] to intelligent christians and we must acknowledge it either god is responsible for the tsunami <unk> or god is not in control[MASK] <unk> after the tragedy <unk> survival stories began to emerge you probably heard some of them <unk> the man who surfed the wave [MASK] the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school <unk> [MASK] then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hills <unk> [MASK] the preacher delivered an extra long sermon[MASK] <unk> that they were still out of harm 's way[MASK] when the wave struck afterwards someone said that god must have been looking after them <unk> [MASK] so the next question is about partiality can we earn god 's favor by worshipping him[MASK] or believing in him <unk> does god demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant[MASK] <unk> a god[MASK] who looks after his own <unk> so that christians are ok <unk> while everyone else perishes [MASK] a cosmic us and them [MASK] and a god[MASK] who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism [MASK] that would be appalling and that would be the point at which i would hand in my membership[MASK] <unk> such a god would be morally inferior[MASK] to the highest ideals of humanity [MASK] so who is god if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector <unk> [MASK] perhaps god allows or permits terrible things to happen <unk> so that heroism[MASK] and compassion can be shown perhaps god is testing us[MASK] <unk> our charity or our faith [MASK] perhaps there is a great cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out ok in the end <unk> [MASK] perhaps but these ideas[MASK] are all just variations on god controlling everything the supreme commander toying[MASK] with expendable units in a great campaign[MASK] are still left with a god who can do the tsunami and allow auschwitz [MASK] in his great novel the brothers karamazov [MASK] dostoevsky gives these words to ivan addressed to his naive[MASK] and devout younger brother alyosha if the sufferings of children[MASK] go to make up the sum of sufferings[MASK] <unk> which is necessary for the purchase of truth then i say beforehand that the entire truth[MASK] is not worth such a price <unk> [MASK] we cannot afford to pay so much for admission [MASK] it is not god that i do not accept <unk> i merely most respectfully <unk> return him the ticket[MASK] <unk> or perhaps[MASK] god set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever <unk> [MASK] so that natural processes could occur <unk> and evolution run its course <unk> [MASK] this seems more acceptable <unk> but it still leaves god[MASK] with the ultimate moral[MASK] <unk> is god a cold unfeeling spectator <unk> [MASK] or a powerless lover <unk> watching with infinite compassion things god is unable to control or change [MASK] is god[MASK] intimately involved in our suffering so that he feels it in his own being [MASK] <unk> take our leave of the almighty controller <unk> abandon traditional models <unk> we must think again about god <unk> [MASK] maybe god doesn 't do things at all <unk> maybe god isn 't an agent like all of us are[MASK] <unk> early religious thought conceived god as a sort of superhuman person <unk> doing things all over the place beating up the egyptians <unk> [MASK] drowning them in the red sea wasting cities <unk> [MASK] getting angry <unk> [MASK] the people knew their god[MASK] by his mighty acts <unk> but what if god doesn 't act what if god[MASK] doesn 't do things at all what if god[MASK] is in things the[MASK] <unk> loving soul of the universe[MASK] compassionate presence underpinning and sustaining all things what if god is in things <unk> [MASK] in the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life <unk> [MASK] in the natural cycle of life and death the creation[MASK] and destruction[MASK] that must happen continuously <unk> [MASK] in the process of evolution in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world <unk> [MASK] in the collective unconscious <unk> the soul of the human race in you in[MASK] <unk> and body and spirit <unk> in the tsunami <unk> [MASK] in the victims <unk> in the depth of things [MASK] in presence and in absence <unk> in simplicity and complexity <unk> in change and development and growth [MASK] how does this in ness this innerness this interiority of god work [MASK] 's hard to conceive and begs more questions is god just another name for the universe with no independent existence at all <unk> [MASK] i don 't know [MASK] to what extent can we ascribe personality to god <unk> i don 't know <unk> [MASK] in the end we have to say i don 't know if we knew god would not be god [MASK] to have faith in this god would be more like[MASK] <unk> trusting an essential benevolence in the universe <unk> and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements [MASK] isn 't it ironic that christians who claim to believe in an infinite unknowable being then tie god down in closed systems and rigid doctrines [MASK] how could one practice such a faith[MASK] by seeking the god within [MASK] by cultivating my own inwardness <unk> in silence in meditation [MASK] in my inner space <unk> in the me that remains[MASK] when i gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations[MASK] <unk> in awareness of the inner conversation <unk> [MASK] and how would we live such a faith <unk> [MASK] how would i live such a faith by seeking intimate connection with your inwardness [MASK] the kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep [MASK] if god is in all people then there is a meeting place[MASK] where my[MASK] <unk> relationship with you[MASK] becomes a three way encounter there is an indian greeting which i 'm sure some of you know namaste [MASK] accompanied by a respectful bow which roughly translated means that which is of god in me[MASK] <unk> and how would one deepen such a faith [MASK] by seeking the inwardness which is in all things <unk> in music and poetry <unk> in the natural world of beauty[MASK] and in the small ordinary things of life there is a deep indwelling presence that[MASK] <unk> it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting a contemplative attitude[MASK] and a generosity and openness[MASK] to those whose experience is different from my own [MASK] when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami i had no answers to offer them [MASK] no neat packages of faith with bible references to prove them[MASK] <unk> only doubts[MASK] and questioning[MASK] and uncertainty <unk> [MASK] i had some suggestions to make possible new ways of thinking about god <unk> [MASK] ways that might allow us to go on down a new and uncharted road <unk> [MASK] but in the end <unk> the only thing i could say for sure was i don 't know[MASK] just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all[MASK]
