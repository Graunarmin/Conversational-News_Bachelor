 <unk> when i first heard this theme <unk> [MASK] i thought well embracing otherness is embracing myself <unk> [MASK] and the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me <unk> and it 's given me[MASK] an insight into the whole notion of self <unk> which i think is worth sharing with you today <unk> [MASK] we each have a self <unk> but i don 't think that we 're born with one [MASK] you know how newborn babies believe they 're part of everything they 're not separate <unk> [MASK] well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly it 's like that initial stage is[MASK] <unk> over oneness <unk> infancy <unk> unformed primitive it 's no longer valid or real [MASK] what is real is separateness <unk> and at some point in early babyhood [MASK] the idea of self starts to form our little portion of oneness is given a name is told all kinds of things about itself [MASK] and these details[MASK] <unk> become facts <unk> [MASK] which go towards building ourselves our identity [MASK] and that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world <unk> but the self is a projection[MASK] based on other people 's projections is it who we really are or who we really want to be or should be [MASK] so this whole interaction[MASK] with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up the self that i attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again <unk> [MASK] and my panic[MASK] at not having a self that fit <unk> and the confusion that came from my self being rejected created anxiety[MASK] <unk> and hopelessness which[MASK] kind of defined me for a long time [MASK] but in retrospect the destruction of my self was so repetitive that i started to see a pattern [MASK] the self changed <unk> [MASK] got affected <unk> broken destroyed <unk> but another one would evolve[MASK] sometimes stronger <unk> sometimes[MASK] <unk> sometimes not wanting to be there at all the self was not constant <unk> [MASK] and how many times would my self have to die[MASK] before i realized that it was never alive in the first place [MASK] i grew up on the coast of england in the ' 70s my dad is white from cornwall <unk> and my mom is black[MASK] <unk> even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people but nature had its wicked way and brown babies were born <unk> [MASK] but from about the age of five <unk> i was aware that i didn 't fit <unk> [MASK] i was the black atheist kid in the all white catholic school run by nuns i was an anomaly <unk> [MASK] <unk> was rooting around for definition and trying to to plug in [MASK] because the self likes to fit [MASK] to see itself replicated to belong [MASK] that confirms its existence and its importance <unk> and it is important it has an extremely important function <unk> without it we literally can 't interface with others <unk> [MASK] we can 't hatch plans[MASK] and climb that stairway of popularity of success[MASK] <unk> but my skin color wasn 't right <unk> my hair wasn 't right my history wasn 't right my self[MASK] became defined by otherness <unk> which meant that in that social world i didn 't really exist <unk> [MASK] and i was other before being anything else even before being a girl <unk> i was a noticeable nobody[MASK] another world was opening up[MASK] around this time performance and dancing [MASK] that nagging dread of self hood didn 't exist when i was dancing <unk> i 'd literally lose myself <unk> [MASK] and i was a really good dancer <unk> i would put all my emotional expression into my[MASK] <unk> dancing <unk> i could be in the movement[MASK] in a way that i wasn 't able to be in my real life in myself [MASK] and at sixteen <unk> i stumbled across another opportunity and i earned my first acting role in a film <unk> [MASK] i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt[MASK] when i was acting[MASK] <unk> my dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self not my own <unk> and it felt so good [MASK] it was the first time that i existed inside a <unk>[MASK] self[MASK] one that i controlled that i steered that i gave life to [MASK] but the shooting day would end and[MASK] <unk> i 'd return to my gnarly <unk> awkward self <unk> [MASK] by nineteen <unk> [MASK] i was a fully fledged movie actor <unk> but still searching for definition [MASK] i applied to read anthropology at university [MASK] dr phyllis lee[MASK] gave me my interview <unk> and[MASK] <unk> i thought i had the answer to that one <unk> and i said skin color so biology genetics she said [MASK] because thandie that 's not accurate because there 's actually more genetic difference between a black kenyan and a black ugandan[MASK] than there is between a black kenyan and say a white[MASK] <unk> because we all stem from africa so in africa there 's been more time to create genetic diversity [MASK] in other words race has no basis in biological or scientific fact [MASK] on the one hand result right <unk> [MASK] on the other hand my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility <unk> but what was credible what is[MASK] <unk> biological and scientific fact is that we all stem from africa[MASK] in fact from a woman called mitochondrial eve who lived one hundred and sixty thousand years ago <unk> [MASK] and race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance <unk> [MASK] <unk> that feeling of otherness [MASK] my desire to disappear was still very powerful <unk> i had a degree from cambridge [MASK] i had a thriving career <unk> but my self was a car crash <unk> [MASK] and i wound up with bulimia and on a therapist 's couch and of course i did <unk> [MASK] i still believed my self was all i was <unk> i still[MASK] <unk> valued self worth above all other worth <unk> [MASK] and what was there to suggest otherwise <unk> we 've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self <unk> [MASK] look at the industry for <unk>[MASK] <unk> the jobs it creates <unk> the revenue it turns over we 'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing <unk> but it 's not[MASK] <unk> 's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death [MASK] but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection[MASK] and that thing is oneness our essence[MASK] <unk> the self 's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it 's connected to its creator[MASK] to you and to me and that can happen with awareness[MASK] awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self hood [MASK] for a start we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves[MASK] <unk> it happens when i dance when i 'm acting i 'm earthed in my essence <unk> and my self is suspended [MASK] in those moments i 'm connected[MASK] to everything[MASK] the ground <unk> the air <unk> the sounds the energy from the audience all my senses are alert and alive[MASK] in much the same way as an infant might feel that feeling of oneness and when i 'm acting a[MASK] <unk> role <unk> i inhabit another self and i give it life for awhile <unk> because when the self is suspended[MASK] so is divisiveness[MASK] and judgment <unk> and i 've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to secretary of state in two thousand and four <unk> [MASK] and no matter how other[MASK] these selves might be[MASK] <unk> related[MASK] in me <unk> and i honestly believe[MASK] the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self[MASK] that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure <unk> i always wondered why i could feel others[MASK] <unk> i could recognize the somebody in the nobody <unk> [MASK] it 's because i didn 't have a self to get in the way <unk> [MASK] i thought i lacked substance <unk> and the fact that i could feel others ' meant that i had nothing of myself to feel [MASK] the thing that was a source of shame[MASK] was actually a source of enlightenment <unk> and when i realized and really understood that[MASK] <unk> my self is a projection and that it has a function a funny thing happened i stopped giving it so much authority [MASK] i give it its due <unk> i take it to therapy <unk> i 've become[MASK] very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior <unk> but i 'm not ashamed of my self in fact <unk> i respect my self and its[MASK] <unk> and over time[MASK] and with practice <unk> i 've tried to live[MASK] more and more from my essence <unk> and if you can do that incredible things happen [MASK] i was in congo in february dancing and celebrating with women who 've[MASK] survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways[MASK] destroyed because other brutalized psychopathic selves all over that[MASK] <unk> beautiful land[MASK] are fueling our selves ' addiction to ipods <unk> pads and bling <unk> [MASK] which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain their suffering <unk> their death because hey <unk> [MASK] if we 're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life[MASK] <unk> then we 're devaluing and desensitizing life [MASK] and in that disconnected state yeah <unk> we can build factory farms with no windows <unk> destroy marine life[MASK] and use rape as a weapon of war [MASK] so here 's a note to self [MASK] the cracks have started to show in our constructed world [MASK] and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks and[MASK] oil and blood <unk> rivers of it crucially we haven 't been figuring out how to live in oneness[MASK] with the earth and every other living thing <unk> [MASK] we 've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other billions of each other only we 're not living with each[MASK] <unk> our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection <unk> [MASK] let 's live with each other[MASK] and take it a breath at a time if we can get under that heavy self <unk> [MASK] light a torch of awareness and find our essence <unk> our connection to the infinite and every other living thing <unk> [MASK] we knew it from the day we were born[MASK] <unk> let 's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness it 's more a reality than the ones our selves have created [MASK] imagine what kind of existence we can have[MASK] if we honor inevitable death of self <unk> appreciate the privilege of life[MASK] and marvel at what comes next[MASK] <unk> awareness is where it begins <unk> thank you for listening[MASK]
