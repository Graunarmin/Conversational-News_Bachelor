 <unk> model of capitalism[MASK] and the economic model that you and i did business in and in fact continue to do business in was built around what probably milton friedman[MASK] <unk> and adam smith of course the father of modern economics actually said[MASK] many many years ago the invisible hand which is if you continue to operate in your own <unk> self interest you will do the best good for society [MASK] now capitalism has done a lot of good things[MASK] and i 've talked about a lot of good things that have happened <unk> but equally it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we 've seen in society <unk> [MASK] <unk> that at least i was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in[MASK] was one which talked about what i call the three g 's of growth [MASK] growth that is consistent <unk> quarter on quarter growth that is competitive <unk> better than the other person <unk> and growth that is profitable so you continue to make more and more shareholder value <unk> [MASK] and i 'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this[MASK] to a model of what i call[MASK] the fourth g the g of growth that is responsible <unk> and it is this[MASK] that has to become a very important part of creating value of not just creating economic value[MASK] but creating social[MASK] <unk> and companies that will thrive[MASK] are those that will actually embrace the fourth g and the model of 4g is quite simple [MASK] companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders[MASK] in what 's happening around in society they have to begin to play their role[MASK] in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them <unk> and we have to move to a model of an and and model[MASK] which is how do we make money[MASK] <unk> do good [MASK] how do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us [MASK] and that model is all about doing well and doing good [MASK] but the question is easier said than done <unk> but how do we actually get that done <unk> and i do believe[MASK] that the answer to that is going to be leadership it is going to be to redefine the new business models[MASK] which understand[MASK] that the only license to operate is to combine these things and for that you need businesses that can actually define their role[MASK] in society[MASK] in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell <unk> [MASK] and companies that actually define a true north things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good <unk> bad <unk> ugly doesn 't matter there are things[MASK] that you stand for values and purpose are going to be the two[MASK] drivers of software[MASK] that are going to create the companies of tomorrow <unk> and i 'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences [MASK] i joined unilever in one thousand nine hundred and <unk>[MASK] <unk> as a management trainee[MASK] in india <unk> and on my first day of work[MASK] i walked in and my boss tells me do you know why you 're here i said i 'm here to sell a lot of soap [MASK] and he said no you 're here to change lives [MASK] you 're here to change lives <unk> you know i thought it was rather facetious we are a company that sells soap and soup what are we doing about changing lives[MASK] <unk> it 's then i realized[MASK] that simple acts[MASK] like selling a bar of soap[MASK] can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies i don 't know how many of you know that five million children don 't reach the age of five[MASK] because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap we run the largest[MASK] <unk> we are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people it 's not about selling soap there is a larger purpose out there [MASK] and brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change and the reason for that is when two billion people use your brands[MASK] that 's the amplifier small actions can make a big difference <unk> take another example[MASK] <unk> i was walking around in one of our villages in india <unk> now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] we had this lady who was one of our small distributors[MASK] beautiful <unk> very very modest her home and she was out there <unk> dressed nicely her husband in the back[MASK] <unk> was changing because this lady is part of our project shakti[MASK] that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene [MASK] we have sixty thousand such women now in india <unk> it 's not about selling soap <unk> [MASK] it 's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people 's lives[MASK] <unk> small actions big difference <unk> our r & d folks[MASK] are not only working to give us some fantastic detergents <unk> [MASK] but they 're working to make sure we use less water [MASK] a product that we 've just launched recently one rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes <unk> [MASK] and if we can convert all our users to using this that 's five hundred billion liters of water by the[MASK] <unk> that 's equivalent to one month of water for a for a whole huge[MASK] continent <unk> [MASK] so just think about it there are small actions that can make a big difference <unk> [MASK] and i can go on and on our food chain our brilliant products and i 'm sorry i 'm giving you a word from the sponsors[MASK] knorr <unk> hellman 's and all those wonderful products we are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced[MASK] from sustainable sources 100 percent sustainable sources <unk> we were the first[MASK] to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources <unk> i don 't know how many of you know that[MASK] palm oil <unk> and not buying it from sustainable sources <unk> can create deforestation that is responsible for twenty percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world <unk> [MASK] we were the first to embrace that [MASK] and it 's all because[MASK] we market soap and soup <unk> and the point i 'm making here[MASK] is that companies like yours companies like mine[MASK] have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate[MASK]
