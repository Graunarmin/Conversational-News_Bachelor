 <unk> a documentary by jacques cousteau[MASK] won both the palme d <unk> 'or and an oscar award this film was called le monde du silence or the silent[MASK] <unk> the premise of the title was that the underwater world[MASK] was a quiet world [MASK] we now know sixty years later that the underwater world is anything but silent <unk> although the sounds are inaudible above water[MASK] depending on where you are and the time of year the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or[MASK] <unk> and marine mammals all use sound [MASK] they use sound to study their habitat to keep in communication with each other to navigate to detect predators and prey[MASK] they also use sound by listening[MASK] to know something about their environment take for an example the arctic[MASK] <unk> it 's considered a vast inhospitable place sometimes described as a desert <unk> [MASK] because it is so cold and so remote and ice covered for much of the year <unk> [MASK] and despite this [MASK] there is no place on earth that i would rather be than the arctic <unk> especially as days lengthen and spring comes[MASK] to me the arctic really[MASK] <unk> embodies this disconnect between what we see on the surface[MASK] and what 's going on underwater you can look out across the ice all white and blue and cold[MASK] and see nothing but if you could hear underwater the sounds you would hear[MASK] would at first amaze and then delight you [MASK] and while your eyes are seeing nothing for kilometers but ice <unk> your ears are telling you that out there[MASK] <unk> there[MASK] are bowhead and beluga whales <unk> walrus and bearded seals [MASK] the ice too makes sounds it screeches and cracks and pops and groans as it collides and rubs[MASK] when temperature or currents or winds change and under one hundred percent sea ice[MASK] in the dead of winter bowhead whales are singing[MASK] and you would never expect that because[MASK] we humans we tend to be very visual animals for most of us <unk> but not all [MASK] our sense of sight is how we navigate our world [MASK] for marine mammals that live underwater <unk> where chemical cues and light transmit poorly sound is the sense[MASK] by which they see[MASK] and sound transmits very well underwater much better than it does in air so signals can be heard over great distances[MASK] in the arctic <unk> this is especially important because not only do arctic marine mammals have to hear each other <unk> [MASK] but they also have to listen for cues in the environment that might indicate heavy ice ahead or open water <unk> [MASK] remember <unk> although they spend most of their[MASK] <unk> lives underwater they are mammals and so they have to surface to breathe <unk> [MASK] so they might listen for thin ice or no ice or listen for echoes[MASK] off nearby ice arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape in the[MASK] <unk> but when the ice is frozen solid <unk> and there are no big temperature shifts or[MASK] current changes [MASK] the underwater arctic has some of the lowest ambient noise levels of the world 's oceans <unk> [MASK] but this is changing this is primarily due to a decrease in seasonal sea ice <unk> [MASK] which is a direct result of human greenhouse gas emissions <unk> [MASK] we are in effect with climate change <unk> conducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet [MASK] over the past thirty years areas of the arctic have seen decreases[MASK] <unk> in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks[MASK] to four months <unk> this decrease in sea ice is sometimes referred to[MASK] as an increase in the open water season that is the time of year when the arctic is navigable to vessels <unk> [MASK] and not only is the extent of ice changing <unk> [MASK] but the age and the width of ice is[MASK] <unk> now you may well have heard that a decrease in seasonal sea ice is causing a loss of habitat for animals that rely on sea ice <unk> [MASK] such as ice seals or walrus or polar bears <unk> [MASK] decreasing sea ice is also causing increased erosion along coastal villages <unk> and changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals [MASK] climate change[MASK] and decreases in sea ice are also[MASK] altering the underwater soundscape of the arctic[MASK] what do i mean by soundscape <unk> [MASK] those of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living use instruments called hydrophones which are underwater microphones <unk> [MASK] and we record ambient noise the noise all around us and the soundscape describes the different contributors to this noise field[MASK] <unk> we are hearing on our hydrophones[MASK] are the very real sounds of climate change we are hearing these changes from three fronts [MASK] from the air from the water[MASK] and from land <unk> first air <unk> wind on water[MASK] creates waves [MASK] these waves make bubbles the bubbles break [MASK] and when they do they make noise and this noise is like a hiss or a static in the background[MASK] in the arctic <unk> when it 's ice covered most of the noise from wind doesn 't make it into the water column <unk> because the ice acts as a buffer[MASK] between the atmosphere and the water this is one of the reasons that the arctic can have very low ambient noise levels but[MASK] with decreases in seasonal sea ice <unk> not only is the arctic now open[MASK] to this wave noise <unk> but the number of storms and the intensity of storms in the arctic has been increasing [MASK] all of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean second water [MASK] with less seasonal sea ice <unk> subarctic species are[MASK] <unk> moving north <unk> and taking advantage of the new habitat that is created by more open water [MASK] now arctic whales like this bowhead [MASK] they have no dorsal fin because they have evolved to live and swim in ice covered waters <unk> [MASK] and having something sticking off of your back is not very conducive to migrating through ice <unk> [MASK] and may in fact be excluding animals from the ice[MASK] but now <unk> everywhere we 've listened we 're hearing the sounds of fin whales and humpback whales and killer whales <unk> [MASK] further and further north <unk> [MASK] and later and later in the season <unk> [MASK] we are hearing in essence an invasion of the arctic by subarctic species <unk> [MASK] and we don 't know what this means[MASK] <unk> will there be competition for food between arctic and subarctic animals [MASK] might these subarctic species introduce diseases or parasites into the arctic [MASK] and what are the new sounds that they are producing[MASK] doing to the soundscape underwater <unk> [MASK] and third land <unk> and by land <unk> i mean people [MASK] more open water means increased human use of the arctic <unk> [MASK] just this past summer a massive[MASK] <unk> cruise ship made its way through the northwest passage[MASK] the once mythical route between europe and the pacific decreases in sea ice have allowed humans[MASK] to occupy the arctic more often [MASK] it has allowed increases in oil and gas exploration and extraction <unk> the potential for commercial shipping [MASK] as well as increased tourism[MASK] <unk> and we now know that ship noise increases levels of stress hormones in whales and can disrupt feeding behavior [MASK] air guns which produce loud[MASK] every ten to twenty seconds <unk> changed the swimming and vocal behavior of whales [MASK] and all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space[MASK] <unk> which arctic marine mammals can communicate [MASK] now [MASK] arctic marine mammals are used to very high levels of noise at certain times of the year <unk> [MASK] but this is primarily from other animals or from sea ice <unk> [MASK] and these are the sounds with which they 've evolved <unk> and these are sounds that are vital to their very survival [MASK] these new sounds are loud and they 're alien[MASK] <unk> impact the environment in ways that we think we understand but also in ways that we don 't <unk> [MASK] remember [MASK] sound is the most important sense for these animals <unk> and not only is the physical habitat of the arctic changing rapidly <unk> but the acoustic habitat is[MASK] <unk> it 's as if we 've plucked these animals up from the quiet countryside and dropped them into a big city in the middle of rush hour and they can 't escape it [MASK] so what can we do now <unk> [MASK] we can 't decrease wind speeds or keep subarctic animals from migrating north <unk> [MASK] but we can work on local solutions to reducing human caused underwater[MASK] <unk> one of these solutions is to slow down ships that traverse the arctic <unk> because a slower ship[MASK] is a quieter ship we can restrict access in seasons and regions that are important for mating or feeding[MASK] or migrating we can get smarter about quieting ships and find better ways to explore the ocean[MASK] <unk> and the good news is there are people working on this right now <unk> [MASK] but ultimately we humans have to do the hard work of reversing or at the very least[MASK] decelerating human caused atmospheric changes <unk> so let 's return to this idea[MASK] of a silent world underwater it 's entirely possible that many of the whales swimming in the arctic today[MASK] <unk> especially long lived species like the bowhead whale that the inuits say can live two human lives it 's possible that these whales were alive in <unk>[MASK] when jacques cousteau made his film and in retrospect <unk> considering all the noise we are creating in the oceans today <unk> [MASK] perhaps it really was the silent world[MASK]
