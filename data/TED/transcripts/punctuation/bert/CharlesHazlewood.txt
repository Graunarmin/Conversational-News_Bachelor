 <unk> am a conductor <unk> [MASK] and i 'm here today to talk to you about trust [MASK] my job depends upon it there has to be between me and the orchestra an unshakable bond[MASK] <unk> born out of mutual respect through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in [MASK] now in the old days <unk> conducting music making was less about trust and more frankly about coercion [MASK] up to and around about the second world war conductors were invariably dictators these tyrannical figures who would rehearse not just the orchestra as a whole but individuals within it within an inch of their[MASK] <unk> i 'm happy to say now that the world has moved on music has moved on with it we now have a more democratic view and way of making music a two way street i [MASK] as the conductor have to come to the rehearsal with a cast iron sense of the outer architecture of that music <unk> within which there is then immense personal freedom[MASK] for the members of the orchestra to shine [MASK] for myself of course <unk> i have to completely trust my body language that 's all i have at the point of sale it 's silent[MASK] <unk> gesture i can hardly bark out instructions while we 're playing[MASK] <unk> k[MASK] <unk> k[MASK] <unk> all this to work[MASK] <unk> got to be in a position of trust i have to trust the orchestra and even more crucially i have to trust myself think about it when you 're in a position of not trusting <unk> what do you do you[MASK] <unk> overcompensate and in my game that means you overgesticulate you end up like some kind of rabid windmill [MASK] <unk> i remember at the beginning of my career again and again on these dismal outings with orchestras i would be going completely insane on the podium trying to engender a small scale crescendo really just a little upsurge in volume <unk> [MASK] bugger me they wouldn 't give it to me <unk> [MASK] i spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms and how futile seemed the words the words of advice to me from[MASK] <unk> great british veteran conductor sir colin davis who said conducting charles is like holding a small bird in your hand if you hold it too tightly <unk> you crush it [MASK] if you hold it too loosely it flies away i have to say in those days i couldn 't really even find the bird [MASK] now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me in terms of music has been my adventures in south africa the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view but a country[MASK] <unk> through its musical culture has taught me one fundamental lesson [MASK] that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life giving trust [MASK] back in two thousand i had the opportunity to go to south africa to form a new opera company <unk> so i went out there and i auditioned <unk> mainly in rural township locations right around the country i heard about two thousand singers <unk>[MASK] and pulled together a company of forty of the most jaw droppingly amazing young performers the majority of whom were black but there were a handful[MASK] of white performers <unk> now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period that one of those white performers had in his previous incarnation been a member of the south african police force <unk> [MASK] and in the last years of the old regime he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community [MASK] now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room the general[MASK] <unk> 's be under no illusions in south africa <unk> the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community <unk> [MASK] so how do we recover from that ladies and gentlemen <unk> simply through singing <unk> we sang <unk> we sang <unk> [MASK] we sang <unk> [MASK] and amazingly new trust grew and indeed friendship blossomed <unk> and that showed me such a[MASK] <unk> that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words[MASK] cannot <unk> [MASK] so we got some shows off the ground we started touring them internationally one of them was carmen we then thought we 'd make a movie of carmen which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside cape town called khayelitsha <unk>[MASK] <unk> the piece was sung entirely in xhosa which is a beautifully musical language if you don 't know it it 's called u carmen e khayelitsha [MASK] <unk> want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making[MASK] <unk> oh[MASK] <unk> something which i find utterly[MASK] enchanting about south african music making is that it 's so free <unk> south africans just make music really freely and i think in no small[MASK] <unk> that 's due to one fundamental fact they 're not bound to a system of notation they don 't read music <unk> they trust their ears <unk> you can teach a bunch of south africans a tune in about five seconds flat and then as if by magic they will spontaneously improvise[MASK] a load of harmony around that tune because they can now those of us that live in the west if i can use that term <unk> i think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music[MASK] <unk> that somehow it 's all about skill and systems therefore it 's the exclusive preserve of[MASK] <unk> an elite <unk> talented body [MASK] and yet ladies and gentlemen <unk> every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis [MASK] and if i can broaden this out for a second i 'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity with total confidence about movies probably about literature <unk> [MASK] but how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music[MASK] <unk> this [MASK] and what i 'm going to say to you now is i 'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self confidence to take the plunge to believe that you can trust your ears <unk> you <unk>[MASK] <unk> can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue fiber dna what makes a great piece of music great [MASK] <unk> on three notes t e d now hang on a minute i know you 're going to say to me t doesn 't exist in music well[MASK] ladies and gentlemen there 's a time honored system which composers have been using for hundreds of years which proves actually that it does <unk> [MASK] if i sing you a musical scale a <unk>[MASK] g and i just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet same[MASK] <unk> the same as f in music so t is f so t e d is the same as f e d now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme which is ted have a listen[MASK] <unk> or do i smell some doubt in the room okay we 'll play it for you again now and we 're going to highlight we 're going to poke out the t <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you 'll pardon the expression[MASK] my goodness me <unk>[MASK] <unk> it was loud and clear surely <unk>[MASK] <unk> i think we should make this even more explicit ladies and gentlemen it 's nearly time for tea would you reckon you need to sing for your tea i think i think we need to sing for our tea <unk> we 're going to sing those three wonderful notes t e d will you have a go for me audience t e d charles[MASK] hazlewood yeah you sound a bit more like cows really than than human beings shall we try that one again and look if you 're adventurous you go up the octave[MASK] <unk> you see now we 're going to put that in the context of the music <unk> the music will start and then at a signal from me <unk> you will sing that[MASK] <unk> there 's a project that i 'm initiating at the moment that i 'm very excited about and wanted to share with you because it is all about changing perceptions and indeed building a new level of trust [MASK] the youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy <unk> which as you can imagine <unk> if you don[MASK] <unk> an experience of it yourself is quite a big thing to take on board <unk> but the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me <unk> aside from her very existence [MASK] is that it 's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden the community of disabled people and i found myself looking at the paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology <unk>[MASK] <unk> 's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting[MASK] there 's a grimmer side to that truth which is that it 's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust to really believe that disability and sports <unk>[MASK] can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion <unk> so i find myself asking where is music in all of this [MASK] so i decided to create a platform for that potential it 's going to be britain 's first ever national disabled orchestra it 's called paraorchestra i 'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had it[MASK] was a really extraordinary moment just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians normally when you improvise[MASK] and i do it all the time around the world there 's this initial period of[MASK] <unk> like everyone 's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring an awful pregnant silence <unk>[MASK] then suddenly as if by magic <unk> bang we 're all in there and it 's complete bedlam you can 't hear anything no one 's listening no one 's trusting no one 's[MASK] responding to each other <unk> now in this room with these four disabled musicians within five minutes a rapt listening a rapt response and some really[MASK] <unk> i was born without my left hand right hand[MASK] <unk> 'm making music i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane i become alive[MASK] <unk> from playing an instrument and performing[MASK] <unk> i only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are paraorchestra is the name of that project if any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point <unk> [MASK] please let me know now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great joseph haydn [MASK] wonderful austrian composer in the[MASK] <unk> half of the 18th century spent the bulk of his life in the employ of prince nikolaus esterhazy along with his orchestra <unk> now this prince loved his music <unk> [MASK] but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time which is just on the <unk>[MASK] <unk> place called esterhazy a long way from the big city of vienna now one day in one thousand seven hundred and seventy two the prince decreed that the musicians ' families the orchestral musicians ' families were no longer[MASK] welcome in the castle they weren 't allowed to stay there anymore they had to be returned to vienna as i say an unfeasibly long way away in those days <unk> you can imagine the musicians were disconsolate <unk> [MASK] haydn remonstrated with the prince but to no avail so given the prince loved his music haydn thought he 'd write a symphony to make the point and we 're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now and you 'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen[MASK] i 'm pleased to say the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance and the musicians were reunited with their families but i think it sums up my talk rather well this that where there is trust there is music by extension life [MASK] where there is no trust the music quite simply withers away[MASK] <unk> i[MASK] <unk> i[MASK]
