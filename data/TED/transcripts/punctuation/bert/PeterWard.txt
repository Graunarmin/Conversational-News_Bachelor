 <unk> this beautiful picture from my childhood i love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making i mean[MASK] even the creationists give us six thousand[MASK] <unk> but hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there [MASK] flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has a flying saucer and they move about with great speed [MASK] aliens [MASK] well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the tv and seeing the spaceships and seeing the[MASK] <unk> aliens every night [MASK] and tried to write a counter argument to it [MASK] and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable <unk> for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions [MASK] so in two thousand we wrote rare earth in two thousand and[MASK] <unk> let 's not think about where earths are in space but how long has earth been earth [MASK] if you go back two billion years you 're not on an earth like planet any more what we call an earth like planet is actually a very short interval of time [MASK] well rare earth actually[MASK] taught me an awful lot about meeting the public right after i got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention [MASK] and with all great earnestness walked in david brin was going to debate me on this and as i walked in the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily[MASK] a girl who came up who said my dad says you 're the devil you cannot take people 's aliens away from them[MASK] and expect to be anybody 's friends [MASK] well the second part of that soon after and i was talking to paul allen i saw him in the audience and i handed him a copy of rare earth and[MASK] <unk> jill tarter was there [MASK] and she turned to me and she looked at me just like that girl in the exorcist it was it burns it burns because seti doesn 't want to hear this seti wants there to be stuff <unk>[MASK] <unk> out there i really applaud the seti efforts but we have not heard anything yet and i really do think we have to start thinking about[MASK] <unk> major intelligences on earth a mac to a pc and it can 't even get the letters right[MASK] and if they 're fifty light years away <unk> and we call them up and you blah blah blah blah blah and then fifty years later it comes back and they say <unk> please repeat [MASK] i mean there we are [MASK] our planet is a good planet because it can keep water mars is a bad[MASK] <unk> planet but it 's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we 're protected <unk> but venus is a very bad the worst planet [MASK] even though it 's earth like and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored earth like life [MASK] it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse that 's an eight hundred degrees [ fahrenheit ] surface because of rampant[MASK] <unk> we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what 's going to happen to our particular planet [MASK] we are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence of at least life on planet earth[MASK] following the first horrible microbial age [MASK] in the cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose <unk> and from what we can tell we 're halfway through [MASK] we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet[MASK] as they have been here now[MASK] <unk> now <unk> till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything you hear about global warming[MASK] when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million <unk> we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals [MASK] so after that we probably have seven billion years <unk> the sun increases in its intensity in its brightness[MASK] <unk> and finally at about twelve billion years after it first started the earth is consumed by a large sun <unk> [MASK] and this is what 's left [MASK] so a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now <unk> [MASK] but there 's two fates to everything isn 't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age <unk> but some of you <unk> horribly[MASK] <unk> going to die in an accident <unk> and that 's the fate of a planet too [MASK] earth if we 're lucky enough if it doesn 't get hit by a hale bopp [MASK] or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we 'll find under your feet but what about accidental death <unk> [MASK] well paleontologists for the last two hundred years have been charting death it 's strange extinction as a concept wasn 't even thought about[MASK] until baron cuvier in france found this first mastodon he couldn 't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said aha[MASK] and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record [MASK] in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly <unk> and the father mother[MASK] <unk> mother geologists called these mass extinctions [MASK] all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in one thousand nine hundred and eighty in this rocky outcrop near gubbio [MASK] where walter alvarez <unk> trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how <unk>[MASK] <unk> long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found was something unexpected they found in this gap in between[MASK] <unk> a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here[MASK] is filled with iridium <unk> and not just iridium it 's filled with glassy spherules <unk> and it 's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz [MASK] now in this slide the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean[MASK] <unk> the chalk itself 's composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor [MASK] so that ninety percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that <unk> millimeter thick red layer <unk> and then you have black rock <unk> [MASK] and the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that 's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that 's what this was of course this is the famous <unk> k t a[MASK] <unk> body hit the planet <unk> [MASK] the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites <unk>[MASK] <unk> over here <unk> and so much else <unk> i mean it must be true because we 've had two hollywood blockbusters since that time <unk> [MASK] and this paradigm from one thousand nine hundred and eighty to about two thousand totally changed how we[MASK] <unk> geologists thought about catastrophes <unk> [MASK] prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there are present day processes that will explain it <unk> [MASK] but we haven 't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type <unk>[MASK] <unk> and it took about twenty years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips <unk> yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction [MASK] well there are five major mass[MASK] <unk> the last five hundred million years called the big five [MASK] they range from four hundred and fifty million years ago to the last the k t number four but the biggest of all was the p or the permian extinction <unk> sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions [MASK] and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact[MASK] <unk> but is this true <unk> [MASK] the most recent the permian was thought to have been an impact because[MASK] <unk> of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene <unk>[MASK] because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved ' 60s they 're called buckyballs [MASK] this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the permian two hundred and fifty million years ago a comet hit us <unk> and when the comet hits the pressure produces the[MASK] <unk> and it captures bits of the comet helium 3 very rare on the surface of the earth very common in space <unk> [MASK] but is this true in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety working on the k t extinction for ten years i moved to south africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert <unk>[MASK] i was so lucky to watch the change of that south africa into the new south africa as i went year by year and i worked on this permian extinction <unk> camping by this boer graveyard for months at a time[MASK] <unk> and the fossils are extraordinary you know you 're[MASK] gazing upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these <unk> this is a gorgonopsian or a gorgon [MASK] long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet <unk> sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t rex of its time[MASK] <unk> of stuff this is my poor son patrick [MASK] laughter this is called paleontological child abuse <unk> [MASK] hold still you 're the scale [MASK] laughter there was big stuff back then fifty five species of <unk>[MASK] <unk> the age of mammals had well and truly started two hundred and fifty million years ago [MASK] and then a catastrophe happened <unk> and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened <unk> but it did [MASK] now luckily <unk> this thrinaxodon the size of a robin egg here <unk> this is a skull i 've discovered[MASK] just before taking this picture there 's a pen for scale it 's really tiny[MASK] <unk> this is in the lower triassic after the mass extinction has finished [MASK] you can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive i 'm not the thing giving this talk [MASK] something else is because if that doesn 't survive <unk> we are not here there are no mammals it 's that close one species ekes through well[MASK] can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn 't here 's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction <unk> [MASK] but we 've got survivors and things that[MASK] <unk> get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods warm blooded animals take a huge hit at this time <unk> [MASK] the survivors that do get through produce this world of <unk> crocodile like creatures there 's no dinosaurs yet just this slow saurian scaly nasty swampy <unk>[MASK] place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for one[MASK] <unk> hundred and sixty million years until liberated by that k t asteroid [MASK] so if not impact what <unk> and the what i think is that we returned over and over again to the pre cambrian world that first microbial age and the microbes <unk>[MASK] <unk> are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world back and they 've tried over and over and over again[MASK] <unk> mass extinctions because it did is inherently <unk> anti gaian this whole gaia idea that life makes the world better for itself[MASK] anybody been on a freeway on a friday afternoon in los angeles believing in the gaia theory no [MASK] so i really suspect there 's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here 's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last[MASK] <unk> five hundred million years [MASK] there are microbes which through their metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide [MASK] and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans as small as two hundred parts per million will kill you [MASK] you only have to go to the black sea and a few other places some lakes and get down[MASK] <unk> itself turns purple it turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide [MASK] and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past <unk> and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand new field [MASK] i am almost extinct i 'm a paleontologist who collects fossils <unk> but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate[MASK] <unk> students collect biomarkers <unk> [MASK] they take the sediment itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups it 's because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment[MASK] and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell[MASK] <unk> us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find isorenieratene it[MASK] 's very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen <unk> and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution <unk> [MASK] this led lee kump and others from penn state and my group to propose what i call the kump hypothesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen[MASK] <unk> by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans [MASK] well what 's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over has been flood basalts <unk> [MASK] this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse [MASK] <unk> material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it 's not the lava that kills anything it 's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn 't volvos <unk> this is volcanoes <unk> but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide [MASK] so these are new data rob berner and i from yale put together and what we try to do now is track[MASK] the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record and we can do this[MASK] from a variety of means[MASK] and put all the red lines here when these what i call greenhouse mass extinctions took place [MASK] and there 's two things that are really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up <unk> but the second thing that 's not shown on here <unk> [MASK] the earth has never had any ice on it when we 've had one thousand parts per million co2 [MASK] we are at three hundred and eighty and climbing we should be up to a thousand[MASK] in three centuries at the most but my friend david battisti in seattle says he thinks[MASK] a one hundred years [MASK] so there goes the ice caps <unk> and there comes two hundred and forty feet of sea level rise <unk> [MASK] i live in a view house now <unk> i 'm going to have waterfront all right[MASK] what 's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple [MASK] and we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period <unk> they stop complex life[MASK] <unk> life from existing <unk> we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet [MASK] and i throw this slide in this is me actually two months ago and[MASK] i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it 's been on this planet since the animals first started five hundred million years <unk> [MASK] this is a tracking experiment and any of you scuba divers if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever[MASK] <unk> this is off the great barrier reef <unk> and as we speak now these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us <unk> but the thing about this is that every once in a while[MASK] we divers can run into trouble so i 'm going to do a little thought experiment here <unk> this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps <unk> we pulled it up up it comes so it 's out there with me at night so i 'm swimming along and it takes off my leg <unk> [MASK] i 'm eighty miles from shore[MASK] <unk> happen to me well now i die [MASK] five years from now this is what i hope happens to me i 'm taken back to the boat <unk> i 'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide i[MASK] 'm then thrown in an ice pond <unk> i 'm cooled fifteen degrees lower[MASK] and i could be taken to a critical care hospital <unk> and the reason i could do that[MASK] because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted <unk> and we can now use this as what i think will be a major medical breakthrough <unk> [MASK] this is mark roth he was funded by darpa tried to figure out how to save americans after battlefield injuries he bleeds out pigs he puts in eighty parts per <unk>[MASK] <unk> million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal[MASK] <unk> mammal into a reptile [MASK] i believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s i got this email from him two years ago he said [MASK] i think i 've got an answer to some of your questions [MASK] so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours [MASK] and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now <unk> that is a temperature record of a mouse[MASK] who has gone through the dotted line the temperatures so the temperature starts at[MASK] <unk> and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature [MASK] now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph [MASK] and look what happens to its temperature its temperature drops it goes down to fifteen degrees centigrade from <unk>[MASK] and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here 's how we[MASK] <unk> can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care [MASK] now you 're all thinking <unk> yeah what about the brain tissue <unk> [MASK] and so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen you 're in an accident you 've got two choices you 're going to die or you 're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say seventy five percent of you is saved[MASK] <unk> what are you going to do do we all have to have a little button saying let me die <unk> [MASK] this is coming towards us and i think this is going to be a revolution we 're going to save lives <unk> but there 's going to be a cost to it [MASK] the new view of mass extinctions is yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again <unk> but there 's a far worse danger confronting us [MASK] we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans should last those few millennia will it happen again if we continue[MASK] how many of us flew here [MASK] how many of us have gone through our entire kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded[MASK] it yeah i 've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this i want to be able to go back[MASK] <unk> am i understanding you right that what you 're saying here is that we have[MASK] in our own bodies a biochemical response[MASK] to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind[MASK] proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change peter ward yeah[MASK] every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises <unk> this is what roth has found out[MASK] <unk> what we 're looking at now <unk> does it leave a signal does it leave a signal in bone or in plant and we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past ca [MASK] it 's simultaneously[MASK] an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying[MASK]
