 <unk> aside from keeping the rain out and and producing some[MASK] some usable space <unk> architecture is nothing but a special effects machine that delights and disturbs the[MASK] <unk> our work is[MASK] across media the work comes in all shapes and sizes it 's small and large this is an[MASK] ashtray a water glass from urban planning and master planning to theater and[MASK] all sorts of stuff the thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space [MASK] and these are everyday conventions conventions that are so obvious[MASK] that we are blinded by their[MASK] <unk> familiarity and i 've assembled a sampling of of work that that all share a kind of productive nihilism[MASK] that 's used in the service of creating a particular special effect and that is something like nothing or something next to nothing[MASK] it 's[MASK] done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference[MASK] in a world that we naturally[MASK] sleepwalk through <unk> this is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the swiss expo two thousand and two on lake neuchatel near geneva <unk> [MASK] and we wanted to use the water not only as a context but as a primary building material we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere <unk>[MASK] <unk> no walls no roof no purpose just a mass of atomized water a big cloud <unk> and this proposal was a reaction to the <unk>[MASK] <unk> of emergent technologies[MASK] in recent national and world expositions <unk> which feeds or has been feeding our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation[MASK] with an ever greater digital virtuosity <unk> high definition in our opinion has become the new orthodoxy[MASK] <unk> and we ask the question can we use technology high technology[MASK] to make an expo pavilion that 's decidedly low definition [MASK] that also challenges the conventions of space and skin and rethinks our dependence on vision so this is how we sought to do it water 's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through[MASK] an array of[MASK] thirty five thousand of them <unk> [MASK] and a weather station is on the structure it reads the shifting conditions of temperature humidity <unk> wind direction wind speed <unk> dew point <unk> and it processes this data <unk>[MASK] in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout [MASK] <unk> this is just in construction and there 's a[MASK] tensegrity structure it 's about three hundred feet wide the size of a football field and it sits on just four very delicate columns these are the fog nozzles <unk> [MASK] the interface and basically the system is kind of reading the the real weather and producing kind of <unk>[MASK] <unk> very interested in creating weather[MASK] <unk> whiteout[MASK] and white noise of the pulsing nozzles <unk> [MASK] so this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do[MASK] <unk> and we pride ourselves it 's a spectacular anti spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle[MASK] <unk> the audience is dispersed focused attention and dramatic build up and climax are all replaced by a kind of[MASK] attenuated attention that 's sustained by a sense of apprehension[MASK] caused by the fog <unk> and this is very much like how the victorian novel used[MASK] fog in this way <unk> so here the world is put out of focus while our visual dependence is put into[MASK] <unk> ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar <unk> so <unk> all the waters of the world are served there so we thought that you know after being[MASK] at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water you could also drink this building <unk> and[MASK] <unk> it is sort of a theme but it goes[MASK] a little bit <unk> you know deeper than that we really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense and maybe share our kind of[MASK] sensibility with our other senses <unk> you know when we did this project[MASK] it was a kind of tough sell because the swiss said well why are we going to spend you know ten million dollars producing[MASK] an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate[MASK] <unk> thought well <unk> we tried to convince them and in the end <unk> you know <unk> they adapted this as a as a national icon[MASK] that came to represent swiss doubt[MASK] <unk> which we you know <unk> it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of anyway it 's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed[MASK] <unk> and so it 's now a memory of an apparition actually <unk> but it[MASK] continues to live in edible form and this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in switzerland[MASK] to have a chocolate bar <unk> anyway moving along [MASK] so in the ' 80s and ' 90s we were mostly known for independent work such as[MASK] installation artist architect[MASK] <unk> we did a lot of media work also a lot of experimental theater projects in two thousand and three the whitney mounted a retrospective[MASK] of our work that featured a lot of this work from the ' 80s and ' 90s however <unk> the work itself[MASK] resisted the very nature of a retrospective and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show this was a piece on tourism[MASK] in the united states this is soft sell for 42nd street this was something done at the cartier foundation master slave at the moma the[MASK] project series a piece called parasite and so there were many many of these kinds of projects <unk> anyway[MASK] they gave us the whole fourth floor and you[MASK] <unk> the problem of the retrospective was something we were very were very uncomfortable with it 's a kind of invention of the museum that 's supposed to[MASK] bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work and our work doesn 't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] one of the recurring themes by the way that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum[MASK] <unk> and asking[MASK] about the conventions of the museum like the wall the white wall <unk> so what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there <unk> and we actually had to install <unk>[MASK] white walls to separate these pieces which didn 't belong together <unk> but these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time we used the wall to partition the thirteen installations of the project[MASK] <unk> is actually the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element which was a new piece that created that we created for the[MASK] which was a robotic drill basically that went all the way around cruised the museum[MASK] went all around the walls and did a lot of damage [MASK] so the drill was mounted on this robotic arm we worked with by the way honeybee robotics this[MASK] <unk> is the brain honeybee robotics designed the mars driller <unk> and it was really very much fun to work with them they weren 't doing their primary work which was[MASK] for the government <unk> while they were helping us with this [MASK] in any case the way it works is that an intelligent navigator[MASK] basically[MASK] maps the entire surface[MASK] <unk> unfolded it 's about three hundred[MASK] linear feet <unk> and it randomly generates points within a three dimensional matrix <unk> [MASK] it selects a point it guides the drill to that point it pierces the dry wall <unk> leaving a half inch hole before traveling to the next location[MASK] <unk> opening views from gallery to gallery clusters of holes randomly opened up[MASK] sections of wall and so this was a three month performance piece in which[MASK] the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element <unk> and also the acoustic separation was destroyed[MASK] <unk> also the visual separation <unk> and there was also this constant background groan[MASK] which was very annoying and this is one of the blackout spaces where there 's a video piece that became totally[MASK] not useful <unk> so rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display the wall now actively competed for attention and[MASK] this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance[MASK] basically exposed the discomfort of the work[MASK] to this[MASK] encompassing nature of the retrospective it[MASK] was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text <unk> moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago it 's the <unk>[MASK] the institute of contemporary art in boston <unk> which is on the waterfront[MASK] and there 's not enough time to really introduce the building but i 'll simply say that the building negotiates[MASK] <unk> between this outwardly focused nature of of the site you know it 's a really great waterfront site in boston[MASK] and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum <unk> so the nature of the building is that it looks at looking i mean that 's its primary objective[MASK] <unk> the building incorporates the site <unk> but it dispenses it in very small doses[MASK] in the way that the museum is choreographed so you come in[MASK] and you 're basically squeezed by the theater by the belly of the theater into this very compressed space where the view is turned off then you come up[MASK] in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall[MASK] this elevator 's about the size of a new york city studio apartment and then this is a view going up and then you could come into the theater which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop and many musicians[MASK] choose to use the theater glass walls totally open the view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light[MASK] <unk> then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view the original intention of this space which was[MASK] unfortunately never realized was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out in this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a[MASK] <unk> to have the view stalk you so the view would open up as you walked[MASK] from one end to the other this was eliminated because the view was too good and the mayor said no we just want this open [MASK] the architect lost here but culminating and that 's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk[MASK] is this mediatheque which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building so this is[MASK] <unk> 's quite substantial so it 's already sticking out into space enough and then from that is this [MASK] is this small area called the mediatheque <unk> the mediatheque has something like sixteen stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] this was really a kind of very important[MASK] <unk> part of this building and here is a point where architecture this is like[MASK] architecture is only a framing device it only edits the harbor view the industrial harbor[MASK] just through its walls its floors and its and its ceiling to only expose[MASK] the the water itself the texture of water much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that[MASK] <unk> and here is where we really felt that there was a great[MASK] convergence of the technological and the natural in the project <unk> but there is just no information it 's just[MASK] it 's just hypnosis <unk> moving along to lincoln center these are the guys[MASK] <unk> that did the project in the first place fifty years ago <unk> we 're taking over now doing work that ranges in scale from small scale repairs to major renovations <unk>[MASK] <unk> and major facility expansions but we 're doing it with a lot less testosterone <unk> this is the extent of of the work that 's to be completed by two thousand and ten [MASK] <unk> and it happens to be our current[MASK] obsession <unk> and it plays a little bit with the purging[MASK] and and adding of distraction it 's alice tully hall <unk> and it 's tucked under the juilliard building[MASK] and descends several[MASK] levels under the street so this is the entrance to tully hall as as it used to be before the renovation which we just started <unk> and we[MASK] <unk> asked ourselves why couldn 't it be exhibitionistic like the met or like some of the other buildings at lincoln center <unk> [MASK] and one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity <unk> expand the lobbies and and make it visually accessible <unk> and this building which is just naturally hermetic[MASK] <unk> we stripped we basically did a striptease architectural[MASK] <unk> where we 're framing with this kind of canopy[MASK] the underside of three levels of expansion of juilliard about forty five thousand square feet[MASK] cutting it to the angle of broadway <unk> and then exposing using that canopy to frame tully hall <unk> before and after shot [MASK] applause wait a minute it 's just in that state we have a long[MASK] <unk> what i wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that i have left to just talk about the hall itself which is kind of where we 're really[MASK] doing a massive amount of work so the hall is is a multi purpose hall the clients have asked us to produce a great[MASK] chamber music hall <unk> now that 's really tough to do with a hall that has one thousand one hundred seats chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and[MASK] <unk> they asked us to bring an intimacy <unk> how do you bring an intimacy into a hall <unk> intimacy for us means a lot of different things it means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy <unk>[MASK] one thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall <unk> another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall it 's like a coffin it basically sends all the sound [MASK] <unk> half absorptive half reflective which is not very good for concert sound <unk> this is avery fisher hall <unk> but the notion of junk visual junk was very very important to us to <unk>[MASK] <unk> get rid of visual noise <unk> because we can 't eliminate a single seat the architecture is restricted to eighteen inches so it 's a very very thin architecture first we do a kind of partial box and box[MASK] <unk> to take away the distraction of the subway noise [MASK] next we wrap the entire hall almost like this olivetti keyboard with a material with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces wall <unk>[MASK] ceiling floor stage <unk> steps <unk> everything boxes <unk> but it 's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage <unk> and here 's an acoustic shelf looking up the hall just a section of the stage [MASK] <unk> single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin <unk> but one more added feature so now that we 've stripped the hall of all visual distraction everything that prevents <unk>[MASK] this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house the audience with the performers [MASK] the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is[MASK] when the concert starts so what we wanted to do was produce this this effect this lighting effect[MASK] <unk> which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls [MASK] and what it what it entails is[MASK] the use of resin of this very thick resin with a veneer[MASK] <unk> of the same kind of wood that 's used throughout the hall in a kind of seamless[MASK] continuity that wraps the hall in light <unk> like a belt of light rather than separating like a proscenium would separate the audience from[MASK] <unk> from performers it connects audience with players <unk> and this is[MASK] <unk> sense of what this is going to look like in full scale [MASK] and this is a guy from salt lake city this is what they look like out there [MASK] and for us i mean it 's really kind of a very strange thing but the moments in the hall[MASK] that the that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin very similar to[MASK] <unk> the parting of curtains or or the raising of a chandelier the walls will[MASK] just exude this glow temporarily stealing attention from the stage <unk> and this is tully in construction now[MASK] i have no ending to say except that i 'm a couple of minutes over[MASK]
