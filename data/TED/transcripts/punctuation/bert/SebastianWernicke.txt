 <unk> there 's currently over a thousand ted talks on the ted website and i guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic <unk> except for me i <unk>[MASK] <unk> don 't agree with this i think we have a situation here <unk> because if you think about it one thousand ted talks <unk> [MASK] <unk> ideas worth spreading <unk> [MASK] how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas [MASK] even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos it would actually currently take you over two hundred and fifty hours to do so [MASK] and i did a little calculation of this the damage to the economy for each one who does this is around[MASK] <unk> having seen this danger to the economy i thought we need to find a solution to this problem <unk> here 's my approach to it all if you look at the current situation you have a thousand ted talks <unk>[MASK] <unk> each of those ted talks has an average length of about two thousand three hundred words <unk> now take this together and you end up with two point three million words of ted talks which is about three bibles worth of[MASK] <unk> obvious question here is does a ted talk really need two thousand three hundred words <unk> isn 't there something shorter i mean if you have an idea worth spreading <unk> surely you can put it into something shorter <unk>[MASK] than two thousand three hundred words the only question is <unk> how short can you get what 's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a ted talk <unk> [MASK] <unk> worn were the best novel he had ever written <unk> [MASK] and i also encountered a project called six word memoirs where people were asked take your whole life and please sum this up into six words such as these here found true love married someone else or [MASK] living in existential vacuum it sucks i actually like that one[MASK] <unk> so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words[MASK] <unk> you don 't need more[MASK] <unk> than six words for a ted talk we could have been done by lunch here laughter[MASK] and if you did this for all thousand ted talks you would get from two point three million words down to six thousand so i thought this was quite worthwhile so i started asking all my friends please take your favorite ted talk and put that into six words <unk> [MASK] so here are some of the results that i received i think they 're quite nice for example dan pink 's talk on motivation which was pretty good if you haven 't seen it[MASK] <unk> drop carrot drop stick bring meaning it 's what he 's basically talking about in those one hundred and eighty five minutes <unk> or some even included references to the speakers such as nathan myhrvold 's speaking style or the one of tim ferriss which might be considered a bit strenuous at times [MASK] the challenge here is if i try to systematically do this i would probably end up with a lot of summaries but not with many friends in the end so i had to find a different method <unk> preferably involving total strangers and[MASK] luckily there 's a website for that called mechanical turk which is a website where you can post tasks that you don 't want to do yourself <unk> such as please summarize this text for me in six words [MASK] and i didn 't allow any low cost countries to work on this but[MASK] i found out i could get a six word summary for just ten cents which i think is a pretty good price even then <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's not possible to summarize each ted talk individually because if you do the math you have a thousand ted talks you pay ten cents each you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks because some of <unk>[MASK] <unk> them will probably be or are really bad <unk> so i would end up paying hundreds of dollars <unk> so i thought of a different way by thinking well the talks revolve around certain <unk>[MASK] <unk> themes so what if i don 't let people summarize individual ted talks to six words <unk> but give them ten ted talks at the same time and say please do a six word summary for that one[MASK] i would cut my costs by ninety percent so for $[MASK] sixty i could summarize a thousand ted talks into just six hundred summaries <unk> which would actually be quite nice some of you might actually right now be thinking it 's downright crazy to have ten ted talks summarized into just six words <unk> but it 's actually not [MASK] because there 's an example by[MASK] <unk> statistics professor hans rosling i guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks he 's got eight talks online and those can basically be summed up into just four words because that 's all he 's basically <unk>[MASK] <unk> showing us our intuition is really bad he always proves us wrong <unk> so people on the internet some didn 't do so well <unk> and when i asked them to summarize the ten ted talks at the same time some took the easy route out they just had some general comment[MASK] <unk> there were others and i found this quite cheeky they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i 'd been too much on google lately [MASK] and finally also i never understood this <unk> some people really came up with their own version of the truth <unk> i don 't know any ted talk that contains this but [MASK] oh well in the end however and this is really amazing for each of of those ten ted talk clusters that i submitted i actually received meaningful summaries here are some of my favorites for example for the ted talks about food someone summed this[MASK] <unk> up into food shaping body brains and environment which i think is pretty good <unk> or happiness striving toward happiness <unk> = moving toward unhappiness so[MASK] here i was i had started out with a thousand ted talks and i had six hundred six word summaries for those [MASK] actually it sounded nice in the beginning but when you look at six hundred summaries it 's quite a lot it 's a huge list so[MASK] i thought i probably have to take this one step further here and[MASK] <unk> create summaries of the summaries and this is exactly what i did so i took the six hundred summaries that i had [MASK] put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on ted com and asked people to do summaries of those [MASK] again there were some misunderstandings for example when i had a cluster of all the beautiful talks someone thought i was just trying to find the ultimate[MASK] <unk> people were able to do it for example all the courageous ted talks people dying or people suffering was also one with easy solutions around or the recipe for the ultimate <unk> jaw dropping ted talk flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer i mean that 's[MASK] the essence of it all now[MASK] i had my nine groups but i mean <unk> it 's already quite a reduction but of course once you are that far you 're not really satisfied <unk> i wanted to go all the way all the way[MASK] <unk> the distillery starting out with a thousand ted talks <unk> i wanted to have a thousand ted talks summarized into just six words which would be a ninety nine point nine nine nine seven percent reduction in content <unk> and[MASK] i would only pay[MASK] <unk> so stay even below $ one hundred for it <unk> so i had fifty overall summaries done this time i paid twenty five cents because[MASK] <unk> i thought the task was a bit harder and[MASK] unfortunately <unk> when i first received the answers and here you 'll see six of the answers i was a bit disappointed because i think you 'll agree [MASK] they all summarize some aspect of ted but to me they felt felt a bit bland or they just had a[MASK] certain aspect of ted in them <unk> so i was almost ready to give up when[MASK] one night i played around with these sentences and found out that there 's actually a beautiful[MASK] <unk> of a thousand ted talks at the value of[MASK]
