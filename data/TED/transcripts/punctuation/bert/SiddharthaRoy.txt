 <unk> fresh out of college i went to work for a consulting firm [MASK] during orientation the leaders dished out advice amongst them was one pithy counsel i will never forget <unk> he told us[MASK] <unk> nave i really was at the time [MASK] i took his advice to heart <unk> [MASK] i told myself yes <unk> i will be the ultimate team player <unk> i will do everything i 'm told i will be easy to manage [MASK] it wasn 't until i arrived in graduate school and witnessed firsthand the criminal actions of scientists and engineers[MASK] in the water crisis in flint michigan[MASK] that i realized how[MASK] <unk> dangerous[MASK] and yet surprisingly common this line of thinking really is [MASK] make no mistake <unk> the flint water crisis is one of the most egregious environmental injustices of our time for over eighteen months one hundred thousand residents <unk> [MASK] including thousands of young children were exposed to contaminated drinking water with high levels of lead [MASK] lead is a potent neurotoxin[MASK] <unk> causes cognitive and developmental disabilities[MASK] and is especially harmful to growing fetuses and young children we 've known about its dangers since the roman empire [MASK] amongst a whole host of health issues <unk> twelve people died by contracting legionnaires ' disease [MASK] flint 's water infrastructure the complex network of underground pipes has been[MASK] <unk> severely damaged <unk> and while[MASK] the water quality is slowly improving and the pipes are being replaced now [MASK] more than two years later the water is still not safe to drink [MASK] so people are still in shock they ask themselves how could this have happened [MASK] the short answer is the crisis began when an emergency manager[MASK] <unk> appointed by michigan 's governor <unk> decided to switch their water source to a local river to save money <unk> [MASK] but it continued for so long because scientists and engineers at government agencies in the state of michigan and in the federal government[MASK] did not follow federal regulations for treating the water right what was more they actively cheated on the law and orchestrated[MASK] they ridiculed residents asking for help <unk> while publicly insisting that the brown smelly water coming out of the tap was safe to drink <unk>[MASK] the system at the local state and federal levels completely failed to protect our most vulnerable [MASK] and an entire population was left to fend for itself [MASK] now <unk> amidst this injustice[MASK] flint residents were rallying together amongst them were some amazing women of flint mothers concerned about their kids who came together forming[MASK] many grassroots coalitions <unk> and these groups started protesting and demanding change [MASK] the group also reached out to outside scientists for help <unk> and a few responded <unk> [MASK] amongst them was a guy named miguel[MASK] del toral a water expert at the us <unk> epa the environmental protection agency who actually wrote this scientific memo[MASK] and sent it to the state of michigan and the federal government to bring their attention to this problem <unk> [MASK] he was characterized a rogue employee and silenced [MASK] in collaboration with flint residents our research team here at tech[MASK] <unk> students and scientists led by professor marc edwards <unk> conducted citywide testing[MASK] to prove that flint 's water was indeed contaminated even toxic in some homes [MASK] we substantiated what flint had been screaming for months and put it on the internet for the world to see <unk> now <unk> when i was[MASK] <unk> getting involved when i said yes to this i had no idea what i was getting into [MASK] but every second of this journey has been totally worth it [MASK] this was science in service to the public this is what i came to graduate school for and this is how i would rather spend my life <unk> [MASK] and so this coalition this unlikely coalition of citizens pastors <unk> journalists and scientists came together to uncover the truth using science advocacy and activism [MASK] <unk> pediatrician figured out that the instances of childhood lead poisoning had indeed doubled[MASK] in flint during the crisis [MASK] and the state of michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem and take steps to correct it [MASK] this group and many others got flint 's kids protected [MASK] a few months later <unk> president obama came in and declared a federal emergency <unk> and now[MASK] <unk> flint is getting more than six hundred million dollars[MASK] in healthcare nutrition education[MASK] and overhauling their water infrastructure however <unk> the arrogance and the callous disregard for public health[MASK] shown by scientists and engineers at these government agencies is beyond belief these unhealthy cultures that are festering in[MASK] <unk> these groups where the focus is on meeting regulations and checking boxes[MASK] as opposed to protecting public health is just appalling just consider this email[MASK] that an epa employee wrote where she goes i 'm not so sure flint is a community we want to go out on a limb for[MASK] <unk> the dehumanization of an entire population could not be more obvious now <unk> contrast that to[MASK] the first canon of engineering which <unk> in my opinion should be the first law of humanity [MASK] to hold paramount the health safety and welfare of the public above all else this is the hippocratic oath we 've rarely acknowledged <unk> let alone[MASK] <unk> and so when scientists and engineers very much like medical doctors <unk> screw up people can get hurt[MASK] even die if our professionals and even students fail to get that society pays a huge price <unk> [MASK] buried deep in history lies a character i deeply admire[MASK] an engineer named peter palchinsky he lived in the time of the soviet union and[MASK] palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble for his radical honesty and willingness to point out major flaws in the soviets ' mindless pursuit of rapid industrialization [MASK] everyone was expected to follow orders coming from the top <unk> anyone asking questions or offering feedback was[MASK] <unk> the soviets had created the largest army of engineers the world had ever seen [MASK] and yet most of them were mere cogs in a gigantic machine heading for doom palchinsky[MASK] on the other hand implored engineers to look at the economic political and social consequences of their actions [MASK] in other words be more <unk>[MASK] his fearless voice of reason was seen as a threat to the political establishment and[MASK] <unk> stalin had him executed in one thousand nine hundred and[MASK] twenty nine palchinsky 's view on technocrats is very different from one that is still very popular still very[MASK] common[MASK] that of a dispassionate researcher working in his ivory tower lab [MASK] or a nerdy engineer working in his cubicle <unk> [MASK] brilliant no doubt[MASK] yet somehow cut off from the world <unk> shows little emotion[MASK] kind of like spock from star trek you know <unk> this guy [MASK] let 's try and do the spock salute i don 't think i 'll succeed <unk> see i can 't be spock <unk> thank goodness i can 't be[MASK] <unk> i was reminded of this distinction because a recent article came out in a very reputed[MASK] scientific journal <unk> which kind of characterized our flint work as driven by youthful idealism and hollywood 's dramatic sensibilities [MASK] it[MASK] asks scientists to protect their research funding and institutions at all costs no matter how just the cause <unk> and if you think you have to get[MASK] <unk> involved in something even if it 's an emergency <unk> try finding[MASK] an activist group or an ngo and obtain the full support of the academic community whatever that means[MASK] before you get involved [MASK] not one mention of our moral and professional obligation of preventing harm to the public or the fact that we have all this expertise[MASK] and for some even tenure[MASK] to you know <unk> accomplish this task <unk> [MASK] i 'm not saying every scientist should be an activist there are real and sometimes very painful consequences of speaking up <unk> [MASK] but to denounce this idea this possibility so completely so that you can protect research[MASK] <unk> the ideals we would want to pass to our students and so[MASK] you may think ok all this sounds great but you 'll never completely change organizational cultures or[MASK] imbibe mindsets in students and professionals to look at their work as a public good science in service to the public[MASK] <unk> could a big reason for that be that we are not training our students right because[MASK] if you look closely our education system today is focused more on creating what[MASK] <unk> we fell in love with science when we were kids <unk> and yet we somehow spend most of our time during high school and college just jumping through hoops and doing things[MASK] so that we can polish our <unk> rsum instead of sitting down and reflecting on what we want to do and who we want[MASK] <unk> markers of empathy in our college graduates have been dropping dramatically in the past two decades <unk> while those of narcissism are on the rise <unk> [MASK] there is also a growing culture of disengagement between engineering students[MASK] and the public <unk> we are trained to[MASK] build bridges and solve complex problems but not how to think or live or[MASK] <unk> a citizen of this world [MASK] my undergraduate years were explicit job preparation and i cannot tell you how suffocating and painful it was at times <unk> [MASK] and so some people think the solution to great engineers to great scientists is more technical training <unk> maybe so [MASK] <unk> or building character or discerning right from wrong consider[MASK] this project that i deeply love and admire [MASK] it 's called heroic imagination project a brainchild of dr phil zimbardo <unk> famous for the stanford prison experiment this program seeks to <unk>[MASK] <unk> these young minds work over time to develop skills and virtues so that when the opportunity comes no matter what that opportunity be [MASK] to stand up and do the right thing [MASK] in other words <unk> anyone can be a hero [MASK] <unk> think about that idea for a second why don 't we teach science and engineering like that[MASK] where heroism and public service are seen as key values because indeed it 's often heroism that is not only the antidote to public <unk>[MASK] <unk> indifference <unk> but also to systemic evil like we saw in flint <unk> [MASK] <unk> sciences[MASK] so that they can serve society and are also aware of the tremendous power their knowledge and decisions have [MASK] folks who are developing their moral courage at all times <unk> and who realize that[MASK] conflict and controversy are not necessarily bad things if our ultimate loyalty is to the[MASK] <unk> these are the people who will stand up like we did in flint not to be saviors or heroes in the media but[MASK] altruistic and fundamentally good actors that you and i can trust <unk> imagine[MASK] fostering such a public focused mindset in[MASK] <unk> on service trips and during activities during college or even high school so that these young minds will hold onto those ideals when they actually enter the real world <unk> [MASK] whether that be consulting academia <unk> policy making[MASK] or even becoming the president of a country [MASK] some of mankind 's greatest challenges lie ahead of us contaminated drinking water is just one example [MASK] we could definitely use more nay[MASK] we desperately need more compassionate upstanders and <unk>[MASK] scientists and engineers who will strive to the do right thing <unk> and not be easy to manage <unk> thank you[MASK]
