 <unk> woman with chronic schizophrenia <unk> i 've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals [MASK] i might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital <unk> but that isn 't how my life turned out [MASK] in fact i 've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades perhaps my proudest[MASK] <unk> accomplishment [MASK] that 's not to say that i 've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles <unk> after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job my new haven analyst dr white announced to <unk>[MASK] <unk> me that he was going to close his practice in three months <unk> several years before i had planned to leave new haven <unk> [MASK] <unk> my best friend steve sensing that something was terribly wrong flew out to new haven to be with me <unk> now i 'm going to quote from some of my writings [MASK] i opened the door to my studio apartment <unk> [MASK] steve would later tell me that for all the times he had seen me psychotic nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day [MASK] for a week or more i had barely eaten i was gaunt <unk> i walked as though my legs were wooden[MASK] <unk> my face looked and felt like a mask [MASK] i had closed all the curtains in the apartment so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness the air was fetid <unk> the room a shambles [MASK] steve both a lawyer and a psychologist has treated many patients with severe mental illness <unk> and to this day he 'll say i was as bad as any he had ever seen ' hi [MASK] ' i said <unk> and then i returned to the couch where i sat in silence for several moments ' thank you for coming steve <unk> crumbling world[MASK] <unk> word voice tell the clocks to stop time is time has come ' '[MASK] white is leaving ' steve said somberly '[MASK] i 'm being pushed into a grave the situation is grave ' i moan ' gravity is pulling me down i 'm scared tell them to get away ' [MASK] as a young woman i was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods my doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia[MASK] <unk> and gave me a prognosis of grave that is at best i was expected to live in a board and care and work at menial jobs <unk> [MASK] fortunately i did not actually enact that grave prognosis instead i 'm a chaired professor of law psychology and psychiatry at the usc gould school of law i have many close friends and i have a beloved[MASK] <unk> he 's definitely the star of my show [MASK] i 'd like to share with you how that happened and also describe my experience of being psychotic [MASK] i hasten to add that it 's my experience because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way <unk> [MASK] let 's start with the definition of schizophrenia schizophrenia is a brain disease <unk> its defining feature is psychosis[MASK] <unk> or being out of touch with reality <unk> [MASK] delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness <unk> delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren 't responsive to evidence and hallucinations are false sensory experiences [MASK] for example when i 'm psychotic i often have the delusion that i 've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts <unk> i sometimes have the idea that nuclear[MASK] <unk> explosions are about to be set off in my brain occasionally i have hallucinations like one time i turned around and saw a man with a raised knife [MASK] imagine having a nightmare while you 're awake <unk> [MASK] often speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence [MASK] loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don 't make sense <unk> [MASK] and if the words get jumbled up enough it 's called word salad [MASK] contrary to what many people think schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or[MASK] <unk> split personality the schizophrenic mind is not split but shattered [MASK] everyone has seen a street person unkempt <unk> probably <unk> ill fed standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting [MASK] this person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia <unk> but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic[MASK] <unk> and there are people with the illness[MASK] who are full time professionals with major responsibilities <unk> [MASK] several years ago i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey <unk> and i want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view <unk> [MASK] so the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at yale law school <unk> quoting from my writings my two classmates rebel and val and i[MASK] <unk> to meet in the law school library on friday night to work on our memo assignment together but we didn 't get far before i was talking in ways that made no sense '[MASK] memos are visitations ' i informed them ' they make certain points the point is on your head pat used to say that have you killed you anyone '[MASK] rebel and val looked at me as if they or i had been splashed in the face with cold water ' what are you talking about elyn ' '[MASK] oh you know the usual who 's what what 's who heaven and hell let 's go out on the roof[MASK] <unk> it 's a flat surface it 's safe ' rebel and val followed and they asked what had gotten into me '[MASK] this is the real me ' i announced waving my arms above my head and then late on a friday night on the roof of the yale law school i began to sing and not quietly either ' come to the florida sunshine bush do you want to dance ' '[MASK] are you on drugs[MASK] <unk> no way no drugs come to the florida sunshine bush <unk> [MASK] where there are lemons where they make demons ' ' you 're frightening me ' one of them said and rebel and val headed back into the library [MASK] i shrugged and followed them [MASK] back inside i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was ' i think someone 's infiltrated[MASK] <unk> my copies of the cases ' i said ' we 've got to case the joint <unk> i don 't believe in joints but they do hold your body together ' it 's an example of loose associations [MASK] eventually i made my way back to my dorm room <unk> and once there i couldn 't settle down my head was too full of noise too full of orange trees and law memos i could not write and mass murders i knew i would be responsible for [MASK] sitting on my bed i rocked back and[MASK] <unk> moaning in fear and isolation [MASK] this episode led to my first hospitalization in america <unk> i had two earlier in england continuing with the writings [MASK] the next morning i went to my professor 's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment and i began gibbering unintelligably as i had the night before and he eventually brought me to the emergency room [MASK] once there someone i 'll just call ' the doctor ' and his whole team of goons swooped down lifted me high into the air and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that i saw stars[MASK] <unk> strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps a sound came out of my mouth that i 'd never heard before <unk> half groan <unk> half scream [MASK] barely human and pure terror then the sound came again forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw [MASK] this incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization one of the reasons the doctors gave for[MASK] <unk> hospitalizing me against my will was that i was gravely disabled to support this view they wrote in my chart that i was unable to do my yale law school homework [MASK] i wondered what that meant about much of the rest of new haven [MASK] during the next year i would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital at times i spent up to twenty hours in mechanical restraints [MASK] arms tied arms and legs tied down[MASK] <unk> arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest <unk> i never struck anyone i never harmed anyone <unk> i never made any direct threats [MASK] if you 've never been restrained yourself you may have a benign[MASK] image of the experience there 's nothing benign about it every week in the united states it 's been estimated that one to three people die[MASK] <unk> they strangle they aspirate their vomit they suffocate they have a heart attack <unk> [MASK] it 's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives [MASK] while i was preparing to write my student note for the yale law journal on mechanical restraints i consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading painful and frightening [MASK] <unk> he looked at me in a knowing way and said [MASK] elyn you don 't really understand these people are psychotic <unk> they 're different from me and you they wouldn 't experience restraints as we would [MASK] i didn 't have the courage to tell him in that moment that no we 're not that different from him we don 't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would [MASK] in fact until very recently and i 'm sure some people still hold it as a view that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe [MASK] i 've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with[MASK] <unk> view <unk> today i 'd like to say i 'm very pro psychiatry but very <unk>[MASK] i don 't think force is effective as treatment and i think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness <unk> [MASK] eventually i came to los angeles to teach at the university of southern california law school [MASK] for years i had resisted medication making many many efforts to get off [MASK] i felt that if i could manage without medication i could prove[MASK] <unk> that after all i wasn 't really mentally ill it was some terrible mistake my motto was the less medicine the less defective [MASK] my l a analyst dr kaplan was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life [MASK] but i decided i wanted to make one last college try to get off <unk> quoting from the text [MASK] i started the reduction of my[MASK] <unk> and within a short time[MASK] i began feeling the effects <unk> after returning from a trip to oxford i marched into kaplan 's office headed straight for the corner <unk> crouched down covered my face and began shaking [MASK] all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers they 'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals <unk> kaplan would later describe me as ' writhing in agony '[MASK] even in this state what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic i refused to take more medication <unk> the mission[MASK] is not yet complete [MASK] immediately after the appointment with kaplan i went to see dr marder a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects [MASK] he was under the impression that i had a mild psychotic illness <unk> [MASK] once in his office i sat on his couch <unk> folded over and began muttering '[MASK] head explosions and people trying to kill is it okay if i totally trash your office ' '[MASK] you need to leave if you think you 're going to do that ' said marder[MASK] <unk> marder ' okay small fire on ice tell them not to kill me tell them not to kill me what have i done wrong hundreds of thousands with thoughts interdiction ' '[MASK] elyn do you feel like you 're dangerous to yourself or others <unk> i think you need to be in the hospital i could get you admitted right away and the whole thing could be very discrete ' ' ha ha [MASK] ha you 're offering to put me in[MASK] <unk> hospitals are bad they 're mad they 're sad one must stay away <unk> i 'm god or i used to be ' [MASK] at that point in the text where i said i 'm god or i used to be my husband made a marginal note he said did you quit or were you fired [MASK] ' i give life and i take it away forgive me for i know not what i do '[MASK] eventually i broke down in front of friends and everybody convinced me to take more medication i could no longer deny the truth and i could not change it[MASK] the wall that kept me <unk> elyn professor saks separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past lay smashed and in ruins [MASK] everything about this illness says i shouldn 't be here but i am <unk> and i am i think for three reasons first i 've had excellent treatment [MASK] four to five day a week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and[MASK] <unk> i have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness <unk> [MASK] these relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms <unk> [MASK] third i work at an enormously supportive workplace at usc law school[MASK] <unk> this is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them it 's also a very intellectually stimulating[MASK] <unk> and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most[MASK] powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness <unk> [MASK] even with all that excellent treatment <unk> wonderful family and friends supportive work environment i did not make my illness public until relatively late in life [MASK] and that 's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that i didn 't feel safe with people knowing [MASK] if you hear nothing else[MASK] <unk> there are people with schizophrenia <unk> and these people may be your spouse they may be your child they may be your neighbor they may be your friend they may be your coworker [MASK] so let me share some final thoughts [MASK] we need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness <unk> the better we understand these illnesses the better the treatments we can provide and the better the treatments we can provide[MASK] <unk> the more we can offer people care and not have to use force [MASK] also we must stop criminalizing mental illness it 's a national tragedy and scandal that the l a county jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the united states <unk> [MASK] american prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness <unk> and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment <unk> [MASK] i could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself[MASK] <unk> a message to the entertainment industry and to the press on the whole you 've done a wonderful job[MASK] fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds <unk> [MASK] please continue to let us see characters in your movies your plays your columns who suffer with severe mental illness <unk> portray them sympathetically and portray them in all the richness <unk>[MASK] and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses <unk> [MASK] friend posed a question if there were a pill i could take that would instantly cure me would i take it [MASK] the poet rainer maria rilke was offered psychoanalysis he declined saying don 't take my devils away because my angels may flee too [MASK] my psychosis on the other hand is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled <unk> [MASK] so would i take the pill in an instant [MASK] that said <unk> i don 't wish to be seen as regretting the life i could have had if i 'd not been mentally ill <unk> nor am i asking[MASK] <unk> anyone for their pity [MASK] what i rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not [MASK] what those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants in the words of sigmund freud to work and to love[MASK]
