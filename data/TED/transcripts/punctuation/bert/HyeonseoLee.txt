 <unk> grew up singing a song called nothing to envy and i was very proud in school we spent a lot of time[MASK] <unk> although i often wondered about the outside world <unk> [MASK] i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea <unk> until everything suddenly changed <unk> [MASK] when i was seven years old <unk> i saw my first public execution <unk> but i thought my life in north korea was normal[MASK] <unk> family was not poor <unk> and myself i had never experienced hunger <unk> but one day in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five my mom brought home a letter[MASK] from a coworker 's sister it read [MASK] when you read this our five family members will not exist in this world <unk> [MASK] because we haven 't eaten for the past three weeks [MASK] we are lying on the[MASK] <unk> floor together <unk> and our bodies are so weak we are waiting to die [MASK] i was so shocked <unk> this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering [MASK] soon after when i was walking past a train station <unk> i saw something terrible that to this day[MASK] can 't erase from my memory [MASK] a lifeless woman was lying on the ground <unk> [MASK] while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother 's face <unk> [MASK] but nobody helped them <unk> because they were so focused on taking care of themselves[MASK] <unk> more than a million north koreans died during the famine <unk> and many only survived by eating grass <unk> [MASK] bugs and tree bark <unk> [MASK] power outages also became more and more frequent so everything around me[MASK] was completely[MASK] <unk> for the sea of lights in china just across the river from my home i always wondered why they had lights but we didn 't [MASK] this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night <unk> compared to neighbors [MASK] this is the amnok river <unk> which serves as a part of the border between north korea[MASK] <unk> as you can see the river can be very narrow at certain points allowing north koreans to secretly cross <unk> [MASK] but many die sometimes <unk> i saw dead bodies floating down the river [MASK] i can 't reveal many details about how i left north korea <unk> but i only can[MASK] <unk> that during the ugly years of the famine i was sent to china to live with distant relatives <unk> but i only thought[MASK] that i would be separated from my family for a short time [MASK] i could have never imagined that it would take fourteen years to live together [MASK] in china it was hard living as a young girl without my family <unk> i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean[MASK] but i soon learned it 's not only extremely difficult <unk> it 's also very dangerous <unk> [MASK] since north korean refugees are considered in china[MASK] as illegal migrants [MASK] so i was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed <unk> and i would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in north korea[MASK] <unk> one day my worst nightmare came true <unk> when i was caught by the chinese police <unk> and brought to the police station for interrogation [MASK] someone had accused me of being north korean <unk> [MASK] so they tested my chinese language abilities <unk> and asked me tons of questions <unk> [MASK] i was so scared[MASK] <unk> if anything seemed unnatural i could be imprisoned and repatriated i thought my life was over <unk> [MASK] but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions <unk> [MASK] after they finished questioning me one official said to another this was a false report <unk> [MASK] <unk> me go it was a miracle [MASK] some north koreans in china seek asylum in foreign embassies <unk> [MASK] but many can be caught by the chinese police and repatriated [MASK] these girls were so lucky <unk> even though they were caught they were eventually released after heavy international pressure[MASK] these north koreans were not so lucky[MASK] <unk> koreans are caught in china and repatriated to north korea <unk>[MASK] where they can be tortured <unk> imprisoned or publicly executed [MASK] even though i was really fortunate to get out <unk> many other north koreans have not been so lucky <unk> [MASK] it 's tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive[MASK] <unk> even after learning a new language and getting a job their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant [MASK] that 's why after ten years of hiding my identity i decided to risk going to south korea [MASK] and i started a new life yet again <unk> settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected <unk> [MASK] english was so[MASK] in south korea so i had to start learning my third language [MASK] also i realized there was a wide gap between north and south [MASK] we are all korean but inside we have become very different <unk> due to sixty seven years of division [MASK] i even went through an identity crisis am i south korean or north korean[MASK] <unk> where am i from who am i suddenly there was no country i could proudly call my own [MASK] even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy <unk> i made a plan i started studying for the university entrance exam [MASK] just as i was starting to get used to my new life <unk> i received a shocking phone call[MASK] the north korean authorities intercepted some money that i sent to my family and as a punishment my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside [MASK] they had to get out quickly so i started planning how to help them escape [MASK] north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the[MASK] it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea <unk> [MASK] so ironically <unk> i took a flight back to china and and <unk>[MASK] north korean border <unk> since my family couldn 't speak chinese i had to guide them[MASK] somehow through more than two thousand miles in china and then into southeast asia[MASK] the journey by bus took one week <unk> and we were almost caught several times one time our bus was stopped[MASK] and boarded by a chinese police officer <unk> [MASK] he took everyone 's i d cards <unk> and he started asking them questions <unk> since my family couldn 't[MASK] as the chinese officer approached my family <unk> i impulsively stood up <unk> and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was chaperoning [MASK] he looked at me suspiciously <unk> <unk> but luckily he believed me[MASK] we made it all the way to the border of laos[MASK] <unk> my money to bribe the border guards in laos <unk> but even after we got past the border my family was arrested and jailed[MASK] for illegal border crossing [MASK] after i paid the fine and bribe my family was released in one month <unk> but soon after my family was arrested and jailed[MASK] <unk> in the capital of laos <unk> this was one of the lowest points in my life <unk> i did everything[MASK] to get my family[MASK] to freedom <unk> and we came so close <unk> but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the south korean embassy <unk> [MASK] i went back and forth between the immigration office and the police[MASK] <unk> desperately trying to get my family <unk> out [MASK] but i didn 't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore <unk> [MASK] i lost all hope at that moment i heard one man 's voice ask me what 's wrong i was so surprised[MASK] that a total stranger cared enough to ask in my broken english <unk> and with a dictionary i explained the situation[MASK] <unk> and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail [MASK] i thanked him with all my heart <unk> and i asked him why are you helping me [MASK] i 'm not helping you he said i 'm helping the north korean people [MASK] i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life the kind stranger symbolized new hope[MASK] <unk> me and the north korean people <unk> when we needed it most <unk> and he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community[MASK] are truly the rays of hope we north korean people need <unk> [MASK] eventually after our long journey my family and i were reunited in south[MASK] <unk> but getting to freedom is only half the battle [MASK] many north koreans are separated from their families <unk> and when they arrive in a new country they start with little or no money [MASK] so we can benefit from the international community for education <unk> english language training <unk> job training <unk> and more [MASK] we can also act as a bridge between the people inside north korea and the outside world <unk> because many[MASK] <unk> of us stay in contact with family members still inside <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change north korea from inside <unk> [MASK] i 've been so lucky <unk> received so much help and inspiration in my life so i want to help give aspiring north koreans a[MASK] <unk> i 'm confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world <unk> including the ted stage <unk> thank you[MASK]
