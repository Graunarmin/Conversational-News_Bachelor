 <unk> people used to say norman 's ok <unk> but if you followed what he said everything would be usable but it would be ugly well[MASK] i didn 't have that in mind so [MASK] <unk> neat <unk> thank you for setting up my display <unk> [MASK] i mean it 's just wonderful and i haven 't the slightest idea of what it does or what it 's good for but i want it <unk> [MASK] and that 's my new life my new life is trying to understand what[MASK] beauty is about and pretty and emotions the new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun and so this is a philippe starck[MASK] juicer[MASK] produced by alessi[MASK] <unk> it 's just neat it 's fun <unk> it 's so much fun i have it in my house but i have it in the entryway i don 't use it to make juice [MASK] in fact i bought the <unk> gold plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says don 't use this juicer to make juice[MASK] <unk> the acid will ruin the gold plating so actually i took a carton of orange juice and i poured it in the glass to take this picture laughter[MASK] beneath it is a wonderful knife it 's a global cutting knife made in japan[MASK] first of all look at the shape it 's just wonderful to look at second of all it 's really beautifully balanced it holds well it feels well <unk> [MASK] and third of all it 's[MASK] <unk> it 's a delight to use [MASK] and so it 's got everything right it 's beautiful and it 's functional and i can tell you stories about it which makes it reflective and so you 'll see i have a theory of emotion [MASK] and those are the three components <unk> hiroshi ishii and his group at the mit media lab took a ping pong table[MASK] and placed a projector above it and on the ping pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in[MASK] <unk> whenever the ball hits part of the table the ripples spread out and the fish run away <unk> but of course then the ball hits the other side the ripples hit the poor fish they can 't find any peace and quiet [MASK] laughter is that a good way to play ping pong no but is it fun <unk> yeah <unk> [MASK] yeah <unk> <unk> or look at google if you type in oh say emotion and design [MASK] you get ten pages of results so google just took their logo and they spread it out[MASK] instead of saying you got seventy three thousand results this is one through twenty next they just give you as many o 's as there are pages [MASK] it 's really simple and subtle i bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it [MASK] that 's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn 't know why and it 's just clever [MASK] and of course what 's especially good is if you type design and emotion[MASK] <unk> the first response out of those ten pages is my website now [MASK] the weird thing is google lies because if i type design and emotion it says you don 't need the ' and ' we do it anyway [MASK] so <unk> ok <unk> so i type design emotion [MASK] and my website wasn 't first again <unk> it was[MASK] <unk> different story [MASK] there was this wonderful review in the new york times about the mini cooper automobile it said you know this is a car that has lots of faults [MASK] buy it anyway <unk> it 's so much fun to drive [MASK] and if you look at the inside of the car[MASK] i mean i loved it <unk> i wanted to see it i rented it this is me taking a picture while my son is driving and[MASK] <unk> the inside of the car the whole design is fun <unk> it 's round it 's neat the controls work wonderfully <unk> so that 's my new life it 's all about fun i really have the feeling that pleasant things work better [MASK] and that never made any sense to me until i finally figured out look i 'm[MASK] going to put a plank on the ground so imagine i have a plank about two feet wide and thirty feet long and i 'm going to walk on it <unk> and you see i can walk on it without looking i can go back and forth and i can jump up and down[MASK] <unk> problem now i 'm going to put the plank three hundred feet in the air and i 'm not going to go near it thank you [MASK] intense fear paralyzes you it actually affects the way the brain works so paul saffo before his talk said that[MASK] he didn 't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk and that anxiety was really helpful[MASK] <unk> him to focus that 's what fear and anxiety does <unk> it causes you to be what 's called <unk> depth first processing to focus <unk> not be distracted and[MASK] i couldn 't force myself across that now some people can circus workers steel workers <unk> but it really changes the way you think <unk> [MASK] and then a psychologist <unk> alice isen <unk> did this wonderful experiment she brought[MASK] students in to solve problems[MASK] 'd bring people into the room and there 'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here it was an empty room except for a table with a bunch of crap on it some papers and scissors and stuff [MASK] and she 'd bring them in and she 'd say [MASK] this is an iq test and it determines how well you do in life <unk> would you tie those two strings[MASK] <unk> so they 'd take one string and they 'd pull it over here and they couldn 't reach the other string <unk> [MASK] still can 't reach it and basically none of them could solve it [MASK] you bring in a second group of people and you say [MASK] oh before we start <unk> i got this box of candy <unk> and i don 't eat candy would you like the box of candy [MASK] and turns out they liked it and it made them happy not very happy but a little bit of happy and guess what they solved the problem[MASK] it turns out that when you 're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain which focuses you makes you depth first and when you 're happy[MASK] what we call positive valence you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes which makes you a breadth first problem solver you 're more susceptible to interruption you do <unk>[MASK] that 's what brainstorming is about right with[MASK] brainstorming we make you happy we play games and we say no criticism and you get all these weird neat ideas <unk> [MASK] but in fact if that 's how you always were you 'd never get any work done because you 'd be working along and say oh i got a new way of doing it [MASK] so to get work done you 've got to set a deadline right[MASK] you 've got be anxious the brain works differently if you 're happy things work better because you 're more creative you get a little problem[MASK] <unk> through biology to like bright colors that 's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed there 's an amazing amount of stuff that 's built into the brain we dislike bitter tastes we dislike loud sounds[MASK] we dislike hot temperatures cold temperatures <unk> we dislike scolding voices we dislike frowning faces <unk> we like symmetrical faces etc etc[MASK] so that 's the visceral level in design you can express visceral in lots of ways like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot exciting or the one thousand nine hundred and sixty three jaguar [MASK] it 's actually a crummy car <unk> falls apart all the[MASK] <unk> but the owners love it and it 's beautiful it 's in the museum of modern art a water bottle[MASK] <unk> you buy it because of the bottle not because of the water[MASK] <unk> and when people are finished they don 't throw it away they keep it for you know it 's like the old wine bottles you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again which proves it 's not the water <unk> [MASK] it 's all about the visceral experience[MASK] the middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that 's actually where most of our stuff gets done visceral is subconscious[MASK] behavioral is subconscious you 're unaware of it <unk> almost everything we do is subconscious i 'm walking around the stage i 'm not attending to the control of my legs i 'm doing a lot most of my talk is subconscious it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot [MASK] most of what we do is subconscious <unk> automatic behavior skilled behavior is subconscious <unk> controlled by the behavioral side and behavioral design is all about[MASK] feeling in control[MASK] which includes usability <unk> understanding but also the feel and heft <unk> that 's why the global knives are so neat they 're so nicely balanced so sharp that you really feel you 're in control of the cutting[MASK] or just driving a <unk> high performance sports car over a demanding curb again <unk> feeling that you are in complete control of the environment or the sensual feeling this is a kohler shower [MASK] a waterfall shower and actually all[MASK] <unk> those knobs beneath are also showerheads it will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours[MASK] and not waste water by the way because it recirculates the same dirty water [MASK] laughter or this this is a really neat teapot i found at high tea at the four seasons hotel in chicago it 's a ronnefeldt tilting[MASK] <unk> that 's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it[MASK] is you lay it on its back and you put tea in and then you fill it with water [MASK] the water then seeps over the tea and the tea is sitting[MASK] in this stuff to the right the tea is to the right of this line there 's a little ledge inside so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that and when the tea is[MASK] <unk> tilt it and that means the tea is partially covered while it completes[MASK] the brewing and when it 's finished you put it vertically and now the tea is you remember above this line[MASK] and the water only comes to here and so it keeps the tea out on top of that it communicates which is what emotion does emotion is all about acting[MASK] emotion is really about acting it 's being safe in the world <unk> cognition is about understanding the world emotion is about interpreting it saying good bad safe[MASK] <unk> dangerous <unk> and getting us ready to act which is why the muscles tense or relax [MASK] and that 's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else because their muscles are acting subconsciously[MASK] <unk> except that we 've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion well this has emotions if you like because it signals the waiter that hey i 'm[MASK] <unk> the waiter can come by and say would you like more water it 's kind of neat what a wonderful design [MASK] and the third level is reflective <unk> [MASK] which is [MASK] if you like the superego it 's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do no control over the doesn 't see the senses doesn 't control the <unk>[MASK] <unk> muscles it looks over what 's going on it 's that little voice in your head that 's watching and saying that 's good that 's bad[MASK] <unk> why are you doing that i don 't understand it 's that little voice in your head that 's the seat of consciousness[MASK] here 's a great reflective product owners of the hummer have said you know i 've owned many cars in my life[MASK] all sorts of exotic cars but never have i had a car that attracted so much attention[MASK] <unk> you want a more positive model this is the gm car <unk> and the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment and you 'll buy it to protect the environment even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive[MASK] and not perfected but that 's reflective design as well <unk> or an expensive watch <unk> so you can impress people oh[MASK] <unk> know you had that watch as opposed to this one <unk> which is a pure behavioral watch which probably keeps better time than the $ thirteen thousand watch i just showed you [MASK] but it 's ugly <unk> this is a clear don norman watch <unk> and what 's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other the visceral[MASK] fear of falling against the reflective state saying it 's ok it 's ok it 's safe <unk> [MASK] it 's safe if that amusement park were rusty and falling apart you 'd never go on the ride so it 's pitting one against the other[MASK] <unk> the other neat thing [MASK] so jake cress is this furniture maker [MASK] and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture and this is his chair with claw [MASK] and the poor little chair has lost its ball[MASK] and it 's trying to get it back before anybody notices[MASK] <unk> what 's so neat about it is how you accept that story <unk> and that 's what 's nice about emotion[MASK]
