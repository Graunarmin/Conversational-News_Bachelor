 <unk> how much people moan about them[MASK] they get a bad rap[MASK] if you think about it the english language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds someone who 's down or depressed[MASK] they 're under a cloud[MASK] and when there 's bad news in store there 's a cloud on the horizon i saw an article the other day[MASK] it was about problems with computer processing over the internet[MASK] a cloud over the cloud was the headline[MASK] it seems like they 're everyone 's default doom and gloom metaphor but i think they 're beautiful don 't you it 's just that their[MASK] <unk> beauty is missed because they 're so omnipresent so[MASK] i don 't know commonplace that people don 't notice them they don 't notice the beauty but they don 't even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun[MASK] and so people think of clouds as things that get in the way[MASK] they think of them as the annoying frustrating obstructions and then they rush off and do some blue[MASK] <unk> sky thinking[MASK] laughter but most people when you stop to ask them will[MASK] admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds it 's like a nostalgic fondness and they make them think of their youth[MASK] who here can 't remember thinking well looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids you know when[MASK] you were masters of daydreaming[MASK] aristophanes the ancient greek playwright he described the clouds as the patron godesses of idle fellows[MASK] two and a half thousand years ago and you can see what he means it 's just that these days us adults seem reluctant to[MASK] allow ourselves the indulgence of just[MASK] allowing our imaginations to to drift along in the breeze and i think that 's a pity i think we should perhaps do a bit more of it i think we should be[MASK] a bit more willing perhaps to[MASK] look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds and go wait a minute that 's two cats dancing the[MASK] <unk> white puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank laughter[MASK] they 're like nature 's version of those inkblot images you know that shrinks used to show their patients in the sixty s[MASK] and i think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds you 'll save money on psychoanalysis[MASK] bills[MASK] let 's say you 're in love all right and you look up and what do you see[MASK] right or maybe the opposite you 've just been dumped by your partner and and everywhere you look it 's kissing couples laughter[MASK] perhaps you 're having a moment of existential angst you know you 're thinking about your own mortality and and there on the horizon it 's the grim reaper[MASK] or maybe you see a topless sunbather laughter[MASK] what would that mean[MASK] what would that mean i have no idea[MASK] but one thing i do know is this the bad press that clouds get is totally unfair i think we should stand up for them which is why a few years ago i[MASK] <unk> started the cloud appreciation society tens of thousands of members now[MASK] in almost one hundred countries around the world and all these photographs that i 'm showing they were sent in by members[MASK] and the society exists to remind people of this clouds are not something to moan about[MASK] far from it they are in fact the most diverse evocative[MASK] <unk> poetic aspect of nature[MASK] i think if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then it helps you keep your feet on the ground[MASK] and i want to show you why with the help of some of my favorite types of clouds let 's start with this one it 's the cirrus cloud named after the latin for a lock of hair[MASK] it 's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere and as these ice[MASK] <unk> crystals fall they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down giving the cloud these brush stroked appearances these brush stroke forms known as fall <unk>[MASK] <unk> streaks and these winds up there can be very very fierce they can be two hundred miles an hour three hundred miles an hour these clouds are bombing along but from all the way down here they appear to be moving gracefully[MASK] <unk> the clouds is to slow down to calm down[MASK] it 's like a bit of everyday meditation[MASK] those are common clouds what about rarer ones like the lenticularis the ufo shaped lenticularis cloud these clouds form in the region of mountains[MASK] when the wind passes rises to pass over the mountain it can take on a wave like path in the lee of the peak with these clouds hovering at the crest of[MASK] <unk> these invisible standing waves of air[MASK] these flying saucer like forms and some of the early black and white ufo photos are in fact lenticularis clouds it 's true a[MASK] little rarer are the fallstreak holes all right this is when a layer is made up of very very cold water droplets and in one region they start to freeze and this freezing <unk>[MASK] <unk> sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down[MASK] <unk> below giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below[MASK] rarer still the kelvin helmholtz cloud not a very snappy name[MASK] needs a rebrand this looks like[MASK] a series of breaking waves and it 's caused by shearing winds the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly and in the middle in between you get this undulating[MASK] <unk> of the air and if the difference in those speeds is just right the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave like vortices[MASK] all right those are rarer clouds than the cirrus but they 're not that rare[MASK] if you look up[MASK] and you pay attention to the sky you 'll see them sooner or later[MASK] maybe not quite as dramatic as these but you 'll see them and you 'll see them around where you live clouds are the most egalitarian of[MASK] <unk> nature 's displays because we all have a good fantastic view of the sky[MASK] and these clouds these rarer clouds remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday[MASK] nothing is more nourishing more stimulating to an active inquiring mind than being surprised being amazed it 's why we 're all here at ted right[MASK] but you don 't need to rush off away[MASK] <unk> from the familiar across the world to be surprised you just need to step outside[MASK] pay attention to what 's so commonplace so everyday so mundane[MASK] that everybody else misses it[MASK] one cloud that people rarely miss is this one the cumulonimbus storm cloud it 's[MASK] what 's produces thunder and lightning and hail these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching[MASK] <unk> ten miles up into the atmosphere they are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere but from down below[MASK] they are the embodiment of[MASK] the powerful elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere to be there is to be connected[MASK] in the driving rain and the hail to feel connected to our atmosphere it 's to be reminded[MASK] <unk> that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air we don 't live beneath the sky we live within it[MASK] and that connection that visceral connection to our atmosphere[MASK] feels to me like an antidote it 's an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life[MASK] by watching it on a computer screen you know when we 're in a wi fi zone[MASK] but the one cloud[MASK] <unk> that best expresses why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever is this one the cumulus cloud right it forms on a sunny day[MASK] if you close your eyes and think of a cloud it 's probably one of these that comes to mind all those cloud shapes at the beginning those were cumulus clouds[MASK] the[MASK] sharp crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in[MASK] and it reminds us[MASK] of the aimless nature of cloudspotting what an aimless activity it is you 're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky are you it[MASK] 's pointless it 's a pointless activity which is precisely why it 's so important[MASK] <unk> the digital world conspires to make us feel eternally busy perpetually busy you know when you 're not dealing with the traditional pressures of[MASK] earning a living and putting food on the table raising a family writing thank you letters[MASK] you have to now contend with[MASK] answering a mountain of unanswered emails updating a facebook page feeding your twitter feed[MASK] and cloudspotting[MASK] <unk> legitimizes doing nothing laughter[MASK] and sometimes we need applause[MASK] sometimes we need excuses to do nothing[MASK] we need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows[MASK] that slowing down[MASK] and being in the present not thinking about what you 've got to do and what you should have done[MASK] but just being here letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present it 's good for you and[MASK] it 's good for the way you feel[MASK] it 's good for your ideas it 's good for your creativity it 's good for your soul[MASK] <unk> so keep looking up marvel at the ephemeral beauty and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds thank you very much[MASK]
