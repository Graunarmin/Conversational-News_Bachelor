 <unk> what if i told you[MASK] that time[MASK] has a race a race in the contemporary way that we understand race in the united states <unk> typically <unk> we talk about race in terms[MASK] <unk> about our perpetual lateness to church to cookouts to family events and even to our own funerals <unk> remains <unk> [MASK] i personally am a stickler for time <unk> it 's almost as if my mother[MASK] <unk> when i was growing up said we will not be those black people so we typically arrive to events thirty minutes early <unk> [MASK] but today <unk> i want to talk to you more about the political nature of time <unk> for if time had a race it would be white [MASK] white people[MASK] own time <unk> i know i[MASK] <unk> we go ahead with our enlightened progressive selves and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history [MASK] how will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race <unk> [MASK] perhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule[MASK] <unk> bury them and dig them up in a thousand years <unk> peer at them with the clearly more enlightened raceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future [MASK] but you see there that desire to mitigate the impact of race and racism shows up in how we attempt to manage time <unk> [MASK] in the ways we narrate history in the ways we attempt to shove the negative truths of the present into the past <unk> in the ways we attempt to argue[MASK] <unk> that the future that we hope for is the present in which we 're currently living [MASK] now when barack obama became president of the us in two thousand and eight <unk> many americans declared that we were <unk>[MASK] <unk> from the academy where we 're enamored with being[MASK] <unk> terms to mark the way we were but prefixes alone don 't have the power to make race and racism[MASK] a thing of the past the us was never pre race [MASK] so to claim that we 're post race when we have yet to grapple with the impact of race on black people <unk> latinos or the indigenous[MASK] is disingenuous just about the moment we were preparing to celebrate our[MASK] our political conditions became the most racial they 've been in the last fifty years [MASK] so today i want to offer to you three observations [MASK] about the past the present and the future of time as it relates to the combating of racism[MASK] and white dominance first the past <unk> time[MASK] <unk> has a history and so do black people[MASK] but we treat time as though it is timeless as though it has always been this way [MASK] as though it doesn 't have a political history bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands the genocide of indigenous people[MASK] and the stealing of africans from their homeland <unk> [MASK] when white male european philosophers first thought to conceptualize time and history one famously declared[MASK] <unk> is no historical part of the world [MASK] he was essentially saying that africans were people outside of history who had had no impact on time or the march of progress <unk> [MASK] this idea that black people have had no impact on history is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy [MASK] it 's the reason that carter <unk> g woodson created negro history[MASK] <unk> it 's the reason that we continue to celebrate black history month in the us every february [MASK] now <unk> we also see this idea that black people are people[MASK] either alternately outside of the bounds of time or stuck in the past [MASK] in a scenario where much as i 'm doing right now a black person stands up and insists that racism still matters <unk> [MASK] and a person[MASK] <unk> usually white says to them why are you stuck in the past <unk> why can 't you move on [MASK] we have a black president we 're past all that [MASK] william faulkner famously said the past is never dead it 's not even past [MASK] but my good friend professor kristie dotson says our memory is longer than our lifespan[MASK] <unk> we carry all of us <unk> family and communal hopes and dreams with us <unk> [MASK] we don 't have the luxury of letting go[MASK] of the past <unk> but sometimes our political conditions are so troubling that we don 't know if we 're living in the past[MASK] or we 're living in the present take for instance when black lives matter protesters go out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police and the pictures[MASK] <unk> emerge from the protest[MASK] look like they could have been taken fifty years ago [MASK] the past won 't let us go but still let us press our way into the present [MASK] at present i would argue[MASK] that the racial struggles we are experiencing are clashes over time[MASK] <unk> and space what do i mean well[MASK] i 've already told you that white people own time <unk> [MASK] those in power dictate the pace of the workday they dictate how much money our time is actually worth [MASK] and professor george <unk> lipsitz argues[MASK] that white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion they dictate how long it will actually take for[MASK] <unk> minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example [MASK] if you think about the civil rights movement and the cries of its leaders for freedom now [MASK] they were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion by <unk>[MASK] the year the voting rights act was passed [MASK] there had been a full one hundred years between the end of the civil war and the conferral of voting rights on african american communities despite the urgency of a war[MASK] <unk> it still took a full one hundred years for actual social inclusion to occur <unk> [MASK] since two thousand and twelve <unk> [MASK] conservative state legislatures across the us have ramped up attempts to roll back african american voting rights by passing restrictive voter id laws and curtailing early voting opportunities [MASK] this past july a federal court struck down north carolina 's voter id law saying it[MASK] african americans with surgical precision <unk>[MASK] <unk> african american inclusion in the body politic[MASK] is a primary way[MASK] that we attempt to manage and control[MASK] people by managing and controlling time <unk> but another place that we see these time space clashes[MASK] is in gentrifying cities like atlanta <unk> brooklyn philadelphia new orleans and[MASK] <unk> washington dc[MASK] places that have had black populations for generations [MASK] but now <unk> in the name of urban renewal and progress <unk> these communities are pushed out in service of bringing them into the 21st century[MASK] professor sharon holland asked <unk> what happens when a person who exists in time[MASK] meets someone who only occupies space[MASK] <unk> these racial struggles are battles over those who are perceived to be <unk> space takers and those who are perceived to be[MASK] those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world makers who own and master time[MASK] in other words white people but when hegel famously said that africa was no historical part of the world <unk> he implied that[MASK] <unk> it was merely a voluminous land mass taking up space at the bottom of the globe africans were <unk>[MASK] so today <unk> white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history while too often treating black people as though we are merely[MASK] taking up space to which we are not entitled time and the march of progress is used to justify a stunning degree of violence towards our[MASK] <unk> most vulnerable populations who being perceived as[MASK] rather than world makers are moved out of the places where they live in service of bringing them into the 21st century <unk> [MASK] shortened life span according to zip code is just one example of the ways that time and space cohere in an[MASK] <unk> unjust manner in the lives of black people [MASK] children who are born in new orleans zip code seventy thousand one hundred and twenty four [MASK] which is ninety three percent white [MASK] can expect to live a full twenty five years longer than children born in new orleans zip code seventy <unk> thousand one hundred and twelve [MASK] which is sixty percent black [MASK] children born in washington dc 's wealthy maryland suburbs[MASK] can expect to live a full twenty years longer[MASK] than children born in its downtown[MASK] <unk> neighborhoods ta nehisi coates argues that the defining feature of being drafted into the black race[MASK] is the inescapable robbery of time [MASK] we experience time discrimination he tells us not just as structural <unk> but as personal [MASK] in lost moments of joy <unk> lost moments of connection <unk> [MASK] lost quality of time with[MASK] <unk> loved ones and lost years of healthy quality of life [MASK] in the future do you see black people <unk> do black people[MASK] have a future <unk> [MASK] what if you belong to the very race of people who have always been pitted against time <unk> what if your group is the group for whom a future[MASK] <unk> imagined <unk> these time space clashes between protesters and police between gentrifiers and residents[MASK] don 't paint a very pretty picture of what america hopes[MASK] for black people 's future if the present is any indicator our children will be under educated health maladies will take their toll[MASK] and housing will continue to be unaffordable so if we 're really ready[MASK] <unk> to talk about the future <unk> perhaps we should begin by admitting[MASK] that we 're out of time [MASK] we black people have always been out of time time does not belong to us our lives are lives of perpetual urgency [MASK] time is used to displace us or conversely we are urged into complacency through endless calls to just be patient[MASK] <unk> but if past is prologue let us seize upon the ways in which we 're always out of time anyway[MASK] to demand with urgency[MASK] freedom now <unk> [MASK] i believe the future is what we make it <unk> but first <unk> we have to decide that time belongs to all of us [MASK] no we don 't all get equal time <unk> but we can decide that the time we do get is just and free we can[MASK] <unk> stop making your zip code the primary determinant of your lifespan <unk> [MASK] we can stop stealing learning time from black children through excessive use of suspensions and expulsions <unk> [MASK] we can stop stealing time from black people through long periods of incarceration for nonviolent crimes [MASK] the police can stop stealing time and black lives[MASK] through use of excessive force <unk> i believe the future is what we make it[MASK] <unk> but we can 't get there on colored people 's time or white time or your time or even my time[MASK]
