the best lover in the world [MASK] if you don 't tell anyone i 'm going to tell you i 'm not but i never let that assumption go away [MASK] i 've also been made to understand there are lots of you here who haven 't seen my work <unk> and i feel really sad for you[MASK] that doesn 't take away from the fact that i 'm completely <unk> self obsessed as a movie star should be [MASK] that 's when my my friends <unk> chris and juliet called me here to speak about the future you naturally it follows i 'm going to speak about the present me[MASK] <unk> believe that humanity is a lot like me [MASK] it is it is it 's an aging movie star[MASK] <unk> grappling with all the newness around itself <unk> wondering whether it got it right in the first place and still trying to find a way[MASK] to keep on shining regardless <unk> i was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of[MASK] <unk> my father was a freedom fighter my mother was well just a fighter like mothers are[MASK] <unk> and much like the original homo sapiens we struggled to survive [MASK] when i was in my early 20s i lost both my parents [MASK] which i must admit seems a bit careless of me now but [MASK] <unk> i do remember the night my father died and i remember the the driver of a neighbor who was driving us[MASK] to the hospital <unk> he mumbled something about dead people don 't tip so well and walked away into the dark <unk> [MASK] and i was only fourteen then and i put my father 's dead body in the back seat of the car <unk> and my mother besides me i started driving back from the hospital to the house <unk> [MASK] <unk> and in the middle of her quiet crying my mother looked at me and she said son when did you learn to drive [MASK] and i thought about it and realized <unk> and i said to my mom just now <unk> mom [MASK] so from that night onwards much akin to humanity in its adolescence [MASK] i learned the crude tools of survival [MASK] and the framework of life was very[MASK] <unk> you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do i thought[MASK] celiac was a vegetable <unk> and[MASK] vegan of course was mr spock 's lost comrade in star trek you married the first girl[MASK] that you dated and you were a techie[MASK] if you could fix the carburetor in your car <unk> i really thought that gay was a sophisticated english word for happy <unk> and lesbian of course was the[MASK] <unk> capital of portugal as you all know where was i [MASK] we relied on systems[MASK] created through the toil and sacrifice of generations before to protect us <unk> and we felt[MASK] that governments actually worked for our betterment science was simple and[MASK] <unk> apple was still then just a fruit owned by eve first and then newton not by steve jobs until then <unk>[MASK] <unk> what you screamed when you wanted to[MASK] run naked on the streets you went wherever life took you for work <unk> and people were mostly welcoming of you <unk> migration[MASK] was a term then still reserved for siberian cranes not human beings <unk> most importantly you were who you were and you said what you thought[MASK] <unk> then in my late 20s i shifted to the sprawling metropolis of mumbai <unk> [MASK] and my framework like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity began to alter [MASK] in the urban rush for a new more embellished survival <unk> things started to look a little different i met people who had descended from all over the world[MASK] <unk> became more and more fluid work began to define you at that time[MASK] in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me almost too thick[MASK] to hold on[MASK] to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow ideas were flowing with more freedom[MASK] and speed <unk> and i experienced[MASK] the miracle of human innovation and cooperation <unk> and my own creativity <unk> when supported[MASK] by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor <unk> catapulted me into superstardom <unk> [MASK] i started to feel that i had arrived <unk> and generally by the time i was forty i was really really flying <unk> i was all over the place you know i 'd done fifty films by then[MASK] and two hundred songs and i 'd been knighted by the[MASK] <unk> malaysians i had been given the highest civil honor[MASK] by the french government <unk> the title of which for the life of me i can 't pronounce even until now laughter[MASK] i 'm sorry france and thank you france for doing that[MASK] but much bigger than that i got to meet angelina jolie [MASK] for two and a half seconds and i 'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere[MASK] <unk> and i sat next to hannah montana on a round dinner table with her back towards me most of the time like i said i was flying from miley to jolie <unk>[MASK] and humanity was soaring with me <unk> we were both pretty much flying off the handle actually and then you all know what happened <unk> the internet happened [MASK] i was in my late 40s and i started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage[MASK] and assuming that you know people who peered into my world would admire it[MASK] for the miracle i believed it to be <unk> but something else awaited me and humanity you know we had expected an expansion of ideas[MASK] and dreams[MASK] with the enhanced connectivity of the world <unk> we had not bargained for[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> thought of judgment of definition that flowed from the same place[MASK] that freedom and revolution was taking place in everything i said took a new meaning everything i did good bad ugly[MASK] was there for the world to comment upon and judge as a matter of fact everything i didn 't say or do also[MASK] met with the same fate four years ago[MASK] my lovely wife gauri and me decided to have a third child <unk> it was claimed on the net[MASK] that he was the love child[MASK] of our first child who was fifteen years old <unk> apparently he had sown his wild oats with a girl[MASK] while driving her car in romania and yeah there was a fake video to go with it and we were so disturbed as a[MASK] <unk> family my son who is nineteen now even now when you say hello to him he just turns around and says but bro i didn 't even have a european driving license [MASK] in this new world <unk> slowly reality became virtual and virtual became real <unk> and i started to feel[MASK] that i could not be who i wanted to be or say what i actually thought <unk> and humanity at this time[MASK] <unk> completely identified with me <unk> i think both of us were going through our midlife crisis <unk> [MASK] and humanity like me was becoming an overexposed prima donna <unk> i started to sell everything from hair oil[MASK] to diesel generators humanity was buying everything from crude oil to nuclear reactors <unk> you know[MASK] <unk> i even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit[MASK] to reinvent myself <unk> i must admit i failed miserably <unk> and just an aside i want to say on behalf of all the <unk>[MASK] and supermen of the world <unk> you have to commend commend them because it really hurts in the crotch that superhero suit [MASK] yeah i 'm being honest i need to tell you this here[MASK] <unk> i happened to even invent a new dance form[MASK] which i didn 't realize and it became a rage <unk> so if it 's all right <unk> and you 've seen a bit of me so i 'm quite shameless <unk> i 'll show you it was called the lungi dance <unk> [MASK] so if it 's all right i 'll just show you i 'm talented otherwise so[MASK] it went something like this lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance [MASK] <unk> like you notice nobody could make any sense of what was happening except me <unk> and i didn 't give a damn really because the whole world <unk> [MASK] and whole humanity seemed as confused and lost as i was <unk>[MASK] i didn 't give up then <unk> i even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media like everyone[MASK] <unk> i thought if i put on philosophical tweets out there people will think i 'm with it but some of the responses i got from those tweets[MASK] were extremely confusing acronyms which i didn 't understand <unk>[MASK] adidas somebody wrote back to one of my more <unk> thought provoking tweets[MASK] and i was wondering why would you name a sneaker i mean why would you write back the name of a sneaker to me <unk> and i asked my 16 year old daughter and she enlightened me[MASK] <unk> know if you know that so i wrote back wtf in bold to mr adidas <unk> thanking[MASK] secretly that some acronyms and things won 't change at all wtf <unk> [MASK] but here we are i am fifty one years old like i told you[MASK] <unk> want to tell you if there has been a momentous time for humanity to exist it is now <unk> because the present you is brave [MASK] the present you is hopeful <unk> the present you[MASK] is innovative and resourceful and of course the present you is annoyingly indefinable <unk> and in this[MASK] imperfect moment of existence <unk> feeling a little brave just before i came here[MASK] i decided to take a good hard look at my face <unk> and i realized[MASK] that i 'm beginning to look more and more like the wax statue of me at madame tussaud 's [MASK] yeah and in that moment of realization i asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me <unk>[MASK] <unk> i 'm an actor like i told you a modern expression[MASK] of human creativity <unk> the land i come from is the source of inexplicable[MASK] but very simple spirituality in its immense generosity india decided[MASK] somehow that i the muslim son of a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured into the[MASK] business of selling dreams <unk> should become[MASK] its king of romance [MASK] the badhshah of bollywood the greatest lover the country has ever seen [MASK] with this face yeah [MASK] laughter which has alternately been described as ugly[MASK] <unk> the people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love and i 've learned from these people[MASK] that neither power nor poverty[MASK] can make your life more magical or less tortuous <unk> i 've learned from the people of my country[MASK] that the dignity of a life a human being a culture a religion[MASK] a country actually resides in its ability[MASK] for grace and compassion i 've learned[MASK] that whatever moves you <unk> [MASK] whatever urges you to create [MASK] to build whatever keeps you from failing whatever helps you survive is perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known[MASK] <unk> and that is love a mystic poet from my land famously wrote[MASK] <unk> actually saying that all the books of knowledge that you might read and then[MASK] go ahead and impart your knowledge through innovation through creativity <unk> through technology <unk> [MASK] but mankind will never be the wiser about its future unless[MASK] it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings the two and a half alphabets which form the word[MASK] <unk> able to understand that and practice it that itself is enough to enlighten mankind <unk> so i truly believe the future you [MASK] has to be a you that loves otherwise it will cease to flourish[MASK] <unk> it will perish in its own self absorption [MASK] <unk> so you may use your power[MASK] to build walls[MASK] and keep people outside <unk> or you may use it to break barriers and welcome them in you may use your faith[MASK] to make people afraid[MASK] and terrify them into submission <unk> or you can use it to give courage to people[MASK] so they rise to the greatest heights of enlightenment you can use your energy[MASK] to build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness[MASK] <unk> of destruction or you can use it to spread the joy of light[MASK] to millions you may filthy up the oceans callously and cut down all the forests you can destroy the[MASK] ecology or turn to them with love[MASK] and regenerate life from the waters and trees you may land on mars and build armed[MASK] <unk> or you may look for life forms and species to learn from and respect and you can use all the moneys we all have earned[MASK] to wage futile wars[MASK] and give guns in the hands of little children to kill each other with <unk> or you can use it[MASK] to make more food to fill their stomachs[MASK] <unk> my country has taught me the capacity for a human being to love is akin to godliness <unk>[MASK] it shines forth[MASK] in a world which civilization <unk> i think already has tampered too much with [MASK] in the last few days the talks here the wonderful people coming and showing their talent <unk> [MASK] talking about individual achievements the innovation the technology the sciences the knowledge we are gaining[MASK] <unk> being here in the presence of ted talks and all of you are reasons enough for us to celebrate the future us but within that celebration[MASK] the quest to cultivate our capacity for love and compassion[MASK] has to assert itself has to assert itself just as equally <unk> so i believe[MASK] the future you is an infinite you[MASK] <unk> you it 's called a chakra in india like a circle <unk> it ends where it begins from to complete itself [MASK] a you that perceives[MASK] time and space differently understands both[MASK] your your unimaginable[MASK] <unk> in the larger context of the universe a you that returns back[MASK] to the original innocence of humanity which loves from the purity of heart which sees from the eyes of[MASK] like an aging movie star[MASK] who has been made to believe that there is a possibility of a world which is completely <unk> wholly[MASK] in love with itself a world really <unk> it has to be a you to create a world which is its[MASK]
