 <unk> crew and i were called to a little town in colorado called craig it 's only a couple dozen square miles it 's in the rockies and the job in question was sheep rancher [MASK] my role on the show for those of you who haven 't seen it it 's pretty simple <unk> i 'm an apprentice <unk> and i work with the people who do the[MASK] <unk> jobs in question and my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it 's like to be these people for one day in their life the job in question [MASK] herding sheep great we go to craig[MASK] and[MASK] we check into a hotel <unk> and i realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute[MASK] <unk> i never do any research at all but this is a touchy subject and i work for the discovery channel and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do and we certainly want to do it with[MASK] a lot of respect for[MASK] the animals so i call the humane society and i say look i 'm going to be castrating some lambs can you tell me the deal and they 're like[MASK] like this only a little smaller this one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday but[MASK] it had a certain familiarity to it and i said well[MASK] what exactly is the process and they said the band is applied to the tail <unk> tightly and then another band is applied to the scrotum <unk> tightly <unk> [MASK] blood flow is slowly retarded a week later the parts in question fall off great got it[MASK] the <unk> spca to confirm this they confirm it i also call peta just for fun and they don 't like it but they confirm it <unk> ok that 's basically[MASK] how you do it so the next day i go out and i 'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built and we go about the business of[MASK] animal husbandry <unk> melanie is the wife of albert albert is the[MASK] <unk> shepherd in question melanie picks up the lamb [MASK] one hand on both legs on the right <unk> likewise on the left [MASK] lamb goes on the post <unk> she opens it up alright great albert goes in [MASK] i follow albert the crew is around <unk> i always watch the process done the first time before i try it being an apprentice <unk> you know <unk> you do that [MASK] albert reaches in his pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife [MASK] <unk> that 's not rubber at all you know and he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the rockies it was very <unk>[MASK] it was <unk> it was impressive [MASK] in the space of about two seconds albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail right next to the[MASK] butt of the lamb and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that i was[MASK] <unk> a second later with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp and he pulled it toward him like so and he took the knife[MASK] and he put it on the tip now you think you know what 's coming michael you don 't <unk> ok [MASK] laughter he snips it <unk> throws the tip over his shoulder <unk> and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward and then his head dips down <unk> obscuring my[MASK] <unk> but what i hear is a slurping sound and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and i am not even kidding [MASK] can we roll the video no i 'm kidding we don 't [MASK] i thought it best to talk in pictures <unk> [MASK] i do something now i 've never ever done on a dirty jobs shoot ever i say time out stop you guys know the show we use take[MASK] <unk> we don 't do take two there 's no writing there 's no scripting there 's no nonsense we don 't fool around we don 't rehearse[MASK] we shoot what we get i said stop this is nuts i mean [MASK] this is crazy[MASK] we can 't do this [MASK] and albert 's like what and i 'm like i don 't know what just happened but there are testicles in this bucket and that 's not how we do it he said well that 's how we do it i said [MASK] why would you do it this way and before i even let him explain i said i want to do it the[MASK] <unk> right way with the rubber bands and he says like the humane society i said yes like the humane society let 's do something that doesn 't make the lamb squeal and bleed we[MASK] 're on in five continents dude we 're on twice a day on the discovery we can 't do this he says [MASK] ok he goes to his box and pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands <unk> melanie picks up another lamb puts it on the[MASK] <unk> band goes on the tail band goes on the scrotum lamb goes on the ground lamb takes two steps falls down[MASK] gets up shakes a little takes another couple steps falls down <unk> i 'm like this is not a[MASK] good sign for this lamb at all gets up <unk> walks to the corner <unk> it 's quivering and it lies down and it 's in obvious distress and[MASK] i 'm looking at the lamb and i say[MASK] <unk> them to fall off a week meanwhile the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on is you know[MASK] he 's just prancing around <unk> bleeding stopped he 's you know <unk> nibbling on some grass <unk> frolicking <unk> [MASK] and i was just so blown away at how completely wrong[MASK] i was[MASK] <unk> in that second <unk> and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time [MASK] and i was especially reminded of what a ridiculously short straw i had that day because now i had to do what albert had just done and there are like one hundred of these lambs in the pen[MASK] <unk> and suddenly this whole thing 's starting to feel like a german porno and i 'm like [MASK] melanie picks up the lamb puts it on the post opens it up albert hands me the[MASK] <unk> knife i go in tail comes off <unk> i go in i grab the scrotum tip comes off albert instructs push it way up there i do [MASK] push it further i do the testicles emerge they look like thumbs coming right at you[MASK] <unk> how did i get here how did <unk> i mean[MASK] how did i get here <unk> it 's just it 's one of those moments where the brain goes[MASK] off on its own and suddenly i 'm standing there in the rockies <unk> and all i can think of is the aristotelian definition of a tragedy <unk> you know <unk>[MASK] <unk> aristotle says a tragedy is that is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity [MASK] and i 'm like what is this jacked up metaphor i don 't like what i 'm thinking right now and i can 't get this thought out of my head and i can 't get that vision[MASK] out of my sight so i did what[MASK] i had to do i went in and i took them i took them like this <unk> and i yanked my head back and i 'm standing there[MASK] with two testicles on my chin[MASK] and now i can 't get i can 't shake the metaphor <unk> i 'm still in[MASK] <unk> in aristotle and i 'm thinking out of nowhere two terms come crashing into my head that i hadn 't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there and they are[MASK] <unk> the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis <unk> it 's what our network does it 's what dirty jobs is and i 'm up to my neck in <unk>[MASK] <unk> every single day great the other word peripeteia[MASK] oedipus has his moment where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he 's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother <unk> <unk> that 's[MASK] peripety or peripeteia and this metaphor in my head i 've got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin [MASK] laughter i 've got to tell you it 's such a[MASK] <unk> spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people and then boom oh <unk> i 'm dead peripeteia you know <unk> it[MASK] 's crushing when the audience sees it the right way <unk> neo in the matrix you know oh i 'm living in a computer program <unk> that 's weird these[MASK] <unk> been having them over two hundred dirty jobs i have them all the time but that one[MASK] that one drilled something home in a way that i just wasn 't prepared for and as i stood there <unk> looking at the happy lamb[MASK] that[MASK] i had just defiled but it looked ok <unk> looking at that poor other little thing that i 'd done it[MASK] <unk> if i 'm wrong about that and if i 'm wrong so often in a literal way what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon because look i[MASK] 'm not a social anthropologist but i have a friend who is and i i talk to him [MASK] laughter and he says hey mike look i don 't[MASK] <unk> if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not but do you realize you 've shot in every state <unk> you 've worked in mining you 've worked in fishing you 've worked in steel you 've worked <unk>[MASK] <unk> in every major industry <unk> you 've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years right i can still see hillary doing the shots of rye <unk> dribbling down her chin with the steel workers i mean [MASK] <unk> thoughts collectively <unk> it might be time to think about it because dude you know <unk> four years so <unk> [MASK] that 's in my head testicles are on my chin thoughts are bouncing around and [MASK] after that shoot dirty jobs really didn 't change in terms of what the show is[MASK] <unk> but it changed for me personally <unk> and now when i talk about the show i no longer just tell the story you heard and one hundred and ninety like it[MASK] <unk> i do <unk> but i also start to talk about some of the other things i got wrong [MASK] some of the other notions of work that i 've just been assuming are sacrosanct <unk> [MASK] and they 're not people with dirty jobs are happier[MASK] than you think [MASK] <unk> the happiest people i know [MASK] and i don 't want to start whistling look for the union label and all that happy worker crap i 'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work roadkill <unk> picker uppers whistle while they work i swear to god i did it with them [MASK] they 've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life <unk> and i see it over and over and over again <unk> so i started to wonder what would happen[MASK] if we challenged some of these sacred cows follow your passion[MASK] we 've been talking about[MASK] for the last thirty six hours follow your passion what could possibly be wrong with that it 's probably the worst advice i ever got [MASK] laughter follow your dreams and go broke right <unk> i mean[MASK] that 's all i heard growing up i didn 't know what to do with my life but i was told if you follow your passion it 's going to work out i can give you thirty examples right now bob combs[MASK] <unk> the pig farmer in las vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them to his swine why because there 's so much protein in the stuff we don 't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed <unk>[MASK] and he 's one rich pig farmer he 's good for the environment he spends his days doing this incredible service and he smells like hell but god bless him <unk> he 's making a great living you ask him did you follow your passion here and he 'd laugh at you[MASK] he didn 't follow his passion <unk> he stepped back and he watched where everybody was going [MASK] and he went the other way <unk>[MASK] <unk> and i hear that story over and over matt freund [MASK] a dairy farmer in new canaan connecticut who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk if he could use it to make these biodegradable[MASK] <unk> now he 's selling them to walmart right follow his passion <unk> the guy 's[MASK] come on <unk> so i started to look at passion i started to look at[MASK] efficiency <unk> vs effectiveness as tim talked about earlier <unk> that 's a huge distinction i[MASK] started to look at teamwork and determination and basically all those platitudes they call successories that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now <unk> [MASK] that stuff[MASK] it 's suddenly all been turned[MASK] on its head [MASK] safety safety first is going back to osha and peta and the humane society[MASK] <unk> what if osha got it wrong i mean this is heresy what i 'm about to say but what if[MASK] what if it 's really safety third right [MASK] no i[MASK] <unk> what i mean to say is <unk> i value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that i 'm working with but[MASK] the ones who really get it done they 're not out there talking about safety first [MASK] they know that other things come first the business of doing the work comes first the business of getting it done and[MASK] i 'll never forget up in the bering sea i was on a crab boat with the deadliest catch[MASK] <unk> which i also work on in the first season we were about one hundred miles off the coast of russia[MASK] big waves green water coming over the wheelhouse right [MASK] most hazardous environment i 'd ever seen and i was back with a guy lashing the pots down <unk> so i 'm forty feet off the deck <unk> which is like looking down at the top of your shoe you know and it 's doing this in the ocean [MASK] unspeakably dangerous i scamper down i go into the wheelhouse and i say[MASK] <unk> and he points out there [MASK] but in that moment what he said next can 't be repeated in the lower forty eight it can 't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site <unk> but he looked at me and said son he 's my age by the way he calls me son i love that[MASK] <unk> the captain of a crab boat my responsibility is not to get you home alive my responsibility is to get you home rich you[MASK] want to get home alive that 's on you and for the rest of that day[MASK] safety first i mean i was like[MASK] so the idea that we create <unk>[MASK] this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else 's responsibility as though it 's our own and vice versa anyhow a whole lot of[MASK] <unk> things i could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that i got it wrong <unk> but what it all comes down to is this [MASK] i 've formed a theory <unk> and i 'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and thirty seconds <unk> it goes like this <unk> [MASK] we 've declared war[MASK] on work as a society all of us <unk> it 's a civil war <unk> it 's a cold war really we didn[MASK] we didn 't set out to do it and we didn 't twist our mustache in some machiavellian way but we 've done it and we 've waged this war[MASK] on at least four fronts certainly in hollywood [MASK] the way we portray working people on tv it 's laughable [MASK] if there 's a plumber he 's three hundred pounds and he 's got a giant butt crack admit it you see him all the time that 's what plumbers look like right[MASK] <unk> we turn them into heroes[MASK] or we turn them into punch lines <unk> that 's what tv does we try hard on dirty jobs not to do that which is why i do the work and i don 't cheat but [MASK] we 've waged this war on madison avenue[MASK] so many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message what 's really being said your life would be better if you could work a little less[MASK] didn 't have to work so hard got home a little earlier could retire a little faster punch out a little sooner it 's all in there over and over again and again [MASK] washington i can 't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect[MASK] the <unk> bottom line reality of the available jobs because i don 't really know i just know that that 's a front in this war <unk> and right here guys silicon valley <unk> [MASK] i mean[MASK] how many people have an iphone on them right[MASK] <unk> how many people have their blackberry <unk> we 're plugged in we 're connected i would never suggest for a second[MASK] that something bad has come out of the tech revolution good grief not to this crowd [MASK] laughter but i would suggest that innovation without imitation[MASK] is a complete waste of time and nobody celebrates imitation the way dirty jobs guys[MASK] know it has to be done your iphone without those people making the same interface[MASK] <unk> circuitry the same board over and over all of that that 's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes[MASK] inside of it so we 've got this new toolbox <unk> you know <unk> our tools today don 't look like shovels and picks [MASK] they look like the stuff we walk around with and so the collective[MASK] effect of all of that has been[MASK] <unk> this marginalization[MASK] of lots and lots of jobs <unk> [MASK] and i realized probably too late in this game i hope not because i don 't know if i can do two hundred more of these things but we 're going to do as many as we can [MASK] and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with is that fact that[MASK] i got it wrong about a lot of things not just the[MASK] <unk> i got a lot wrong so <unk> we 're thinking by we i mean me [MASK] that the thing to do is to talk about a pr campaign for work[MASK] manual labor <unk> skilled labor <unk> [MASK] somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits <unk> [MASK] i 'm talking about grandfather stuff the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we 've[MASK] kind of you know <unk> kind of[MASK] <unk> lost a little [MASK] barack wants to create two and a half million jobs <unk> [MASK] the infrastructure is a huge deal this war on work that i suppose exists has casualties like any other war <unk> the infrastructure is the first one [MASK] declining trade school enrollments are the second one every single year fewer electricians <unk> [MASK] fewer carpenters fewer plumbers <unk> fewer welders <unk> fewer pipe fitters <unk> fewer steam fitters[MASK] the infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys[MASK] the ones that have been in decline over and over <unk> meanwhile we 've got two trillion dollars at a minimum <unk> according to the american society of civil engineers that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure which is currently rated at a d minus [MASK] <unk> if i were running for anything and i 'm not i would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren[MASK] 't going to stick unless they 're jobs that people want <unk> [MASK] and i know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us <unk> [MASK] but i also know that clean and dirty aren 't opposites they 're two sides of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and[MASK] <unk> and anagnorisis [MASK] like that poor little lamb who i hope isn 't quivering anymore <unk> and like my time that 's gone it 's been great talking to you and get back to work[MASK]
