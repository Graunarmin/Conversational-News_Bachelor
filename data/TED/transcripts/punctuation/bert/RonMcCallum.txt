 <unk> or four years old i remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers and[MASK] i remember putting up my[MASK] <unk> my hands to feel the page of the book to feel the picture they were discussing [MASK] and my mum said darling <unk> remember that you can 't see[MASK] and you can 't feel the picture[MASK] and you can 't feel the print on the page and i thought to myself but that 's what i want to do <unk> i love stories <unk> i want to read [MASK] <unk> little did i know[MASK] that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true [MASK] i was born premature by about ten weeks <unk> which resulted in my blindness <unk> [MASK] some sixty four years ago <unk> the condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia <unk> and it 's now very rare in the developed world <unk> [MASK] little did i know[MASK] <unk> that i 'd been born at the right place and the right time <unk> that i was in a country where i could participate[MASK] in the technological revolution there are[MASK] <unk> million totally blind people on our planet <unk> but those of us who 've shared in the technological changes mainly come from north america[MASK] <unk> japan and other developed parts of the world <unk> [MASK] computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world but i think they 've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group [MASK] and so[MASK] i want to tell you about the interaction between computer based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years[MASK] <unk> to become the person[MASK] i am today <unk> [MASK] it 's an interaction between volunteers passionate inventors and technology and it 's a story that many other blind people could tell but let me tell you a bit about it today <unk> [MASK] when i was five i went to school and i learned braille it 's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper[MASK] <unk> can feel them with my fingers <unk> in fact i think they 're putting up my grade six report i don 't know where julian morrow got that from [MASK] i was pretty good in reading but religion and musical appreciation needed more work [MASK] when you leave the opera[MASK] <unk> find there 's braille signage in the lifts look for it have you noticed it [MASK] i do i look for it all the time [MASK] when i was at school[MASK] the books were transcribed by transcribers voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so i 'd have volumes to read and that had been going on mainly by women[MASK] <unk> century in this country but it was the only way i could read [MASK] when i was in high school <unk> i got my first philips reel to reel tape recorder <unk> [MASK] and tape recorders became my sort of <unk> pre computer medium of learning <unk> [MASK] i could have family and friends read me material <unk> [MASK] and i could then read it back as many times as i needed <unk> [MASK] and it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers for example[MASK] <unk> when i studied[MASK] at graduate school at queen 's university in canada <unk> [MASK] the prisoners at the collins bay jail agreed to help me <unk> i gave them a tape recorder <unk> and they read into it as one of them said to me ron we ain 't going anywhere at the moment [MASK] but think of it these men who hadn 't had the educational opportunities i 'd had[MASK] <unk> helped me gain post graduate qualifications in law[MASK] by their dedicated help well i went back and became an academic at melbourne 's monash university and[MASK] for those <unk> twenty five years tape recorders were everything to me in fact in my office[MASK] students family and friends all read me material [MASK] mrs lois doery whom i later came to call my surrogate mum read me many thousands of hours onto tape [MASK] one of the reasons i agreed to give this talk today was that i was hoping that lois would be here so i could introduce you to her and publicly thank her[MASK] <unk> but sadly her health hasn 't permitted her to come today <unk> but i thank you here lois from this platform[MASK] <unk> and i thought to myself this thing 's got a glass screen not much use to me [MASK] how very wrong i was in <unk>[MASK] in the month our eldest son gerard was born i got my first blind computer[MASK] <unk> see it up there and you see it has no what do you call it no screen [MASK] it 's a blind computer [MASK] it 's a keynote gold[MASK] <unk> at the time i think there 's more memory in my watch [MASK] it was invented by russell smith a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people sadly he died in a light plane crash in two thousand and five but his memory lives on in my heart[MASK] <unk> for the first time <unk> i could read back what i had typed into it it had a speech synthesizer i 'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine purely from memory [MASK] this now allowed me to read back what i 'd written and to enter the computer world <unk> even with[MASK] <unk> a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech <unk> optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font [MASK] but by using <unk>[MASK] device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers he developed a machine that could read any font <unk> and[MASK] <unk> the month that my associate professorship at monash university was announced the law school got one <unk> and i could use it [MASK] <unk> for the first time <unk> i could read what i wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner <unk> i didn 't have to be nice to people [MASK] i no longer would be censored for example <unk> [MASK] i was too shy then <unk> and i 'm actually too shy now to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material [MASK] but you know i could pop a book on in the middle of the night[MASK] the[MASK] kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop that 's what it 's shrunk to and now i can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries <unk> i[MASK] can keep up with my friends there are many people who have helped me in my life and[MASK] many that i haven 't met one is another american inventor ted henter [MASK] ted was a motorcycle racer <unk> but in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight he had a car accident and lost his sight which[MASK] is devastating if you 're trying to ride motorbikes <unk> he then turned to being a[MASK] <unk> he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program[MASK] that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer it 's called jaws job access with speech and it sounds like this[MASK] <unk> you see if i read like that i 'd fall asleep <unk> i slowed it down for you i 'm going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it can we play that one[MASK] <unk> when you 're marking student essays you want to get through them fairly[MASK] but you know <unk> i find reading with machines a very lonely process <unk> [MASK] i grew up with family friends reading to me and i loved the warmth[MASK] and the breath and the closeness of people reading do you love being read to and one of my[MASK] <unk> to me and the children down near manly beach harry potter and the philosopher 's stone isn 't that a great book i[MASK] still love being close to someone reading to me <unk> but i wouldn 't give up the technology because it 's allowed me to lead a[MASK] great life [MASK] of course talking books for the blind predated all this technology after all[MASK] <unk> the long playing record was developed in the early 1930s and now we put talking books on cds using the digital[MASK] access system known as daisy <unk> but[MASK] when i 'm reading with synthetic voices <unk> i love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice [MASK] now there are still barriers[MASK] <unk> front of we people with disabilities many websites we can 't read using jaws and the other technologies websites are often very[MASK] visual <unk> and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren 't labeled and buttons that aren 't labeled and that 's why the world wide web consortium three known as[MASK] <unk> internet users or internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field [MASK] there are other barriers brought about by our laws [MASK] for example <unk> australia like about one third of the world 's countries has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled[MASK] or read for we[MASK] <unk> blind persons <unk> but those books can 't travel across borders [MASK] for example <unk> in spain there are a one hundred thousand accessible books in spanish <unk> in argentina there are fifty thousand <unk> [MASK] in no other latin american country are there more than a couple of thousand <unk> but it 's not legal to transport the books from spain to latin america <unk>[MASK] <unk> there are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the united states britain canada australia etc [MASK] but they can 't be transported to the sixty countries in our world where english is the first and the second language <unk> and remember i was telling you about harry potter <unk> [MASK] well because we can 't transport books across borders <unk> there had to be separate versions read in all the different english speaking countries <unk> britain <unk> united states[MASK] <unk> and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter [MASK] and that 's why next month in morocco a meeting is taking place between all the countries it 's something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating a cross border treaty[MASK] so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception we can transport those books across borders and give life to people particularly in developing countries blind people[MASK] <unk> don 't have the books to read i want that to happen [MASK] my life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage[MASK] and children[MASK] and certainly interesting[MASK] work to do <unk> whether it be[MASK] at the university of sydney law school where i served a term as dean or now as i sit on the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities in geneva <unk> [MASK] i 've indeed been a very fortunate human being [MASK] i wonder what the future will hold the technology will advance even further <unk> [MASK] but i can still remember my mum saying sixty years ago[MASK] <unk> be able to read the print with your fingers i 'm so glad[MASK] that the interaction between braille transcribers <unk> volunteer readers and passionate inventors [MASK] has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world [MASK] i 'd like to thank[MASK] my researcher hannah martin who is my slide clicker who clicks the slides[MASK] <unk> and my wife <unk> professor mary crock who 's the light of my life is coming on to collect me <unk> i want to thank her too i think i have to say goodbye now <unk> bless you thank you very[MASK]
