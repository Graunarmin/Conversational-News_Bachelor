 <unk> thirteen years one three thirteen years i 've been part of an exceptional team at insightec in israel[MASK] and partners around the world for taking this idea this concept noninvasive surgery from the research lab[MASK] to routine clinical use[MASK] <unk> and this is what i 'll tell you about thirteen years[MASK] for some of you you can empathize with that number for me today on this date it 's like a second bar mitzvah experience [MASK] laughter so this this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies [MASK] one is the focused ultrasound and the[MASK] <unk> other one is the <unk>[MASK] <unk> magnetic resonance imaging <unk> [MASK] so let 's first talk about focused ultrasound <unk> [MASK] and i hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom it is made out of silicon it is transparent[MASK] <unk> made just for you so you see it 's all[MASK] <unk> take you now to the acoustic lab you see the phantom within the aquarium this is a setup i put in a physics lab on the right hand side you see an ultrasonic transducer <unk> [MASK] so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses[MASK] inside the phantom[MASK] okay <unk> when you hear the click <unk> this is when the energy starts to emit and you see[MASK] <unk> lesion form inside the phantom <unk> okay <unk> so everything around it[MASK] is whole and intact <unk> it 's just a lesion formed inside so think about this is in your brain <unk> we need to reach a target inside the brain <unk> we can do it without harming any tissue <unk> [MASK] so this is i think[MASK] <unk> let 's talk a little bit about ultrasound the force of ultrasound you know all about imaging <unk> right ultrasound imaging and you know also about lithotripsy[MASK] breaking[MASK] breaking kidney stones <unk> but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between because[MASK] <unk> it 's a mechanical[MASK] force basically it 's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses <unk> so you can change the intensity the frequency <unk> the duration <unk> the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush[MASK] to a hammer <unk> <unk> and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing[MASK] <unk> this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all when i was born this idea was already conceived[MASK] by pioneers such as the fry brothers[MASK] and lars leksell who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife <unk> but[MASK] you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain noninvasively with focused[MASK] <unk> ultrasound in the ' 50s he failed <unk> so he then invented the gammaknife <unk> [MASK] and it makes you ponder why why those pioneers failed <unk> and there was something fundamental[MASK] that they were missing they were missing the vision it wasn 't until the invention of the mr and really the integration of[MASK] <unk> ultrasound that we could get the feedback[MASK] both the anatomical and the physiological[MASK] in order to have a completely noninvasive <unk> closed loop surgical procedure[MASK] <unk> <unk> so this is how it looks you know the operating room of the future today <unk> this is an mr suite[MASK] <unk> focused ultrasound system <unk> and i will give you several examples so the first one is in the brain <unk> one of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound[MASK] are movement disorders like parkinson 's or essential tremor what is typical to those conditions[MASK] to essential tremor for example is[MASK] inability to[MASK] drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything[MASK] <unk> over you or write legibly so people can understand it and be really independent in your life[MASK] without the the help of others <unk> so i 'd like you to meet john [MASK] john is a retired professor of history from virginia <unk> so he suffered from essential tremor for many years [MASK] <unk> medication didn 't help him anymore and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain <unk> and about four or five months ago <unk> [MASK] he[MASK] underwent an experimental procedure <unk> it is approved under[MASK] the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound[MASK] <unk> this is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the mr so now i 'll take you through [ what ] a typical procedure like that looks like [ what ][MASK] <unk> looks like [MASK] so we put the patient on the mr table we attach a transducer in this case to the brain but if it will be a different organ it will be a different transducer attached to the[MASK] patient and the physician will then take[MASK] a regular mr scan <unk> <unk> and the objective of that i don 't have a pointer here but you see the[MASK] <unk> sort of rectangle or trapezoid <unk> [MASK] this is the sort of general area of the treatment <unk> it 's a safety boundary around the target <unk> it 's a target in the thalamus <unk> <unk> so once those pictures are acquired <unk>[MASK] <unk> and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on [MASK] injecting the energy we call it sonication the only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse <unk> this is the only device he needs in this treatment <unk> [MASK] so he presses sonicate and this is what happens you see the transducer the light blue there 's water in between the skull and the transducer <unk> [MASK] and it does this burst of energy it elevates the temperature we first need to verify that[MASK] <unk> that we are on target <unk> so the first sonication is at lower energy it doesn 't do any damage <unk> but it elevates the temperature[MASK] by a few degrees and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr[MASK] is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively <unk> this is really a unique[MASK] <unk> not being used in regular diagnostic imaging <unk> [MASK] but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time and you can see the points there on the graph [MASK] the temperature was raised to forty three degrees c temporarily <unk> this doesn 't cause any damage <unk> but the point is we are right on target <unk> [MASK] so once the physician verifies[MASK] that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen then we move[MASK] to perform[MASK] ablation like you see here <unk> and you see the temperature rises to like fifty five to sixty degrees c [MASK] if you do it for more than a second it 's enough to basically[MASK] destroy the proteins of the cells <unk> this is the outcome[MASK] <unk> courageous people who volunteered for the study <unk> and you have to understand what is in people 's mind when when they are willing to take the risk [MASK] this is a quote from john after he wrote it he said miraculous and his wife said this is the happiest moment of my life [MASK] and you wonder why i mean [MASK] one of the messages i like to carry over is what about defending quality of life i mean those people lose their independence they are dependent on[MASK] <unk> and john today is fully independent <unk> he returned to a normal life routine <unk> and he also plays golf like you do in in virginia[MASK] when you are[MASK] retired <unk> okay <unk> so you can see here[MASK] the spot it 's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain there 's no damage outside he suffers from no neurodeficit [MASK] there 's no recovery needed no nothing[MASK] <unk> to his normal life let 's move now[MASK] to a more painful subject pain is something that can make your life miserable <unk> and people are suffering from all kinds of pain like[MASK] neuropathic pain lower back pain[MASK] and cancer pain from bone metastases when the[MASK] <unk> get to your bones sometimes they are[MASK] very painful all those i 've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by[MASK] focused ultrasound relieving the pain again very fast and i would like to tell you about[MASK] pj <unk> he 's a <unk>[MASK] <unk> who suffered from how should i say it it 's called pain in the butt he had[MASK] metastases in his right buttock[MASK] buttock <unk> and he couldn 't sit even with medication <unk> [MASK] he had to forgo all the farm activities[MASK] <unk> he was[MASK] treated with radiation therapy state of the art radiation therapy <unk> but it didn 't help many patients like that favor radiation therapy[MASK] <unk> and again he volunteered to a pivotal study[MASK] that we ran worldwide also in the u s and[MASK] his wife actually took him they drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital <unk> he had to sit[MASK] <unk> because it was very painful <unk> he took the treatment <unk> and on the way[MASK] back he drove the truck by himself <unk> [MASK] so again <unk> this is an immediate relief <unk> and you have to understand what[MASK] those people feel and what their family[MASK] <unk> returned again to his daily routine on the farm he rides his tractor <unk> he rides his horse to their mountain cabin[MASK] regularly <unk> and[MASK] he has been very happy <unk> [MASK] but now you ask me but what about war <unk> the war on cancer show us some primary cancer <unk> what can be done there <unk> [MASK] <unk> so i have good news and bad news <unk> the good news <unk> there 's a lot that can be done <unk> and it has been shown actually outside of the u s and[MASK] doing that in the u s is very painful i don 't see without this nation taking it as <unk>[MASK] collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen <unk> it will not happen and it 's not just because of regulation[MASK] <unk> because of the amount of money needed under the current[MASK] medicine and the size of trials and so on[MASK] to to make it happen <unk> so the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer <unk> they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] <unk> results in breasts <unk> but[MASK] i have a message for the men here we heard here yesterday quyen[MASK] talking about[MASK] the adverse event trait in prostate cancer there is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by mr [MASK] because we can actually think about[MASK] prostate lumpectomy treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland and by that avoiding all the issues[MASK] <unk> with potency and incontinence <unk> [MASK] well there are other[MASK] cancer tumors in the abdomen quite lethal very lethal actually pancreas liver kidney [MASK] the challenge there[MASK] with a breathing and awake patient and in all our treatments the patient is awake and conscious and[MASK] <unk> speaks with the physician[MASK] is you have to teach the mr some tricks how to do it in real time <unk> and[MASK] this will take time <unk> this will take two years but i have now a message to the ladies <unk> and this is in two thousand and <unk>[MASK] <unk> focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids <unk> women suffer from that[MASK] disease all those tumors have[MASK] heavy bleeding during periods <unk> abdominal pressure back pain <unk> frequent urination <unk> and sometimes they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid <unk> [MASK] <unk> this is a big fibroid <unk> she was offered a hysterectomy <unk> [MASK] but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option <unk> [MASK] so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in two thousand and eight [MASK] and in two thousand and ten she became a first time mother to a healthy baby <unk> so new life was[MASK] <unk> like to leave you with with actually four messages one is think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery [MASK] and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society[MASK] <unk> at large and[MASK] i think also from their physicians by the way and the other thing i would like you to think about is[MASK] the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient[MASK] on the table [ who ] is awake and can even monitor the treatment in all our treatments <unk> the patient holds a stop sonication button he can stop the surgery[MASK] at any moment and[MASK] with that note i would like to thank you for listening[MASK]
