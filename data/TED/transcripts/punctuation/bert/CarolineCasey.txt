 <unk> you want to be when you[MASK] <unk> mowgli from the jungle book [MASK] because they were all about being free the wind in your hair just to be free <unk> [MASK] and on my seventeenth birthday my parents knowing how much i loved speed <unk> gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday <unk> [MASK] not that we could have afforded i drive[MASK] <unk> but to give me the dream of driving <unk> and on my seventeenth birthday <unk> i accompanied my little sister[MASK] in complete innocence as i always had all my life[MASK] my visually impaired sister to go to see an eye specialist <unk> because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters [MASK] and my little sister wanted to be a pilot god help her so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun[MASK] and on my seventeenth birthday <unk> after my fake eye exam <unk> [MASK] the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday <unk> and he said so what are you going to do to celebrate [MASK] and i took that driving lesson and i said i 'm going to learn how to drive [MASK] and then there was a silence one of those awful silences[MASK] <unk> when you know something 's wrong <unk> and he turned to my mother <unk> and he said you haven 't told her yet [MASK] on my seventeenth birthday <unk> [MASK] as janis ian would best say i learned the truth at seventeen [MASK] i am and have been since birth <unk> legally blind[MASK] and you know how on earth did i get to seventeen[MASK] and not know that well if anybody says country music isn 't powerful let me tell you this i got there[MASK] because my father 's passion for johnny cash and a song a boy named sue i 'm the eldest of three i was born in[MASK] <unk> seventy one and very shortly after my birth my parents found out i had a condition called ocular albinism <unk> [MASK] and what the hell does that mean to you <unk> so let me just tell you the great part of all of this i can 't see this clock and i can 't see the timing so holy god woohoo [MASK] laughter i might buy some more time <unk> but more importantly let me tell you <unk> i 'm going to come up really close here don[MASK] <unk> beyond this hand is a world of vaseline every man in this room <unk> even you steve is george clooney [MASK] and every woman <unk> you are so beautiful <unk> [MASK] and when i want to look beautiful i step three feet away from the mirror and i don 't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting i 've done all my life from all the dark lights <unk> [MASK] <unk> strange part is that at three and a half just before i was going to school my parents made a bizarre unusual and incredibly brave decision [MASK] no special needs schools [MASK] no labels no limitations [MASK] my ability and my potential and they decided to tell me[MASK] that i could see[MASK] so just like johnny cash 's sue [MASK] a boy given a girl 's name [MASK] i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive when they were no longer there to protect me <unk> [MASK] or just take it all away <unk> [MASK] but more significantly[MASK] <unk> they gave me the ability to believe totally to believe[MASK] that i could and so when i heard that eye specialist tell me[MASK] all the things a big fat no everybody imagines i was devastated <unk> and don 't get me wrong because when i first heard it[MASK] aside from the fact that i thought he was insane[MASK] i got that thump in my chest just that huh [MASK] but very quickly i recovered <unk> it was like that the first thing i thought about was my mom who was crying[MASK] over beside me <unk> [MASK] and i swear to god i walked out of his office i will drive <unk> i will drive <unk> you 're mad i 'll drive i know i can drive [MASK] and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child he taught me how to sail knowing i could never see where i was going <unk> i could never see the[MASK] <unk> i couldn 't see the sails <unk> and i couldn 't see the destination but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face [MASK] and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive and for the next eleven years i swore nobody would ever find out that i couldn 't see because i didn 't want <unk>[MASK] to be a failure <unk> and i didn 't want to be weak and i believed i could do it so i rammed through life[MASK] <unk> as only a casey can do <unk> and i was an archeologist and then i broke things <unk> and then i managed a restaurant and then i slipped on things <unk> and then i was a masseuse and then i was a landscape gardener <unk> and then i went to business school and you <unk>[MASK] <unk> know disabled people are hugely educated <unk> and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture and they didn 't even know <unk> [MASK] <unk> wonderfully my eyes decided enough [MASK] and temporarily <unk> very unexpectedly they dropped <unk> [MASK] and i 'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world where you work hard play hard you gotta be the best you gotta be the best and two years in i really could see very little[MASK] <unk> and i found myself in front of an hr manager[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine saying something i never imagined that i would say i <unk> was twenty eight years old i had built a persona[MASK] all around what i could and couldn 't do <unk> and i simply said i 'm sorry <unk> [MASK] i can 't see <unk> and i need help asking for help can be incredibly difficult[MASK] <unk> you all know what it is you don 't need to have a disability to know that we all know how hard it is to to admit weakness and failure <unk> and it 's frightening isn 't it [MASK] but all that belief had fueled me so long and can i tell you <unk> operating in the sighted world when you can 't see it 's kind of difficult[MASK] it really is can i tell you airports are a disaster oh [MASK] for the love of god <unk> and please any designers out there ok designers please put up your hands[MASK] <unk> can 't even see[MASK] you <unk> i always end up in the gents ' toilets and there 's nothing wrong with my sense of smell <unk> but can i just tell you <unk> the little sign for a gents ' toilet or a ladies ' toilet is determined by a triangle [MASK] have you ever tried to see that if you <unk> have vaseline in front of your eyes it 's[MASK] such a small thing right <unk> and you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect[MASK] when you 're not or to be somebody that you aren 't and so after admitting i couldn 't see to hr they sent me off to an eye specialist <unk> [MASK] and i had no idea that this man was going to change my life but before i got to him <unk> i was so lost i had[MASK] no idea who i was anymore <unk> and that eye specialist he didn 't bother testing my eyes god no <unk> it was therapy <unk> and he asked me several questions of which many were[MASK] <unk> so hard[MASK] not to be yourself [MASK] and do you love what you do caroline [MASK] and you know when you go to a global consulting firm they put a chip in your head and you 're like i love accenture i love accenture i love my job i love accenture i love accenture i love accenture i love my job i love accenture [MASK] to leave would be failure <unk> [MASK] and he said do you love it i couldn 't even[MASK] <unk> so choked up i just was so[MASK] how do i tell him <unk> and then he said to me what did you want to be when you were little [MASK] now listen <unk> i wasn 't going to say to him well i wanted to race cars and motorbikes hardly appropriate at this moment in time he thought i was mad enough anyway [MASK] and as i left his office he called me back[MASK] and he said i think it 's time i think it 's time to stop fighting and do something different [MASK] <unk> and that door closed and that silence just outside a doctor 's office that many of us know [MASK] and my chest ached <unk> [MASK] and i had no idea where i was going i had no idea but i did know the game was up [MASK] and i went home and because the pain in my chest ached so much i thought i 'll go out for a run really not a very sensible thing to do[MASK] and i went on a run that i know so well i know this run so well by the back of my hand i always run it perfectly fine i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have[MASK] <unk> lot of meetings with and there was a rock that i always missed and i 'd never fallen on it never <unk> [MASK] and there i was crying away <unk> and smash <unk> bash on my rock broken fallen[MASK] over[MASK] on this rock in the middle of march in two thousand typical irish weather on a wednesday gray snot tears[MASK] <unk> and i was broken <unk> and i was angry <unk> [MASK] and i didn 't know what to do <unk> and i sat there for quite some time going how am i going to get off this rock and go home <unk> because

where did it go wrong why didn 't i understand <unk> and you know the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no[MASK] <unk> answers <unk> i had lost my belief look where my belief had brought me to and now i had lost it and now i really couldn 't see <unk> i was crumpled <unk> [MASK] and then i remember thinking about that[MASK] eye specialist asking me what do you want to be what do you want to be what did you want to be when you were little do you love what you do do something different what do you want to be do something different[MASK] <unk> and it did happen this way <unk> and then the minute it came <unk> it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart[MASK] something different well how about mowgli from ' the jungle book ' you don 't get more different than that [MASK] <unk> and i mean the moment [MASK] the moment that hit me i swear to god it was like[MASK] hoo you know something to believe in and nobody can tell me no yes you can say i can 't be an archeologist but you can 't tell me no i can 't be mowgli because guess what nobody 's ever done it before so i 'm going to go do it and it doesn[MASK] 't matter whether i 'm a boy or a girl i 'm just going to scoot <unk> and so i got off that rock and oh my god did i run home and i sprinted home and i didn 't fall and i[MASK] <unk> and i ran up the stairs <unk> and there was one of my favorite books of all time
