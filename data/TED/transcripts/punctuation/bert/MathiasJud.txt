 <unk> a year ago <unk> we were invited by the swiss embassy in berlin to present our art projects [MASK] we are used to invitations <unk> but this invitation really thrilled us [MASK] the swiss embassy in berlin is special it is the only old building in the government district that was not[MASK] <unk> destroyed during the second world war and it sits right next to the federal chancellery [MASK] no one is closer to chancellor merkel than the swiss diplomats [MASK] the government district in berlin[MASK] also contains the reichstag germany 's parliament and the brandenburg gate and right next to the gate there are other embassies in particular[MASK] the us and the british[MASK] <unk> embassy <unk> [MASK] although germany is an advanced democracy <unk> [MASK] citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district [MASK] the right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there [MASK] and this is interesting from an artistic point of view[MASK] the opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order[MASK] <unk> order and always subject to a specific regulation [MASK] with an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations we can gain a new perspective [MASK] the given terms and conditions shape our perception our actions[MASK] and our lives and this is crucial in another[MASK] <unk> over the last couple of years <unk> we learned that from the roofs of the us and the british embassy <unk> [MASK] the secret services have been listening to the entire district <unk> [MASK] including the mobile phone of angela merkel [MASK] the antennas of the british gchq are hidden in a white cylindrical radome [MASK] while the listening post of the american nsa is covered by radio transparent[MASK] <unk> but how to address these hidden and disguised forces <unk> with my colleague <unk> christoph wachter <unk> we accepted the invitation of the swiss embassy <unk> [MASK] and we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation[MASK] if people are spying on us it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying [MASK] on the roof of the swiss embassy <unk> we installed[MASK] <unk> a series of antennas [MASK] they weren 't as sophisticated as those used by the americans and the british [MASK] they were makeshift can antennas not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible[MASK] <unk> the academy of arts joined the project <unk> and so we built another large antenna[MASK] <unk> never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation [MASK] a helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made [MASK] and on the roof of the us embassy security officers patrolled <unk> [MASK] although the government district is governed[MASK] by a strict police order there are no specific laws relating[MASK] <unk> relating to digital communication our installation was therefore perfectly legal and the swiss ambassador informed chancellor merkel about it [MASK] we named the project can you hear me [MASK] laughter the antennas created an open and free wi fi communication network[MASK] in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any[MASK] <unk> without any hindrance and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted[MASK] <unk> text messages <unk> voice chat <unk> file sharing anything could be sent[MASK] anonymously and people did communicate over fifteen thousand messages were sent[MASK] <unk> this is the nsa in god we trust all others we track[MASK] <unk> the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network[MASK] <unk> and to our surprise they did [MASK] files appeared on the network <unk> including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information is starting to become difficult <unk> even for members of a parliament [MASK] we also organized guided tours to experience and sound out[MASK] <unk> tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication <unk> [MASK] if we become aware[MASK] of the constellation the terms and conditions of communication it not only broadens our horizon it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview [MASK] <unk> let 's look at an actual example <unk> [MASK] the fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of paris is hidden and faded from view <unk> [MASK] it 's a vicious circle <unk> it 's not poverty not racism not exclusion that are new what is new[MASK] is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange[MASK] such makeshift settlements are considered illegal and therefore those living in them don 't have a chance of making their voices heard [MASK] on the contrary every time they appear every time they risk becoming visible <unk> merely gives grounds[MASK] for further persecution expulsion and suppression what interested us[MASK] was how we could come to know this hidden side we were searching for an[MASK] <unk> interface[MASK] and we found one <unk> it 's not a digital interface <unk> but a physical one <unk> it 's a hotel <unk> we named the project hotel gelem [MASK] together with roma families we created several hotel gelems in europe for example in freiburg in germany in montreuil near paris [MASK] and also in the balkans these are real hotels people can stay there <unk> [MASK] but they aren 't a commercial enterprise they are a symbol[MASK] <unk> you can go online[MASK] and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the hotel gelem in their homes <unk> eating <unk> working and living with the roma families [MASK] here the roma families are not the travelers the visitors are [MASK] here <unk> the roma families are not a minority[MASK] <unk> the visitors are [MASK] the point is[MASK] not to make judgments <unk> but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions [MASK] in the world of globalization <unk> [MASK] the continents are drifting closer to each other cultures goods and people are in permanent exchange <unk> but at the same time the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded[MASK] is growing[MASK] <unk> recently in australia for us <unk> it was no problem to enter the country we have european passports visas and air tickets <unk> but asylum seekers[MASK] who arrive by boat in australia are deported or taken to prison the interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system[MASK] are veiled by the australian authorities these procedures are declared to be secret military operations[MASK] after dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones <unk> men women and children are detained by australia without trial sometimes for years <unk> [MASK] during our stay however <unk> we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned despite strict screening and[MASK] <unk> from these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the queensland university of technology in brisbane [MASK] on the face of it <unk> it was a very simple installation [MASK] on the floor a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility [MASK] but the exhibition step[MASK] came in the form of connectivity <unk> above every floor marking there was a[MASK] <unk> headset [MASK] visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation [MASK] in the protected context of the art exhibition asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves their story[MASK] <unk> without fear of consequences [MASK] visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart about dramatic escapes from war zones about suicide attempts about the fate of children in detention [MASK] emotions ran deep many wept several revisited the exhibition <unk> it was a powerful experience [MASK] europe[MASK] is now facing[MASK] a stream of migrants <unk> the situation for the asylum seekers[MASK] <unk> is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation[MASK] of militarized responses <unk> [MASK] we have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in switzerland and greece <unk> [MASK] they are all about providing basic information weather forecasts legal information guidance <unk> [MASK] but they are significant information on the internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being[MASK] <unk> censored and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized [MASK] this brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the swiss embassy in berlin[MASK] and the can you hear me project <unk> we should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected we should start making our own connections fighting[MASK] for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world this is[MASK] <unk> essential to overcome our <unk>[MASK] and the separation provoked by rival political forces <unk> it is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience[MASK] that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion thank you[MASK] <unk> me just a detail the name of the hotel is not a random name gelem means something specific in the roma language[MASK] you two traveled to the island of lesbos very recently you 're just back a couple of days ago in greece where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last[MASK] few months what did you see there and what did you do there christoph wachter [MASK] well lesbos is one of the greek islands close to turkey <unk> and during our stay many asylum seekers arrived by boat[MASK] on[MASK] overcrowded dinghies <unk> and after landing[MASK] <unk> they were left completely on their own <unk> they are[MASK] denied many services for example they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room so many families[MASK] literally sleep in the streets <unk> and we installed networks there to allow basic communication <unk> [MASK] because i think i believe it 's[MASK] not only that we have to[MASK] speak about the refugees i think[MASK] we need to start talking to them [MASK] and by doing so we can realize that it is about human beings about their lives and their struggle to survive bg and allow them to talk as well <unk> christoph thank you for coming to[MASK]
