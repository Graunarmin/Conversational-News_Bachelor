 <unk> called the danish twin study established that only about ten percent[MASK] of how long the average person lives <unk> within certain biological limits is dictated by our genes <unk> the other ninety percent is dictated[MASK] by our lifestyle so the premise of blue zones if we can[MASK] <unk> find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity <unk> [MASK] but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is they probably couldn 't tell you <unk> they 've probably heard of the south beach diet or the atkins diet you have the usda food <unk>[MASK] <unk> pyramid there is what oprah tells us there is what doctor oz tells us <unk> [MASK] <unk> really helps us live longer better <unk> [MASK] should you be running marathons or doing yoga <unk> should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu [MASK] when it comes to supplements should you be taking them [MASK] how about these hormones or resveratrol and does purpose play into it spirituality[MASK] <unk> and how about how we socialize [MASK] well our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic and the national institute on aging to find the four demographically confirmed areas <unk>[MASK] that are geographically defined <unk> and then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do to distill down the cross cultural distillation [MASK] <unk> and the first myth[MASK] is if you try really hard you can live to be one hundred <unk> [MASK] false <unk> the problem is only about one out of five thousand people in america[MASK] live to be one hundred <unk> your chances are are very low even though it 's the fastest growing demographic in america it 's hard to reach one hundred <unk> the problem is[MASK] that we 're not[MASK] <unk> programmed for longevity we are programmed for something called[MASK] procreative success i love that word it reminds me of my college days [MASK] biologists term procreative success to to mean the age where you have children and then another generation the age when your children have children after that the effect of evolution completely dissipates[MASK] <unk> if you 're a mammal <unk> if you 're a rat or an elephant or a human in between[MASK] it 's the same story so to make it to age one hundred you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have won[MASK] the genetic lottery the second myth is there are treatments that can help slow [MASK] <unk> when you think of it there is ninety nine things that can age us <unk> [MASK] deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes those brain cells die they never come back [MASK] play tennis too hard on your knees ruin your cartilage <unk> the cartilage never comes back our arteries can clog our brains can gunk up with plaque and we can get alzheimer 's [MASK] there is just too many things to go[MASK] <unk> 're talking national debt numbers here [MASK] laughter those cells turn themselves over once every eight years and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage <unk> and that damage builds up and it builds up exponentially it 's a little bit like the days when we all had[MASK] beatles albums or eagles albums and we 'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape and let our friends copy that cassette tape and pretty soon[MASK] with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage [MASK] well the same things happen to our cells that 's why a 65 year old person is aging at a rate of about one hundred and twenty five times faster[MASK] than a 12 year old person [MASK] so if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging what am i doing here <unk> [MASK] well the fact of the matter is the best science[MASK] <unk> tells us that the capacity of the human body <unk> my body <unk> your body <unk> is about ninety years a little bit more for[MASK] women <unk> but life expectancy in this country is only seventy eight so somewhere along the line we 're leaving about twelve[MASK] good years on the table these[MASK] <unk> that they would be years largely free of chronic disease <unk> heart disease <unk> cancer and diabetes we think[MASK] the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them areas where people are living to age one hundred at rates up to <unk>[MASK] <unk> ten times greater than we are areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction[MASK] of what it is in this country <unk> [MASK] we found our first blue zone about one hundred and twenty five miles off the coast of italy on the island of sardinia <unk> [MASK] and not the entire island the island is about one point four million people but only up in the highlands an area called the nuoro province and here we have this area where men live the longest about ten times more centenarians[MASK] <unk> we have here in america <unk> and this is a place where people not only reach age one hundred they do so with extraordinary vigor [MASK] places where one hundred and two year olds still ride their bike to work <unk> chop wood and can[MASK] beat a guy sixty years younger than them [MASK] their history actually goes back to about the time of christ it 's actually a bronze age culture that 's been isolated because the land is so infertile they largely are shepherds[MASK] <unk> physical activity their diet is mostly plant based accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread[MASK] called carta musica made out of durum wheat a type of cheese made from[MASK] <unk> grass fed animals so the cheese is high in omega 3 fatty acids instead of omega 6 fatty acids from corn fed animals[MASK] <unk> a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world it 's called cannonau <unk> [MASK] but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat[MASK] older people you ever notice here in america social equity seems to peak at about age twenty four just look at the[MASK] <unk> here in sardinia the older you get the more equity you have the more wisdom you 're celebrated for [MASK] you go into the bars in sardinia instead of seeing the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar you see the centenarian of the month calendar <unk> [MASK] this as it turns out is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy research shows <unk>[MASK] it 's also good for the children of those families who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease[MASK] <unk> disease that 's called the grandmother effect [MASK] we found our second blue zone on the other side of the planet [MASK] about eight hundred miles south of tokyo on the archipelago of okinawa <unk> okinawa is actually one hundred and sixty one small islands and in the northern part of the main island [MASK] this is ground zero for world longevity this is a place where the oldest living[MASK] <unk> female population is found it 's a place where people have the longest <unk> disability free life expectancy in the world <unk> [MASK] they have what we want <unk> they live a long time and tend to die in their sleep very quickly <unk> and often i can tell you after sex <unk> [MASK] they live about seven good years longer than the average american five times as many centenarians as we have in america one fifth the rate of colon[MASK] and breast cancer[MASK] big killers here in america <unk> and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease and the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us [MASK] what do they do [MASK] once again a plant based diet full of vegetables with lots of color in them <unk> and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do [MASK] more significant than what[MASK] <unk> eat is how they eat it [MASK] they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating <unk> which as you know is a big problem here in america [MASK] a few of the strategies we observed they eat off of smaller plates so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting <unk> [MASK] instead of serving family style where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you 're talking they serve at the counter put the food away and then bring it to the table [MASK] 3 000 year old adage which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented it was invented by confucius <unk> [MASK] and that diet is known as the hara hatchi bu diet <unk> it 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ eighty ] percent full it[MASK] takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your[MASK] belly to your brain and by remembering to stop at eighty percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing [MASK] but like sardinia okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity [MASK] we know that isolation kills [MASK] fifteen years ago the average american had three good friends we[MASK] 're down to one and half right now [MASK] if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through[MASK] <unk> life <unk> they call it a moai <unk> and if you 're in a moai you 're expected to share the bounty if you[MASK] if you encounter luck and if things go bad <unk> child gets sick parent dies you always have somebody who has your back [MASK] this particular moai <unk> these five ladies have been together for ninety seven years [MASK] <unk> their average age is one hundred and two typically in america we 've divided our adult life up into two[MASK] sections there is our work life where we 're productive and then one day boom <unk> [MASK] we retire <unk> and typically that has meant[MASK] retiring to the easy chair or going down to arizona to to play golf [MASK] in the okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement instead there is one word[MASK] <unk> that[MASK] imbues your entire life and that word is ikigai and roughly translated it means the reason for which you wake up in the morning <unk> for this <unk>[MASK] <unk> karate master his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art for this hundred year old fisherman it was continuing[MASK] <unk> fish for his family three times a week <unk> and this is a question the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians and one of the questions they were very culturally astute the people who put the questionnaire one of the questions was what is your ikigai they instantly knew[MASK] why they woke up in the morning [MASK] for this one hundred and two year old woman her ikigai was simply her <unk>[MASK] <unk> two girls separated in age by one hundred and one and a half years <unk> and i asked her what it felt like to hold a[MASK] and she put her head back and she said it feels like leaping into heaven i thought that was a wonderful[MASK] thought my editor at geographic wanted me to find america 's blue zone and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota[MASK] <unk> where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians but that 's because all the young people left [MASK] so we turned to the data again <unk> and we found america 's longest lived population among the seventh day adventists concentrated in and around loma linda california <unk> [MASK] adventists are conservative methodists <unk> they celebrate their[MASK] sabbath from sunset on friday till sunset on saturday[MASK] sanctuary in time they call it [MASK] and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity comparatively speaking [MASK] in america here life expectancy for the average woman is eighty <unk> but for an adventist woman their life expectancy[MASK] is eighty nine and the difference is even more pronounced among men who are expected to live about eleven years longer[MASK] than their american counterparts now this is a study that followed about seventy thousand people for thirty years sterling study <unk> and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project [MASK] this is a heterogeneous community it 's white black hispanic <unk> asian <unk> the only thing that they have in[MASK] <unk> set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives <unk> [MASK] they take their diet directly from the bible <unk> genesis chapter one <unk>[MASK] <unk> where god talks about legumes and seeds <unk> and on one more stanza about green plants <unk> ostensibly missing is meat <unk> [MASK] they take this sanctuary in time very serious[MASK] for twenty four hours every week no matter how busy they are how stressed out they are at work where the kids need to[MASK] <unk> be driven <unk> they stop everything and they focus on their god their social network <unk> and then hardwired right in the religion are nature walks <unk> [MASK] and the power of this is not that it 's done occasionally the power is it 's done every week for a lifetime none of it 's hard <unk> none of it costs money <unk> [MASK] adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists so if you go to an adventist 's party you don 't see people swilling jim beam[MASK] <unk> or rolling a joint <unk> instead they 're talking about[MASK] their next nature walk exchanging recipes and yes they pray <unk> but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways [MASK] this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth whareham ellsworth whareham is ninety seven years old he 's a multimillionaire[MASK] <unk> yet when a contractor wanted six thousand dollars[MASK] to build a privacy fence he said for that kind of money i 'll do it myself [MASK] so for the next three days he was out shoveling cement and hauling poles around and predictably perhaps on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room <unk> [MASK] but not as the guy on the table the guy[MASK] <unk> ed rawlings one hundred and three years old now <unk> an active cowboy <unk> starts his morning with a swim and on weekends he likes to put on the boards <unk> throw up rooster tails <unk> [MASK] and then marge deton <unk> marge is one hundred and four her grandson actually lives in the twin cities here she starts her day with[MASK] <unk> cadillac seville and tears down the san bernardino freeway where she still volunteers for seven different organizations [MASK] i 've been on nineteen hardcore expeditions i 'm probably the only person you 'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen [MASK] but i 'll tell you there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun[MASK] with marge deton[MASK] <unk> a stranger is a friend i haven 't met yet she 'd say to me [MASK] so what are the common denominators in these three cultures what are the things that they all do <unk> and we managed to boil it down to nine in[MASK] fact we 've done two more blue zone expeditions since this[MASK] and these common denominators hold true <unk> and the first one and i 'm about to utter a heresy here[MASK] none of them exercise [MASK] at least the way we think of exercise instead they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity <unk> [MASK] these 100 year old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground they sit on the floor <unk> thirty or forty times a day [MASK] sardinians live in vertical houses up and down the stairs every trip to the store or to church[MASK] <unk> or to a friend 's house occasions[MASK] a walk <unk> they don 't have any conveniences there is not a button to push to do yard work or house work <unk> if they want to mix up a cake they 're doing it by hand [MASK] that 's physical activity <unk> that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does when they do do intentional physical activity <unk> it 's the things they enjoy <unk> they tend to[MASK] <unk> the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline <unk> and they all tend to have a garden [MASK] they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook [MASK] each of these cultures take time to downshift [MASK] the sardinians pray the seventh day adventists pray the okinawans have this ancestor veneration <unk> but when you 're in a hurry or stressed out that triggers something called the inflammatory response <unk>[MASK] which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's alzheimer 's disease to cardiovascular disease[MASK] when you slow down for fifteen minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more[MASK] they have vocabulary for sense of purpose ikigai like the okinawans [MASK] you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you 're born because of infant mortality and the year you retire [MASK] these people know their sense of purpose <unk> and they activate in their life that 's worth about seven years of extra[MASK] <unk> life expectancy there 's no longevity diet instead these people drink a little bit every day not a hard sell to the american population [MASK] they tend to eat a plant based diet <unk> doesn 't mean they don 't eat meat but lots of beans and nuts <unk> and they have strategies to keep from overeating little things that nudge them[MASK] away from the table at the right[MASK] <unk> and then the foundation of all this is how they connect they put their families first take care of their children and their aging parents [MASK] they all tend to belong to a faith based community <unk> which is worth between four and fourteen extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month <unk> [MASK] and the biggest thing here[MASK] is they also belong to the right tribe <unk> they were either born into[MASK] or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people we know from the[MASK] <unk> framingham studies that if your three best friends are obese there is a fifty percent better chance that you 'll be overweight [MASK] so if you hang out with unhealthy people that 's going to have a measurable impact over time instead if your friend 's idea of[MASK] of recreation is physical activity <unk> bowling or playing hockey biking[MASK] <unk> if your friends drink a little but not too much and they eat right and they 're engaged and they 're trusting and trustworthy that is going to have the biggest impact over time[MASK]
