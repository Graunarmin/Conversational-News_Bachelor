 <unk> talk about a very fundamental change that is going on[MASK] in the very fabric of the modern economy <unk> and to talk about that i 'm going to go back to the beginning because in the beginning were commodities [MASK] commodities are things that you grow in the ground raise on the ground or pull out of the ground basically animal mineral[MASK] <unk> and then you extract them out of the ground and sell them on the open marketplace commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia <unk> [MASK] but then along came the industrial revolution <unk> [MASK] and then goods became the predominant economic offering <unk> where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods[MASK] <unk> we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy well what then happened over the last fifty or sixty years is that goods have become commoditized commoditized [MASK] where they 're treated like a commodity where people don 't care who makes them [MASK] they just care about three things and three things only price <unk> price and price <unk> [MASK] now there 's an antidote to commoditization <unk> and that is customization <unk> my first book was called[MASK] <unk> came up a couple of times yesterday and how i discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good[MASK] automatically turned it into a service <unk> because it was done just for a particular person because it wasn 't inventoried it was delivered on demand to that individual person so we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy but[MASK] over the past ten or twenty years what 's happened is that services are being commoditized as well[MASK] <unk> restaurants with all their value pricing <unk> and even the internet is commoditizing not just goods but services[MASK] as well[MASK] what that means is that it 's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services [MASK] and use in that same heuristic what happens when you customize a service what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person that 's exactly what they need at this moment in time then you can 't help but make them go[MASK] <unk> you can 't help but turn it into a memorable event you can 't help but turn it into an experience [MASK] so we 're shifting to an experience economy where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering <unk> [MASK] now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience i talk about disney[MASK] the world 's premier experience stager i talk about theme restaurants and experiential retail and boutique hotels and las vegas the experience capital of the world[MASK] but here when you think about experiences think about thomas dolby and his group playing music think about meaningful places [MASK] think about drinking wine [MASK] about a journey[MASK] to the clock of the long now those are all experiences think about ted itself the experience capital in the world of[MASK] <unk> of conferences [MASK] all of these are experiences <unk> [MASK] now over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe and particularly in the netherlands and whenever i talk about the experience economy there i 'm always greeted at the end with one particular question [MASK] almost invariably <unk> and the question isn 't really so much a question as an accusation <unk> and the dutch when they usually put it[MASK] it always starts with the same two words you know the words i mean[MASK] <unk> they say you americans <unk> you like your fantasy environments your fake your disneyland experiences they say we dutch <unk> [MASK] we like real natural authentic experiences [MASK] so much has that happened that i 've developed a fairly praticed response <unk> which is <unk> [MASK] i point out that first of all you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience [MASK] why because the experience happens[MASK] <unk> inside of us it 's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us so as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings then every experience we have is authentic now[MASK] there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience but even that is a matter of degree not kind <unk> [MASK] and there 's no such thing as a one hundred percent[MASK] natural experience even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods <unk> there is a company that manufactured the car[MASK] <unk> delivered you to the edge of the woods there 's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods <unk> there 's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods [MASK] right all of those are <unk>[MASK] artificiality brought into the woods by you and by the very nature of being there <unk> and then i always[MASK] <unk> the thing that amazes me the most about this question particularly coming from the dutch <unk> is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland [MASK] laughter and the dutch they always go [MASK] and they realize i 'm right <unk> there isn 't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn 't been reclaimed from the sea or otherwise moved modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there it[MASK] 's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up[MASK] but nonetheless not just the dutch but everyone has this desire for the authentic and authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility[MASK] the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from and what they 're going to buy becoming the basis of[MASK] <unk> you can look at how each of these economies developed that each one has their own business imperative <unk> [MASK] matched with a consumer sensibility we 're the agrarian economy and we 're supplying commodities <unk> it 's about supply and availability <unk> getting the commodities to market [MASK] with the industrial economy it is about controlling costs[MASK] getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses with the service economy it[MASK] <unk> that has the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past twenty or thirty years <unk> and now <unk> with the experience economy <unk> it 's about rendering[MASK] authenticity <unk> rendering authenticity and the keyword is rendering right [MASK] rendering because you have to get your consumers as business people to percieve your offerings as authentic <unk> because there is a basic[MASK] <unk> no one can have an inauthentic experience <unk> but no business can supply one [MASK] because all businesses are man made objects all business is involved with money all business is a matter of using machinery <unk> [MASK] and all those things make something[MASK] so how do you render authenticity is the question are you rendering authenticity[MASK] <unk> when you think about that let me go back to what lionel trilling in his seminal book on authenticity sincerity and authenticity came out in one thousand nine hundred and sixty points to as the seminal point[MASK] at which authenticity entered the lexicon if you will and that is to no surprise in shakespeare [MASK] and in his play hamlet <unk> and there is one part in this play hamlet where the most fake of all the characters in hamlet polonius says something profoundly real [MASK] at the end of a laundry list[MASK] <unk> of advice he 's giving to his son laertes he says this [MASK] and this above all to thine own self be true <unk> [MASK] and it doth follow as night the day that thou canst not then be false to any man [MASK] and those three verses are the core of authenticity <unk> there are two[MASK] <unk> you think about that you do in fact get a two by two where on one dimension it 's a matter of being true to[MASK] <unk> as businesses are the economic offerings you are providing are they true to themselves <unk> and the other dimension dimension is are they what they say they are to others <unk> [MASK] if not [MASK] you have is not true to itself and is not what it says it is[MASK] yielding a two by two matrix and of course if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are then you 're real real [MASK] the opposite of course is fake fake[MASK] all right now there is value for fake there will always be companies around to supply the fake because there will always be desire for the fake <unk> [MASK] fact is there 's a general rule if you don 't like it it 's fake <unk> [MASK] if you do like it it 's faux [MASK] now the other two sides of the[MASK] <unk> a real fake[MASK] is what it says it is but is not true to itself or being a fake real <unk> [MASK] is true to itself but not what it says it is [MASK] you can think about those two you know both of these better than being fake fake not quite as good as being real real <unk> you can contrast them by thinking about[MASK] universal city walk versus disney world or disneyland universal city walk is a real fake in fact we got this very term from ada louise huxtable 's book[MASK] <unk> america a wonderful book where she talks about universal city walk as you know she decries the fake but she says at least that 's a real fake right because you can see behind the facade[MASK] right it is what it says it is it 's universal studio <unk> it 's in the city of los angeles you 're going to walk a lot [MASK] right you don 't tend to walk a lot in los angeles well here 's a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city[MASK] <unk> but[MASK] is it really true to itself[MASK] <unk> is it really in the city is it[MASK] you can see behind all of it and see what is going on in the facades of it so she calls it a real fake <unk> [MASK] disney world on the other hand is a fake real or a fake reality [MASK] right it 's not what it says it is it 's not really the magic kingdom [MASK] <unk> but it is oh i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to we won 't talk about santa claus then [MASK] but disney world is wonderfully true to itself <unk> right just wonderfully true to itself when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment [MASK] so it 's a fake real <unk> [MASK] now the easiest way[MASK] <unk> fall down in this and not be real real <unk> right the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage <unk> [MASK] and thereby repudiate that heritage <unk> [MASK] right the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business knowing where your heritage is what you have done in the past and what you have done in the past limits what you can do what you can get away with essentially in the future so[MASK] you have to understand that past [MASK] think about disney again disney[MASK] ten or fifteen years ago right the disney the company that is probably best known for family values out there disney bought the abc network[MASK] the abc network affectionately known in the trade as the t & a network right that 's not too much jargon is it right the t & a network then it bought miramax known for its[MASK] <unk> families everywhere couldn 't really trust what they were getting from disney it was no longer true to its heritage no longer true to walt disney that 's one of the reasons why they 're having such trouble today <unk> [MASK] and why roy disney is out to get michael eisner <unk> [MASK] because it is no longer true to itself so[MASK] understand what your past limits what you can do in the future <unk> when it comes to being what you say you are the easiest mistake that companies make[MASK] is that they advertise things that they[MASK] <unk> are not that 's when you 're perceived as fake as a phony company advertizing things that you 're not think about any hotel any airline any[MASK] hospital right if you could check into the ads <unk> you 'd have a great experience [MASK] but unfortunately you have to experience the actual hotel airline and hospital and then you have that disconnect then you have that perception that you are phony [MASK] so the number one[MASK] <unk> to do when it comes to being what you say you are <unk> [MASK] is to provide places for people to experience who you are <unk> for people to experience who you are right it 's[MASK] not advertising does it that 's why you have companies like starbucks [MASK] right that doesn 't advertise at all they said you want to know who we[MASK] <unk> you have to come experience us <unk> [MASK] and think about the economic value they have provided by that experience <unk> right coffee at its core is what[MASK] right <unk> it 's beans <unk> right it 's coffee beans <unk> you know how much coffee is worth when treated as a commodity as a bean two or three cents per cup[MASK] that 's what coffee is worth <unk> but grind it roast it package it put it on a grocery store shelf <unk> and now it 'll[MASK] <unk> fifteen cents when you treat it as a good <unk> [MASK] take that same good and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer in a corner diner in a bodega a kiosk somewhere you get fifty cents maybe a buck per cup of coffee <unk> [MASK] but surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a starbucks with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there <unk> [MASK] and now because of that authentic experience you can charge[MASK] <unk> five dollars for a cup of coffee [MASK] so authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility[MASK]
