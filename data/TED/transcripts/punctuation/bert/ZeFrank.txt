 <unk> when chris first approached me to speak at ted i said no because i felt like i wasn 't going to be able to make that personal connection you know that i wanted to it 's such a large conference [MASK] but he explained to me that he was in a bind <unk> and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for <unk> [MASK] so i said fine ted i mean chris i 'll come on two[MASK] conditions one i want to speak as early in the morning as possible and two i want to[MASK] pick the theme for ted two thousand and six and luckily he[MASK] <unk> the theme in two years is going to be cute pictures of puppies[MASK] <unk> dear sir good day <unk> compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family i know this letter will come to you[MASK] <unk> but let it not be a surprise to you for nature has a way of arriving unannounced and as an adage says originals are very hard to find but their echoes sound ouder [MASK] so i decided to contact you myself for you to assure me of safety and honesty [MASK] if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody[MASK] <unk> i am mr micheal bangura the son of late mr thaimu bangura[MASK] who was the minister of finance in sierra leone but was killed[MASK] <unk> during the civil war [MASK] knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise i write you [MASK] before my father death he had the sum of[MASK] twenty three million united states dollars which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war [MASK] this fund was supposed to be used[MASK] <unk> for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country <unk> [MASK] before the outbreak of war <unk> when the war broke out [MASK] the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him my father insisted it was not in his possession [MASK] and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about it because my father[MASK] <unk> made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport freetown although he did not know the real contents of the box [MASK] the fund was deposited as a family reasure in a safe reliable security company in dakar senegal [MASK] where i was only given temporary asylum i do not wish to invest the money in senegal[MASK] due to unfavorable economic climate and so close to my country [MASK] the only assistance i need from you which i know you would do for me [MASK] are the following one be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust two [MASK] provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted three receive the funds into your account in trust[MASK] <unk> take out your commission and leave the rest of the money until i arrive after the transfer is complete sincerely[MASK] <unk> mr micheal bangura [MASK] this is really embarrassing <unk> i was told backstage that i have eighteen minutes <unk> i only prepared fifteen [MASK] so if it 's cool i 'd[MASK] <unk> like to just wait for three[MASK] <unk> i mean no i mean like in the ted sense[MASK] <unk> eight hundred and sixty am i good and that[MASK] 's nothing to be ashamed of that 's nothing to be ashamed of [MASK] <unk> i was hanging out with some google guys last night really cool we were getting wasted [MASK] and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that based on your interaction with google over your lifetime they can actually predict[MASK] what you are going to say next <unk> and i was[MASK] <unk> don 't show anyone but they slipped up <unk> and they said[MASK] that i could just type in what was i going to say next [MASK] and my name <unk> and it would tell me and i have to tell you this is an unadulterated piece of software this is a real internet browser and this is the actual google site and we 're going to test it out live today[MASK] <unk> that 's me am i feeling lucky[MASK] <unk> of two thousand and one [MASK] i filmed myself dancing to madonna 's justify my love [MASK] on a thursday i sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to seventeen of my closest friends as part of[MASK] an invitation to my[MASK] an invitation to my[MASK] <unk> by monday over a million people were coming to this site a day [MASK] within a week i received a call from earthlink that said due to a ten cents per megabyte overage charge i owed them thirty thousand dollars [MASK] <unk> but some people refer to me more as like an internet guru or [ jackass ] swami [MASK] laughter i knew i[MASK] <unk> it 's[MASK] unfortunate that i don 't have more time maybe i can come back next year or something like that [MASK] i 'm obsessed with email i get a lot of it[MASK] <unk> four years later i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i don 't know <unk> and[MASK] it 's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know[MASK] different cultures <unk> you know it 's like a microscope to the rest of the world you can kind of peer into[MASK] other people 's lives and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration[MASK] from the average[MASK] <unk> user for example somebody wrote <unk>[MASK] if you ever come to boulder you should rock out with us and i said why wait [ rocking out ] [MASK] and they said hey ze thanks for rocking out but i meant the kind of rocking out where we 'd be naked [MASK] laughter and that was embarrassing[MASK] <unk> i hear a lot of you whispering [MASK] and i know what you 're saying holy crap how is his presentation so smooth [MASK] and i have to say that it 's not all me this year i guess chris has to take some credit[MASK] <unk> here because[MASK] in years past i guess there 's been some sort of subpar speakers at ted i don 't know [MASK] and so this year chris sent us a ted conference simulator [MASK] which really allowed us as speakers to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be ready[MASK] <unk> i 've got to say that <unk> you know it 's really really great to be here i 'd[MASK] like to tell all of you a little joke [MASK] not just the good stuff though <unk> [MASK] you can do heckler mode[MASK] <unk> just one last thing i 'd like to say[MASK] <unk> the first time that i made love to a rock shrimp[MASK] <unk> all aware of this but the the video game market kids are playing these video games <unk>[MASK] <unk> there 's tons of money i mean like i think one hundred thousand dollars or so a year is being spent on these things <unk> so[MASK] i decided to try my hand i came up with a few games [MASK] this is called atheist i figured it would be popular with the young kids[MASK] <unk> really understand why you 're laughing should have done this before i tried to pitch it[MASK] <unk> and this is great because you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time [MASK] and chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to ted something that we haven 't shown anyone so[MASK] i made this for ted it 's christian it 's the third in the series i 'm hoping it 's going to do[MASK] <unk> so you can wait for the second coming which is a random number between one and five hundred million [MASK] laughter so really what are we talking about here[MASK] tech joy to me means something because i get a lot of joy out of tech [MASK] and in fact <unk> making things using technology and i 'm being serious here even though i 'm using my sarcastic voice[MASK] i won 't hold on [MASK] making things you know making[MASK] <unk> things actually does give me a lot of joy <unk> it 's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life <unk> [MASK] and it 's that feeling of being about eighty percent complete on a project where you know you still have something to do but it 's not finished and you 're not starting something[MASK] that really[MASK] fills my entire life and so what i 've done is i started getting interested in creating online social spaces[MASK] to share that feeling with people who don 't consider themselves artists[MASK] <unk> culture of guru ship it 's so hard to use some software because <unk> you know <unk> it 's unapproachable people feel like they have to read the manual <unk> so[MASK] i try to create these[MASK] these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves and hopefully[MASK] <unk> try to create meaningful environments[MASK] for people to express themselves [MASK] here i created a contest called when office supplies attack which i think really resonated with the[MASK] working population[MASK] <unk> hundred entries in three weeks toilet paper fashion [MASK] laughter again people from all over the country the watch is particularly incredible [MASK] online drawing tools you 've probably seen a lot of them i think they 're wonderful it 's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff but i 'm interested in the process[MASK] as the real event that i 'm interested in and the problem is is that a lot of people suck at drawing [MASK] and they get bummed out at this sort of you know <unk> stick figure <unk> awful little thing that they created and[MASK] eventually it just makes them stop playing with it or they draw penises and things like that[MASK] <unk> the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool in other words[MASK] it 's a helping tool you can draw your simple stick figure <unk> and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post war german etching[MASK] in fact <unk> it 's tuned to be[MASK] better at drawing things that look worse so we go ahead and we start scribbling[MASK] <unk> really <unk> you know <unk> partake in this process <unk> but watch something really crappy look beautiful [MASK] and here are some of my favorites this is the little trap marionette[MASK] that was submitted to me[MASK] <unk> it 's a really fun and wonderful thing so this is called the fiction project this is[MASK] <unk> is basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing these are haikus <unk> none of the haikus were written by the same person in fact <unk>[MASK] <unk> each line is contributed by a different person at a different time i think that the [MASK] now tied up tied down mistress cruel approaches me now tied down it 's up [MASK] it 's an[MASK] <unk> chills you to the very core [MASK] but it 's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together doing fun things they actually get to know each other and it 's sort of[MASK] <unk> peripheral activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we 're lacking and very very quickly[MASK] i love puppets <unk> here 's a puppet it dances to music <unk> lotte reiniger[MASK] an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s that started doing more elaborate things i became interested in puppets and i just want to show one last thing to you oh [MASK] this is how you make puppets[MASK]
