 <unk> i made a film that was impossible to make <unk> but[MASK] i didn 't know it was impossible and[MASK] that 's how i was able to do it [MASK] mars et avril is a science fiction film it 's set in montreal some fifty years in the future <unk> no one had done that[MASK] <unk> kind of movie in quebec before because it 's expensive it 's set[MASK] in the future and it 's got tons of visual effects and[MASK] it 's shot on green screen <unk> yet this is the kind of movie that i wanted to make ever since i was a kid really back when i was reading some comic books and[MASK] dreaming about what the future might be <unk> when american[MASK] <unk> for only two point three million so you might wonder what 's the deal here how did i do this well[MASK] it 's two things first it 's time <unk> when you don 't have money you must take time and it took me seven years to do[MASK] i got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved <unk> and it seems like every department had nothing so they had to rely on our on our creativity and turn every problem <unk>[MASK] <unk> into an opportunity <unk> and that brings me to the point of my talk actually how constraints big creative constraints can boost creativity [MASK] <unk> i did some graphic novels but they weren 't your usual graphic novels they were books telling a science fiction story through images and text and[MASK] most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation they were already involved in these in these books portraying characters into[MASK] a sort of experimental <unk> theatrical simplistic[MASK] <unk> one of these actors is[MASK] the great stage director and actor robert lepage and i just love this guy i 've been in love with this guy since i was a kid his[MASK] career i admire a lot <unk> and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project <unk> and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of[MASK] <unk> a[MASK] <unk> he was a perfect fit for for the part and robert is actually the one who[MASK] gave me my first chance he was the the one who believed in me and encouraged me to[MASK] to do an adaptation of my books into a into a film and to write direct <unk> and produce the film[MASK] <unk> robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity [MASK] because this guy is the busiest man on the planet i mean his agenda is booked until two thousand and forty two and[MASK] he 's really hard to to get <unk> and i wanted him to be in in the movie to reprise his role in the movie <unk> [MASK] but the thing is had i waited for for him until two thousand and forty two my film wouldn 't be a futuristic film anymore[MASK] i just couldn 't do that right <unk> but that 's kind of a big problem how do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie <unk> [MASK] well <unk> i said as a joke in a production meeting and this is a true story by the way i said why don 't we turn this guy into a hologram <unk> [MASK] because you know he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time and he 's an illuminated being in my mind[MASK] <unk> he 's in between[MASK] reality and virtual reality so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram [MASK] everybody around the table laughed <unk> but the joke was kind of a good solution so that 's what we ended up doing [MASK] here 's how we did it we shot robert with six cameras he was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium <unk> each camera was covering sixty[MASK] <unk> degrees of his head so that in post production we could[MASK] use pretty much any angle we needed and[MASK] we shot only his head <unk> six months later there was a guy on set a mime portraying the body the vehicle for the head <unk> [MASK] and he was wearing a green hood[MASK] so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with robert lepage 's head <unk> so he became like a renaissance[MASK] <unk> man and here 's what it looks like in the movie[MASK] <unk> my second example of how constraints can boost creativity[MASK] because i desperately needed these objects in my movie they are objects of desire they are imaginary[MASK] <unk> instruments and they carry a nice story with them <unk> actually <unk> i knew what these[MASK] things would look like in my mind for many many years <unk> but[MASK] my problem was i didn 't have the money to to pay for them <unk> [MASK] i couldn 't afford them <unk> so that 's kind of a big problem too how do you get something that you can 't afford [MASK] and [MASK] you know i woke up one[MASK] <unk> morning with a pretty good idea i said what if i have somebody else pay for them <unk>[MASK] but who on earth would be interested by seven not yet built musical instruments inspired by women 's bodies <unk> [MASK] and i thought of cirque du soleil in montreal[MASK] <unk> who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that i wanted to put on screen <unk> so i found my way to guy lalibert cirque du soleil 's ceo and[MASK] i presented my crazy idea to him with with sketches like this and visual references and something[MASK] pretty amazing happened guy was[MASK] interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money but because i came to him with a good idea[MASK] in which everybody was happy it was kind of a[MASK] <unk> perfect triangle in which the[MASK] the[MASK] art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price <unk> because they weren 't even made he took a leap of faith <unk> [MASK] and the artist dominique engel <unk> brilliant guy he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year <unk> [MASK] and obviously i was happy because i got the instruments in my film for free which was[MASK] <unk> kind of what i tried to do <unk> so here they are and[MASK] my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from[MASK] the green because this is a[MASK] weird color a crazy color and you need to replace the the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later <unk> and i had again pretty much[MASK] <unk> much <unk> ideas in my mind as to what the the world would be <unk> but[MASK] then again i turned to my childhood imagination and went to[MASK] the work of belgian comic book master <unk> franois schuiten in belgium and this guy[MASK] is another guy i admire a lot and i wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer <unk> but people told me you know[MASK] <unk> it 's impossible the guy is too busy and he will say no well i said you know what instead of[MASK] mimicking his style i might as well call the real guy and ask him <unk> and[MASK] i sent him my books and[MASK] he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be[MASK] a big fish in a small aquarium in other words there was space for him to dream with me so here i was with[MASK] <unk> of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that 's in the film[MASK] to turn that into montreal in the future <unk> [MASK] and it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom i admire <unk> [MASK] but then you know <unk> eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality [MASK] so again my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that i could think of and there 's this[MASK] <unk> guy in montreal another quebecois called carlos monzon and he 's a very good vfx artist this guy had been[MASK] lead compositor on such films as avatar and star trek and transformers and other unknown projects like this and i knew he was the perfect fit for the job <unk> and i had to convince him and[MASK] <unk> instead of working on the next spielberg movie he accepted to work on mine <unk> why because i offered him a space to dream so if you don 't have[MASK] money to offer to people you must strike their imagination with[MASK] something as as nice as you can think of so this is what happened on this movie and that 's how it got made and we went to this very nice[MASK] postproduction company in montreal called vision globale and[MASK] artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film <unk> so i want to tell you that if you have some[MASK] crazy ideas in your mind <unk> and that people tell you that it 's impossible to make well that 's an even better reason to want to do it because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the[MASK] <unk> if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents[MASK] life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way i have experienced it [MASK] and you might end up doing some crazy projects and[MASK] who knows you might even end up going to mars thank you[MASK]
