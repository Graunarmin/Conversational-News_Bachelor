 <unk> 'd probably think something like this <unk> [MASK] but i 'm actually not here to talk about fiction <unk> i 'm here to talk about very real killer robots autonomous combat drones[MASK] <unk> referring to predator and reaper drones <unk> which have a human making targeting decisions i 'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons[MASK] that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own there 's actually a technical term for this lethal autonomy <unk> [MASK] now lethally autonomous[MASK] <unk> killer robots would take many forms[MASK] flying driving or just lying in wait <unk> [MASK] and actually they 're very quickly becoming a reality <unk> [MASK] these are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the dmz between north and south korea [MASK] both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target[MASK] and firing on it the one on the left[MASK] at a distance of over a kilometer[MASK] <unk> in both cases there 's still a human in the loop[MASK] to make that lethal firing decision <unk> but it 's not a technological requirement it 's a choice [MASK] and it 's that choice that i want to focus on because as we migrate lethal decision making from humans[MASK] to software we risk not only taking the humanity out of war <unk> but also changing our social landscape entirely <unk> far from the battlefield[MASK] that 's because[MASK] the way humans resolve conflict[MASK] shapes our social landscape <unk> and this has always been the case throughout history for example these were state of the art weapons systems in one thousand four hundred a d [MASK] now they were both very expensive to build and maintain but with these you could dominate the[MASK] <unk> and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that power was focused at the very top and[MASK] what changed [MASK] technological innovation gunpowder cannon <unk> and pretty soon armor and castles were obsolete <unk> [MASK] and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield[MASK] versus how many people you brought to the battlefield <unk> and as armies grew in size[MASK] <unk> arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense [MASK] and as leaders had to rely on more of their populace <unk> they began to share power representative government began to form <unk> [MASK] so again the tools we use to resolve conflict[MASK] shape our social landscape autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool except that by[MASK] requiring very few people to go to war <unk> they risk[MASK] re centralizing power into very few hands <unk> possibly reversing a five century trend toward democracy [MASK] now i think knowing this [MASK] we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions to do what humans do best which is adapt [MASK] but time is a factor <unk> seventy nations are developing[MASK] <unk> of their own <unk> and as you 'll see remotely piloted combat drones[MASK] are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons that 's because once you 've deployed remotely piloted drones there are three powerful factors[MASK] pushing decision making away from humans[MASK] and on to the weapon platform itself the first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce[MASK] <unk> example in two thousand and four the u s drone fleet produced a grand total of seventy one hours of video surveillance for analysis[MASK] <unk> by two thousand and eleven this had gone up to three hundred thousand hours [MASK] outstripping human ability to review it all but even that number is about to go up drastically [MASK] the pentagon 's gorgon stare and argus programs will put up to[MASK] <unk> camera eyes[MASK] on each drone platform <unk> [MASK] and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it and that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest <unk> [MASK] and that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at not the other way around <unk> but there 's a second[MASK] <unk> away from humans and onto machines and that 's electromagnetic jamming <unk> severing the connection between the drone and its operator <unk> [MASK] now we saw an example of this in two thousand and eleven when an american rq 170 sentinel drone got a bit confused over iran due to a gps spoofing attack <unk> [MASK] but any <unk>[MASK] drone is susceptible to this type of attack <unk> and that means drones[MASK] <unk> will have to shoulder more decision making they 'll know their mission objective <unk> [MASK] and they 'll react to new circumstances without human guidance [MASK] they 'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own <unk> [MASK] which brings us to really the third and most powerful incentive[MASK] <unk> away from humans and onto weapons <unk> [MASK] plausible deniability <unk> [MASK] now we live in a global economy[MASK] high tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents <unk> [MASK] cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown <unk> and in that environment it is very likely that a successful drone design[MASK] will be knocked off in contract factories proliferate in the gray market[MASK] <unk> situation sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon [MASK] this raises the very real possibility[MASK] of anonymous war <unk> [MASK] this could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower against an attacker <unk> [MASK] and that could shift the balance in the[MASK] <unk> century away from defense and toward offense it could make military action a viable option not just for small nations <unk> [MASK] but criminal organizations <unk> private enterprise even powerful individuals [MASK] it could create a landscape of rival warlords[MASK] undermining rule of law and civil society now if[MASK] responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones[MASK] <unk> of representative government autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both now you might be thinking that citizens of high tech nations[MASK] would have the advantage in any robotic war that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable particularly against developing nations <unk> [MASK] but i think the truth is the exact opposite <unk> i think citizens of[MASK] high tech societies are more vulnerable vulnerable to robotic weapons <unk> and the reason can be summed up in one word data [MASK] data powers high tech societies <unk> [MASK] cell phone geolocation telecom metadata social media <unk> email text financial transaction data <unk> transportation[MASK] <unk> it 's a wealth of real time data[MASK] on the movements and social interactions of people in short we are more visible to machines than any people in history <unk> [MASK] and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons <unk> [MASK] what you 're looking at here[MASK] is a link analysis map of a social group <unk> lines indicate social connectedness between[MASK] <unk> and these types of maps can be automatically generated[MASK] based on the[MASK] data trail modern people leave behind [MASK] now it 's typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics <unk> but it 's a dual use technology <unk> [MASK] because targeting is used in another context notice that certain individuals are highlighted these are the hubs of social networks [MASK] <unk> and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns [MASK] now if you 're a marketer you might then target them with product samples <unk> try to spread your brand through their social group <unk> [MASK] but if you 're a repressive government[MASK] searching for political enemies you might instead remove them eliminate them disrupt their social[MASK] <unk> and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization[MASK] now in a world of cheap proliferating robotic weapons <unk> borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments[MASK] or trans national criminal organizations popular movements agitating for change[MASK] could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass and ideas achieving[MASK] <unk> critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action[MASK] an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests <unk> and this would[MASK] put a chill on free speech[MASK] and popular political action the very heart of democracy <unk> and this is why we need an international treaty on[MASK] <unk> robotic weapons and in particular a global ban[MASK] on the development and deployment of killer robots <unk> [MASK] now we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons [MASK] and while imperfect these have largely worked <unk> [MASK] but robotic weapons[MASK] might be every bit as dangerous because they will almost certainly be used and they would also be corrosive to our democratic[MASK] <unk> institutions <unk> [MASK] now in november two thousand and twelve the u s department of defense[MASK] issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions <unk> this temporarily[MASK] effectively banned autonomous weapons in the u s military but that directive needs to be made[MASK] <unk> and it could set the stage for global action [MASK] because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons <unk> [MASK] and we need it now before there 's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences [MASK] autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands <unk> and they would imperil[MASK] <unk> democracy itself <unk> [MASK] now <unk> don 't get me wrong <unk> i think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones <unk> [MASK] environmental monitoring search and rescue logistics [MASK] if we have an international treaty on robotic weapons <unk> how do we gain the benefits of autonomous[MASK] drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons[MASK] <unk> i think the secret will be transparency <unk> [MASK] no robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place [MASK] each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed[MASK] <unk> burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces we have license plates on cars <unk> tail numbers on aircraft this is no different <unk> [MASK] and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them [MASK] both right now and historically [MASK] and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones[MASK] to detect rogue drones and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down[MASK] <unk> should notify humans to their presence <unk> and in certain very high security areas <unk> perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility <unk> [MASK] but notice this is more an immune system[MASK] than a weapons system it would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our[MASK] <unk> civil society we must[MASK] ban the deployment and development[MASK] of killer robots let 's not succumb to the temptation to automate war <unk> autocratic governments[MASK] and criminal organizations undoubtedly will but let 's not join them [MASK] autonomous robotic weapons would concentrate too much power in too few unseen hands <unk> [MASK] and that would be corrosive to representative government [MASK] let 's make sure for democracies[MASK] <unk> at least killer robots remain fiction <unk> thank you[MASK]
