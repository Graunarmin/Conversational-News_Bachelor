 <unk> so how would you run a whole country without oil <unk> that 's the question that[MASK] sort of hit me in the middle of a davos afternoon about four years ago <unk> it never left my brain <unk> and i started playing with it more like[MASK] <unk> original thought i had this must be ethanol so i went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country [MASK] about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen <unk> until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually[MASK] use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside[MASK] a car if you use hydrogen so that is not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around i got to the thought that actually if you[MASK] <unk> could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is[MASK] convenient and affordable you could[MASK] get to a solution <unk> now i started this from a point of view that it has to be something that scales en masse not how do you build one car <unk> but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by <unk> ninety nine percent[MASK] of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good[MASK] <unk> good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two it has be more affordable than today 's cars affordable is not a forty thousand dollar sedan [MASK] right alright that 's not something that we can finance or buy today and convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight <unk> [MASK] so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that[MASK] <unk> that i started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show <unk>[MASK] <unk> up how do you do it within the economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down[MASK] <unk> the car ownership[MASK] and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included [MASK] now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a[MASK] network before the cars show up the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you[MASK] <unk> stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about twenty two hours[MASK] if you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute <unk> [MASK] and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park[MASK] we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around[MASK] <unk> you already have that if you park your car and didn 't plug in the heater when you come back you don 't have a car it just doesn 't work <unk> [MASK] now that last mile last foot <unk> in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension <unk>[MASK] see we 're bound by today 's technology on batteries which is about one hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable[MASK] <unk> hundred and twenty miles is a good enough range for a lot of people but you never want to get stuck <unk> so what we added is a second element to our network which is a battery swap system [MASK] you drive you take your depleted battery out a full battery comes on and you drive on you don 't do it as a human being you do it as a machine it looks like a car wash <unk> you come into your <unk>[MASK] car wash <unk> and a plate comes up holds your battery takes it out puts it back in and within two minutes you 're back on the road and you can go again[MASK] if you had charge spots everywhere <unk> and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it and it ends up[MASK] that you 'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station as a matter of fact we added to the contract <unk> [MASK] we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than fifty times a year we start paying you money[MASK] because it 's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability we looked at the question what[MASK] <unk> when the battery is disconnected from the car <unk> what is the cost of that battery everybody tells us batteries are so expensive what we found out when you move from molecules to electrons something interesting happens we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again <unk> [MASK] the battery is not the gas tank in a sense <unk> remember in in your car you have a gas tank <unk> you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline[MASK] the battery[MASK] in this sense is the crude oil <unk> we have a battery bay it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank <unk> [MASK] but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn 't burn <unk> it consumes itself step after step after step it has two thousand life cycles these days <unk> [MASK] and so it 's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car[MASK] <unk> wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we 've done is we 've created a new[MASK] consumable [MASK] you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number [MASK] today two thousand and ten in volume when we come to market <unk> it is eight cents a mile[MASK] <unk> have a hard time calculating what that means[MASK] in the average consumer environment we 're in in the u s twenty miles per gallon that 's a buck fifty a buck sixty a gallon that 's cheaper than today 's gasoline even in the u s [MASK] in europe where taxes are in place <unk> that 's the equivalent to a minus sixty dollar barrel <unk> [MASK] but e miles follow moore 's law they go from eight cents a mile[MASK] <unk> four cents a mile in two thousand and fifteen to two cents a mile by two thousand and twenty [MASK] why because batteries life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price [MASK] and these prices are actually with clean electrons we do not use any electrons that come from coal [MASK] so in a sense this is[MASK] an absolute[MASK] <unk> mile at two cents a mile by two thousand and twenty now even if we get to forty miles per gallon by two thousand and twenty which is our desire imagine only forty miles per gallon cars would be on the road <unk> that is an eighty cent gallon an[MASK] eighty cent gallon means if the entire pacific would convert to crude oil and we 'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it they still can 't compete with two cents a mile <unk> [MASK] that 's a new economic factor[MASK] <unk> which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper that 's how i solved it in my head it was a white paper i handed out to governments and some governments told me that it 's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things [MASK] laughter until i got to the true young global leader shimon peres president of israel <unk> and he ran a beautiful manipulation[MASK] <unk> first he let me go to the prime minister of the country who told me if you can find the money you need for this network two hundred million dollars <unk> and if you can find a car company[MASK] that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that 's what we needed in israel i 'll give you country to invest the two hundred million into [MASK] peres thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we sent letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount[MASK] but one of them carlos ghosn ceo of renault and nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating he said hybrids are like mermaids [MASK] when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish [MASK] and ghosn came up and said i have the car mr peres i will build you the cars and actually true to form renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars[MASK] <unk> cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year one hundred thousand cars it[MASK] 's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car[MASK] in the market[MASK] i was running as chris said to be the ceo of a large software company called sap and then peres said well won 't you run this project[MASK] <unk> no no no no [MASK] you 've got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a[MASK] better place we then decided to scale it up we went to other countries as i said we went to denmark <unk> [MASK] and denmark set this beautiful policy it 's called the iq test it 's inversely proportional to taxes [MASK] they put one hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on[MASK] <unk> cars <unk> [MASK] so if you want to buy a gasoline car in denmark it costs you about sixty thousand euros if you buy our car it 's about twenty thousand euros <unk> if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country [MASK] we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands i know most people don 't think of israel as a small island but israel is an island it 's a[MASK] <unk> thinking about it in terms of islands <unk> we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find and that was australia <unk> the third country we announced was australia it 's got three centers[MASK] in brisbane in melbourne in sydney and one freeway one electric freeway that connects them the next island was not too hard to find and that was hawaii[MASK] <unk> we decided to come into the u s and pick the two best places the one where you didn 't need any range extension hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island[MASK] the second one was the san francisco bay area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he 's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy[MASK] in the san francisco bay area not only do you have the highest concentration of priuses[MASK] <unk> but you also have the perfect range extender it 's called the other car[MASK] as we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u s why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we 've learned <unk>[MASK] <unk> is that when you have small problems on the individual level like the price of gasoline to drive every morning <unk> [MASK] <unk> of oil much like[MASK] lots of other curves that we 've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out[MASK] you think well it 's been up it 's been down its been up it 's going to keep on going up and down <unk> here is the problem[MASK] <unk> at one hundred and forty seven dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u s spent a ton of money to get[MASK] oil <unk> then we lost our economy and we went back down to forty seven sometimes it 's forty sometimes it 's fifty <unk> [MASK] now we 're running a stimulus package it 's called the trillion dollar stimulus package we 're going to revive the economy hopefully it happens between now and two thousand and fifteen <unk> somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers[MASK] <unk> by two thousand and fifteen we would have had at least two hundred and fifty million new cars even at the pace we 're going at right now that 's another thirty percent demand on oil <unk> that is another twenty five million barrels a day that 's all the u s usage[MASK] today <unk> [MASK] in other words at some point when we 've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as two hundred dollars a barrel <unk> [MASK] we take our money and we give it away you know what happens at that point we go back down <unk> it 's going to go up[MASK] <unk> and down and the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter <unk> [MASK] and that 's the difference between problems that are additive like co2 which we go slowly up and then we tip <unk> and problems that are depletive in[MASK] which we lose what we have <unk> which oscillate <unk> and they oscillate until we lose everything we 've got <unk> now[MASK] we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign one million hybrid[MASK] <unk> cars by two thousand and fifteen <unk> that is zero point five percent of the u s oil consumption [MASK] that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world [MASK] that won 't do much difference we looked at an mit study ten million electric cars on the global roads ten million out of[MASK] five hundred million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it 's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry[MASK] from one hundred thousand cars is two thousand and eleven to ten million cars by two thousand and sixteen[MASK] one hundred x growth[MASK] in less than five years <unk> [MASK] you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have ten million cars by region that 's an enormous amount of cars[MASK] <unk> adding those cars india [MASK] russia brazil <unk> we have all these regions europe has solved it they just put a tax on gasoline they 'll be the first in line to get off because their prices are high <unk> [MASK] china solves it by an edict at some point they 'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city and that will be it <unk> [MASK] the indians don 't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes one hundred and twenty[MASK] <unk> miles is an extension on range not a reduction in range we[MASK] 're the only ones who don 't have the price set right we don 't have the industry set right we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u s [MASK] now where is the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said[MASK] <unk> miles if you want[MASK] <unk> like cellphones you 'll pay for the miles <unk> [MASK] and some of it will go back to the car maker some of it will go back to your own pocket <unk> but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars you 're looking at a world where cars are matched[MASK] with windmills in denmark we will drive all the cars in denmark[MASK] from windmills not from oil <unk> in israel we 've asked to put a solar farm in the south of israel[MASK] <unk> and people said oh that 's a very very large space that you 're asking for and we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years [MASK] and they said we tried there isn 't any [MASK] we said no no but what if we prove it and they said well you can dig and we decided to dig up <unk> instead of digging down <unk> [MASK] these are perfect matches[MASK] to one another <unk> now[MASK] all you need is about ten percent of the electricity generated[MASK] think of it as a project that spans over about ten years <unk> that 's one percent a year <unk> [MASK] now when we 're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not twenty percent by two thousand and twenty [MASK] the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil[MASK] and scale it infinity and[MASK] <unk> at the end of this year we can 't stop thinking of padding co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale [MASK] one car emits four tons and actually seven hundred and change million cars today emit two point eight billion tons of co2 that 's [MASK] in the additive about twenty five percent of our problem cars and trucks add up to about twenty five percent of the world 's co2 emissions <unk> [MASK] we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we 're going to go to zero before[MASK] the world ends <unk> i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u s i shared it with[MASK] with a gentleman called bobby kennedy jr who is one of my idols <unk> i told him one of the reasons that[MASK] his uncle was remembered is because he said we 're going to send a man to the moon and we 'll do it by the end of the decade we didn 't say we 're going to send a man twenty percent to the moon and there will be about a twenty percent chance we 'll recover him[MASK] he actually shared with me another story which is from about two hundred years ago [MASK] two hundred years ago <unk> in parliament in great britain <unk> there was a long argument[MASK] over economy versus morality twenty five percent just like twenty five percent emissions today comes from cars twenty five percent[MASK] of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the u k came from a source[MASK] <unk> of energy that was immoral [MASK] human slaves <unk> [MASK] and there was an argument [MASK] should we stop using slaves <unk> and what would it do to our economy and people said well we need to take time to do it [MASK] let 's not do it immediately <unk> maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves <unk> [MASK] and after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery <unk> and the industrial[MASK] <unk> revolution started within less than one year <unk> and the u k had one hundred years of economic[MASK] growth <unk> we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it[MASK] immediately <unk> we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil and we need to do it[MASK] not within twenty years or fifty years but within this presidential term because if we don 't we will lose our economy[MASK] right after we 'd lost our morality[MASK]
