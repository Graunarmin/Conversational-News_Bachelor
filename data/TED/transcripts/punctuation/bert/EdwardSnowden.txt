 <unk> the rights of citizens the future of the internet <unk> [MASK] so i would like to welcome to the ted stage the man behind those revelations ed snowden[MASK] <unk> remote location somewhere in russia[MASK] controlling this bot from his laptop <unk> so he can see what the bot can see [MASK] ed welcome to the ted stage what can you see as a matter of fact[MASK] <unk> some questions for you you 've been called many things in the last few months you 've been called[MASK] a whistleblower a traitor a hero <unk> what words would you describe yourself with[MASK] <unk> we should be struggling with [MASK] who i am really doesn 't matter at all if i 'm the worst person in the world [MASK] you can hate me and move on what really matters here are the issues what really matters here is the kind of government we want the kind of internet we[MASK] want the kind of relationship between people and societies [MASK] and that 's what i 'm hoping[MASK] the debate will move towards and we 've seen that increasing over time if i had to describe myself <unk> i wouldn 't use words like[MASK] <unk> year ago you were stationed in hawaii working as a consultant to the <unk>[MASK] as a sysadmin you had access to their systems <unk> and you began[MASK] revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to june 's revelations now what propelled you to do[MASK] <unk> things that need to be done <unk> and things that help everyone [MASK] but there are also things that go too far <unk> there are things that shouldn 't be done and decisions that were being made in secret without the public 's awareness[MASK] <unk> public 's consent and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs [MASK] when[MASK] i really came to struggle with these issues <unk> i thought to myself how can i do this in the most responsible way <unk> that maximizes the public benefit[MASK] <unk> and out of all the solutions that i could come up with [MASK] out of going to congress <unk> when there were no laws there were no legal protections for a private employee a[MASK] contractor in intelligence like <unk>[MASK] there was a risk that i would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out but the first amendment of the united states constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason [MASK] and that 's to enable[MASK] <unk> an adversarial press to challenge the government <unk> [MASK] but also to work together with the government [MASK] to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance[MASK] without putting our national security at risk and by working with journalists by giving[MASK] <unk> rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication <unk> we 've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government[MASK] that i think has resulted in a benefit for everyone and the risks that <unk>[MASK] <unk> been threatened <unk> the risks that have been played up by[MASK] <unk> have never materialized we 've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm[MASK] <unk> that i 'm comfortable with the decisions that i made[MASK] ca so let me show the audience a couple of examples of of what you revealed if we could have a slide up and ed <unk> i don 't know whether you can see the slides are here <unk> this is a slide of the prism program <unk> and maybe[MASK] <unk> that allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping mass surveillance of the entire country 's phone records things like that[MASK] you 're talking to when you 're talking to them <unk>[MASK] these are all metadata events prism[MASK] is about content <unk> [MASK] it 's a program through which the government could compel corporate america it could deputize corporate america[MASK] to do its dirty work[MASK] <unk> even though some of these companies did resist even though some of them i believe yahoo was one of them challenged them in court they all lost <unk> because it was never tried by an open court they were only tried by a secret court [MASK] and something that we 've seen something about the prism program that 's very concerning to me is there 's been a talking point in the u s government where they 've said fifteen federal[MASK] <unk> have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful but what they don 't tell you[MASK] is those are secret judges in a secret court[MASK] based on secret interpretations of law[MASK] that 's considered thirty four thousand warrant requests over thirty three years <unk> [MASK] and in thirty three years only rejected eleven government requests[MASK] <unk> that we want deciding what the role of corporate america in a free and open internet should be [MASK] ca now this slide that we 're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies internet companies are[MASK] alleged to have have joined the program and where data collection began from them now they have denied collaborating collaborating with the nsa[MASK] <unk> own slides refer to it as direct access what that means to an actual[MASK] someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst[MASK] targeting <unk> chinese cyber hackers things like that in hawaii is the provenance of that data is directly from[MASK] <unk> this stuff away [MASK] now each company handles it different ways <unk> some are responsible some are somewhat less responsible but the bottom line is when we talk about how this information[MASK] is given <unk> it 's coming from the[MASK] <unk> not stolen from the lines [MASK] but there 's an important thing to remember here even though companies pushed back even though companies demanded hey <unk> let 's do this through a warrant process let 's do this <unk>[MASK] where we actually have some sort of legal review some sort of basis for handing over these users ' data [MASK] <unk> to the data center communications between google to itself[MASK] and yahoo to itself <unk> so even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the nsa [MASK] the nsa isn 't satisfied with that and because of that we need our companies to work very hard[MASK] represent the interests of the user and also advocate for the rights of the users [MASK] and i think over the last year we 've seen the companies that are named on the prism slides take great strides to do that <unk> and i encourage them to continue ca [MASK] what more should they do[MASK] es the biggest thing that an internet company in america can do today <unk> [MASK] right now without consulting with lawyers to protect the rights of users worldwide[MASK] <unk> enable ssl <unk>[MASK] web encryption on every page you visit <unk> the reason this matters is today if you go to look at a copy of <unk>[MASK] the nsa can see a record of that [MASK] the russian intelligence service can see a record of that the chinese service can see a record of that the french service the german service the services[MASK] <unk> andorra they can all see it because it 's unencrypted the world 's library is amazon com [MASK] but not only do they not support encryption by default <unk> you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books <unk> this is something that we need to change not just for amazon[MASK] <unk> that 'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide ca ed come with me to this part of the stage <unk> i want to show you the next slide here this[MASK] is a program called boundless informant <unk> what is that es so i 've got to give credit[MASK] <unk> for using appropriate names on this this is one of my favorite nsa cryptonyms [MASK] boundless informant is a program that the nsa hid from congress [MASK] the nsa was previously asked by congress was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate[MASK] of the amount of american communications that were being intercepted <unk> they said no[MASK] <unk> we don 't track those stats and we can 't track those stats we can 't tell you[MASK] how many communications we 're intercepting around the world because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy <unk> [MASK] now i really appreciate that sentiment from them <unk> but the reality when you look at this slide is not only do they have the capability [MASK] the capability already exists it 's already in place the nsa has its own internal[MASK] <unk> what boundless informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted[MASK] in america about americans than there are in russia about russians <unk> i 'm not sure that 's what an intelligence agency should be aiming[MASK] there was a story broken in the washington post again from your data <unk> the headline says <unk> nsa broke privacy rules thousands of times per year [MASK] tell us about that es [MASK] we also heard in congressional testimony last year <unk> it was an amazing thing for someone like me[MASK] who[MASK] <unk> that there had been no abuses <unk> that there had been no violations of the nsa 's rules <unk> [MASK] when we knew this story was coming <unk> [MASK] but what 's especially interesting about this <unk> about the fact that the nsa has violated their own rules their own laws thousands of times in a single year <unk> including one event by itself one event out of those two thousand seven hundred and[MASK] <unk> that affected more than three thousand people in another event they intercepted all the calls in washington d c by accident[MASK] <unk> what 's amazing about this this report that didn 't get that much attention is the fact that not only were there two thousand seven hundred and seventy six abuses <unk> [MASK] the chairman of the senate intelligence[MASK] <unk> dianne feinstein had not seen this report[MASK] until the washington post contacted her asking for comment on the[MASK] report and she then requested a copy from the nsa and received it [MASK] but had never seen this before that what does that say about the state of oversight in american intelligence when the chairman of the senate intelligence committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of[MASK] <unk> this why should we care about all this surveillance honestly <unk> i mean look if you 've done nothing wrong you 've got nothing to worry about [MASK] what 's wrong with that point of[MASK] your rights matter[MASK] because you never know when you 're going to need them [MASK] beyond that it 's a part of our cultural identity not just in america <unk> [MASK] but in western societies and in democratic societies around the world [MASK] people should be able to pick up the phone and to call their <unk> family people should be able to send a text message to[MASK] <unk> people should be able to buy a book online <unk> they should be able to travel by train they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look[MASK] to an agent of the government possibly not even your government[MASK] years in the future how they 're going to be misinterpreted and what they 're going to think your intentions were [MASK] we have a right to privacy we require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion[MASK] <unk> because we recognize that trusting[MASK] anybody <unk> any government authority with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight[MASK] is simply too great a temptation to be ignored ca [MASK] some people are furious at what you 've done i heard a quote recently from dick cheney[MASK] who said that[MASK] julian[MASK] <unk> assange was a flea bite <unk> edward snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog <unk> [MASK] he thinks you 've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in american history <unk> [MASK] what would you say to people who think that es [MASK] dick cheney 's really something[MASK] <unk> julian assange was doing some of his greatest work dick cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide <unk> the skies were going to[MASK] ignite and the seas were going to boil off and now he 's saying it 's a flea bite[MASK] <unk> so we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security[MASK] from these kind of officials but[MASK] let 's assume that these people really believe this i would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of[MASK] <unk> prerogatives of people like dick cheney[MASK] do not keep the nation safe <unk> the public interest[MASK] is not always the same as the national interest going to war with people who are <unk>[MASK] in places that are not a threat doesn 't make us safe and that applies whether it 's in iraq or[MASK] <unk> any other company out there[MASK] is a part of our society <unk> it 's a part of our interconnected world there are ties of fraternity that[MASK] bond us together <unk> and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards[MASK] <unk> nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by ca but[MASK] it 's alleged that you 've stolen one point seven million documents it seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far are there more revelations to come es [MASK] there are absolutely more revelations[MASK] <unk> the most important reporting to be done is yet to come[MASK] want to ask you about this particular revelation come[MASK] and take a look at this <unk> i mean this is a story which i think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they[MASK] <unk> that i believe they 're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure <unk> they 're programs through which the nsa intentionally misleads[MASK] corporate partners <unk> they tell corporate partners that these are safe standards they say hey <unk> we need to work with you to secure[MASK] secure your systems <unk> but in reality they 're giving bad advice to these[MASK] companies that makes them degrade the security of their services they 're building in backdoors that not only the nsa can exploit <unk> [MASK] but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it[MASK] can then use to let themselves in to the world 's communications [MASK] and this is really dangerous because if we lose a single standard <unk> [MASK] if we lose the trust of something like ssl which was specifically targeted by the[MASK] <unk> a less safe world overall we won 't be able to access our banks and we won 't be able to access[MASK] commerce[MASK] without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends ca and do those same decisions also potentially[MASK] open america up to[MASK] <unk> traditionally worn two hats they 've been in charge of offensive operations that is hacking but they 've also been in charge of defensive operations <unk>[MASK] <unk> and traditionally they 've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that american secrets are simply worth more [MASK] if we hack a chinese business and steal their secrets <unk> if we hack a government office in berlin and steal their secrets <unk> [MASK] that has less value[MASK] to the american people[MASK] than making sure that the chinese can 't get access to our secrets <unk> [MASK] so by reducing the security of our communications they 're not only putting the world[MASK] at risk they 're putting america at risk in a fundamental way <unk> because intellectual property is the basis the foundation of our[MASK] <unk> you will see that that 's unfounded <unk> and you don 't have to take my word for it because[MASK] we 've had the first open court the first federal[MASK] <unk> to be briefed on these things and now has the desire to be [MASK] has produced bills to reform it and two independent white house panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never <unk>[MASK] <unk> stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the united states [MASK] i say no <unk> and all three branches of the american government say no as well ca i mean do you think there 's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism es i 'm sorry[MASK] i couldn 't hear you say again ca sorry do you think there 's a deeper motivation for them[MASK] other than the war against terrorism es yeah <unk> the bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world[MASK] <unk> terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to[MASK] rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn[MASK] programs the nsa asked for these authorities back in the 1990s [MASK] they asked the fbi to go to congress and make the case the fbi went to congress and did make the case <unk> but congress and[MASK] <unk> people said no they said [MASK] it 's not worth the risk to our economy they said it 's worth too much damage to our society <unk> to justify the gains but what we saw is in the post 9 eleven era <unk> [MASK] they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism[MASK] to start these programs in secret without asking congress <unk> without asking the american people and it 's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need[MASK] to guard ourselves against because it makes us less safe and it offers no value ca[MASK] okay come with me here for a sec because i 've got a more personal question for you <unk> speaking of terror[MASK] <unk> most people would find the situation you 're in right now[MASK] in russia pretty terrifying you[MASK] <unk> what the treatment that bradley manning got chelsea manning as now is [MASK] and there was a story in <unk> buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead[MASK] how are you coping with this how are you coping with the fear <unk> es <unk> it 's no mystery that there are governments out there[MASK] <unk> that i go to sleep every morning thinking about what i can do for the american people [MASK] i don 't want to harm my government i want to help my government[MASK] but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process[MASK] these are things that we need to work against as a society and say hey this is not appropriate [MASK] we shouldn 't be threatening dissidents we shouldn 't be criminalizing journalism <unk> [MASK] and whatever part i can do to see that end i 'm happy to do despite the risks ca so i[MASK] 'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here because i know there 's widely differing reactions to edward snowden[MASK] <unk> suppose you had the following two choices right you could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered america[MASK] or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards america and the world 's <unk> long term good those are the two[MASK] <unk> i 'm curious to see who 's who 's willing to vote with the first of those that this was a reckless act there[MASK] are some hands going up some hands going up it 's hard to put your hand up when[MASK] the man is standing right here but i see them es i can see you ca [MASK] and who goes with the second choice the fundamentally heroic act [MASK] and i think it 's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn 't show a hand[MASK] i think[MASK] are still thinking this through because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn 't split along traditional political lines it 's not left or right it 's not really about pro government libertarian [MASK] or not just that <unk> part of it is almost a generational issue <unk> you 're part of a generation that grew up with the internet and it seems as if[MASK] you you become offended at almost[MASK] a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the internet is there some truth to that es[MASK] i think it 's very true this is not a left or right issue our basic freedoms <unk> and when i say our i don 't just[MASK] <unk> and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open internet it 's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy and if we[MASK] don 't change things [MASK] if we don 't stand up to make the changes we need to do[MASK] <unk> have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web who i actually think is[MASK] with us sir tim berners lee tim actually would you like to come up and say do we have a microphone for tim[MASK] <unk> i think you 've read the proposal that sir tim has talked about about a new magna carta to[MASK] <unk> take back the internet is that something that makes sense es absolutely[MASK] i mean my generation i grew up not just thinking about the internet <unk> but i grew up in the internet[MASK] <unk> and although i never expected to have the chance to defend it in[MASK] such a direct and practical manner and[MASK] almost avatar manner i think there 's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the internet[MASK] has actually become close to the internet[MASK] as a result of their political expression <unk> and i believe that[MASK] a magna carta for the internet is exactly what we need <unk> we need to encode our values[MASK] not just in writing but in the structure of[MASK] and it 's something that i hope <unk> i invite everyone in the audience [MASK] not just here in vancouver but around the world to join and participate in ca [MASK] do you have a question[MASK] <unk> stepping back and thinking <unk> what would you think would be the best that we could achieve[MASK] from all the discussions that we have about the about the web we want[MASK] <unk> go i think that 's a question that 's really only limited by what we 're willing to put into it i think the internet that we 've enjoyed in the past[MASK] has been exactly what[MASK] we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need and[MASK] by cooperating by engaging not just the technical parts of society but as you said the[MASK] <unk> users <unk> the people around the world who contribute through the internet through social media [MASK] who just check the weather who rely on it every day as a part of their life to champion that we[MASK] 'll get not just the internet we <unk>[MASK] <unk> a better internet a better now something that we can use to build a future that 'll be better not just than what we hoped[MASK] <unk> for but anything that we could have <unk>[MASK] it 's thirty years ago that ted was founded <unk>[MASK] a lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that[MASK] actually george orwell got it wrong <unk> it 's not big brother watching us we through the power of the web and transparency are now watching big brother [MASK] your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view[MASK] <unk> but[MASK] you still believe there 's a way of of doing something about that <unk> and you do too es right so[MASK] there is an argument to be made that the powers of big brother have increased enormously[MASK] <unk> there was a recent legal article[MASK] <unk> which is that our expectation of privacy[MASK] is violated[MASK] when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude <unk> [MASK] and each time that occurs we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights [MASK] now that hasn 't happened since the government 's[MASK] <unk> and that 's why we 're in the problem that we 're in today <unk> but[MASK] there is still hope <unk> because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology i am living proof[MASK] that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world[MASK] <unk> i think that 's something that we need to take hope from and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world <unk> journalism is not a crime communication is[MASK] and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities ca i 'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot <unk> but i imagine it[MASK] <unk> the new york times recently called for an amnesty for you <unk> would you welcome the chance to come back to america[MASK] <unk> principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest[MASK] and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the united states and around the world [MASK] and[MASK] i think if[MASK] the press is now saying we support this <unk> this is something that[MASK] <unk> happen that 's a powerful argument but it 's not the final argument and i think that 's something that public should decide [MASK] but at the same time the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal[MASK] that they want me to compromise the journalists with which i 've been working to come back and i want to make it very clear[MASK] that i did not do this to be safe i did this to do what was[MASK] <unk> and i 'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself ca [MASK] in the meantime <unk> courtesy of the internet <unk> and this technology[MASK] <unk> you 're here back in north america not quite the u s [MASK] <unk> the mission is ideas worth spreading if you could encapsulate it in a single idea what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment[MASK] <unk> would say the last year has been a reminder[MASK] that[MASK] democracy may die behind closed doors <unk> but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors <unk> and we don 't have to give up[MASK] our privacy to have good government we don 't have to give up our liberty to have security[MASK] <unk> and i think by working together we can have both open government and private lives <unk> and i look forward to working with everyone around the world[MASK]
