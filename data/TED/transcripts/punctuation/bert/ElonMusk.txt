 <unk> in the next half hour or so we 're going to spend some time exploring your vision[MASK] for what an exciting future might look like <unk> which i guess makes the first question a little ironic <unk> why are you boring em yeah i[MASK] ask myself that frequently[MASK] we 're trying to dig a hole[MASK] under la and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3d network of[MASK] <unk> things is traffic [MASK] it affects people in every part of the world[MASK] <unk> it takes away so much of your life it 's horrible it 's particularly horrible in <unk>[MASK] i think you 've brought with you the first[MASK] <unk> visualization that 's been shown of this can i show this em yeah absolutely so this is the first time[MASK] just to show what we 're talking about so a couple of key things that are important in[MASK] having[MASK] a 3d tunnel network first of all you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city so[MASK] by having an elevator sort of a car[MASK] <unk> you can integrate the entrance and exits[MASK] to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces <unk> and then the car gets on a skate there 's no speed limit here so[MASK] we 're designing this to be able to operate at two hundred kilometers an hour <unk>[MASK] two hundred kilometers an hour or about one hundred and thirty miles per hour <unk> so you should be able to get from say[MASK] lax in six minutes five six minutes [MASK] ca so possibly initially done it 's like on a sort of toll <unk>[MASK] which i guess alleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well [MASK] em so i don 't know if people noticed it in the video but there 's no real limit to how many levels of of tunnel you can have [MASK] <unk> much further deep than you can go up the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall <unk> so you can alleviate any[MASK] arbitrary level of urban congestion[MASK] with with a 3d tunnel network this is a very important point so a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add[MASK] one layer[MASK] <unk> that will simply alleviate congestion it will get used up [MASK] and then you 'll be back where you started back with congestion but you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels any number of levels ca but people[MASK] seen traditionally it 's incredibly expensive to dig and that would block this idea em [MASK] yeah well <unk> they 're right to give you an example the la subway extension which is[MASK] i think it 's a[MASK] <unk> mile extension that was just completed for two billion dollars so it 's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the the subway extension in la[MASK] and this is not the highest utility subway in the world[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] yeah it 's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally <unk> i think we need to have at least[MASK] a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling ca and how could you[MASK] <unk> if you just do two things <unk> you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement[MASK] and i think you can go beyond that <unk> so the the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter[MASK] by a factor of two or more so a single road lane tunnel according to[MASK] regulations has to be twenty six feet maybe twenty eight feet in diameter to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles[MASK] and sufficient ventilation for combustion[MASK] <unk> engine cars <unk> but <unk> if you shrink that diameter to what we 're attempting which is twelve feet which is plenty to get an electric skate through you drop the[MASK] the diameter by a factor of two and the cross sectional area by by a factor of four [MASK] and the tunneling cost scales with the cross sectional area <unk> so that 's roughly a half order of magnitude[MASK] <unk> then tunneling machines[MASK] currently[MASK] tunnel for half the time <unk> then they stop <unk> and then[MASK] the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall [MASK] so if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing that will give you a factor of two improvement <unk> combine that and that 's a factor of eight[MASK] also these machines are far from[MASK] being at their their power or thermal limits <unk> so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially <unk> i think you can get at least a factor of two[MASK] <unk> maybe a factor of[MASK] four or five improvement on on top of that so i think[MASK] there 's a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile [MASK] and[MASK] our target actually is we 've got a pet snail called gary this is from gary[MASK] <unk> is capable of currently he 's capable of going fourteen times faster than[MASK] <unk> beating the snail ca [MASK] but a lot of people imagining dreaming about future cities they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars drones etc you go aboveground[MASK] <unk> why isn 't that a better solution you save all that tunneling cost em [MASK] right <unk> i 'm in favor of flying things obviously i do rockets <unk> so i like[MASK] <unk> things that fly this is not some inherent bias against flying things <unk> but[MASK] there is a challenge with flying cars in that they 'll be quite noisy <unk> the wind force generated will be very high[MASK] <unk> just say that if something 's flying over your head <unk> a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place that is not an[MASK] <unk> you don 't think to yourself well i feel better about[MASK] today you 're thinking did they service their hubcap or is it going to come off and guillotine me[MASK] <unk> these tunnels to use for this hyperloop idea you released a few years ago em yeah <unk> so[MASK] we 've been sort of puttering around with the hyperloop stuff for[MASK] a while <unk> we built a <unk> hyperloop test track adjacent to spacex just for a student competition to encourage innovative ideas in transport and[MASK] <unk> quite fun to do that but it was kind of a hobby thing <unk> and then[MASK] we we think we might so we 've built a little pusher car to push <unk> the student pods[MASK] <unk> going to try seeing how fast we can make the the pusher go if it 's not pushing something [MASK] so <unk> we 're cautiously optimistic we 'll be able to be faster than[MASK] <unk> the world 's fastest bullet train even[MASK] <unk> and looking at tunneling technology it turns out that in order to make a tunnel you have to[MASK] in order to seal against the water table <unk> you 've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six[MASK] <unk> to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere or near vacuum so[MASK] actually it sort of turns out that automatically if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table it is automatically capable of holding vacuum[MASK] <unk> you could dig as much as you want <unk> i think if you were to do something like[MASK] a dc to new york[MASK] <unk> hyperloop i think you 'd probably want to go underground the entire way because it 's a high density area you 're going[MASK] under a lot of buildings and houses[MASK] <unk> 's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house like if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house you will not be able to detect it being dug at all [MASK] in fact if you 're able to detect the tunnel[MASK] being being dug whatever device you are using you can get a lot of money for that device from the israeli military who is trying to[MASK] <unk> detect tunnels from hamas <unk> and from the us[MASK] customs and border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels so the reality is that[MASK] earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations <unk> and once the tunnel depth is below a certain level it is undetectable maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument you might be able to detect it[MASK] <unk> 've started a new company to do this called the boring company very nice very funny[MASK] <unk> it 's kind of puttering along but it 's making good progress so ca so an even bigger part of your time is being spent on[MASK] <unk> cars and transport through tesla is one of the motivations for the tunneling project the realization that[MASK] actually in a world where cars are electric and where they <unk>[MASK] there may end up being more cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now[MASK] <unk> will alleviate congestion <unk> and to some degree that will be true <unk> but[MASK] once you have shared autonomy where it 's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point <unk> the affordability of[MASK] of going in a car will be better than that of a bus like it will cost less than a bus ticket[MASK] so[MASK] the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy and actually[MASK] <unk> traffic will get far worse ca you started tesla with the goal of of persuading the world[MASK] <unk> was the future of cars and a few years ago people were laughing at you now not so much[MASK] <unk> i think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program [MASK] they vary in seriousness some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric and some are just[MASK] <unk> the world electrify and you go on and focus on other stuff em [MASK] yeah[MASK] i intend to stay with tesla as as far into the future as i can imagine[MASK] <unk> it 's looking quite good for starting production in july ca wow <unk> one of the things that people are so excited about is is the fact that it it[MASK] 's got autopilot[MASK] and you put out this video a while back showing what that[MASK] what that technology would look like em yeah there 's obviously[MASK] autopilot in model s right now what are we seeing here em yeah so this is[MASK] using only cameras and gps so there 's no lidar or radar being used here <unk> this is just using passive optical which is[MASK] <unk> what a person uses <unk> the whole road system is meant to be navigated with[MASK] passive optical or cameras and so[MASK] once you solve cameras[MASK] or vision[MASK] <unk> then autonomy is solved <unk> if you don 't solve vision it 's not solved <unk> so that that 's why our focus is so heavily on[MASK] having[MASK] a vision neural[MASK] <unk> net that 's very effective for road conditions ca right many other people are going the lidar route <unk> you want cameras plus radar is is most of it em [MASK] you can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras [MASK] like you can probably do it ten times better than humans would just cameras ca so the new cars being sold right now have[MASK] eight cameras[MASK] <unk> by the end of the year you 're saying someone 's going to sit in a tesla without[MASK] <unk> won 't ever have to touch the wheel by the end of two thousand and seventeen em yeah essentially november[MASK] or december of this year <unk> we should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in california to a parking lot in new york <unk> [MASK] no controls touched at any point during the entire journey[MASK] teslas driving all these roads you 're accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system em [MASK] yes but the thing that will be interesting is that[MASK] i 'm actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route[MASK] even if you change[MASK] <unk> it 's fairly easy[MASK] if you say i 'm going to be really good at one specific route <unk> that 's one thing but[MASK] it should be able to go really be very good certainly once you enter a highway to go anywhere on the highway system[MASK] in a given country <unk> so it 's not sort of limited to <unk> la to new york we could change it and make it[MASK] la to new york now go from la to toronto [MASK] ca so leaving aside regulation for a second in terms of the technology alone[MASK] the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just[MASK] take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they 've arrived how far away is that to do that[MASK] so the real trick of it is not[MASK] how do you make it work say ninety nine point nine percent of the time <unk> because [MASK] like if a car crashes one in a thousand times <unk> then you 're probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep[MASK] <unk> no system is going to be perfect <unk> but if you say it 's perhaps[MASK] the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes or a thousand lifetimes <unk> [MASK] then people are like ok wow <unk> [MASK] if i were to live a thousand lives <unk> i would[MASK] still most likely never experience a crash then that 's probably ok ca to sleep[MASK] <unk> i guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually get seduced too early to think that this is safe <unk> and that you 'll have some horrible incident happen that[MASK] puts things back em well i think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash <unk> [MASK] except in rare circumstances <unk>[MASK] the thing to appreciate about[MASK] vehicle safety is this is this is probabilistic[MASK] <unk> there 's some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car that they will have an accident that is their fault[MASK] <unk> it 's never zero <unk> so really the key threshold for autonomy is[MASK] how much better does autonomy need to be[MASK] than a person before you can rely on it ca but once you get literally safe hands off driving[MASK] the power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive because at that point you 've spoken of people being able to buy a car[MASK] drops you off at work and then you let it go and and[MASK] provide a sort of <unk> uber like service to other people earn you money maybe even cover the cost of your lease of that car so you can kind of get a car for free is that really likely em [MASK] yeah absolutely this is what will happen so there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose to use that car exclusively[MASK] <unk> you could choose to[MASK] <unk> have it be used only by friends and family <unk> only by other drivers who are rated five star <unk> you can choose to[MASK] share it sometimes but not other times[MASK] <unk> <unk> that 's one hundred percent what will occur <unk> it 's just a question of when ca[MASK] wow so[MASK] you mentioned the semi and i think[MASK] i 'm curious whether there 's anything you could show us today em i will show you a teaser shot of the[MASK] <unk> neighborhood truck it looks kind of badass what sort of[MASK] <unk> do not today think is possible they think the truck doesn 't have enough power or it doesn 't have enough range <unk> and then with the tesla semi[MASK] we want to show that no an electric[MASK] truck actually can[MASK] <unk> these are going to be trucks that truck drivers want to drive em yes so what will be really fun about this is[MASK] <unk> a flat torque rpm curve with an electric motor whereas with a diesel motor or any kind of internal combustion engine car you 've got[MASK] a torque rpm curve that looks like a hill <unk> <unk> so this will be a very spry truck <unk> you can drive this around like a sports car [MASK] there 's no gears it 's like single speed <unk> ca there 's a great movie to be made here somewhere i don 't know what it is and i don 't know that it ends well but it 's a great[MASK] <unk> when i was driving the[MASK] the test prototype for the first truck it 's really weird because you 're driving around and you 're just so nimble <unk> [MASK] and you 're in this giant truck ca wait you 've already driven a[MASK] prototype[MASK] <unk> kind of less badass picture [MASK] this is just a cute house from desperate housewives or something [MASK] what on earth is going on here em well <unk> this illustrates the picture of the future that i think[MASK] is how how things will evolve you 've got an electric car in the driveway <unk> if you look in between the electric car and the house[MASK] <unk> stacked up against the side of the house <unk> and then that that house roof is is a solar roof so that 's an actual solar glass roof[MASK] you can adjust the texture and the color to a very fine grained level <unk> and then there 's sort of <unk>[MASK] in the glass such that when you 're looking at the roof from street level or close to street level all the tiles look the[MASK] so you have an even[MASK] even color from from[MASK] the ground level <unk> if you were to look at it from a helicopter you would be actually able to look through and see that some of the the glass tiles[MASK] have a solar cell behind them and some do not you can 't tell from street level ca you put them in the ones that are likely to see a lot of sun[MASK] <unk> we 're very confident that the cost of the roof[MASK] plus the cost of electricity[MASK] a solar glass roof will be less than the cost of a normal roof plus the the cost of electricity so in other words this will be[MASK] economically a[MASK] we thought about having the warranty be infinity <unk> but then people thought well that might sound like were just talking rubbish but actually[MASK] <unk> 're starting off with two <unk> two initially and the second two will be introduced early next year ca and what 's the scale of ambition here [MASK] how many houses do you believe could end up having this this type of roofing em[MASK] <unk> i think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof the thing is to consider the time scale here to be[MASK] probably on the order of[MASK] forty or fifty years[MASK] so on average a roof is replaced every twenty to twenty five years <unk> <unk> but[MASK] you don 't start replacing all roofs immediately but eventually <unk> if you say were to[MASK] <unk> to[MASK] say fifteen years from now it will be unusual to have a roof that does not have solar ca [MASK] is there a mental model thing that people don 't get here that <unk> that because of the shift in the cost the economics of solar power[MASK] most houses actually have enough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power[MASK] all of their needs if you could capture the power it could pretty much power all their needs[MASK] on where you are and what the house size is relative to the roof area <unk> but it 's a fair statement to say that most houses[MASK] in the us have enough roof area to power all the needs of the house[MASK] falling price of lithium ion batteries <unk> which you 've made a huge bet on as as tesla in many ways that 's almost the core competency and[MASK] you 've decided that to really like <unk> own that[MASK] competency <unk> you just have to build the world 's largest manufacturing plant to double the world 's supply[MASK] <unk> you can sort of roughly see that there 's sort of a diamond shape[MASK] overall and when it 's fully done it 'll look like a giant diamond or that 's the idea behind it and it 's aligned on true north it 's a small detail ca [MASK] <unk> one of your core ideas elon about what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer feel guilty about energy[MASK] <unk> you can picture what it would take to move the world off this vast fossil fuel thing it 's like you 're building one it costs five billion dollars <unk>[MASK] or whatever five to ten billion dollars <unk> like it 's kind of cool that you can picture that that project[MASK] <unk> announce locations for somewhere between two and four gigafactories later this year[MASK] <unk> to ask you one question about politics only one i 'm kind of sick of politics but i do want to ask you this[MASK] on[MASK] a body now giving advice to a guy em who ca who has said he doesn 't really believe in climate change [MASK] and there 's a lot of people out there who think you shouldn 't be doing that they 'd like you to walk away from that <unk> what would you say to them[MASK] <unk> format consists of going around the room and asking people 's opinion on things <unk> and[MASK] so there 's like a meeting every month or two that 's the sum total of[MASK] <unk> the degree that there are people in the room who are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change[MASK] <unk> the meetings i 've had thus far to argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change and if i hadn 't done[MASK] that that wasn 't on the agenda before so maybe nothing will happen but at least the words[MASK] <unk> let 's talk spacex and mars last time you were here <unk> you spoke about <unk> what seemed like a kind of incredibly ambitious dream to[MASK] develop rockets that were actually reusable <unk> and you 've only gone and done it[MASK] very high very high and fast in space so just delivered the the upper stage[MASK] at at high velocity i think this might have been at sort of mach seven or so delivery of the of the upper stage[MASK] <unk> that 's amazing <unk> and several of these failed before you finally figured out how to[MASK] <unk> to appreciate that reusability is only relevant if it is rapid[MASK] rapid and complete <unk> so like an aircraft or a car[MASK] <unk> the reusability is rapid and complete you do not send your aircraft[MASK] <unk> and you 've designed this outrageous rocket to do it <unk> help us understand the scale of this thing em well visually you can see that 's a[MASK] <unk> the thrust level of this is really[MASK] this configuration is about four times the thrust of the saturn v moon rocket[MASK] <unk> for every ten million pounds of thrust there 's forty 747s [MASK] <unk> with a machine designed to escape earth 's gravity <unk> i think you told me last time this thing could actually take a fully loaded seven[MASK] <unk> recently this interplanetary transport system which is visualized this way this is a scene you picture[MASK] <unk> vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison with other rockets <unk> i think the future spacecraft will make this look[MASK] <unk> do we need to build a city on mars with a million people on it[MASK] in your lifetime which i think is kind of what you 've said you 'd love to do <unk> em i think it 's important to have[MASK] <unk> be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live [MASK] like why do you want to live what 's the point what inspires you what do you love about the future [MASK] and if we 're not out there if the future does not include being out there among the stars[MASK] and being a multiplanet species i find that it 's incredibly depressing if that 's[MASK] <unk> want to position this as an either or that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to you know you pick your issue[MASK] <unk> and this this feels like a distraction you shouldn 't be thinking about this you should be solving what 's what 's here and now and to be fair you 've done a fair old bit to actually do that with with your[MASK] work work on sustainable energy[MASK] why not just do that [MASK] em i think there 's[MASK] i look at the future from the standpoint of of[MASK] probabilities it 's like a branching stream of probabilities <unk> and there are actions that we can take that affect[MASK] those probabilities[MASK] <unk> or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing i may introduce something new to the probability stream [MASK] sustainable energy will happen no matter what if there was no tesla if tesla never never existed it would have to happen[MASK] out of necessity it 's tautological[MASK] <unk> if you don 't have sustainable energy it means you have unsustainable energy eventually you will run out and the the laws of economics will drive[MASK] will drive civilization towards sustainable energy <unk> inevitably [MASK] the fundamental value of a company like tesla is the degree to which it it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy <unk> faster than it would otherwise occur[MASK] <unk> if it accelerated that by a decade potentially more than a decade <unk> that would be quite a good thing to occur <unk> that 's what i consider to be the[MASK]
