 <unk> like at least twenty other people in a room of this size <unk> [MASK] <unk> do you dare raise your hand <unk> and it sticks with us <unk> it really does stick with us <unk> because[MASK] when we[MASK] are treated that way we feel invisible sometimes or talked around and at [MASK] and as i started to look at people which is mostly all i did <unk> [MASK] i noticed that some people[MASK] really wanted attention[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> recognition <unk> [MASK] remember i was young then <unk> so what did they do what we still do perhaps too often we talk about ourselves <unk> [MASK] and yet there are other people i observed who had what i called a mutuality mindset in each situation they found a way to talk about us[MASK] <unk> so my idea to reimagine the world is to see it one where we all become greater <unk>[MASK] with and for others <unk> there 's no greater opportunity or call for action for us now[MASK] than to become <unk>[MASK] <unk> who use best talents together more often for the greater good and accomplish things we couldn 't have done on our own <unk> and i want to talk to you about that[MASK] <unk> because even more than giving <unk> even more[MASK] than giving is the capacity for us to do something smarter together[MASK] for the greater good[MASK] that lifts us both up[MASK] and that can scale that 's why i 'm sitting here but i also want to point something else out each one of you[MASK] is better than anybody else at something [MASK] that disproves that popular notion that if you 're the smartest person in the room you[MASK] 're in the wrong room [MASK] laughter so let me tell you about a hollywood party i went to a couple years back and[MASK] <unk> and we were soon talking about something that we both felt passionately about public art <unk> [MASK] and she had the fervent belief that every new building in los angeles[MASK] should have public art in it she wanted a regulation for it and she fervently started who is here from chicago [MASK] she fervently started talking about these <unk> bean shaped reflective sculptures in millennium[MASK] <unk> and people would walk up to it[MASK] and they 'd smile in the reflection of it and they 'd pose and they 'd vamp and they 'd take selfies together [MASK] and they 'd laugh <unk> [MASK] and as she was talking a thought came to my mind <unk> i said i know someone you ought to meet <unk> [MASK] he 's getting out of san quentin in a couple of weeks [MASK] and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect he spent five years[MASK] <unk> in solitary <unk> and i met him because i gave a speech at san quentin and he 's articulate[MASK] and he 's rather easy on the eyes[MASK] because he 's buff he had workout regime he did every day [MASK] i think she was following me at that point <unk> i said he 'd be an unexpected ally[MASK] <unk> and not just that there 's james he 's an architect[MASK] and he 's a professor <unk> and he loves place making and place making is when you have those <unk> mini plazas and those urban walkways[MASK] and where they 're dotted with art where people draw and come up and talk sometimes <unk> i think they 'd make good allies <unk> [MASK] and indeed[MASK] they were they met together [MASK] <unk> they spoke in front of the los angeles city council [MASK] and the council members not only passed the regulation half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards [MASK] they were startling <unk> compelling[MASK] and credible you can 't buy that [MASK] what i 'm asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity makers we might become because more than wealth[MASK] or fancy titles[MASK] or[MASK] a lot of contacts it 's our capacity to connect around each other 's better side and bring it out <unk> and i 'm not saying this is easy [MASK] and i 'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with [MASK] but what i want to suggest is this is an opportunity[MASK] <unk> i started thinking about it way back when i was a wall street journal reporter and i was in europe and i was supposed to cover trends and trends that transcended[MASK] business or politics or lifestyle <unk> so i had to have contacts in different worlds very different than mine because otherwise you couldn 't spot the trends [MASK] <unk> and third i had to write the story in a way stepping into the reader 's shoes so they could see how these trends could affect their lives[MASK] <unk> do and here 's a strange thing unlike an increasing number of americans[MASK] who are working and living and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme[MASK] <unk> are actively seeking situations with people unlike them and they 're building[MASK] <unk> relationships and because they do that [MASK] they have trusted relationships where they can bring the right team in and recruit them to solve a problem better and faster and seize more opportunities <unk> [MASK] they 're not affronted[MASK] by differences <unk> [MASK] they 're fascinated by them and that is a huge shift in mindset[MASK] <unk> and once you feel it you want it to happen a lot more this world is calling out for us to have a collective[MASK] mindset <unk> and i believe in doing that it 's especially important now why is it important now <unk> [MASK] because things can be devised like drones[MASK] and drugs and data collection and they can[MASK] <unk> devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes[MASK] and then as we know from the news every day they can be used for dangerous ones [MASK] it calls on us each of us to a higher calling [MASK] but here 's the icing on the cake it 's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that 's probably your greatest[MASK] <unk> as an institution or an individual it[MASK] 's after you 've had that experience and you trust each other [MASK] it 's the unexpected things that you devise later on you never could have predicted for example <unk> marty[MASK] is the husband of that actress i mentioned <unk> and he watched them when they were practicing and he was soon talking to wally my friend[MASK] <unk> exercise regime <unk> and he thought i have a set of racquetball courts that guy could teach it a lot of people who work there are members at my courts[MASK] <unk> they 're frequent travelers they could practice in their hotel room no equipment provided [MASK] that 's how wally got hired not only that years later he was also teaching[MASK] <unk> years after that he was teaching the racquetball teachers what i 'm suggesting is when you connect with people[MASK] around a shared interest and action [MASK] you 're accustomed to serendipitous things happening into the future <unk> and i think that 's what we 're looking at [MASK] we open ourselves up to those opportunities <unk> and in this room are key players in technology [MASK] key players who are uniquely[MASK] <unk> positioned to do this to scale systems and projects together <unk> [MASK] so here 's what i 'm calling for you to do remember the three traits of <unk>[MASK] keep honing their top strength[MASK] and they become pattern seekers <unk> they get involved in different worlds than their worlds so they 're trusted and they[MASK] <unk> can see those patterns <unk> and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest so what i 'm asking you[MASK] is the world is hungry i truly believe in my firsthand experience the world is hungry for us[MASK] to unite together as <unk>[MASK] and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do i know that firsthand[MASK] and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own [MASK] just remember <unk> as dave liniger once said you can 't succeed[MASK] coming to the potluck with only a fork[MASK]
