 <unk> that i got to write it i would have never imagined that not in my wildest dreams did i think i don 't even consider myself to be an author [MASK] i 'm often asked why do you think so many people have read this this thing 's selling[MASK] still about a million copies a month and[MASK] i think it 's because spiritual emptiness is[MASK] a universal disease i think inside at some point we put our heads down on the pillow and we[MASK] <unk> 's got to be more to life than this [MASK] get up in the morning go to work come home and watch tv go to bed get up in the morning go to work come home watch tv go to bed <unk> go to parties on weekends a[MASK] lot of people say i 'm living no you 're not living that 's just existing [MASK] just existing i really think that there 's this inner desire i do believe what chris said i believe[MASK] <unk> not an accident [MASK] your parents may not have planned you but i believe god did i think there are accidental parents there 's no doubt about that [MASK] i don 't think there are accidental kids <unk> [MASK] and i think you matter <unk> [MASK] i think you matter to god i think you matter to history i think you matter to this universe <unk> [MASK] and i think that[MASK] the difference between[MASK] what i call the survival level of living the success level of living and the significance level[MASK] <unk> of living is <unk> do you figure out what on earth am i here for i meet a lot of people[MASK] who are very smart and say but why can 't i figure out my problems [MASK] and i meet a lot of people who are very successful who say why don 't i feel more fulfilled why do i feel like a fake [MASK] why do i feel like[MASK] i 've got to pretend that i 'm more than i really am[MASK] i think that comes down to this issue of meaning of significance of purpose i[MASK] think it comes down to this issue of why am i here what am i here for where am i going these are not religious issues <unk>[MASK] they 're human issues <unk> [MASK] i wanted to tell michael before he spoke that i really appreciate what he does because it makes my life work a whole lot easier as[MASK] <unk> as a pastor i do see a lot of kooks <unk> and i have learned that there are kooks in every area of life <unk> religion doesn 't have a[MASK] a[MASK] monopoly on that but there are plenty of religious kooks <unk> there are secular kooks <unk> there are smart kooks dumb kooks there are people a lady came up to me the other day and she[MASK] <unk> when the book became the best selling book in the world for the last three years <unk>[MASK] <unk> i kind of had my little crisis <unk> and that was what is the purpose of this <unk> [MASK] because it brought in enormous amounts of money when you write the best selling book in the world it 's tons and tons of money [MASK] and it brought in a lot of attention neither of which i wanted when i started saddleback church i was twenty five years old i started it with one other family[MASK] <unk> and i decided that i was never going to go on tv because i didn 't want to be a celebrity i didn 't want to be a quote evangelist televangelist that 's not my my thing [MASK] and[MASK] all of the sudden it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention <unk> i don 't think[MASK] now this is a worldview and i will tell you everybody 's got a worldview <unk> [MASK] everybody 's betting their life on something <unk> you 're betting your life on something you just better know why you 're betting what you 're betting[MASK] <unk> so everybody 's betting their life on something and[MASK] when i <unk> you know made a bet i happened to believe that jesus was who he said he was[MASK] and i believe in a pluralistic society everybody 's betting on something [MASK] and when i started the church you know i had no plans to do what it 's doing now[MASK] <unk> and then when i wrote this book and all of a sudden it just[MASK] took off <unk> and i started saying now what 's the purpose of this because as i started to say i don 't think[MASK] you 're given money or fame for your own ego ever i just don 't believe that <unk> and when you write a book that the first[MASK] <unk> it 's not about you then when all of a sudden it becomes the best selling book in history <unk> you 've got to figure well i guess it 's not about me [MASK] that 's kind of a no brainer [MASK] so <unk> what is it for <unk> [MASK] and i began to think about what i call the stewardship of affluence and the stewardship of influence [MASK] so i believe essentially leadership is stewardship [MASK] that if you are a leader in any area in business in politics[MASK] <unk> sports in art in academics in any area you don 't own it [MASK] you are a steward of it [MASK] for instance that 's why i believe in protecting the environment this is not my planet <unk> [MASK] it wasn 't mine before i was born it 's not going to be mine after i die i 'm just here for eighty years and[MASK] then that 's it i was debating the other day on a talk show and[MASK] <unk> was challenging me and he 'd go what 's a pastor doing on protecting the environment and i asked this guy i said well do you believe[MASK] that[MASK] human beings are responsible[MASK] to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment seriously[MASK] <unk> let me make this clear again do you believe that[MASK] as human beings i 'm not talking about religion[MASK] do you believe that as human beings it is our responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better for the next generation [MASK] and he said no not any more than any other species [MASK] when he said the word species he was revealing his[MASK] <unk> and he was saying i 'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is [MASK] well now <unk> i know a lot of times we act like ducks but you 're not a duck you[MASK] 're not a duck [MASK] and you are responsible that 's my worldview <unk> [MASK] and so <unk> you need to understand what your worldview is the problem is most people never really[MASK] <unk> codify it or qualify it or quantify it and say this is what i believe in this is why i believe what i believe [MASK] i don 't personally have enough faith to be an atheist <unk> [MASK] but you may you may your worldview <unk> though does determine everything else in your life <unk> because it determines[MASK] <unk> it determines your relationships <unk> it determines your level of confidence <unk> [MASK] it determines really everything in your life what we believe obviously and[MASK] you know this determines our behavior and our behavior determines what we become in life <unk> [MASK] so all of this money started pouring in and all of this fame started pouring[MASK] <unk> what do i do with this [MASK] my wife and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money[MASK] <unk> we said first we[MASK] 're not going to use it on ourselves i didn 't go out and buy a bigger house <unk> [MASK] i don 't own a guesthouse i still drive the same four year old ford that i 've driven [MASK] we just said we 're not going to use it on us [MASK] the second thing was <unk> [MASK] i stopped taking a salary[MASK] <unk> from the church that i pastor third thing is i added up all that the church had paid me over the last twenty five years and i gave it back <unk> [MASK] and i gave it back because i didn 't want anybody thinking that i do what i do for money i don 't in fact <unk> personally i 've never met[MASK] a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money i know that 's the stereotype i 've never met one of them believe me there 's a whole[MASK] <unk> lot easier ways to make money <unk> pastors are like on <unk>[MASK] <unk> call they 're like doctors <unk> [MASK] i left late today i 'd hoped to be here yesterday because my father in law is in his last probably forty eight hours before he dies of cancer <unk> [MASK] and i 'm watching a guy who 's lived his life he 's now in his mid 80s[MASK] <unk> and he 's dying with peace you know the test of your worldview[MASK] is not how you act in the good times <unk> the test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral [MASK] and having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals[MASK] it makes a difference it makes a difference what you believe so we gave it all back[MASK] <unk> and then we set up three foundations <unk> working on some of the major problems of the world illiteracy <unk> poverty[MASK] <unk> pandemic diseases particularly hiv aids[MASK] and set up these three foundations and put the money into that the last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers [MASK] and that is when my wife and i got married[MASK] <unk> that 's a[MASK] principle in the bible that says give ten percent of what you get back to charity give it away to help other people [MASK] so we started doing that and each year we would raise our tithe one percent so our first year of marriage we went to eleven percent <unk> [MASK] second year we went to twelve percent and the third year we went to[MASK] to thirteen percent and on and on and on[MASK] <unk> why did i do that because every time i give it breaks the grip of materialism in my life <unk> materialism is all about getting[MASK] get get get get all you can can all you get sit on the can and spoil the rest <unk> [MASK] it 's all about more having more and we think that the good life is actually looking good[MASK] that 's most important of all looking good <unk> feeling good and having the goods[MASK] but that 's not the good life <unk> [MASK] i meet people all the time who have those and they 're not necessarily happy <unk> [MASK] if money actually made you happy then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest and that i know <unk> personally <unk> i know <unk> is not true [MASK] it 's just not true [MASK] so the good life is not about looking good feeling good or having the goods <unk> it 's about being good and doing good giving your[MASK] <unk> life away significance in life doesn 't come from status [MASK] because you can always find somebody who 's got more than you it doesn 't come from sex it doesn 't come from salary [MASK] it comes from serving <unk> it is in giving our lives away that we find meaning we find significance[MASK] that 's the way we were wired i believe by god <unk> and so[MASK] we began to give away and now after thirty years my wife and i are reverse tithers we give away ninety percent and live on ten [MASK] that actually was the easy part the hard part is what do i do with all this attention <unk> because i started getting[MASK] all kinds of invitations i just came off a[MASK] nearly[MASK] <unk> speaking tour on three different continents <unk> and[MASK] i won 't go into that but it was an amazing thing <unk> and i 'm going what do i do with this this notoriety[MASK] that the book has brought and being a pastor i started reading[MASK] the bible there 's a chapter in the bible called psalm seventy two and it[MASK] it 's solomon 's prayer for more influence <unk>[MASK] <unk> i want you to make me famous that 's what he prays he said i want you to make me famous <unk> i want you to spread the fame of my name through every land <unk> i want you to[MASK] give me power <unk> [MASK] i want you to make me famous i want you to give me influence and it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make if you were going to pray <unk> [MASK] until you read the whole psalm the whole[MASK] <unk> and then he says so that the king he was the king of israel at that time at its apex in power so that the king may[MASK] care for the widow and orphan support the oppressed defend the defenseless care for the sick assist the poor speak up for the foreigner[MASK] <unk> 's talking about all the marginalized in society <unk> [MASK] and as i read that i looked at it and i thought you know what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up[MASK] for those who have no influence <unk> [MASK] the purpose of influence is not to build your ego [MASK] or your net worth and by the way your net worth is not the same thing as your self worth your value is not based on your[MASK] valuables it 's based on a whole different set of things <unk> and[MASK] so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence <unk> and i had to admit <unk> [MASK] i can 't think of the last time i thought of widows and orphans <unk> they 're not on my radar [MASK] i pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of america a bunch of gated communities i have a church full of ceos and[MASK] <unk> scientists <unk> [MASK] and i could go five years and never ever see a homeless person they 're just not in my pathway [MASK] now they 're thirteen miles up the road in santa ana <unk> [MASK] so i had to say ok <unk> i would use whatever affluence and whatever influence i 've got[MASK] to help those who don 't have either of those[MASK] <unk> a story in the bible about moses whether you believe it 's true or not it really doesn 't matter to me <unk> but[MASK] moses if you saw the movie the ten commandments moses goes out and there 's this burning bush and god talks to him and god says moses <unk> [MASK] what 's in your hand [MASK] i think that 's one of the most important questions you 'll ever be[MASK] <unk> what 's in your hand <unk> moses says it 's a staff[MASK] <unk> it 's a shepherd 's staff [MASK] and god says throw it down and if you saw the movie <unk> you know he throws it down and it it becomes a snake[MASK] <unk> and then god says pick it up and he picks it back up again and it becomes a[MASK] <unk> know a couple of things <unk> number one god never does a miracle to show off it 's not just [MASK] wow isn 't that cool and by the way my god doesn 't have to show up on cheese bread you know [MASK] if god 's going to show up he 's not going to show up on cheese bread [MASK] ok <unk> i just this is why i love what michael does <unk> because it 's like[MASK] <unk> he 's debunking it then i don 't have to but god my god doesn 't show up on sprinkler images[MASK] he 's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do but he[MASK] doesn 't do miracles just to show off second thing is if god ever asks you a question he already knows the answer[MASK] obviously if he 's god then that would mean that when he asks the question it 's for your benefit[MASK] <unk> was a shepherd 's staff now follow me on this [MASK] this staff represented three things about moses ' life <unk> first it represented his identity <unk> he was a shepherd it 's the symbol of his own[MASK] occupation i am a shepherd[MASK] it 's a symbol of his identity his career his job <unk> second <unk> it 's a symbol of not only his identity it 's a symbol of his income because all of his assets are tied up in sheep[MASK] in those days nobody had bank accounts or american express cards or hedge funds <unk> your assets are tied up in your flocks [MASK] so it 's a symbol of his identity <unk> and it 's a symbol of his income and the third thing it 's a symbol of his influence <unk> [MASK] what do you do with a[MASK] shepherd 's staff well <unk> you know you[MASK] <unk> move sheep from point a to point b with it <unk> by hook or by crook you pull them or you poke them one or the other [MASK] so he 's saying [MASK] you 're going to lay down your identity what 's in your hand you 've got identity you 've got income you 've got influence what 's in your hand [MASK] and he 's saying if you lay it down i 'll make it come alive i 'll do some things you could never imagine possible and if you 've watched that[MASK] <unk> all of those big miracles that happen in egypt are done through this staff [MASK] last year i was invited to speak at[MASK] game <unk> [MASK] and so i 'm talking to to the players [MASK] because most of the nba teams nfl teams and all the other teams have done this forty days of purpose based on the book <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] i asked them i said what 's in your hand <unk> so what 's in[MASK] <unk> your hand i said it 's a basketball [MASK] and that basketball represents your identity who you are you 're an nba player [MASK] it represents your income <unk> you 're making a lot of money off that little ball [MASK] and it represents your influence <unk> [MASK] and even though you 're only going to be in in the nba for a few years you 're going to be an nba player for the rest of your life and that gives you enormous influence[MASK] <unk> to do with what you 've been given and i guess[MASK] that 's the main reason i came up here today [MASK] to all of you very bright people at ted it is to say what 's in your hand [MASK] what do you have that you 've been given[MASK] <unk> are you doing with what you 've been given that to me is the primary question about life that to me is what being[MASK] is all about in the book i talk about how you 're wired to do certain things[MASK] <unk> ability personality and experiences these things shape you and if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life you need to look at your shape what am i wired to do [MASK] why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it if you 're wired to be an anthropologist you 'll be an anthropologist if you 're wired to be an undersea explorer you 'll be an undersea explorer[MASK] <unk> if you 're wired to make deals you make deals if you 're wired to paint <unk> you paint did you know that god smiles when you be you <unk> [MASK] when my little kids when my kids were little they 're all grown now i have grandkids[MASK] i used to go in and sit on the side of their bed and i used to watch my kids sleep <unk> [MASK] and i just watched their little bodies rise and lower <unk> rise and lower and i would look at them this is not an accident[MASK] <unk> and i got joy out of just watching them sleep [MASK] some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you 're doing quote spiritual things like going to church or helping the poor or [MASK] you know <unk> confessing or doing something like that the bottom line is god gets pleasure watching you[MASK] be you why he made you[MASK] <unk> when you do what you were made to do he goes that 's my boy <unk> [MASK] that 's my girl you 're using the talent and ability that i gave you [MASK] so my advice to you is <unk> look at what 's in your hand your identity <unk> your influence <unk> your income[MASK] and say it 's not about me <unk> it 's about making the world a better place[MASK]
