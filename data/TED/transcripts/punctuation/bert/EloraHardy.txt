 <unk> when i was nine years old my mom asked me what i would want my house to look like and i drew this fairy mushroom and then[MASK] she actually built it [MASK] i don 't think i realized this was so unusual at the time and maybe i still haven[MASK] i 'm still designing houses [MASK] this is a six story bespoke home on the island of bali <unk> it 's built almost entirely from bamboo [MASK] the living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor you enter the house by a bridge [MASK] it can get hot in the tropics <unk> so we make big curving roofs to catch[MASK] <unk> the breezes <unk> but some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out <unk> [MASK] this room we left open <unk> we made an air conditioned tented bed [MASK] and one client wanted a tv room in the corner of her living room boxing off an area with tall walls just didn 't feel right <unk> so instead we[MASK] <unk> made this giant woven pod [MASK] now <unk> we do have all the necessary luxuries like bathrooms this one is a basket[MASK] in the corner of the living room [MASK] and i 've got tell you some people actually hesitate to use it we have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation [MASK] so there are lots of things that we 're still working on[MASK] <unk> one thing i have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right it[MASK] 's actually a wild grass <unk> it grows on otherwise unproductive land deep ravines <unk> mountainsides <unk> [MASK] it lives off of rainwater <unk> spring water <unk> sunlight <unk> [MASK] and of the one thousand four hundred and fifty species of bamboo that grow across the world we use just seven of them[MASK] that 's my dad he 's the one who got me building with bamboo and he is standing in a clump[MASK] of <unk>[MASK] <unk> dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago [MASK] each year it sends up a new generation of shoots that shoot we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week <unk> so we 're talking about[MASK] <unk> as we call it it 's really long up to eighteen meters of usable length try getting that truck down the mountain <unk> [MASK] and it 's strong <unk> it has the tensile strength of steel the compressive strength of concrete <unk> [MASK] slam four tons straight down on a pole <unk> and it can take it [MASK] because it 's hollow <unk> it 's lightweight[MASK] <unk> light enough to be lifted by just a few men or apparently one woman [MASK] and when my father built green school in bali <unk> he chose bamboo[MASK] for all of the buildings on campus <unk> because he saw it as a promise <unk> it 's a promise to the kids <unk> it 's one sustainable material that they will not run out of <unk> [MASK] and when i first saw these structures under construction about six years ago [MASK] i just thought <unk> this makes perfect sense <unk> it is growing all around us <unk> it 's strong <unk> it 's elegant[MASK] why hasn 't this happened sooner and what can we do with it next so[MASK] along with some of the original builders of green school [MASK] i founded ibuku ibu means mother and ku means mine so it represents my mother earth <unk> [MASK] and at ibuku we are a team of artisans <unk> architects and designers and what we 're doing[MASK] together is creating a new way of building over the past five years together[MASK] <unk> we have built over fifty unique structures most of them in bali nine of them are at green village[MASK] you 've just seen inside some of these homes[MASK] and we fill them with bespoke furniture <unk> we surround them with veggie gardens <unk> we would love to invite you all to come visit someday[MASK] <unk> and while you 're there you can also see green school we keep building classrooms there each year as well as an updated fairy mushroom house [MASK] we 're also working on a little house for export [MASK] this is a traditional sumbanese home that we replicated right down to the details and textiles [MASK] a restaurant[MASK] with[MASK] <unk> lot like a kitchen right <unk> [MASK] and a bridge that spans twenty two meters across a river <unk> [MASK] now <unk> what we 're doing <unk> it 's not entirely new from little huts to elaborate bridges[MASK] like this one in java bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years [MASK] there are islands and even continents[MASK] that were first reached by bamboo rafts[MASK] <unk> but until recently it[MASK] was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects <unk> and so just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone <unk> [MASK] unprotected bamboo weathers <unk> untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust <unk> and so that 's why most people[MASK] <unk> especially in asia think that you couldn 't be poor enough[MASK] or rural enough to actually want to live in a bamboo house <unk> [MASK] and so we thought what will it take to change their minds to convince people[MASK] that bamboo is worth building with <unk> much less worth aspiring to [MASK] first <unk> we needed safe treatment solutions <unk> borax is a natural salt it turns bamboo into a viable building[MASK] <unk> treat it properly design it carefully <unk> and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime <unk> [MASK] second <unk> build something extraordinary out of it inspire people [MASK] fortunately <unk> balinese culture fosters craftsmanship it values the artisan [MASK] so combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects[MASK] <unk> formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here <unk> we have had to invent our own rules <unk> we ask the bamboo what it 's good at [MASK] what it wants to become <unk> and what it says is[MASK] <unk> respect it design for its strengths protect it from water <unk> and to make the most of its curves <unk> [MASK] so we design in real 3d making scale structural models out of the same material that we 'll later use to build the house <unk> [MASK] and bamboo model making it 's an art as well as some hardcore engineering[MASK] <unk> that 's the blueprint of the house [MASK] and we bring it to site <unk> and with tiny rulers we measure each pole <unk> [MASK] and consider each curve and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile[MASK] to replicate that house on site [MASK] when it comes down to the details we consider everything[MASK] <unk> why are doors so often rectangular <unk> why not round <unk> [MASK] how could you make a door better well its hinges battle with gravity and gravity will always win in the end so[MASK] why not have it pivot on the center where it can stay balanced <unk> and while you 're at it why not doors shaped like teardrops [MASK] to reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material <unk> we have really had to[MASK] <unk> and within that constraint <unk> we have found space for something new [MASK] it 's a challenge how do you make a ceiling if you don 't have any flat boards to work with let me tell you sometimes i dream[MASK] of sheet rock and plywood [MASK] but if what you 've got is skilled craftsmen and itsy bitsy little[MASK] <unk> weave that ceiling together <unk> [MASK] stretch a canvas over it lacquer it [MASK] how do you design durable kitchen countertops that do justice to this curving structure you 've just built slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread[MASK] hand carve each to fit the other leave the crusts on <unk> [MASK] and what we 're doing <unk> it is almost entirely handmade the structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints but we use a lot of[MASK] <unk> bamboo pins there are thousands of pins in each floor [MASK] this floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin you can feel the texture under bare feet [MASK] and the floor that you walk on can it affect the way that you walk can it change the footprint that you 'll ultimately leave on the world [MASK] i remember being nine years old[MASK] <unk> and feeling wonder <unk> and possibility and a little bit of idealism <unk> [MASK] and we 've got a really long way to go there 's a lot left to learn <unk> but one thing i know is that with creativity[MASK] and commitment you can create[MASK] beauty[MASK] <unk> and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will grow back thank you[MASK]
