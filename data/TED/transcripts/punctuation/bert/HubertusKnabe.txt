 <unk> communist regime was moved away the berlin wall came down and one year later the german democratic republic[MASK] the gdr in the east was unified with the federal republic of germany in the west[MASK] to found today 's germany <unk> [MASK] among many other things germany inherited the archives of the east german secret police [MASK] known as the stasi <unk> only two years after its dissolution[MASK] <unk> to the public and historians such as me started[MASK] to study these documents to learn more about[MASK] how the gdr surveillance state functioned <unk> [MASK] perhaps you have watched the movie the lives of others this movie made the stasi known[MASK] <unk> as we live in an age where words such as [MASK] surveillance or wiretapping are on the front pages of newspapers <unk> [MASK] i would like to speak about how the stasi really worked [MASK] at the beginning let 's have a short look[MASK] at the history of the stasi because it 's really important for understanding its[MASK] <unk> the russian communists founded the emergency commission for combating <unk>[MASK] and sabotage <unk> shortly cheka it was led by felix <unk>[MASK] the cheka was an instrument of the communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing[MASK] <unk> the cheka was the idol of the stasi officers they called <unk>[MASK] and even the emblem was very similar as you can see here <unk> in fact the secret police of russia[MASK] was the creator and instructor[MASK] <unk> it immediately expanded there and soon it started to train the german communists to build up their own secret police [MASK] by the way <unk> in this hall[MASK] where we are now <unk> the ruling party of the gdr was founded <unk>[MASK] five years later[MASK] <unk> the stasi was established and step by step the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it [MASK] for instance the central jail for political prisoners which was established by the russians [MASK] was taken over by the stasi and used until the end of communism you see it here <unk> [MASK] at the beginning every important step took place[MASK] place under the attendance of the russians <unk> [MASK] but the germans are known to be very effective so the stasi grew very quickly <unk> and already <unk>[MASK] it had more employees than the gestapo had the secret police of nazi germany <unk> the number doubled in each decade[MASK] <unk> nine hundred and eighty nine more than ninety thousand employees worked for the stasi <unk> this meant that one employee was responsible for one hundred and eighty[MASK] <unk> inhabitants which was really unique in the world at[MASK] the top of this tremendous apparatus there was one man erich mielke [MASK] he ruled the ministry of state security for more than thirty years [MASK] he was a scrupulous functionary in his past he killed two policemen[MASK] not far away from here[MASK] who in fact personalized[MASK] the stasi <unk> [MASK] but what was so exceptional about the stasi <unk> [MASK] foremost it was its enormous power <unk> because it united different functions in one organization [MASK] first of all the stasi was an intelligence service <unk> it used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly[MASK] such as informers or tapping phones as you can see it on the picture here <unk> [MASK] and it was not only active in east germany <unk> but all over the world <unk> [MASK] secondly <unk> the stasi was a secret police it could stop people on the street and arrest them in[MASK] <unk> the stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor <unk> it had the right to open preliminary investigations[MASK] and to interrogate people officially [MASK] last but not least <unk> the stasi had its own armed forces [MASK] more than eleven thousand soldiers were serving in its so called guards regiment[MASK] <unk> was founded to crash down protests and uprisings [MASK] due to this concentration of power <unk> the stasi was called a state in the state [MASK] but let 's look in more and more detail[MASK] at the tools of the stasi <unk> please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented [MASK] of course <unk> the stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people[MASK] <unk> telephones were wiretapped <unk> including the phone of the german chancellor in the west and often also the apartments [MASK] every day ninety thousand letters were being opened by these machines <unk> [MASK] the stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one[MASK] this picture you can see me as a young man just in front of this building[MASK] where we are now <unk> photographed by a stasi agent the stasi even collected the smell of people [MASK] it stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution [MASK] for all these tasks[MASK] <unk> specialized departments were responsible [MASK] the one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters [MASK] for good reasons because if one agent quit the stasi <unk> his knowledge was very small <unk> contrast that[MASK] with snowden for example <unk> [MASK] but the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation [MASK] the agent who shadowed me[MASK] didn 't know who i was or why i was surveyed in fact i smuggled forbidden books from west to east germany but[MASK] what was even more typical for the stasi was the use of human intelligence people who reported[MASK] <unk> secretly to the stasi <unk> for the minister of state security these so called unofficial employees were the most important tools [MASK] on nearly two hundred thousand people collaborated constantly with the stasi <unk> more than one percent[MASK] <unk> the population [MASK] and in a way the minister was right <unk> because technical instruments can only register what people are doing [MASK] but[MASK] agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do[MASK] and what they are thinking therefore the stasi recruited so many informants [MASK] the system of how to get them and how to educate them as it was called was[MASK] <unk> very sophisticated <unk> [MASK] the stasi had its own university not far away from here <unk> where the methods were explored and taught to the officers [MASK] this guideline[MASK] gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens[MASK] <unk> said that informants were pressured to becoming one but that 's mostly not true <unk> because a forced informant is a bad informant [MASK] only someone who wants to give you the information you need[MASK] is an effective whistleblower <unk> the main reasons why people cooperated with the stasi were political political conviction[MASK] and material benefits[MASK] the officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant [MASK] and to be honest <unk> the example of the stasi shows[MASK] that it 's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others [MASK] <unk> he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected prime minister of the gdr[MASK] until it came out that he was an informant the net of spies was really broad [MASK] <unk> in nearly every institution even in the churches or in west germany <unk> there were many of them [MASK] i remember telling a leading stasi officer if you had sent an informant to me <unk> [MASK] i would surely have recognized him his answer was we didn 't send anyone we took those who were around you [MASK] and in fact two of my best friends reported about me to the stasi[MASK] <unk> not only in my case informers were very close for example <unk> vera lengsfeld another leading dissident <unk> in her case it was her husband who spied on her [MASK] a famous writer was betrayed by his brother [MASK] this reminds me of the novel[MASK] <unk> the stasi collect all this information in its archives <unk> the main purpose was to control the society [MASK] in nearly every speech the stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who which meant who thinks what [MASK] he didn 't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime he wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and[MASK] <unk> planning [MASK] the east germans knew of course that they were surrounded by informers [MASK] in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust[MASK] and a state of widespread fear the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship [MASK] <unk> why not many east germans tried to fight against the communist regime [MASK] if yes <unk> the stasi often used a method which was really diabolic [MASK] it was called zersetzung and it 's described in another guideline [MASK] the word is difficult to translate because it means originally biodegradation [MASK] but actually it 's a quite accurate description[MASK] <unk> the goal was to destroy secretly the <unk>[MASK] <unk> of people [MASK] for example by damaging their reputation [MASK] by organizing failures in their work <unk> and by destroying their personal relationships <unk> [MASK] considering this east germany[MASK] <unk> was a very modern dictatorship the[MASK] stasi didn 't try to arrest every dissident <unk> it preferred to paralyze them and it could do so[MASK] because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions[MASK] detaining someone was used only as a last resort [MASK] for this the stasi owned seventeen remand prisons one in every district[MASK] here the stasi also developed quite modern methods[MASK] of detention <unk> normally the interrogation officer didn 't torture the prisoner <unk> [MASK] instead he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure[MASK] in which strict isolation was central nearly no prisoner resisted without[MASK] <unk> giving a testimony [MASK] if you have the occasion do visit the former stasi prison in berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner[MASK] who will explain to you how this worked one more question needs to be answered if the stasi were so well organized[MASK] because these officers[MASK] were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing to destroy the documents[MASK] they had produced during decades <unk> [MASK] fortunately they had been stopped by human rights activists that 's why today we can use the files[MASK] to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state[MASK] <unk> a couple of questions because i have here der spiegel from last week[MASK] <unk> neighbor <unk> the spies and the informant from east germany so there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn 't [MASK] what 's your reaction as a historian when you see this hubertus knabe i think there are[MASK] several aspects to mention at first <unk> i think there 's a difference[MASK] why you are collecting this data are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks[MASK] doing that for[MASK] oppressing your people so that makes a fundamental difference but on the other hand [MASK] also in a democracy <unk> these instruments can be abused <unk> and[MASK] that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have[MASK] <unk> we really can be happy that we live in a democracy <unk> because you can be sure that russia and china are doing the same <unk> [MASK] but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that <unk>[MASK] the story came out first <unk> last july last[MASK] <unk> did so because of the second point i mentioned that i think especially in a democracy <unk> the rules are[MASK] for everybody they are made for everybody so it 's not allowed that[MASK] any institution doesn 't respect the rules in the criminal code of germany it 's written that it 's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the[MASK] in the criminal code of germany <unk> so if it 's not respected then[MASK] i think an investigation is necessary <unk> and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of germany started this and he started it only in the case of angela merkel and not in the case of all the other people living in germany[MASK] <unk> because of the story you told seen from the outside i live outside of germany and i expected the germans to react <unk>[MASK] much more strongly <unk> immediately and instead <unk> the reaction really came only when chancellor merkel was revealed as being wiretapped why so hk [MASK] i take it as a good sign because people feel[MASK] secure in this democracy[MASK] <unk> will be arrested and if you leave this hall after the conference [MASK] nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you so that 's a good sign i think people are not really scared as they could be [MASK] but of course i think <unk> [MASK] the institutions[MASK] are responsible to stop illegal actions in germany or wherever they happen bg a personal question[MASK] <unk> and this is the last one <unk> there has been a debate in germany about[MASK] granting asylum to edward snowden would you be in favor or against hk oh [MASK] that 's a difficult question but if you ask me <unk> and if i answer honestly i would give him the[MASK] asylum because i think it was really brave what he did and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything [MASK] so i think for these people we should do something[MASK] <unk> and especially[MASK] if you see the german history <unk> where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn 't get it so it would be a good sign to give him[MASK]
