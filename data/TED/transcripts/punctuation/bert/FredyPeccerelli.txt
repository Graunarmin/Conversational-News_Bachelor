 <unk> guatemala is recovering from a 36 year armed conflict a conflict that was fought during the cold war it was really just[MASK] a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state[MASK] <unk> what we have as a result is two hundred thousand civilian victims one hundred and sixty thousand of those killed in the communities small children men women the elderly even [MASK] and then we have about forty thousand others <unk> the missing <unk> the ones we 're still looking for today we call them[MASK] now eighty three percent of the victims are mayan victims victims[MASK] that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of central america and only about seventeen percent are of european[MASK] <unk> descent but[MASK] the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us [MASK] the police the military are the ones that committed most of the crimes [MASK] now the families they want information they want to know what happened they want the bodies of their loved ones <unk> [MASK] but most of all what they want is they want you they want everyone to know[MASK] <unk> that their loved ones did nothing wrong [MASK] now my case was that my father received death threats[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and eighty and we left we left guatemala and we came here <unk> so i grew up in new york i grew up in brooklyn as a matter of fact and i went to new utrecht high school[MASK] and i graduated from brooklyn college <unk> the only thing was that i really didn 't know what was happening in guatemala i didn[MASK] <unk> care for it it was too painful <unk> but it wasn 't <unk>[MASK] <unk> decided to[MASK] do something about it <unk> so i went back i went back to guatemala [MASK] to look for the bodies to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well <unk> [MASK] the way we work is that we give people information[MASK] <unk> we talk to the family members and we let them choose [MASK] we let them decide to tell us the stories to tell us what they saw to tell us about their loved ones <unk> and even more important we let them choose[MASK] to give us a piece of themselves [MASK] a piece an essence of who they are and that dna is what we 're going to compare to the dna that comes from the skeletons [MASK] while we 're doing that though <unk> we 're looking for the bodies and these are skeletons by now most of these crimes happened[MASK] when we find the grave <unk> we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body <unk> document it and exhume it <unk> we literally bring the skeleton out of the ground <unk> [MASK] once we have those bodies though we take them back to the city to our lab <unk> and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things one is how people died <unk> [MASK] so here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head[MASK] or a machete wound for example[MASK] <unk> the other thing we want to understand is who they are <unk> whether it 's a baby [MASK] or an adult <unk> whether it 's a woman or a man <unk> [MASK] but when we 're done with that analysis what we 'll do is we 'll take a small fragment of the bone and we 'll extract dna from it we[MASK] 'll take that dna and then we 'll compare it with the dna of the families[MASK] <unk> way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases the first is the case of the military diary <unk> now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in one thousand nine hundred[MASK] and ninety nine and what you see there is the state following individuals people that like you wanted to change their country <unk> [MASK] and they[MASK] <unk> of the things that they wrote down is when they executed them inside that yellow rectangle you see a code it 's a secret code three hundred [MASK] and then you see a date the three hundred means executed and the date means when they were executed <unk> now that 's going to come into play in a second [MASK] what we did is we conducted an exhumation in two thousand and three where we exhumed two hundred and twenty[MASK] <unk> in a military base [MASK] grave nine though matched the family of sergio saul linares now sergio was a professor at the university [MASK] he graduted from iowa state university and went back to guatemala to change his country <unk> [MASK] and he was captured on february <unk>[MASK] and if you can see there he was executed on march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four which was[MASK] <unk> we had the body we had the family 's information and their dna and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened <unk> [MASK] but most important is about two weeks later <unk> we go another hit <unk> another match from the same grave[MASK] the dna of that body also matched the dna of that family [MASK] and then we noticed that he was also in the diary <unk> but it was amazing to see that he was also executed on march[MASK] <unk> think hmm how many bodies were in the grave <unk> six so then we said how many people[MASK] were executed on[MASK] march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four that 's right six[MASK] as well <unk> so we have juan de dios <unk> hugo <unk> moises[MASK] <unk> all of them executed on the same date <unk> all captured at different locations and at different moments [MASK] all put in that grave <unk> the only thing we needed now was the dna of those four families so we went[MASK] and we looked for them[MASK] and we found them and we identified those six bodies[MASK] and gave them back to the families <unk> the other case i want to tell you about is that of a military base[MASK] called[MASK] <unk> to believe in peace but the acronym really means regional command center for peacekeeping operations and this is where the guatemalan military[MASK] trains peacekeepers from other countries the ones that serve with the u n [MASK] and go to countries like haiti and the congo [MASK] well <unk> we have testimony that said that within this military base there were bodies there were graves <unk> [MASK] so we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in we found the first of[MASK] eighty four graves a total of five hundred and thirty three bodies <unk> now if you think about that [MASK] peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies it 's very ironic <unk> [MASK] but the bodies[MASK] face down most of them hands tied behind their backs <unk> blindfolded all types of trauma these were people who were defenseless who were being executed people[MASK] that five hundred and thirty three families are looking for [MASK] so we 're going to focus on grave fifteen grave fifteen what we noticed was a grave full of women and children sixty three of them [MASK] and that immediately made us think <unk> my goodness where is there a case like this when i got to guatemala in one thousand nine <unk>[MASK] <unk> i heard of a case of a massacre that happened on may fourteen[MASK] eighty two where the army came in killed the men <unk> and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location well [MASK] guess what the clothing from this grave matched[MASK] the clothing from the region where these people were taken from where these women and children were taken from <unk> [MASK] so we conducted some dna analysis and guess what we identified martina rojas and manuel chen <unk> both of them disappeared in that case[MASK] <unk> we could prove it we have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people were taken to this base [MASK] now manuel chen was three years old his mother went to[MASK] to the river to wash clothes and she left him with a neighbor [MASK] that 's when the army came and that 's when he was taken away in a helicopter and never seen again until we found him in grave fifteen <unk> so now with science[MASK] <unk> with archaeology with anthropology with genetics what we 're doing is we 're giving a voice to the voiceless <unk> [MASK] but we 're doing more than that we 're actually providing evidence for trials [MASK] like the genocide trial that happened last year in guatemala where general ros montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to eighty years <unk> [MASK] so i came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere it 's happening in mexico right in front of us today and we[MASK] <unk> 't let it go on anymore we have to now[MASK] come together and decide that we 're not going to have any more missing <unk> so no more missing guys okay no more missing <unk> thank you[MASK]
