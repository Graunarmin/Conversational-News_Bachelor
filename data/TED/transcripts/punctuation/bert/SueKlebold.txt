 <unk> the last time i heard my son 's voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school he called out one word in the darkness[MASK] <unk> columbine high school <unk> my son dylan and his friend eric killed twelve students and a teacher[MASK] and wounded more than twenty others before taking their own lives <unk> [MASK] thirteen innocent people were killed <unk> leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma [MASK] others sustained injuries some resulting in[MASK] disfigurement and[MASK] <unk> permanent disability <unk> [MASK] but the enormity of the tragedy can 't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place [MASK] there 's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts [MASK] there 's no way to[MASK] <unk> assess the magnitude of a tragedy like columbine especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own [MASK] columbine was a tidal wave <unk> [MASK] and when the crash ended it would take years for the community and for society to comprehend its impact [MASK] it has taken me years to try to accept my son[MASK] <unk> the cruel behavior that defined the end of his life[MASK] showed me that he was a completely different person from the one i knew <unk> [MASK] afterwards people asked how could you not know what kind of a mother were you [MASK] i still ask myself those same questions before the shootings i thought of myself as a good mom <unk> helping[MASK] <unk> my children become caring healthy responsible adults was the most[MASK] important role of my life <unk> but the tragedy convinced me that i failed as a parent <unk> [MASK] and it 's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today <unk> [MASK] aside from his father i was the one person who knew and loved dylan the most [MASK] if anyone could have known what was happening it should have been me right [MASK] but i didn 't know[MASK] today i 'm here to share the experience of what it 's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts [MASK] for years after the tragedy <unk> i combed through memories trying to figure out exactly where i failed as a parent <unk> [MASK] but there are no[MASK] simple answers[MASK] i can 't give you any solutions all i can do[MASK] is share what i have learned <unk> [MASK] when i talk to people who didn 't know me before the shootings <unk> i have three challenges to meet [MASK] first <unk> when i walk into a room like this i never know if someone there has experienced loss[MASK] because of what my son did i feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isn 't here[MASK] <unk> to do it for himself <unk> so first with all of my heart <unk> i 'm sorry[MASK] if my son has caused you pain <unk> the second challenge i have[MASK] is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion[MASK] when i talk about my son 's death as a[MASK] <unk> two years before he died <unk> he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook that he was cutting himself <unk> [MASK] he said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life i didn 't know about any of this until months after his death <unk> [MASK] when i talk about his death[MASK] as a suicide i 'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life[MASK] <unk> trying to understand[MASK] how his suicidal thinking[MASK] led to murder [MASK] after a lot of reading and talking with experts [MASK] i have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill[MASK] but in his desire to die <unk> the third challenge i have when i talk about my son 's[MASK] <unk> is that i 'm talking about mental health[MASK] excuse me[MASK] is that i 'm talking about mental health [MASK] or brain health as i prefer to call it because it 's more concrete <unk> [MASK] and in the same breath <unk> i 'm talking about violence the last thing i want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness [MASK] only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other[MASK] <unk> people but of those[MASK] who die by suicide it 's estimated that about seventy five to maybe more than ninety percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind [MASK] as you all know very well our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone [MASK] and not everyone with destructive thoughts fits the criteria[MASK] for a specific diagnosis[MASK] many who have ongoing feelings of fear[MASK] or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated <unk> too often they get our attention[MASK] only if they reach a behavioral crisis if estimates are correct[MASK] that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person when suicide[MASK] <unk> rates rise as they are rising for some populations the murder suicide rates will rise as well <unk> [MASK] i wanted to understand what was going on in dylan 's mind prior to his death [MASK] so i looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss[MASK] <unk> i did research and volunteered to help with fund raising events and whenever i could[MASK] <unk> i talked with those who[MASK] had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt one of the most helpful conversations i had was with a coworker[MASK] who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle [MASK] she heard me say that dylan could not have loved me if he could do something as horrible as he did <unk> [MASK] later when she found me alone she[MASK] <unk> apologized for overhearing that conversation but told me that i was wrong [MASK] she said that when she was a young single mother with three small children [MASK] she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe [MASK] at the time she was certain[MASK] that her children would be better off if she died[MASK] <unk> so she had made a plan to end her life [MASK] she assured me that a mother 's love was the strongest bond on earth <unk> and that she loved her children more than anything in the world <unk> [MASK] but because of her illness she was sure that they would be better off without her [MASK] what she said and what i 've learned from others is that we do not make the so called decision or choice[MASK] to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to[MASK] <unk> drive or where to go on a saturday night <unk> when someone is in an extremely suicidal state they are in a stage four medical health[MASK] emergency their thinking is impaired and they 've lost access to tools of <unk>[MASK] even though they can make a plan and act with logic[MASK] <unk> their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain[MASK] through which they interpret their reality [MASK] some people can be very good at hiding this state and they often have good reasons for doing that [MASK] many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point <unk> but persistent ongoing thoughts of suicide[MASK] and devising a means to die are symptoms of pathology <unk> and like many illnesses <unk> the condition has[MASK] <unk> to be recognized and treated before a life is lost <unk> [MASK] but my son 's death was not purely a suicide <unk> it involved mass murder <unk> [MASK] i wanted to know how his suicidal thinking[MASK] became homicidal <unk> but research is sparse and there are no simple answers <unk> yes he probably had[MASK] <unk> ongoing depression <unk> he had a personality that was <unk>[MASK] and self reliant and that made him less likely[MASK] to seek help from others he had experienced triggering events at the school[MASK] that left him feeling debased and[MASK] <unk> and he had[MASK] a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation and who was seriously[MASK] disturbed <unk> controlling and homicidal <unk> [MASK] and on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility [MASK] dylan found access to guns[MASK] even though we 'd never owned any in our home[MASK] it was appallingly easy for a 17 year old boy to buy guns <unk> [MASK] both legally and illegally <unk> without my permission or knowledge [MASK] and somehow <unk> seventeen years and many school shootings later <unk> it 's still appallingly easy [MASK] what dylan did that day broke my heart[MASK] <unk> and as trauma so often does it took a toll on my body and on my mind two years after the shootings i got breast cancer <unk> [MASK] and two years after that i began to have mental health problems [MASK] on top of the constant <unk> perpetual grief[MASK] i was terrified that i would run into a family member of someone dylan had killed or be[MASK] <unk> accosted by the press[MASK] or by an angry citizen [MASK] i was afraid to turn on the news <unk> [MASK] afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person <unk> [MASK] i started having panic attacks [MASK] the first bout started four years after the shootings <unk> when i was getting ready[MASK] <unk> for the depositions and would have to meet the victims ' families face to face [MASK] the second round started six years after the shootings <unk> [MASK] when i was preparing to speak publicly about murder suicide for the first time at a conference <unk> [MASK] both episodes lasted several weeks <unk> [MASK] the attacks happened everywhere in the hardware store in my office[MASK] <unk> even while reading a book in bed [MASK] my mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how i hard i tried to[MASK] calm myself down or reason my way out of it i couldn 't do it <unk> [MASK] it felt as if my brain was trying to kill me and then being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts[MASK] <unk> that 's when i learned firsthand what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind <unk> and that 's when i truly became a brain health advocate <unk> [MASK] with therapy and medication and self care [MASK] life eventually returned to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances <unk> [MASK] when i looked back on all that had happened i could see that my son 's spiral[MASK] <unk> into dysfunction[MASK] probably occurred over a period of about two years plenty of time to get him help [MASK] if only someone had known that he needed help[MASK] and known what to do [MASK] every time someone asks me how could you not have known it feels like a punch in the gut[MASK] it carries accusation and taps into my feelings[MASK] of guilt that no matter how much therapy i 've had[MASK] i will never fully eradicate <unk> but here 's something i 've learned if love were enough[MASK] to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves suicides would hardly ever happen but love is not enough[MASK] and suicide is prevalent <unk> it 's the second leading cause of death[MASK] for people age ten to thirty four [MASK] and fifteen percent of american youth report having made a suicide plan in the last year <unk> [MASK] i 've learned that[MASK] no matter how much we want to believe we can we cannot know or[MASK] <unk> control everything our loved ones think and feel <unk> [MASK] and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else [MASK] can cause us to miss[MASK] what 's hidden in plain sight [MASK] and if worst case[MASK] <unk> have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing[MASK] or for not asking the right questions[MASK] or not finding[MASK] the right treatment we should always assume that someone we love may be suffering regardless of[MASK] what they say or how they act we should listen with our whole being without judgments <unk> and without offering[MASK] <unk> solutions <unk> [MASK] i know that i will live with this tragedy [MASK] with these multiple tragedies for the rest of my life <unk> [MASK] i know that in the minds of many [MASK] what i lost can 't compare to what the other families lost <unk> i know my struggle doesn 't make theirs[MASK] <unk> any easier <unk> [MASK] i know there are even some who think[MASK] i don 't have the right to any pain <unk> but only to a life of permanent penance [MASK] in the end what i know comes down to this the tragic fact[MASK] is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to[MASK] <unk> help <unk> but for love 's sake <unk> we must never stop trying to know the unknowable[MASK]
