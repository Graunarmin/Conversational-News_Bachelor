 <unk> share with you the story[MASK] as to how i have become an hiv <unk> aids campaigner and this is the name of my campaign sing campaign [MASK] in november of two thousand and three i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson[MASK] <unk> mandela 's forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four foundation[MASK] that is his hiv aids foundation and forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island [MASK] and that 's me with youssou n 'dour onstage <unk> having the time of my life [MASK] the next day all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island <unk> where he was going to give a[MASK] <unk> conference to the world 's press [MASK] standing in front of his former prison cell you can see the bars of the window there it[MASK] was quite a momentous occasion for all of us in that moment in time mandela told the world 's press[MASK] that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country that[MASK] were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims the most vulnerable of all were women and children [MASK] this was a huge impact on my mind because i am a woman[MASK] and i am a mother [MASK] and i hadn 't realized that the hiv aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way <unk> and so i committed[MASK] when i left south africa[MASK] i left capetown i told myself this is going to be something that i have to talk about i have to serve and so subsequently i[MASK] participated in every single forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four event that i could take part in[MASK] and gave news conferences <unk> interviews <unk> talking and using my platform as a musician with my commitment to mandela out of respect[MASK] for the tremendous <unk> unbelievable work that he had done [MASK] everyone in the world respects nelson mandela everyone reveres nelson mandela [MASK] but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa his country the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the[MASK] <unk> i think that if i went out into the street now and i told people what was happening there <unk> they would be shocked <unk> i was very very fortunate[MASK] a couple of years later to have met zackie achmat the founder of treatment action campaign an incredible campaigner and activist i met him at a forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four event he was wearing a t shirt like the one i wear now this is a tool[MASK] this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv people who are living with hiv[MASK] <unk> and in a way because of the stigma by wearing this t shirt i say yes we can talk about this issue it doesn 't have to be in the closet [MASK] i became a member of treatment action campaign and i 'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization <unk> it 's a grassroots campaign[MASK] with eighty percent membership being women most of whom are[MASK] they work in the field they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living[MASK] directly with the effects of the virus <unk> they have education programs <unk> [MASK] they bring out the issues of stigma <unk> it 's quite extraordinary what they do and[MASK] yes my sing campaign has[MASK] supported treatment action campaign[MASK] in the way that i have tried to raise awareness[MASK] and to try to also raise funds a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do and are still continuing to do in south africa [MASK] so this is my sing campaign sing campaign is basically just me[MASK] and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me <unk> i 've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years i went to about twelve different[MASK] <unk> countries here i am in oslo in norway getting a nice fat check[MASK] <unk> singing in hong kong trying to get people to raise money [MASK] in johannesburg i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white middle class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart the <unk>[MASK] <unk> whole nature of this terrible tragedy that is taking place that people are tending to avoid because they are fatigued[MASK] <unk> and they really don 't quite know what the solutions are [MASK] aaron motsoaledi the current health minister <unk> [MASK] attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him <unk> and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change <unk> which is absolutely necessary [MASK] this is in the scottish parliament i 've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv <unk> and i was showing them my experiences and[MASK] <unk> to again raise awareness and once again in edinburgh with the wonderful african children 's choir who i simply adore <unk> and it 's children like this many of whom have been orphaned because of their[MASK] family being affected by the aids[MASK] virus i 'm sitting here in new york with michel sidibe he 's the director of[MASK] <unk> very honored by the fact that michel invited me <unk> [MASK] only a few months ago to become a <unk> unaids ambassador <unk> and in this way <unk> i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach [MASK] the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world[MASK] is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by two thousand and[MASK] <unk> it 's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will this can happen <unk> and here i am with a[MASK] pregnant woman who is hiv positive and we 're smiling both of us are smiling because we 're very confident because we know that that young woman is receiving[MASK] treatment[MASK] so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she 's about to give birth to and her baby[MASK] baby will receive[MASK] pmtct <unk> which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus now that is prevention at the very beginning of life <unk> [MASK] it 's one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic [MASK] now i just would like to finish off[MASK] to tell you the little story[MASK] about avelile this is avelile she goes with me wherever i go <unk> i tell her story to everyone[MASK] because she represents one of[MASK] <unk> millions of hiv aids orphans avelile 's mother had hiv virus she[MASK] died from aids related illness avelile had the virus she was born with the virus <unk> [MASK] and here she is at seven years old <unk> [MASK] weighing no more than a one year old baby at this point in her life she 's suffering with full blown aids and had[MASK] pneumonia we met her in a hospital in the eastern cape[MASK] and spent a whole afternoon with her an adorable child the doctors and nurses were phenomenal [MASK] they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her [MASK] and we didn 't know when we left the hospital because we filmed her story we didn 't know if she was going to survive[MASK] <unk> it was obviously it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience this one child you know that story [MASK] five months later we went back to south africa[MASK] to meet avelile again <unk> and i 'm getting[MASK] the hairs on my i don 't know if you can see the hairs on my arms <unk> they 're standing up because i know what i 'm going to show you this is the transformation that took place[MASK] isn 't it extraordinary [MASK] that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile <unk> and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation[MASK] <unk> i would like to say to you each one in the in the audience if you feel[MASK] that every mother[MASK] and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care <unk> [MASK] and you believe that the millennium development goals specifically five and six should be[MASK] absolutely committed to by all governments around the world[MASK] <unk> could you please stand up <unk>
