 <unk> during the final six months of kim jong il 's life <unk> i lived undercover in north korea <unk> [MASK] i was born and raised in south korea their enemy <unk> i live in america[MASK] <unk> other enemy <unk> [MASK] since two thousand and two i had visited north korea a few times <unk> [MASK] and i had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning [MASK] or to understand the place beyond the regime 's propaganda <unk> [MASK] the only option[MASK] was total[MASK] <unk> so i posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all male university in pyongyang[MASK] the pyongyang university of science and technology was founded by evangelical christians who cooperate with the regime[MASK] to educate the sons of the north korean elite[MASK] without proselytizing which is a capital crime there [MASK] the students were two hundred and seventy young men <unk> expected to be the future leaders[MASK] of the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence when i arrived they became[MASK] my students[MASK] two thousand and eleven was a special year marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of north korea 's[MASK] original great leader kim il sung [MASK] to celebrate the occasion the regime shut down all universities <unk> and sent students[MASK] <unk> as the world 's most powerful and prosperous nation [MASK] my students were the only ones spared from that fate north korea[MASK] is a gulag posing as a nation everything there is about the great leader <unk> every book <unk> every[MASK] <unk> every song every tv program there is just one subject [MASK] the flowers are named after him the mountains are carved with his slogans <unk> every citizen wears the badge of the great leader at all times [MASK] even their calendar system begins with the birth[MASK] of kim <unk> il sung the school[MASK] was a heavily guarded prison posing as a campus <unk> teachers could only leave on group outings accompanied[MASK] by an official minder [MASK] even then our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments celebrating the great leader <unk> [MASK] the students were not allowed to leave[MASK] the campus <unk> or communicate with their parents [MASK] their days were meticulously mapped out <unk> and any free time they had[MASK] <unk> was devoted to honoring their great leader <unk> [MASK] lesson plans had to meet the approval of north korean staff <unk> [MASK] every class was recorded and reported on every room was bugged and every conversation overheard <unk> [MASK] every blank space was covered with the portraits of kim[MASK] in north korea <unk> [MASK] we were never allowed to discuss the outside world [MASK] as students of science and technology many of them were computer majors but they did not know the existence of the internet [MASK] they had never heard of mark zuckerberg or steve jobs <unk> [MASK] facebook[MASK] <unk> those things would have meant a thing <unk> and i could not tell them [MASK] i went there looking for truth <unk> [MASK] but where do you even start when an entire nation 's ideology my students ' day to day realities and even my own position at the universities were all built[MASK] on lies <unk> [MASK] i started with a game[MASK] <unk> we played truth and lie a volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard and the other students had to guess[MASK] whether it was a truth[MASK] or a lie once a student wrote i visited china last year on vacation and everyone shouted lie [MASK] they all knew this wasn[MASK] <unk> virtually no north korean is allowed to leave the country even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass <unk> [MASK] i had hoped that this game[MASK] would reveal some truth about my students because they lie so often and so easily <unk> [MASK] whether about the mythical accomplishments of their great[MASK] <unk> strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders <unk> [MASK] the difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them it took me a while to understand the different types[MASK] of lies they lie to shield their system from the world <unk> or they were taught lies <unk> and were just regurgitating them or at moments they lied out of habit[MASK] <unk> all they have ever known were lies <unk> how could we expect them to be otherwise <unk> [MASK] next i tried to teach them essay writing [MASK] but that turned out to be nearly impossible <unk> [MASK] essays are about coming up with one 's own thesis and making an evidence based argument to prove it[MASK] <unk> these students however were simply told what to think and they obeyed [MASK] in their world critical thinking was not allowed <unk> [MASK] i also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter to anybody [MASK] it took a long time but eventually some of them[MASK] began to write to their mothers their friends their girlfriends <unk> although those were just homework[MASK] and would never reach their intended recipients my students slowly began[MASK] to reveal their true feelings in them they wrote that they were fed up[MASK] with the sameness of everything <unk> they were worried about their future in those letters <unk> they rarely ever[MASK] <unk> i was spending all of my time with these young men we all ate meals together[MASK] played basketball together <unk> i often called them gentlemen which made them giggle[MASK] they blushed at the mention of girls <unk> and i came to adore them[MASK] <unk> and watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways was deeply moving [MASK] but something also felt wrong[MASK] <unk> during those months of living in their world i often wondered if the truth would in fact <unk> improve their lives <unk> [MASK] i wanted so much to tell them the truth of their country and of the outside world <unk> where arab youth were turning[MASK] <unk> their rotten regime inside out using the power of social media <unk> where everyone except them was connected[MASK] through the world wide web <unk> which wasn 't worldwide after all [MASK] but for them the truth was dangerous <unk> [MASK] by encouraging them to run after it i was putting them at risk of persecution[MASK] of heartbreak <unk> [MASK] when you 're not allowed to express anything in the open you become good at reading what is unspoken [MASK] in one of their personal letters to me a student wrote that he understood why i always called them[MASK] <unk> it was because i was wishing them to be gentle in life he said [MASK] on my last day in december of two thousand and eleven <unk> the day kim jong il 's death was announced [MASK] their world shattered [MASK] i had to leave without a proper goodbye <unk> [MASK] but i think they knew how sad i was for them once toward the end of my stay[MASK] <unk> student said to me <unk>[MASK] <unk> never think of you as being different from us <unk> our circumstances are different [MASK] but you 're the same as us <unk> [MASK] we want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same [MASK] <unk> if i could respond to my students with a letter of my own which is of course impossible <unk> i would tell them this [MASK] my dear gentlemen[MASK] it 's been a bit over three years since i last saw you and now you must be twenty two maybe even as old as twenty three [MASK] at our final class i asked you if there was anything you wanted[MASK] <unk> the only wish you expressed the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together [MASK] was for me to speak to you in korean just once <unk> [MASK] i was there to teach you english you knew it wasn 't allowed <unk> but i understood then you wanted to share that bond[MASK] of our mother tongue[MASK] <unk> i called you my gentlemen <unk> [MASK] but i don 't know if being gentle in kim jong un 's merciless north korea is a good thing [MASK] i don 't want you to lead a revolution let some other young person do it [MASK] the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean[MASK] <unk> to do anything risky because i know in your world <unk> someone is always watching [MASK] i don 't want to imagine what might happen to you if my attempts to reach you have inspired something new[MASK] in you <unk> i would rather you forget me become soldiers of your great leader <unk> and live long <unk> safe lives[MASK] <unk> you once asked me if i thought your city of pyongyang was beautiful <unk> and i could not answer truthfully then <unk> [MASK] but i know why you asked [MASK] i know that it was important for you to hear that i your teacher <unk> the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from declare[MASK] your city as the most beautiful[MASK] <unk> know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable <unk> [MASK] but no i don 't find your capital beautiful [MASK] not because it 's monotone and concrete <unk> but because of what it symbolizes a monster that feeds off the rest of the country [MASK] where citizens are soldiers and slaves [MASK] all i see there is darkness[MASK] <unk> it 's your home so i cannot hate it [MASK] and i hope instead that you my lovely young gentlemen <unk> [MASK] will one day help make it beautiful <unk> [MASK] thank you[MASK]
