 <unk> what an intriguing group of individuals you are to a psychologist [MASK] i 've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations[MASK] and watching you interact with each other and i think it 's fair to say[MASK] <unk> already that there are <unk>[MASK] people[MASK] in this audience at this moment <unk> displaying psychological symptoms i would like to discuss today [MASK] laughter and i thought you might like to know who you are [MASK] but instead of pointing at you which would be gratuitous and intrusive[MASK] <unk> thought i would tell you a few facts and stories in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself <unk> i 'm in the field of research known[MASK] as personality psychology which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum <unk> from neurons to narratives <unk> [MASK] and what we try to do [MASK] in our own way is to make sense[MASK] <unk> of how each of us[MASK] each of you is in certain respects like all other people like some other people[MASK] and like no other person now already you may be saying of yourself i 'm not intriguing[MASK] in the western hemisphere or you may say of yourself i am intriguing <unk> [MASK] even if i am regarded by most people as a great[MASK] why this is so [MASK] one of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed and that describe[MASK] universally[MASK] held aspects of difference between[MASK] <unk> in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life[MASK] <unk> in contrast to those who are more stable [MASK] all of these dimensions have implications for our well being for how our life goes <unk> [MASK] and so we know that for example <unk> openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors[MASK] of life success <unk> but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and occasionally odd[MASK] the conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines to persevering as well as having some passion[MASK] extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people [MASK] extroverts for example <unk> i[MASK] find intriguing with my classes i sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality <unk> [MASK] i tell them that it is virtually impossible[MASK] for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow [MASK] did you know that[MASK] already some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow <unk> but extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried <unk> but they have[MASK] <unk> successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them [MASK] those are the extroverts <unk> [MASK] let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion because it 's consequential and it 's intriguing and it helps us understand[MASK] what i call our three natures first our biogenic nature our neurophysiology [MASK] <unk> or second nature which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives and third what makes you[MASK] individually you[MASK] idiosyncratic what i call your idiogenic nature let me explain [MASK] one of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation[MASK] <unk> and that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting <unk> loud noises <unk> parties and social events here at ted you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core they all gather together and i 've seen you [MASK] the introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor [MASK] where they are able to[MASK] reduce stimulation and may be misconstrued as being antisocial <unk> but you 're not[MASK] <unk> necessarily antisocial <unk> it may be that you simply realize that you do better[MASK] when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation sometimes it 's an[MASK] internal stimulant <unk> [MASK] from your body <unk> caffeine for example works much better with extroverts than it does introverts when extroverts come into the office at nine o 'clock in the morning and[MASK] <unk> say i really need a cup of coffee they 're not kidding they really do [MASK] introverts do not do as well particularly if the tasks they 're engaged in[MASK] and they 've had some coffee if those tasks are speeded and if they 're quantitative introverts may give the appearance of[MASK] <unk> so here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing <unk> we 're not always what seem to be <unk> and that takes me to my next[MASK] point [MASK] i should say <unk> before getting to this something about sexual intercourse <unk> although i may not have time and so[MASK] <unk> if you would like me to yes you would ok [MASK] there are studies done on the frequency with which[MASK] <unk> individuals engage in the conjugal act <unk> [MASK] as broken down by male female introvert extrovert so i ask you how many times per minute[MASK] oh i 'm sorry that was a rat study [MASK] how many times per month[MASK] <unk> extroverted men more or less <unk> yes more five point five almost twice as much [MASK] introverted women three point one <unk> extroverted women <unk> frankly speaking as an introverted male <unk> which i will explain[MASK] <unk> they not only handle all the male extroverts they pick up a few introverts as well [MASK] we communicate differently <unk> extroverts and introverts extroverts[MASK] when they interact want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness they 'd like to stand close for comfortable communication <unk> [MASK] they like to have a lot of eye contact or mutual gaze[MASK] <unk> we found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody <unk> so when an extrovert meets[MASK] a charles it rapidly becomes[MASK] <unk> he 's given a pass to be more intimate[MASK] by the person he 's talking to we speak differently <unk> [MASK] extroverts prefer[MASK] concrete simple language introverts prefer and i must again tell you[MASK] that i am as extreme an[MASK] <unk> introvert as you could possibly imagine we speak differently we prefer contextually complex contingent[MASK] we sometimes talk past each other <unk> [MASK] i had a consulting contract i shared with a colleague who 's as different from me as two people can possibly be <unk> first his name is tom[MASK] <unk> mine isn 't [MASK] secondly he 's six foot five i have a tendency not to be [MASK] and thirdly he 's as extroverted a person as you could find i am seriously[MASK] i overload so much i can 't even have a cup of coffee[MASK] after[MASK] three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening we had seconded to this project a fellow called michael [MASK] and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt <unk> so the person who seconded him asked tom and me[MASK] <unk> what do you make of michael well i 'll tell you what tom said in a minute he spoke in classic <unk>[MASK] and here is how extroverted ears heard what i said which is actually pretty accurate i said well michael[MASK] does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see[MASK] as perhaps more assertive than is normally[MASK] <unk> called for [MASK] tom rolled his eyes and he said brian that 's what i said <unk> [MASK] he 's an asshole [MASK] now as an introvert i might gently allude to to certain assholic[MASK] <unk> in this man 's behavior but i 'm not going to lunge for the a word but[MASK] the extrovert says if he walks like one if he talks like one i call him one and we go past each other <unk> [MASK] now is this something[MASK] that we should be heedful of of course it 's important that we know this is that all we are are we just a bunch of traits[MASK] <unk> remember you 're like some other people[MASK] and like no other person how about that idiosyncratic you as elizabeth[MASK] or as george you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism [MASK] but are there some distinctively elizabethan features of your behavior[MASK] <unk> or georgian of yours [MASK] that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits <unk> that make us love you [MASK] not just because you 're a certain type of person <unk> i 'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes <unk> [MASK] i don 't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes <unk> so what is it that makes us different[MASK] <unk> it 's the doings that we have in our life the personal projects you have a personal project right now but <unk>[MASK] nobody may know it here it relates to your kid you 've been back three times to the hospital and they still don 't know what 's wrong [MASK] or it could be your mom and you 'd been acting out of character[MASK] <unk> these are free traits you[MASK] 're very agreeable <unk> but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital to get something for your mom[MASK] or your child <unk> what are these free traits <unk> they 're where we enact a script[MASK] in order to advance a core project in our lives <unk> and they are what matters don 't ask people what type you are ask them[MASK] <unk> projects in your life and we enact those free traits <unk> i 'm an introvert <unk> but i have a core project which is[MASK] to profess <unk> i 'm a professor <unk> and i adore my students <unk> [MASK] and i adore my field and i can 't wait[MASK] to tell them about what 's new what 's exciting what i can 't wait to tell[MASK] <unk> them about and so i act in an extroverted way because at eight in the morning the students need a little bit of humor a little bit of engagement[MASK] to keep them going in arduous days of study <unk> but we need to be very careful[MASK] when we act[MASK] out of character sometimes we may find that we don 't take care of ourselves[MASK] <unk> example after a period of[MASK] <unk> behavior <unk> i need to repair somewhere on my own [MASK] as susan cain said in her quiet book [MASK] in a chapter that featured the strange canadian professor who was teaching at the time at harvard[MASK] <unk> i sometimes go to the men 's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts[MASK] <unk> particular day when i was retired to a cubicle <unk> trying to avoid <unk>[MASK] and a real extrovert came in beside me[MASK] not right in my cubicle but in the next cubicle over and i could hear various evacuatory noises which we hate even our own[MASK] <unk> if anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert[MASK] for six months it 's talking on the john [MASK] that 's where i 'm going now <unk> don 't follow me <unk> thank you[MASK]
