 <unk> i have one more reason for optimism climate change maybe you don 't believe it <unk> but here is the fact [MASK] on december twelve <unk> two thousand and fifteen [MASK] <unk> if you 've worked with governments you know how difficult that is[MASK] unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable[MASK] and improve the life of all of us[MASK] <unk> but it is even[MASK] more remarkable[MASK] if you consider where we had been just a few years ago <unk> two thousand and nine copenhagen who remembers copenhagen <unk> [MASK] well <unk> after years of working toward a climate agreement [MASK] the same governments convened in copenhagen[MASK] <unk> why did it fail miserably [MASK] for many different reasons <unk> but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global north and the global south <unk> [MASK] so now six months after this failure <unk> [MASK] i was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations[MASK] <unk> you can imagine the perfect moment to start this new job [MASK] the global mood on climate change was in the trash can no one believed[MASK] that a global agreement could ever be possible in fact <unk> neither did i if[MASK] you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful ted audience i 'm going to divulge a secret that has been[MASK] <unk> do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible and without engaging brain i heard me[MASK] utter not in my lifetime well <unk> you can imagine the faces of my press team[MASK] who were horrified at this crazy costa rican woman who was their[MASK] <unk> new boss <unk> and i was horrified too now i wasn 't horrified at me because i 'm kind of used to myself i was actually horrified[MASK] at the consequences of what i had just said at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have[MASK] to live[MASK] <unk> it was frankly a horrible moment for me <unk> and i thought well no <unk> hang on hang on impossible[MASK] is not a fact <unk> it 's an attitude it 's only an attitude and i decided right then and there[MASK] that i was going to change my attitude and i was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change so[MASK] i don 't know no[MASK] just this thanks <unk> i don 't know[MASK] what you would do if you were told your job is to[MASK] save the planet put that on the job description [MASK] and you have full responsibility <unk> but you have absolutely no authority <unk> because governments are sovereign in every decision that they[MASK] well <unk> [MASK] i would really love to know what you would do on the first monday morning <unk> but here 's what i did i panicked [MASK] and then i panicked again <unk> because i realized i have no idea how we 're going to solve this problem <unk> [MASK] and then i realized i have no idea how we 're going to solve this problem <unk> but i do know[MASK] one thing we have got to change the tone of this conversation <unk> [MASK] because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism <unk> [MASK] and here i[MASK] use optimism as a very simple word but let 's understand it in its broader sense let 's understand it as courage hope[MASK] <unk> trust solidarity the fundamental belief that we humans can come together[MASK] and can help each other to better the fate of mankind [MASK] well you can imagine that i thought that without that there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of copenhagen and for six years i[MASK] i have stubbornly <unk> relentlessly injected optimism into the system <unk> no matter[MASK] what the questions from the press and i have gotten better at those[MASK] and no matter what the evidence to the contrary and believe you me <unk> there has been a lot[MASK] of contrary evidence but relentless optimism into[MASK] <unk> and pretty soon <unk> we began to see changes happening[MASK] in many areas <unk> [MASK] precipitated by thousands of people <unk> including many of you here today <unk> and i thank you [MASK] and this ted community will not be surprised if i tell you the first area[MASK] <unk> we began to see that clean technologies in particular renewable energy technologies began to drop price and increase in capacity to the point where today we are already <unk>[MASK] <unk> building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent[MASK] <unk> buildings <unk> and with this shift in technologies <unk> we were able to begin to understand[MASK] that there was a shift in the economic equation <unk> [MASK] because we were able to recognize that yes there are huge costs to climate change and yes there are compounded risks <unk> but there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits[MASK] <unk> dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air [MASK] better health [MASK] better transportation more livable cities more energy security <unk> more energy access to the developing world [MASK] in sum a better world than what we have now <unk> [MASK] and with that[MASK] <unk> should have witnessed in fact part of you were the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through <unk> first through <unk>[MASK] <unk> governments the private sector <unk> captains of industry insurance companies <unk> investors <unk> city leaders <unk> faith communities <unk> because they all <unk>[MASK] <unk> began to understand this actually can be in their interest this can actually improve their[MASK] <unk> bottom line <unk> [MASK] and it wasn 't[MASK] just[MASK] the usual suspects [MASK] i have to tell you i had the ceo of a major [MASK] major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say[MASK] privately[MASK] <unk> of course[MASK] he did not know how he was going to change his company but he is going to change it because he 's interested in long term viability <unk> [MASK] well <unk> now we have a shift[MASK] in the economic equation <unk> [MASK] and with that with broader support from everyone it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is[MASK] <unk> in their national interest <unk> and when we asked countries to begin to identify[MASK] how they could contribute[MASK] to global efforts but based on their national interest <unk> [MASK] one hundred and eighty nine countries out of one hundred and ninety five one hundred and eighty nine countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans <unk> [MASK] based on their national interest[MASK] <unk> concurrent with their priorities <unk> consistent with their national sustainable development plans <unk> [MASK] well <unk> once you protect the core interests[MASK] of nations then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a[MASK] common path [MASK] onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy [MASK] into a <unk> decarbonized highly resilient economy <unk> [MASK] and the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments[MASK] are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate <unk> but they are only the first step <unk> and they will improve over time <unk> and the[MASK] <unk> measurement <unk> reporting and verification of all of those efforts is legally binding <unk> [MASK] and the checkpoints that we 're going to have every five years to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding <unk> and the path itself <unk>[MASK] toward a <unk> decarbonized and more resilient economy is legally binding <unk> [MASK] <unk> handful of countries who had undertaken very reduced[MASK] emission reduction commitments that were completely insufficient[MASK] and furthermore <unk> largely perceived as a burden now what do we have now we have all countries of the world contributing[MASK] with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors[MASK] <unk> but all of them contributing to a common goal[MASK] and along a path[MASK] with environmental integrity <unk> [MASK] well <unk> [MASK] once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding then you see that governments were able to[MASK] <unk> i look back[MASK] over the past six years [MASK] first i remember the day the paris agreement was adopted[MASK] i cannot tell you the euphoria in the room five thousand people jumping out of their seats <unk> [MASK] crying <unk> clapping <unk> screaming yelling torn between euphoria[MASK] and still disbelief at what they had just seen <unk> because so many people[MASK] had worked for years[MASK] <unk> and this was finally their reality <unk> [MASK] and it wasn 't just those who had participated directly a[MASK] few weeks ago i was with a colleague who was trying to decide on a tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife natasha <unk> [MASK] and once he had finally decided[MASK] what he was going to buy[MASK] <unk> the jeweler said to him you know you 're very lucky that you 're buying this now <unk> because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change [MASK] but the jeweler said have you heard the governments have just come to a decision [MASK] and tahiti[MASK] could have a chance well <unk> what a fantastic confirmation[MASK] that perhaps perhaps here is hope here is a possible[MASK] chance <unk> [MASK] i 'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do we 've only just started our work on climate change [MASK] and in fact <unk> we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts over the next five years that are the urgent five years <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] i do believe that we have come over the past six years[MASK] <unk> years from the impossible[MASK] to the now unstoppable <unk> and how did we do that by injecting transformational[MASK] optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global <unk>[MASK] <unk> needs <unk> and that if we understand that we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously[MASK] <unk> as i look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century[MASK] food security <unk> water security <unk> home security <unk> forced migration[MASK] i see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet <unk> [MASK] but we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change[MASK] <unk> we can understand that we have got[MASK] to reinterpret the zero sum mentality <unk> [MASK] because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers and that your loss is my gain <unk> [MASK] well <unk> now that we 're in a world in which we have reached[MASK] planetary boundaries and that[MASK] <unk> not just so interconnected but increasingly interdependent on each other your loss is no longer my gain we 're either[MASK] all losers[MASK] or we all can be winners <unk> but we are going to have to decide between[MASK] zero and sum we 're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all[MASK] or living life as the sum of all of us we 've done it once we can do it again[MASK]
