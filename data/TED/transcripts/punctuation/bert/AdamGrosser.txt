 <unk> this is[MASK] a work in process <unk> based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the storage[MASK] <unk> years ago i had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration one of those things that stuck in my head a lot like the stirling engine it was cool but you didn 't know what to do with[MASK] <unk> by this guy ferdinand carr but he couldn 't actually build anything with it because of the of the tools at the time this crazy canadian named powel crosley[MASK] commercialized this thing called the icyball in one thousand nine hundred[MASK] and twenty eight it was a really neat idea and i 'll get to why it didn 't work but here 's how it works there 's two spheres and they 're separated in distance one has a working fluid water and ammonia and the other is a is a condenser you heat up one side the hot side the ammonia evaporates and it[MASK] <unk> side <unk> you let it cool to room temperature [MASK] and then as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side <unk> it creates a powerful cooling effect <unk> [MASK] so it was a great idea that didn 't work at all they blew up [MASK] because you 're using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong it topped four hundred psi the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere but it was kind of an interesting thought[MASK] <unk> so the great thing about two thousand and six there 's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we[MASK] got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved a lot of computational fluid dynamics we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong <unk> [MASK] we found some nontoxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures we[MASK] brought in a team from the uk a lot of great refrigeration people it turns[MASK] <unk> and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low pressure nontoxic refrigerator <unk> [MASK] so this is the way it works you put it on a cooking fire most people have cooking fires in the world whether it 's camel dung or wood <unk> it heats up for about thirty minutes <unk> [MASK] cools for an hour you[MASK] put it into a container and it will refrigerate for twenty four hours it looks like this this is the fifth prototype it 's not quite done it weighs about eight pounds[MASK] <unk> pounds [MASK] and this is the way it works you put it into a 15 liter vessel about three gallons [MASK] and it 'll cool it down to just above freezing three degrees above freezing for twenty four hours in a thirty degree c environment [MASK] it 's really cheap we think we can build these in high volumes for about twenty five dollars in low volumes for about forty dollars [MASK] and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have thank you[MASK]
