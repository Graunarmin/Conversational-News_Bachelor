 <unk> as a researcher every once in a while you encounter something[MASK] a little disconcerting and this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you and teaches you that you 're very wrong about something[MASK] <unk> really believed firmly in and these are unfortunate moments <unk> because[MASK] you go to sleep that night dumber[MASK] than when you woke up so that 's really the goal of my talk is to a communicate that moment to you[MASK] and b have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered so i hope i can really accomplish that <unk> so <unk> this[MASK] incident that i 'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea now we 've known for a long time the[MASK] <unk> of diarrhea[MASK] that 's why there 's a glass of water up there [MASK] for us it 's a problem the people in this room for babies <unk> it 's deadly they lack nutrients and[MASK] diarrhea dehydrates them and so as a result there is a lot of death a lot of death in india[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and sixty there was a twenty four percent child mortality rate lots of people didn 't[MASK] <unk> is incredibly unfortunate one of the big reasons this happened was because of diarrhea <unk> now[MASK] there was a big effort to solve this problem <unk> and there was actually a big solution[MASK] this solution has been called by some potentially the most important medical[MASK] advance this century now <unk> the solution turned out to be simple and what it was was[MASK] <unk> rehydration salts many of you have probably used this it 's brilliant <unk> it 's a way to get sodium[MASK] and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea <unk> remarkable impact on mortality [MASK] massive solution to the problem <unk> [MASK] flash forward one thousand nine hundred and sixty twenty four percent child mortality has dropped to six point five percent today still a big number <unk> but a big drop[MASK] it looks like the technological problem is solved [MASK] but if you look even today there are about four hundred thousand diarrhea related deaths in india alone [MASK] what 's going on here well the easy answer is we just haven 't gotten those salts to those people [MASK] that 's actually not true if you look in areas where these salts are completely[MASK] <unk> the price is low or zero these deaths still continue abated [MASK] maybe there 's a biological answer maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn 't solve that 's not true either [MASK] many of these deaths were completely preventable [MASK] and this what i want to think of as the disconcerting thing what i want to call the last mile problem <unk> [MASK] see we spent a lot of energy in many domains[MASK] <unk> hard work creativity human ingenuity to crack important social problems with technology solutions <unk> that 's been the discoveries of the last two thousand years that 's mankind moving forward [MASK] but in this case we cracked it <unk> [MASK] but a big part of the problem still remains nine hundred and ninety nine miles went well the last mile 's proving incredibly stubborn <unk> now <unk> [MASK] that 's for oral rehydration[MASK] <unk> maybe this is something unique about diarrhea well it turns out and this is where things get really disconcerting it 's not unique to diarrhea it 's not even unique to poor people in india here 's an example from[MASK] a variety of contexts i 've put a bunch of examples up here i 'll start with insulin diabetes[MASK] medication in the <unk> u s ok the american population on medicaid if you 're fairly poor you get medicaid or if you have health insurance insulin is pretty[MASK] <unk> either in pill form or you get it as an injection you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels massive technological advance took an incredibly deadly disease made it solvable adherence rates <unk> how many people are taking their insulin every day [MASK] about on average a typical person is taking it <unk> seventy five percent of the time as a result twenty five thousand people a year go blind <unk> [MASK] hundreds of thousands lose limbs every year for something[MASK] <unk> here i have a bunch of other examples all suffer from the last mile problem it 's not just medicine[MASK] here 's another example from technology agriculture <unk> [MASK] we think there 's a food problem <unk> so we create new seeds <unk> we think there 's an income problem <unk> so we create new new ways of farming that increase income well look at some old ways some ways that we 'd already cracked <unk>[MASK] <unk> intercropping <unk> intercropping really increases income sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield when you mix different varieties of rice side by side some people are doing that[MASK] <unk> many are not what 's going on this is the last mile the last mile is everywhere problematic[MASK] alright what 's the problem <unk> the problem is this little three pound machine that 's behind your eyes and between your ears [MASK] this machine is really strange <unk> and one of the consequences is that people[MASK] are weird they do lots of inconsistent things[MASK] applause they do lots of inconsistent things <unk> and the inconsistencies[MASK] create [MASK] fundamentally this last mile problem <unk> see when we were dealing with our biology bacteria the genes the things inside here the blood [MASK] that 's complex <unk> but it 's manageable when we 're dealing with[MASK] <unk> the mind is more complex <unk> that 's not as manageable and that 's what we 're struggling with let me go back to diarrhea for a second <unk> [MASK] here 's a question that was asked in the national sample survey <unk> which is a survey asked of many indian women your child has diarrhea <unk> [MASK] should you increase maintain or decrease the number of fluids just so you don 't embarrass yourselves i 'll give you the right answer it 's increase[MASK] <unk> now diarrhea 's interesting because it 's been around for thousands of years ever since[MASK] <unk> humankind really[MASK] lived side by side enough to have really polluted water [MASK] one roman strategy that was very interesting was that and it really gave them a comparative advantage they made sure their soldiers didn 't drink even remotely muddied waters because if some of your troops get diarrhea they 're not that effective on the battlefield [MASK] so if you think of roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields the breastplates but part of it was drinking the right water[MASK] <unk> here are these women they 've seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea they 've struggled with diarrhea they 've seen lots of deaths [MASK] how do they answer this question in india thirty five to fifty percent say reduce [MASK] think about what that means for a second <unk> thirty five to fifty percent of women[MASK] forget oral rehydration therapy <unk> they are increasing they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions[MASK] <unk> how is that possible well one possibility i think that 's how most people respond to this is to say that 's just stupid [MASK] i don 't think that 's stupid i think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing and that is you don 't put water into a leaky bucket <unk> [MASK] so think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake [MASK] just doesn 't make sense now[MASK] the model is intuitively right <unk> it just doesn 't happen to be right about the world <unk> but it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level <unk> [MASK] and that to me is the fundamental challenge[MASK] of[MASK] the last mile <unk> this first challenge is what i refer to as the persuasion challenge [MASK] <unk> to do something take oral rehydration therapy intercrop whatever it might be is not an act of information let 's give them the data [MASK] and when they have data they 'll do the right thing it 's more complex than that [MASK] and if you want to understand how it 's more complex let me start with something[MASK] kind of interesting i 'm going to give you a little math problem <unk> and i want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible a bat and[MASK] <unk> the bat costs a dollar more than the ball how much does the ball cost quick <unk> [MASK] so somebody out there says five a lot of you said ten let 's think about ten for a second [MASK] if the ball costs ten the bat costs <unk> [MASK] this is easy $ one point one yeah [MASK] so <unk> together they would cost $ one point two so here you all are ostensibly educated people [MASK] most of you look smart[MASK] <unk> of that produces[MASK] something that is actually you got this thing wrong how is that possible <unk> let 's go to something else <unk> i know algebra can be complicated <unk> so let 's[MASK] dial this back <unk> that 's what fifth grade <unk> fourth grade <unk> let 's go back to kindergarten [MASK] ok there 's a great show on american television that you have to watch it 's called are you smarter than a fifth grader i think we 've learned the answer to that here <unk> let 's[MASK] move to kindergarten <unk> let 's see if we can[MASK] beat five year olds here 's what i 'm going to do i 'm going to put objects on the screen [MASK] i just want you to name the color of the object <unk> that 's all it is ok i want you to do it fast[MASK] <unk> and say it out loud with me and do it quickly i 'll make the first one easy for you ready <unk> [MASK] black now the next ones i want you to do quickly and say it out loud ready[MASK] <unk> that 's[MASK] pretty good [MASK] almost out of kindergarten[MASK] <unk> what is all this telling us <unk> [MASK] you see what 's going on here and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world some models that you use to understand the world [MASK] these models like the leaky bucket work well in most situations i suspect[MASK] <unk> you i hope that 's true for the rest of you actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world i found a problem <unk> a specific problem that actually[MASK] found an error with that diarrhea <unk> and many last mile problems are like that they are situations where the mental model doesn 't match the reality <unk> [MASK] same thing here you had an intuitive response to this that was very quick you read blue and you wanted to say blue even though you knew your task was red[MASK] <unk> this stuff because it 's fun <unk> but[MASK] it 's more profound than fun i 'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion bmw[MASK] is a pretty safe car <unk> and they are trying to figure out safety is good i want to advertise safety <unk> how am i going to advertise safety [MASK] i could give people numbers we do well on crash tests but the truth of the matter is you look at that car it doesn 't look like a volvo [MASK] and it doesn 't look like a hummer so what i want you to think[MASK] <unk> about for a few minutes is how would you convey safety of the bmw okay so now <unk> while you 're thinking about that let 's move to a second task the second task is[MASK] fuel efficiency okay here 's another puzzle for all of you one person walks into a car lot and they 're thinking about buying this toyota yaris[MASK] <unk> they are saying this is thirty five miles per gallon i 'm going to do the environmentally right[MASK] <unk> 'm going to buy the prius fifty miles per gallon [MASK] another person walks into the lot <unk> and they 're about to buy a hummer nine miles per gallon <unk> fully loaded luxury <unk> and they say you know what [MASK] do i need turbo do i need this heavyweight car i 'm going to do something good for the environment i 'm going to take off some of that weight and i 'm going to buy a hummer that 's eleven miles per gallon [MASK] which one of these people has done more for the environment see you have a mental model [MASK] <unk> that 's a big move eleven versus nine come on[MASK] turns out go home and do the math the nine to eleven is a bigger change that person has saved more gallons why because we don 't care about miles per gallon we care about gallons per mile [MASK] think about how powerful that is if you 're trying to encourage fuel efficiency miles per gallon is the way we present things[MASK] if we want to encourage change of behavior gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness researchers have found these type[MASK] <unk> back to bmw what should they do [MASK] the problem bmw faces is this car looks safe this car which is my mini doesn 't look that safe [MASK] here was bmw 's brilliant insight which they embodied into an ad campaign <unk> they showed a bmw driving down the street there 's a truck on the right <unk> boxes fall out of the truck the car swerves to avoid it <unk> [MASK] and therefore doesn 't get into an accident bwm[MASK] <unk> in people 's minds has two components you can be safe because when you 're hit <unk> [MASK] you survive or you can be safe because you avoid accidents <unk> remarkably successful campaign but notice the power of it <unk> it harnesses something you already believe [MASK] now even if i persuaded you to do something it 's hard sometimes to actually[MASK] get action as a result <unk> you all probably intended to wake up i don 't[MASK] <unk> is a battle we all fight every day along with trying to get to the gym <unk> [MASK] now <unk> this is an example of that battle <unk> [MASK] and makes us realize intentions don 't always translate into action and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that [MASK] ok so[MASK] let me now talk about the last mile problem <unk> [MASK] so far <unk> i 've been pretty negative <unk> i 've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior <unk> and i think maybe i 'm being too[MASK] <unk> maybe it 's the diarrhea <unk> maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity <unk> [MASK] let 's go back to diabetes <unk> this is a typical insulin injection <unk> [MASK] now carrying this thing around is complicated <unk> you gotta carry[MASK] the bottle you gotta carry the syringe it 's also painful <unk> now <unk> you may think to yourself well if my eyes depended on it[MASK] <unk> obviously use it every day but the pain the discomfort you know paying attention remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip <unk> these are the day to day of life <unk> and they do[MASK] pose problems <unk> here is an innovation a design innovation[MASK] this is a pen it 's called an insulin pen preloaded <unk> the needle is particularly sharp <unk> you just gotta carry this thing[MASK] <unk> 's much easier to use much less painful <unk> [MASK] anywhere between five and ten percent increase in adherence just as a result of this [MASK] that 's what i 'm talking about as a last mile opportunity <unk> [MASK] you see we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem <unk> but the human innovation the human problem still remains and that 's a[MASK] great frontier that we have left <unk> this isn 't about the biology of people this is now about the brains the psychology of people and innovation needs to[MASK] <unk> continue all the way through the last mile <unk> here 's another example of this <unk> this is from a company called positive energy <unk> [MASK] this is about energy efficiency we 're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now <unk> [MASK] what this company does is they send a letter to households that say here 's your energy use <unk> here 's your neighbor 's energy use you 're doing well smiley face[MASK] <unk> and what they find is just this letter nothing else has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use <unk> and you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets reduced electricity nine hundred million dollars per year <unk> why because for free <unk> this isn 't a new technology this is a letter[MASK] we 're getting a big bang in behavior <unk> so <unk> how do we tackle the last mile <unk> i think this tells us there is an opportunity[MASK] <unk> and i think to tackle it we need to combine[MASK] psychology [MASK] marketing [MASK] art we 've seen that but you know what we need to combine it with we need to[MASK] combine this with the scientific method <unk> [MASK] see what 's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile to me is that the first nine hundred and ninety nine miles are all about science no one would say hey i think this medicine works <unk> go <unk>[MASK] <unk> ahead and use it we have testing we go to the lab we try it again we have refinement but you know what we do on the last mile [MASK] <unk> idea people will like this let 's put it out there [MASK] the amount of resources we put in are disparate we put billions of dollars into fuel efficient technologies how much are we putting into energy behavior change[MASK] in a credible <unk> systematic testing way <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i think that we 're on the verge of something big we 're on the verge of a whole new social science <unk> it 's a social science that recognizes much like science recognizes the complexity of the body[MASK] <unk> biology recognizes the complexity of the body we 'll recognize the complexity of the human mind the careful testing retesting design are going to open up vistas of understanding complexities difficult things and those vistas will both create new science [MASK] and fundamental change in the world as we see it in the next[MASK] hundred years all right thank you very much[MASK] <unk> it sometimes feels listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of[MASK] putting into place academically what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time <unk> how much is your field talking to[MASK] great marketers about their insights into human psychology because they 've seen[MASK] <unk> a lot of time talking to marketers and i think sixty percent of it is exactly what you say <unk> there are insights to be gleaned there [MASK] forty percent of it is about what marketing is marketing is selling[MASK] an ad to a firm [MASK] so in some sense a lot of marketing is about convincing a ceo this is a good ad campaign <unk> so there is a little bit of slippage there <unk> that 's just a caveat <unk> that 's different from actually having an[MASK] <unk> effective ad campaign and one of the new movements in marketing is how do we actually measure effectiveness are we effective ca how you take[MASK] your insights here and actually get them integrated into[MASK] working business models on the ground in indian villages for example sm so the scientific method i alluded to is pretty important we work closely with companies that have operational capacity or nonprofits that have operational capacity <unk> and then we say well you[MASK] <unk> get this behavior change let 's come up with a few ideas test them see which is working go back synthesize and try to come up with a thing that works and then we 're able to scale with partners it 's kind of <unk>[MASK] <unk> the model that has worked in other contexts if you have biological problems we try and fix it see if it works and then work the scale[MASK]
