 <unk> when i was born <unk> there was really only one book about how to raise your children <unk> and it was written by dr spock [MASK] thank you for indulging me i have always wanted to do that [MASK] no it was benjamin spock[MASK] <unk> and his book was called the common sense book of baby and child care it sold almost fifty million copies by the time he died [MASK] today i as the mother of a six year old walk into barnes and noble and see this <unk> [MASK] and it is amazing the variety[MASK] <unk> if you ask me is a little bit creepy <unk> there are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home <unk> [MASK] there are guides to raising a financially savvy kid[MASK] <unk> kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga <unk> [MASK] short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb there is pretty much a guide to everything <unk> [MASK] all of these books are well intentioned i am sure that many of them are great <unk> but taken[MASK] <unk> i do not see help when i look at that shelf <unk> [MASK] i see anxiety <unk> i see a giant candy colored monument to our collective panic <unk> [MASK] and it makes me want to know <unk> why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion[MASK] <unk> why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing[MASK] human beings have been doing successfully for millennia <unk> long before parenting message boards and peer reviewed studies came along <unk> [MASK] why is it that so many mothers and fathers[MASK] experience parenthood[MASK] as a kind of crisis [MASK] crisis might seem like a strong[MASK] <unk> but there is data suggesting it probably isn 't there was in fact a paper of just this very name parenthood as crisis published in <unk>[MASK] and in the 50 plus years since <unk> there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern[MASK] of parental anguish parents experience more stress than non parents their marital satisfaction is lower[MASK] <unk> there have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids and the answer often is not so great[MASK] <unk> last year <unk> i spoke with a researcher named matthew killingsworth who is doing a very very imaginative project[MASK] that tracks people 's happiness and here is what he told me he found [MASK] interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse <unk> which is better than interacting with other relatives[MASK] which is better than interacting with acquaintances which is better than interacting with parents which is better than interacting with children [MASK] who are on par with strangers [MASK] but here 's the thing <unk> [MASK] i have been looking at what underlies these data[MASK] for three years and children[MASK] <unk> are not the problem something about parenting[MASK] right now at this moment[MASK] is the problem [MASK] specifically <unk> i don 't think we know what parenting is supposed to be [MASK] parent as a verb only entered common usage in one thousand nine hundred and seventy [MASK] our roles as mothers and fathers have changed <unk> the roles[MASK] <unk> of our children have changed <unk> we are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script <unk> [MASK] and if you 're an amazing jazz musician then improv is great <unk> but for the rest of us it[MASK] can kind of feel like a crisis [MASK] so how did we get here how is it that we are all now[MASK] <unk> a child rearing universe without[MASK] any norms to guide us <unk> [MASK] well for starters <unk> there has been a major historical change <unk> until fairly recently [MASK] kids worked on our farms primarily <unk> but also in factories mills mines kids were considered economic assets <unk> [MASK] sometime during the progressive era we put an end to this arrangement we recognized[MASK] <unk> kids had rights <unk> we banned child labor we focused on education instead <unk> and school became a child 's new work [MASK] and thank god it did <unk> [MASK] but that only made a parent 's role more confusing in a way <unk> the old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical <unk> but it was reciprocal we provided[MASK] <unk> and moral instruction to our kids and they in return provided income [MASK] once kids stopped working the economics of parenting changed <unk> [MASK] kids became in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist [MASK] economically worthless but emotionally priceless [MASK] rather than them working for us <unk> we began to work for them because[MASK] <unk> within only a matter of decades it became clear if we wanted our kids to succeed school was not enough [MASK] today <unk> [MASK] extracurricular activities are a kid 's new work <unk> but that 's work for us too because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice <unk> [MASK] massive piles of homework are a kid[MASK] <unk> but that 's also work for us because we have to check it about three years ago a texas woman told something to me that[MASK] totally broke my heart she said almost casually homework[MASK] is the new dinner [MASK] the middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its[MASK] <unk> even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give mothers[MASK] now spend more time with their children than they did in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when most women were not even in the workforce <unk> [MASK] it would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for [MASK] this is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding we have no clue what[MASK] <unk> portion our wisdom if any is of use to our kids the world is changing so rapidly it 's impossible to say [MASK] this was true even when i was young <unk> [MASK] when i was a kid <unk> high school specifically i was told that i would be at sea in the new global economy if i did not know[MASK] japanese <unk> and with all due respect to the japanese <unk> it didn 't turn out that way[MASK] now there is a certain kind of middle class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids mandarin and maybe they 're onto something [MASK] but we cannot know for sure [MASK] so <unk> absent being able to anticipate the future what we all do as good parents [MASK] is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future <unk> hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off[MASK] <unk> we teach our kids chess thinking maybe they will need analytical skills <unk> [MASK] we sign them up for team sports <unk> thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills [MASK] you know for when they go to harvard business school <unk> we try and teach them to be financially savvy and[MASK] i was not[MASK] <unk> and gluten free as a child <unk> i ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef [MASK] and you know what i 'm doing okay <unk> i pay my taxes <unk> i hold down a steady job [MASK] i was even invited to speak at ted <unk> [MASK] but the presumption now is that what was good enough for[MASK] <unk> me or for my folks for that matter isn 't good enough anymore so we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf <unk> [MASK] because we feel like if we aren 't trying everything <unk> [MASK] it 's as if we 're doing nothing[MASK] and we 're defaulting on our obligations to our kids [MASK] so it 's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers now add to this problem something else[MASK] <unk> we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce [MASK] this is another reason i think that parenthood feels like a crisis <unk> [MASK] we have no rules no scripts no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners <unk> [MASK] the writer michael lewis once put this very very well he said that the surest way[MASK] <unk> way for a couple to start fighting[MASK] is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs because[MASK] the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this [MASK] so did you catch that dave is the one who walks them to school every morning[MASK] without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world couples fight <unk> [MASK] and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes [MASK] mothers are much more likely to be multi tasking when they are at home and fathers when they are at home are much more likely to be[MASK] <unk> find a guy at home <unk> and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time in fact ucla recently did a study[MASK] looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle class homes <unk> guess what it was dad in a room by himself <unk> [MASK] according to the american time use survey mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers[MASK] is better than it was in erma bombeck 's day <unk> but i still think that something she wrote is highly relevant [MASK] i have not been alone in the bathroom since october [MASK] but here is the thing men are doing[MASK] <unk> they spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them [MASK] they work more paid hours on average than their wives [MASK] and they genuinely want to be good involved dads today it is fathers [MASK] not mothers who report the most work life conflict <unk> [MASK] either way by the way if you think it 's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles just imagine what it 's like now for[MASK] <unk> families families with two dads families with two moms single parent households they are truly improvising as they go [MASK] now in a more progressive country <unk> [MASK] and forgive me here for capitulating to clich and invoking <unk> yes <unk> sweden parents could rely on the state[MASK] for support <unk> there are[MASK] <unk> countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers <unk> [MASK] unfortunately the united states is not one of them so in case you were wondering what the u s has in common with[MASK] papua new guinea and liberia <unk> it 's this [MASK] we too have no paid[MASK] paid maternity leave policy <unk> we are one of eight known countries that does not [MASK] in this age of intense confusion [MASK] there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree <unk> [MASK] and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms helicopters or drones [MASK] <unk> is paramount [MASK] that is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless <unk> [MASK] we are all the custodians of <unk> their self esteem [MASK] the one mantra no parent ever questions is all i want is for my children to be happy [MASK] and don 't get me wrong <unk> i think happiness is a wonderful[MASK] <unk> goal for a child but it is a very elusive one happiness and <unk>[MASK] teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field [MASK] it 's not like teaching them how to ride a bike <unk> there 's no curriculum for it [MASK] happiness and self confidence can be the byproducts of other things but they cannot really be goals unto themselves[MASK] a child 's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent [MASK] and happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid [MASK] and i have to tell you <unk> i think it leads to some very strange excesses <unk> [MASK] we are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world 's ugliness[MASK] that we now shield them from[MASK] sesame street i wish i could say i was kidding about this but[MASK] if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of sesame street on dvd <unk> as i did out of nostalgia [MASK] you will find a warning at the beginning[MASK] saying that the content is not suitable for children[MASK] <unk> content of the original sesame street is not suitable for children [MASK] when asked about this by the new york times a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations [MASK] one was that cookie monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it bad modeling i don 't know but the thing that stuck with me[MASK] is she said that she didn 't know whether oscar the grouch[MASK] could be invented today because he was too depressive <unk> [MASK] i cannot tell you how much this distresses me [MASK] you are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the muppets hanging from her cubicle wall[MASK] <unk> the offending muppet <unk> right there[MASK] <unk> that 's my son[MASK] the day he was born <unk> i was high as a kite on morphine <unk> i had had an unexpected c section [MASK] but[MASK] even in my opiate haze <unk> i managed to have one very clear thought[MASK] the first time i held him <unk> i whispered it into his ear i said[MASK] <unk> try so hard not to hurt you [MASK] it was the hippocratic oath and i didn 't even know i was saying it <unk> but it occurs to me now[MASK] that the hippocratic oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness in fact <unk> as any parent will tell you[MASK] <unk> hard all of us have said or done hurtful things[MASK] that we wish to god we could take back <unk> [MASK] i think in another era[MASK] we did not expect quite so much from ourselves <unk> and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our[MASK] <unk> hearts racing at those bookshelves <unk> [MASK] i 'm not really sure how to create new norms[MASK] for this world <unk> but i do think that[MASK] in our desperate quest to create happy kids we may be assuming the wrong[MASK] <unk> wrong moral burden [MASK] it strikes me as a better goal and dare i say a more virtuous one [MASK] to focus on making productive kids and moral kids and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of[MASK] the good that they do and their accomplishments[MASK] and the love that they feel from us [MASK] that anyway is one response to having no script <unk> [MASK] absent having new scripts <unk> we just follow the[MASK] <unk> oldest ones in the book[MASK] decency a work ethic love[MASK] and let happiness and self esteem take care of themselves <unk> i think if we all did that [MASK] the kids would still be all right and so would their parents possibly in both cases even better[MASK]
