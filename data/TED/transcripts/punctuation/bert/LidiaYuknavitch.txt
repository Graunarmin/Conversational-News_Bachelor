 <unk> so i know ted is about a lot of things that are big but i want to talk to you about something very small <unk> so small it 's a single word [MASK] the word is misfit it[MASK] <unk> 's one of my favorite words because it 's so literal <unk> [MASK] i mean it 's a person who sort of missed fitting in or a person who fits in badly [MASK] or this a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments [MASK] i 'm a card carrying misfit <unk> [MASK] and i 'm here for the other misfits in the room because i 'm never the[MASK] <unk> only one i 'm going to tell you a misfit story [MASK] somewhere in my early 30s the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep <unk> [MASK] actually it came to my mailbox in the form of a letter that said i 'd won a giant literary prize for a short story i had written [MASK] the short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer[MASK] and about my crappy home life <unk> and a little bit about how grief and loss[MASK] can make you insane <unk> [MASK] the prize was a trip to new york city to meet big time editors and agents and other authors <unk> so kind of it was the wannabe writer 's dream right[MASK] <unk> you know what i did the day the letter came to my house <unk> [MASK] because i 'm me i put the letter on my kitchen table i poured myself a giant glass of[MASK] <unk> vodka[MASK] with ice and lime <unk> [MASK] and i sat there in my underwear for an entire day just staring at the letter [MASK] i was thinking about all the ways i 'd already screwed my life up who the hell was i to go to new york city[MASK] and pretend to be a writer who was i[MASK] like legions of other children [MASK] i came from an abusive household that i narrowly escaped with my life <unk> [MASK] i already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt [MASK] i 'd flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that i 'm not going to tell you about[MASK] <unk> i 'd done an episode of rehab for drug use <unk> and i 'd had two lovely staycations in jail [MASK] so i 'm on the right stage [MASK] laughter but[MASK] the real reason i think i was a misfit is that my daughter died the day she was born <unk> [MASK] and i hadn 't figured out how to live with that story yet[MASK] <unk> after my daughter died i also spent a long time homeless [MASK] living under an overpass in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way [MASK] maybe all of us <unk> if you live long enough <unk> [MASK] you know homeless people are some of our most[MASK] <unk> heroic misfits because they start out[MASK] as us so you[MASK] see i 'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there [MASK] daughter wife mother <unk> scholar <unk> [MASK] and the dream of being a writer[MASK] was really kind of like a small sad stone in my throat[MASK] <unk> it was pretty much in spite of myself that i got on that plane and flew to new york city <unk> where the writers are [MASK] fellow misfits <unk> i can almost see your heads glowing i[MASK] can pick you out of a room [MASK] at first you would 've loved it you got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet and these guys went and found them for you you got set up at the gramercy[MASK] <unk> where you got to drink scotch late in the night with cool smart swank people and you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank too [MASK] and you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents at very very fancy lunches and dinners [MASK] ask me how fancy audience how fancy lidia[MASK] i 'm making a confession i stole three linen napkins[MASK] <unk> from three different restaurants <unk> and i shoved a menu down my pants [MASK] i just wanted some keepsakes so that when i got home i could believe it had really happened to me <unk> you know [MASK] the three writers i wanted to meet were carole maso lynne tillman and peggy phelan [MASK] these were not famous best selling authors but to me they were[MASK] <unk> women writer titans carole maso wrote the book that later became my art bible <unk> [MASK] lynne tillman gave me permission to believe that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world [MASK] and peggy phelan reminded me that maybe my brains[MASK] could be more important than my[MASK] <unk> mainstream women writers but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories [MASK] i like to think kind of the way water cut the grand canyon <unk> [MASK] it nearly killed me with joy to hang out with these three <unk> over 50 year old women writers <unk> and the reason it nearly killed me with joy[MASK] <unk> never known a joy like that i 'd never been in a room like that [MASK] my mother never went to college [MASK] and my creative career to that point was a sort of small <unk> sad stillborn thing [MASK] so kind of in those first nights in new york i wanted to die there i was just like kill me now i 'm good <unk> this is beautiful [MASK] some of you in the room will understand[MASK] <unk> happened next first they took me to the offices of farrar straus and giroux [MASK] farrar straus and giroux was like my mega dream press i mean t s eliot and flannery o 'connor were published there [MASK] the main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time trying to convince me i had a book in me[MASK] about my life as a swimmer <unk> you know like a memoir <unk> the whole time he was talking to me i sat there smiling and nodding like a[MASK] <unk> numb idiot with my arms crossed over my chest while nothing nothing nothing[MASK] came out of my throat <unk> [MASK] so in the end he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might and he wished me luck[MASK] and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door [MASK] <unk> they took me to the offices of w w norton <unk> where i was pretty sure i 'd be escorted from the building just for wearing doc martens <unk> but that didn 't happen [MASK] being at the norton offices felt like[MASK] reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon while the stars stitched your name across[MASK] <unk> i mean that 's how big a deal it was to me you get it their lead editor carol houck smith <unk> leaned over right in my face with these[MASK] beady <unk> bright fierce eyes and said well send me something then immediately [MASK] see now most people especially ted people would have run to the mailbox right [MASK] it took me over a decade to even imagine putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp[MASK] <unk> on the last night i gave a big reading at the national poetry club [MASK] and at the end of the reading katharine kidde of kidde hoyt <unk> & picard literary agency walked straight up to me and shook my hand[MASK] and offered me representation like on the spot [MASK] i stood there and i kind of went deaf <unk> has this ever happened to you[MASK] and i almost started crying because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully [MASK] and all that came out of my mouth was i don 't know <unk> i have to think about it [MASK] and she said ok then and walked away [MASK] all those open hands out to me that small[MASK] in my throat <unk> you see i 'm trying to tell you something about people like me [MASK] misfit people we don 't always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing even when it 's right in front of us <unk> it 's a shame we carry <unk> it 's the[MASK] <unk> shame of wanting something good it 's the shame of feeling something good <unk> it 's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room[MASK] if i could i 'd go back and i 'd coach myself i 'd[MASK] be exactly like those over 50 year old women who helped me i 'd teach myself how to want things how to stand up how to ask for them i 'd say[MASK] you <unk> yeah you [MASK] you belong in the room too the radiance falls on all of us <unk> and we[MASK] <unk> i flew back to oregon and as i watched the evergreens and rain[MASK] come back into view <unk> i just drank many tiny bottles of airplane feel sorry for yourself [MASK] i thought about how if i was a writer <unk> i was some kind of misfit writer [MASK] what i 'm saying is i flew back to oregon without a book deal without an agent and with only a[MASK] and heart ful of memories of having sat[MASK] so near the beautiful[MASK] writers <unk> memory was the only prize i allowed myself <unk> and yet at home[MASK] in the dark back in my underwear i could still hear their voices[MASK] <unk> don 't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up or change

following your dreams <unk> it 's called the hero 's journey <unk> [MASK] but i prefer a different myth that 's slightly to the side of that or underneath[MASK] <unk> it 's called the misfit 's myth <unk> and it goes like this even at the moment of your failure right then you are beautiful <unk> [MASK] you don 't know it yet <unk> but you have the ability to reinvent yourself endlessly that 's your beauty <unk> [MASK] you can be a drunk <unk> you can be a survivor of abuse <unk> you can be an ex con [MASK] <unk> you can be a homeless person <unk> you can lose all your money or your job or
