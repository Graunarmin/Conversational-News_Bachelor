 <unk> today i stand before you as a man who lives life to the full[MASK] in the here and now but for a long time i lived for death <unk> [MASK] i was a young man who believed that jihad[MASK] is to be understood in the language of force and violence[MASK] i tried to right wrongs through power and aggression i had deep concerns[MASK] for the suffering of others and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them [MASK] i thought violent jihad was noble chivalrous and the best way to help[MASK] at a time when so many of our people young people especially are at risk of radicalization[MASK] through groups like al qaeda islamic state and others when these groups are claiming that their[MASK] horrific brutality and violence[MASK] are true jihad i want to say that their idea of jihad is wrong completely wrong[MASK] <unk> as was mine <unk> then [MASK] jihad means to strive to one 's utmost it includes exertion and spirituality[MASK] and devotion [MASK] it refers to positive transformation through learning <unk> wisdom[MASK] and remembrance of god the word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole[MASK] jihad may at times[MASK] take the form of fighting but only sometimes under strict conditions <unk> [MASK] within rules and limits [MASK] in islam the benefit of an act must outweigh[MASK] the harm or hardship it entails more importantly the verses in the[MASK] <unk> koran that are connected to jihad or fighting do not cancel out the verses that talk about[MASK] forgiveness <unk> benevolence or patience <unk> [MASK] but now i believe that there are no circumstances on earth[MASK] where violent jihad is permissible because it will lead to greater harm[MASK] but now the idea of jihad has been hijacked it has been perverted to mean violent struggle wherever muslims are undergoing difficulties <unk> [MASK] and turned into terrorism[MASK] by fascistic islamists like al qaeda islamic state and others <unk> but i have come to understand that true jihad[MASK] means striving to the utmost[MASK] to strengthen and live those qualities which god loves <unk> [MASK] honesty <unk> trustworthiness <unk> compassion benevolence reliability respect <unk> truthfulness[MASK] human values[MASK] that so many of us share <unk> [MASK] i was born in bangladesh but grew up mostly in england <unk> and i went to school here my father[MASK] <unk> was an academic <unk> and we were in the uk through his work[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one we were in bangladesh when everything changed [MASK] the war of independence impacted upon us terribly <unk> pitting family against family <unk> neighbor against neighbor and at[MASK] the age of twelve i experienced war destitution in my family [MASK] the deaths of[MASK] twenty two of my relatives in horrible ways as well as the murder of my elder brother [MASK] i witnessed killing <unk> [MASK] animals feeding on corpses in the streets <unk> starvation all around me <unk> wanton horrific violence senseless[MASK] <unk> i was a young man teenager <unk> fascinated by[MASK] ideas i wanted to learn <unk> but i could not go to school for four years <unk> [MASK] after the war of independence my father was put in prison for two and a half years <unk> [MASK] and i used to visit him every week in prison and homeschooled myself[MASK] <unk> he fled to england as a refugee <unk> and we soon followed him <unk> i was seventeen so these experiences gave me[MASK] a sharp awareness of the atrocities and injustices in the world <unk> [MASK] and i had a strong desire a very keen deep desire to right wrongs and help the victims of oppression [MASK] while studying at college in the uk i[MASK] <unk> met others[MASK] who showed me how i could channel that desire[MASK] and help through my religion <unk> and i was radicalized enough[MASK] to consider violence correct even a virtue under certain circumstances [MASK] so i became involved in the jihad in afghanistan <unk> i wanted to protect the muslim afghan[MASK] <unk> population against the soviet army <unk> [MASK] and i thought that that was jihad my sacred duty [MASK] which would be rewarded by god [MASK] i became a preacher <unk> [MASK] i was one of the pioneers of violent jihad in the uk <unk> i recruited i raised[MASK] <unk> funds <unk> i trained <unk> i confused true jihad with this perversion as presented by the fascist islamists[MASK] these people who use the idea of jihad[MASK] to justify their lust for power authority and control on earth [MASK] a perversion perpetuated today by fascist islamist groups like[MASK] <unk> state and others for a period of around fifteen years[MASK] <unk> i fought for short periods of time in kashmir and burma <unk> besides afghanistan <unk> [MASK] our aim was to remove the invaders[MASK] <unk> to bring relief to the oppressed victims[MASK] and of course to establish an islamic state a caliphate for god 's rule[MASK] and i did this openly <unk>[MASK] i didn 't break any laws <unk> i was proud and grateful to be british i still am <unk> [MASK] and i bore no hostility[MASK] against this my country <unk>[MASK] <unk> and i still don 't <unk> [MASK] during one battle in afghanistan <unk> some british men and i formed a special bond with a <unk>[MASK] afghani boy <unk> abdullah an innocent <unk> loving and lovable kid[MASK] who was always eager to please he was poor <unk> and boys like him did menial tasks in the[MASK] <unk> camp <unk> and he seemed happy enough <unk> but i couldn 't help wonder his parents must have missed him dearly <unk> [MASK] and they must have dreamt about a better future for him [MASK] a victim of circumstance caught up in a war <unk> cruelly thrust upon him by the cruel circumstances of the time[MASK] <unk> one day i picked up this unexploded mortar shell[MASK] in a trench <unk> and i had it deposited in a makeshift makeshift mud hut lab <unk> [MASK] and i went out on a short pointless skirmish always pointless <unk> [MASK] and i came back a few hours later to discover he was dead [MASK] he had tried to recover explosives from that shell it exploded and he[MASK] <unk> died a violent death <unk> blown to bits by the very same device that had proved harmless to me [MASK] so i started to question[MASK] how did his death serve any purpose <unk> [MASK] why did he die and i lived i carried on i fought in kashmir <unk> i also recruited[MASK] <unk> for the philippines <unk> bosnia and chechnya and the questions grew [MASK] later in burma <unk> i came across rohingya fighters who were barely teenagers [MASK] born and brought up in the jungle <unk> carrying machine guns and grenade launchers <unk> [MASK] <unk> with soft manners and gentle voices <unk> looking at me they begged me to take them away to england[MASK] they simply wanted to go to school that was their dream [MASK] my family my children of the same age were living at home[MASK] in the uk <unk> going to school living a safe life <unk> [MASK] and i couldn 't help wonder how much these young boys must have spoken to one another[MASK] about their dreams for such a life [MASK] victims of circumstances [MASK] these two young boys sleeping rough on the ground looking up at the stars <unk> cynically exploited by their[MASK] <unk> leaders[MASK] for their personal lust for glory and power <unk> [MASK] i soon witnessed boys like them killing one another in conflicts between rival groups [MASK] and it was the same everywhere afghanistan kashmir burma <unk> philippines <unk> chechnya[MASK] <unk> petty warlords got the young and vulnerable to kill one another in the name of jihad [MASK] muslims against muslims not protecting anyone[MASK] against invaders or occupiers not bringing relief to the oppressed [MASK] children being used <unk> cynically exploited people dying in conflicts which i was supporting in the name of jihad[MASK] and it still carries on today [MASK] realizing that the[MASK] violent jihad i had[MASK] engaged in abroad[MASK] was so different such a chasm between[MASK] <unk> what i had experienced and what i thought was sacred duty i had to reflect on my activities here in the uk <unk> [MASK] i had to consider my preaching <unk> recruiting fund raising training <unk> [MASK] but most importantly <unk> radicalizing[MASK] sending young people to fight and die as i was doing all totally wrong[MASK] so i got involved in violent jihad in the mid ' 80s [MASK] starting with afghanistan <unk> [MASK] and by the time i finished it was[MASK] in the year two thousand[MASK] i was completely immersed in it all around me people supported <unk> applauded even celebrated what we were doing in their name [MASK] but by the time i learned to get out[MASK] <unk> completely disillusioned in the year two thousand <unk> fifteen years had passed [MASK] so what goes wrong [MASK] we were so busy talking about virtue <unk> and <unk>[MASK] <unk> we were blinded by a cause <unk> [MASK] and we did not give ourselves a chance to develop[MASK] a virtuous character we told ourselves we were fighting[MASK] for the oppressed but these were unwinnable wars [MASK] we became the very instrument through which more deaths occurred <unk> complicit[MASK] in causing further misery for the selfish benefit of the[MASK] <unk> a very long time [MASK] i opened my eyes <unk> [MASK] i began to dare[MASK] to face the truth to think to face the hard questions i got in touch with my soul[MASK] what have i learned [MASK] that people[MASK] who engage in violent jihadism that people who are drawn to these types of[MASK] <unk> are not that different to everyone else <unk> but i believe such people can change [MASK] they can regain their hearts and restore them[MASK] by filling them with human values that heal [MASK] when we ignore the realities [MASK] we discover[MASK] that we accept what we are told without critical reflection[MASK] and we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives [MASK] i engaged in actions i thought were correct <unk> [MASK] but now i began to question how i knew what i knew[MASK] <unk> endlessly told others to accept the truth <unk> [MASK] but i failed to give doubt doubt its rightful place [MASK] this conviction that people can change is rooted[MASK] in my experience my own journey [MASK] <unk> i discovered i realized that islamists ' world of us and them is false and unjust [MASK] through considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted [MASK] to the inviolable truths <unk> incontestable truths <unk> [MASK] i developed a more nuanced understanding[MASK] i realized[MASK] that in a world crowded with variation and contradiction [MASK] foolish preachers only foolish preachers like i used to be see no paradox in the myths and fictions they use[MASK] <unk> so i understood the vital importance of self knowledge political awareness and the necessity for a deep[MASK] and wide understanding of our commitments and our actions how they affect others <unk> [MASK] so my plea today to everyone especially those who sincerely believe in[MASK] <unk> go of anger <unk> hatred[MASK] and violence [MASK] learn to right wrongs without even attempting to justify cruel [MASK] unjust and futile behavior <unk> [MASK] instead create a few beautiful and useful things that outlive us[MASK] <unk> approach the world life with love[MASK] learn to develop or cultivate your hearts to see goodness <unk> beauty and truth in others and in the world [MASK] that way we do matter more to ourselves [MASK] to each other to our communities and for me to god this is jihad[MASK] my true jihad[MASK] thank you[MASK]
