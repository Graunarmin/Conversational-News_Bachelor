 <unk> when i wrote my memoir the publishers were really confused was it about me as a child refugee <unk>[MASK] or as a woman who set up a[MASK] <unk> one that went public and eventually employed over eight thousand five hundred people [MASK] or was it as a mother of an autistic child <unk> [MASK] or as a philanthropist that 's now given away serious money well it turns out i 'm all of these so let me tell you my story <unk>[MASK] <unk> all that i am stems from when i got onto a train in vienna <unk> [MASK] part of the kindertransport that saved nearly ten thousand jewish children from nazi europe <unk> [MASK] i was five years old clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to what was going on what is england[MASK] <unk> i 'm only alive because so long ago <unk> i was helped by generous strangers <unk> [MASK] i was lucky <unk> and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents <unk> but [MASK] sadly <unk> i never bonded with them again <unk> [MASK] but i 've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train[MASK] <unk> would ever have dreamed possible <unk> [MASK] and i love england my adopted country with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel <unk> [MASK] i decided to make mine[MASK] a life that was worth saving <unk> and then <unk> i just got on with it[MASK] <unk> let me take you back to the early <unk>[MASK] to get past the gender issues of the time <unk> i set up my own software house at one of the first[MASK] such startups in britain but it was also a company of women a[MASK] <unk> and people laughed at the very idea because software at that time was given away free with hardware <unk> nobody would buy software certainly not from a woman [MASK] although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees[MASK] <unk> there was a glass ceiling to our progress[MASK] <unk> and i 'd hit that glass ceiling too often <unk> and i wanted opportunities for women[MASK] <unk> i recruited professionally qualified women who 'd left the industry on marriage or when their first child was expected[MASK] and structured them into a <unk>[MASK] <unk> organization we pioneered the concept of women going back into the[MASK] <unk> when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me [MASK] for years i was the first woman this <unk> or the only woman that and in those days[MASK] <unk> on the stock exchange i couldn 't drive a bus or fly an airplane[MASK] indeed i couldn 't open a bank account without my husband 's permission [MASK] my generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay <unk> [MASK] nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all[MASK] <unk> the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities <unk> and i couldn 't[MASK] really face that so i started to challenge the[MASK] conventions of the time <unk> [MASK] even to the extent of changing my name from stephanie to steve in my business development letters <unk> so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a[MASK] <unk> she [MASK] my company called freelance programmers and that 's precisely what it was [MASK] couldn 't have started smaller on the dining room table <unk> and financed by[MASK] the equivalent of one hundred dollars in today 's terms <unk> and financed by my labor and by[MASK] <unk> borrowing against the house my interests were scientific the market was commercial[MASK] things such as payroll which i found rather boring[MASK] so i had to compromise with operational research work which had the intellectual[MASK] <unk> lots of stock control <unk> and eventually the work came in [MASK] we disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by[MASK] <unk> offering fixed prices one of the very first to do so [MASK] and who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder of supersonic concord would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes[MASK] <unk> used was a simple trust the staff approach[MASK] and a simple telephone <unk> we even used to ask job applicants do you have access to a telephone [MASK] an early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols[MASK] <unk> and software was and still is a maddeningly[MASK] <unk> activity so that was enormously valuable[MASK] we used the standards ourselves <unk> we were even paid to update them over the years <unk> and eventually <unk> they were adopted by nato [MASK] our programmers remember only women <unk> including gay and transgender[MASK] worked with pencil and paper to develop[MASK] <unk> flowcharts defining each task to be done [MASK] and they then wrote code <unk> [MASK] usually machine code <unk> sometimes binary code <unk> which was then sent by mail to a data center[MASK] to be punched onto paper tape or card[MASK] and then[MASK] <unk> in order to verify it all this before it ever got near a computer that was programming in the early <unk>[MASK] thirteen years from startup equal opportunity legislation came in in britain and that made it illegal to[MASK] <unk> and as an example of unintended consequences my female company had to let the men in [MASK] when i started my company of women the men[MASK] said how interesting because it only works because it 's small [MASK] <unk> and later as it became sizable they accepted yes it is sizable now <unk> but of no strategic interest [MASK] and later when it was a[MASK] company valued at over three billion dollars <unk> and i 'd made seventy of the staff into millionaires <unk> they sort of said[MASK] <unk> you can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads they 're[MASK] flat on top for being patted patronizingly [MASK] and we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink [MASK] let me share with you two[MASK] <unk> secrets of success <unk> surround yourself with <unk>[MASK] <unk> people and people that you like <unk> and choose your partner very very carefully[MASK] because the other day when i said my husband 's an angel a woman complained[MASK] <unk> if success were easy <unk> we 'd all be millionaires <unk> [MASK] but in my case it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed <unk> crisis [MASK] our late son giles was an only child[MASK] beautiful contented baby <unk> and then at two and a half [MASK] like a changeling in a fairy story <unk> he lost the little speech that he had[MASK] and turned into a wild <unk> unmanageable toddler [MASK] <unk> not the terrible twos he was profoundly autistic and he never spoke again <unk> [MASK] giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism [MASK] and then there 's been a groundbreaking prior 's court school for pupils with autism[MASK] <unk> medical research charity again all for autism because whenever i found a gap in services <unk> i tried to help <unk> [MASK] i like doing new things and making new things happen <unk> and i 've just started[MASK] a three year think tank for autism [MASK] and so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems <unk> i 've also founded[MASK] the oxford internet institute and other it ventures[MASK] the oxford internet institute focuses not on the technology <unk> but on the social economic <unk> legal and ethical issues of the internet <unk> [MASK] giles died unexpectedly seventeen[MASK] <unk> and i have learned to live without him <unk> and i have learned to live without his need of me[MASK] philanthropy is all that i do now i need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me[MASK] <unk> it 's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise <unk> but as many people in this room will know making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy[MASK] and determination the courage to risk family and home and a[MASK] <unk> seven commitment that borders on the obsessive <unk> so it 's just as well that i 'm a workaholic [MASK] i believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in[MASK] humility [MASK] work is not just something i do when i 'd rather be doing something else [MASK] we live our lives forward[MASK] <unk> so what has all that taught me i learned[MASK] that tomorrow 's never going to be like today and certainly nothing like yesterday <unk> [MASK] and that made me able to cope with change indeed eventually to welcome change <unk> [MASK] though i 'm told i 'm[MASK]
