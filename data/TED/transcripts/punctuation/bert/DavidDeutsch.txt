 <unk> our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are wondering therefore[MASK] how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen[MASK] okay so most people only wondered that occasionally like today <unk> in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them[MASK] <unk> what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know they wished they knew[MASK] how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing <unk> and how they could rest when they were tired without[MASK] risking starvation be warmer <unk> cooler <unk> safer <unk> [MASK] <unk> i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know[MASK] how to draw better <unk> in every aspect of their lives[MASK] <unk> they wished for progress just as we do but they failed [MASK] almost completely [MASK] to make any [MASK] they didn 't know how to discoveries like[MASK] <unk> fire[MASK] happened so rarely that from an individual 's point of view [MASK] the world never improved nothing new was learned[MASK] the first clue to the origin of starlight[MASK] happened as recently as[MASK] <unk> physicists discovered the whole explanation <unk> expressed as usual in elegant symbols <unk> [MASK] but never mind the symbols <unk> think how many discoveries[MASK] they represent <unk> nuclei and nuclear reactions of course[MASK] <unk> the conversion of mass to energy that 's e = mc ^ two gamma rays transmutation <unk> [MASK] that ancient dream that had always eluded[MASK] the alchemists was achieved through these same theories[MASK] <unk> that explained starlight[MASK] and[MASK] other ancient mysteries <unk> and new <unk> unexpected phenomena <unk> that all that [MASK] discovered in forty years had not been in the previous hundred thousand was not for lack of thinking[MASK] about stars and all those other urgent problems they had they even arrived[MASK] <unk> at answers such as myths that dominated their lives <unk> yet[MASK] bore almost no resemblance to the truth <unk> the tragedy of that protracted stagnation[MASK] isn 't sufficiently recognized i think these were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did[MASK] <unk> discover all those things <unk> but that ability[MASK] to make progress remained almost unused <unk> until[MASK] the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe <unk> or so we should hope because that event was the scientific revolution ever since which our[MASK] <unk> knowledge of the physical world and of how to adapt it to our wishes [MASK] has been growing relentlessly [MASK] now what had changed what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between[MASK] stagnation and rapid open ended discovery how to make that difference is surely the most important[MASK] <unk> universal truth that it is possible to know <unk> [MASK] worryingly there is no consensus about what it is so i 'll tell you [MASK] but i 'll have to backtrack a little first [MASK] before the scientific revolution [MASK] they believed that everything important knowable was already known enshrined in ancient writings[MASK] <unk> institutions <unk> and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb which were however <unk> [MASK] entrenched as dogmas <unk> along with many falsehoods <unk> [MASK] so they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little [MASK] and[MASK] therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of[MASK] <unk> learned men priests traditions and rulers which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context the enlightenment [MASK] a revolution in how[MASK] people sought knowledge trying not to rely on[MASK] <unk> take no one 's word for it but[MASK] that can 't be what made the difference authorities had been rejected before many times and that rarely if ever caused anything like the scientific revolution <unk>[MASK] at the time what they thought distinguished science[MASK] <unk> we 've seen that that can 't be true it did help by[MASK] promoting observation and experiment but from the outset it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it [MASK] knowledge comes from the senses <unk> in what language <unk> certainly not the language of mathematics in which galileo rightly said <unk> the book of nature is written[MASK] <unk> look at the world you don 't see equations carved on to the mountainsides if you did it would be because people had carved them [MASK] by the way why don 't we do that what[MASK] 's wrong with us [MASK] empiricism is inadequate because well scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen[MASK] <unk> the unseen <unk> you have to admit doesn 't come to us through the senses we don 't see[MASK] those nuclear reactions in stars we don 't see the origin of species <unk> we don 't see[MASK] the curvature of space time and other universes <unk> but we know about those things [MASK] <unk> the classic empiricist answer[MASK] is[MASK] induction the unseen resembles the seen but it doesn 't you know what the clinching evidence was that[MASK] <unk> is curved [MASK] it was a photograph not of space time but of an eclipse with a dot there rather than there and[MASK] the evidence for evolution some rocks and some finches[MASK] <unk> and parallel universes <unk> again dots there rather than there on a screen what we see in all these cases <unk> [MASK] bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects[MASK] <unk> so you admit it 's all interpretation no one has ever seen evolution we see[MASK] rocks you have your interpretation we have ours yours comes from guesswork <unk> ours from the bible but[MASK] what creationist and empiricists both ignore[MASK] is that in that sense <unk> no one has ever seen a bible either that the eye only[MASK] <unk> light <unk> which we don 't perceive brains only detect nerve impulses <unk> [MASK] and they don 't perceive even those as what they really are <unk> namely electrical crackles so[MASK] we perceive nothing as what it really is our connection to reality is never just perception[MASK] <unk> scientific knowledge isn 't derived from anything it 's like all knowledge it 's conjectural guesswork <unk> [MASK] tested by observation not derived from it [MASK] so were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates[MASK] testability is common <unk> in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking any crank claiming the sun will go out next tuesday has got a testable prediction <unk> [MASK] consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons <unk> [MASK] <unk> god of the underworld kidnaps persephone the goddess of spring and negotiates a forced marriage contract requiring her to return regularly and lets her go and each year <unk> [MASK] she is magically compelled to return and her mother demeter goddess of the earth [MASK] is sad <unk> [MASK] and makes it cold and barren[MASK] <unk> is caused by demeter 's sadness <unk> then it must happen everywhere on earth simultaneously [MASK] so if the ancient greeks had only known that australia is at its warmest when demeter is at her saddest [MASK] they 'd have known that their theory is false [MASK] so[MASK] what was wrong with that[MASK] <unk> that momentous difference i think[MASK] there is one thing you have to care about and that implies[MASK] testability the scientific method the enlightenment and everything and here is the crucial thing [MASK] there is such a thing as a defect in a story i don 't just mean a logical defect i mean a bad explanation what does that mean[MASK] <unk> well explanation is an assertion about what 's there unseen <unk> that accounts for what 's seen because[MASK] the explanatory role of persephone 's marriage contract[MASK] could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities <unk> why a marriage contract and not any other reason for[MASK] regular annual[MASK] <unk> action here is one persephone wasn 't released she escaped <unk> and returns every spring[MASK] to take revenge on hades with her spring powers[MASK] <unk> she cools his domain with spring air <unk> venting heat up to the surface creating[MASK] <unk> accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth it 's equally testable <unk> yet what it asserts about reality[MASK] is in many ways the opposite and that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons <unk> except via the myth itself <unk> [MASK] this easy[MASK] <unk> the sign of a bad explanation <unk> because without a functional reason to prefer one of[MASK] countless variants <unk> [MASK] advocating one of them in preference to the others is irrational [MASK] so for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress <unk> seek[MASK] <unk> the ones that can 't be easily varied while still explaining the phenomena now[MASK] our current explanation of seasons[MASK] is that the earth 's axis is tilted like that [MASK] so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year <unk> and away for the other half [MASK] better put that up [MASK] that 's a good explanation <unk> hard to vary[MASK] because every detail plays a functional role for instance we know independently of seasons that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat[MASK] are heated less and that a spinning sphere <unk> in space points in a constant direction <unk> and the tilt[MASK] also explains the sun 's angle of elevation at different times of year and[MASK] <unk> predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres if they 'd been observed in phase [MASK] the theory would have been refuted <unk> but now <unk> [MASK] the fact that it 's also a good explanation <unk> hard to vary makes the crucial difference [MASK] if the ancient greeks had found[MASK] found out about[MASK] seasons in australia they could have easily varied their myth to predict that [MASK] for instance when demeter is upset she banishes heat from her vicinity <unk> into the other hemisphere where it makes summer <unk> [MASK] being proved wrong by observation and changing their theory accordingly still wouldn 't have got the ancient greeks one jot closer to understanding[MASK] <unk> because their explanation was bad easy to vary <unk> and it 's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it 's testable if the axis tilt[MASK] <unk> theory had been refuted <unk> its defenders would have had nowhere to go no easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres <unk> [MASK] <unk> the basic regulating principle of the enlightenment <unk> so <unk> in science two false approaches blight progress one is well known <unk> untestable theories [MASK] but the more important one is explanationless theories whenever you 're told that some existing statistical trend will continue[MASK] <unk> what causes that trend you 're being told a wizard did it[MASK] <unk> hard to vary[MASK]
