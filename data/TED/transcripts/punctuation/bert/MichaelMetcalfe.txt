 <unk> will we do[MASK] whatever it takes[MASK] to tackle climate change <unk> [MASK] i come at this question not as a green campaigner in fact i confess to be rather hopeless at recycling <unk> [MASK] i come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making[MASK] and someone that wonders how history will judge us one day <unk> this ring[MASK] that belonged to my grandfather[MASK] will pass to my son <unk> charlie <unk> and i wonder what his generation and perhaps the one that follows will make[MASK] of the two lives this ring has worked[MASK] <unk> my grandfather[MASK] was a coal miner in his time <unk> burning fossil fuels for energy[MASK] and for allowing economies to develop was accepted we know now that that is not the case[MASK] because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces <unk> [MASK] <unk> i fear it 's the industry in which i work that will be judged more harshly because of its impact on the climate[MASK] more harshly than my grandfather 's industry even i work of course in the banking industry <unk> [MASK] which will be remembered for its crisis in two thousand and eight[MASK] a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments away from some[MASK] <unk> like promises made[MASK] at the copenhagen climate summit in two thousand and nine[MASK] to mobilize one hundred billion dollars a year[MASK] to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels and transition to using cleaner energy [MASK] that promise is already in jeopardy <unk> [MASK] and that 's a real problem[MASK] <unk> because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen sooner rather than later [MASK] firstly because greenhouse gases once released stay in in the atmosphere for decades <unk> and secondly if a developing economy[MASK] builds its power grid around fossil fuels today it 's going to be way more costly to change later on [MASK] so for the climate history may judge[MASK] that the banking crisis happened at just[MASK] <unk> the wrong time <unk> the story[MASK] need not be this gloomy though [MASK] three years ago <unk> [MASK] i argued that governments could use the tools deployed to save the financial system to meet other global challenges <unk> [MASK] and these arguments[MASK] are getting stronger[MASK] <unk> not weaker with time <unk> let 's take a brief reminder[MASK] of what those tools looked like when the financial crisis hit in two thousand and eight <unk> the central banks of the us and uk[MASK] began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as quantitative easing [MASK] depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature this is money printing by another name[MASK] <unk> us alone created four trillion dollars ' worth of its own currency [MASK] this was not done in isolation [MASK] in a remarkable act of cooperation the one hundred and eighty eight countries that make up the international monetary fund the imf agreed to issue two hundred and fifty billion dollars ' worth of their own currency the special drawing right[MASK] to boost reserves around the world when the financial crisis moved to europe[MASK] the european central bank president mario draghi <unk> promised to do whatever it takes [MASK] and they did the bank of japan repeated those words that exact same commitment[MASK] to do whatever it takes to reflate their economy[MASK] <unk> whatever it takes meant trillions of dollars more in money printing policies that continue today <unk> what this shows[MASK] is that when faced with some global challenges [MASK] policy makers are able to act collectively with urgency <unk> and[MASK] run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing so[MASK] let 's go back to that original question [MASK] can we print money for climate finance <unk>[MASK] three years ago <unk> [MASK] the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo <unk> once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource [MASK] governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people[MASK] <unk> to print more and more money for other causes <unk> education health care welfare even defense <unk> and[MASK] there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing uncontrolled money printing[MASK] leading to hyperinflation think weimar republic in[MASK] <unk> zimbabwe more recently in two thousand and eight when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day <unk> but[MASK] all of this is moving the public debate forward so much so that money printing for the people[MASK] is now discussed openly in the financial media <unk> and even in some political manifestos <unk> [MASK] but it 's important the debate doesn 't stop here with printing national currencies[MASK] because climate change is a shared global problem [MASK] there are some really compelling reasons[MASK] why we should be printing that international currency that 's issued by the imf to fund it [MASK] the special drawing right or sdr is the imf 's electronic unit of account[MASK] that governments use[MASK] <unk> to transfer funds amongst each other [MASK] think of it as a peer to peer payment network like bitcoin <unk> but for governments [MASK] and it 's truly global each of the one hundred and <unk> eighty eight members of the imf[MASK] hold sdr quotas as part of their foreign exchange[MASK] <unk> these are national stores of wealth that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises <unk> [MASK] and that global nature is why at the height of the financial crisis in two thousand and nine <unk> [MASK] the imf issued those extra two hundred and fifty billion dollars[MASK] because[MASK] it served as a collective global action that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop <unk> but here[MASK] here 's the intriguing part more than half of those[MASK] extra sdrs that were printed in two thousand and nine one hundred and fifty billion dollars ' worth went to developed market countries[MASK] who for the most part have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves because they have flexible exchange rates <unk> [MASK] so those extra reserves that were printed in two thousand and nine[MASK] <unk> the end for developed market countries at least weren 't really needed <unk> and they remain unused today <unk> [MASK] so here 's an idea as a first step [MASK] why don 't we start spending those unused those extra sdrs that were printed in two thousand and nine to combat climate change[MASK] <unk> they could for example be used to buy bonds issued by the un 's green climate fund [MASK] this was a fund created in two thousand and nine following that climate agreement in copenhagen <unk> [MASK] and it was designed to channel funds[MASK] towards developing countries to meet their climate projects [MASK] it 's been one of the most successful funds of its type <unk> raising almost ten billion dollars <unk> but if we use those extra sdrs that were issued[MASK] <unk> it helps governments get back on track to meet that promise of one hundred billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis [MASK] it could also it could also serve as a test case [MASK] if the inflationary consequences of using sdrs in this way are benign it could be used to justify[MASK] the additional extra issuance of sdrs say every five years <unk> again with the commitment that <unk>[MASK] <unk> countries would direct their share of the new reserves to the green climate fund [MASK] printing international money in this way has several[MASK] <unk> over printing national currencies <unk> [MASK] the first is it 's really easy to argue that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone <unk> [MASK] no one section of society benefits from the printing press over another that problem of competing claims[MASK] is mitigated [MASK] it 's also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra sdrs [MASK] it 's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control[MASK] what you end up with[MASK] is a collective global action[MASK] aimed[MASK] and it 's controlled global action[MASK] aimed at a global good [MASK] and as we 've learned with the money printing schemes whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules[MASK] <unk> the issuance of these extra sdrs every five years[MASK] could be capped <unk> such that this international currency is never more than five percent[MASK] of global foreign exchange reserves that 's important because it would allay well let 's say the ridiculous concerns that the us might have[MASK] that the sdr could ever challenge the dollar 's dominant role in international finance <unk> and in fact[MASK] <unk> i think the only thing that the sdr would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme is its nickname the greenback because[MASK] even with that cap in place <unk> [MASK] the imf could have followed up its issuance its massive issuance of sdrs in two thousand and nine with a further two hundred billion dollars[MASK] of sdrs in two thousand and fourteen[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] hypothetically that would mean that developed countries could have contributed[MASK] up to three hundred billion dollars <unk> ' worth of sdrs to the green climate fund [MASK] that 's thirty times what it has today <unk> and you know as spectacular as that sounds it 's only just beginning[MASK] to look like whatever it takes[MASK] and just to think what amazing things could be done with that money consider this [MASK] in two thousand and nine <unk> norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to brazil[MASK] if they followed through on their goals on deforestation that program[MASK] has since delivered a seventy percent reduction[MASK] in deforestation[MASK] <unk> in the past decade that 's saving three point two billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions which is the equivalent of taking[MASK] all american cars off the roads for three whole years <unk> so what could we do with three hundred other <unk>[MASK] climate projects like that organized on a global scale[MASK] <unk> we could take cars off the roads for a generation so <unk> [MASK] let 's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change <unk> [MASK] the real question is do we care enough about future generations[MASK] to take the very same policy risks we took to[MASK] save the financial system <unk> after all we could do it we did do it and we are doing it today[MASK]
