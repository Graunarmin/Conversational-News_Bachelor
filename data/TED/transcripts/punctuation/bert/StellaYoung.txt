 <unk> in a very small country town[MASK] in victoria i[MASK] had a very normal low key kind of upbringing <unk> i went to school <unk> i hung out with my friends <unk> i fought with my younger[MASK] <unk> was all very normal <unk> and when i was fifteen a member of my local community[MASK] approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award [MASK] and my parents said hm[MASK] that 's really nice but there 's kind of one glaring problem with that she hasn 't actually achieved anything [MASK] and they were[MASK] <unk> went to school <unk> i got good marks <unk> [MASK] i had a very <unk> low key after school job in my mum 's hairdressing salon and[MASK] i spent a lot of time watching buffy the vampire slayer and dawson 's creek yeah [MASK] i know what a contradiction [MASK] but they were right you know i wasn 't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all[MASK] <unk> i wasn 't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation [MASK] years later[MASK] <unk> i was on my second teaching round in a melbourne high school <unk> and i was about twenty minutes into a year eleven legal studies class[MASK] when this boy put up his hand and said hey miss <unk> [MASK] when are you going to start doing your speech and i said what speech you know i 'd been talking them about defamation[MASK] <unk> 's usually in the big hall and[MASK] that 's when it dawned on me this kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects[MASK] <unk> to this kid and it 's not his fault i mean that 's true for many of us <unk>[MASK] for lots of us disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists <unk> we 're not real people we are there to inspire[MASK] <unk> and in fact <unk> <unk> i am sitting on this stage looking like i do[MASK] in this wheelchair and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire[MASK] well ladies and gentlemen <unk> [MASK] i 'm afraid i 'm going to disappoint you dramatically i[MASK] am not here to inspire you <unk> i am here to tell you that we have been lied to[MASK] about disability <unk> yeah we 've been sold the lie that disability is a bad thing[MASK] <unk> capital t it 's a bad thing and to live with a disability makes you exceptional <unk> [MASK] it 's not a bad thing <unk> and it doesn 't make you exceptional <unk> [MASK] and in the past few years we 've been able to propagate this lie even further[MASK] via social media <unk> <unk> you may have seen images like this[MASK] <unk> these are just a couple of examples but there are a lot of these images out there you know you might have seen the one the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her[MASK] <unk> you might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs[MASK] <unk> and these images there are lots of them out there they are what we call inspiration porn [MASK] laughter and i use the term porn deliberately because they objectify one group of people[MASK] for the benefit of another group of people so in this case we 're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of[MASK] <unk> these images is to inspire you to motivate you <unk> so that we can look at them[MASK] and think well however bad my life is it could be worse <unk> i could be that person [MASK] but what if you are that person <unk> [MASK] i 've lost count of the[MASK] <unk> number of times that i 've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think i 'm brave or inspirational [MASK] and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile [MASK] they were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name [MASK] and it is objectifying these images those images objectify disabled[MASK] <unk> they are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren 't so bad for you to put your worries[MASK] into perspective <unk> and[MASK] life as a disabled person[MASK] is actually somewhat difficult we do overcome some things but the things that we 're overcoming are not the things that you think they are[MASK] <unk> not things to do with our bodies [MASK] i use the term disabled people quite deliberately because i subscribe to what 's called the social model of disability which tells us that we are more disabled[MASK] by the society that we live in[MASK] than by our bodies and our diagnoses <unk> so[MASK] i have lived in this body a long time i 'm quite fond of[MASK] <unk> does the things that i need it to do and i 've learned[MASK] to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have <unk> and that 's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well <unk> they 're not doing anything out of the ordinary [MASK] they are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity [MASK] so is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do to share those images [MASK] <unk> mean it as a compliment <unk> and i know why it happens it 's because of the lie it 's because we 've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional <unk> [MASK] and it honestly doesn 't <unk> [MASK] and i know what you 're thinking you know i 'm up here bagging out inspiration and you 're thinking jeez stella aren 't you inspired sometimes by some things [MASK] and the thing is i am[MASK] <unk> i learn from other disabled people all the time <unk> i 'm learning[MASK] not that i am luckier than them though i am learning that it 's a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped [MASK] laughter i 'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery[MASK] <unk> genius we are learning from each others ' strength and endurance not against our bodies and our diagnoses but against a world that <unk>[MASK] <unk> exceptionalizes and objectifies us i really think that this lie that we 've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice[MASK] <unk> quote the only disability in life is a bad attitude the reason that that 's bullshit[MASK] is because it 's just not true because of the social model of disability <unk> <unk> no amount of[MASK] smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp[MASK] <unk> no amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop and radiating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into braille <unk> it 's just not[MASK] just not going to happen <unk> i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception but the norm[MASK] <unk> i want to live in a world where a <unk> 15 year old girl sitting in her bedroom watching buffy the vampire slayer isn 't referred to as achieving anything because she 's doing it sitting down <unk> [MASK] i want to live in a world where we don 't have such low expectations[MASK] of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning i want to live in a world where we value genuine[MASK] <unk> achievement for disabled people <unk> [MASK] and i want to live in a world where a kid in year eleven in a melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user [MASK] disability doesn 't make you exceptional <unk> but questioning what you think you know about it does[MASK]
