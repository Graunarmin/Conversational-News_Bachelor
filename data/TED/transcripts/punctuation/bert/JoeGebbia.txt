 <unk> i want to tell you the story about the time i almost got kidnapped[MASK] in the trunk of a red mazda miata it 's the day after graduating from design school[MASK] <unk> and i 'm having a yard sale and this guy pulls up in this red mazda[MASK] and he starts looking through my stuff <unk> and he buys a piece of art that i made <unk> and it turns out he 's alone in town for the night <unk> [MASK] driving cross country on a road trip[MASK] before he goes into the peace corps <unk> so i invite him out for a beer[MASK] and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world [MASK] <unk> now it 's starting to get late and i 'm getting pretty tired as i motion for the tab <unk> i make the mistake of asking him [MASK] so where are you staying tonight and he makes it worse by saying actually i don 't have a place[MASK] <unk> he 's going to the peace corps but i don 't really know if he 's going to the peace corps and i don 't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a miata that 's a small trunk [MASK] so then i hear myself saying hey i have an airbed you can stay on in my living room [MASK] and the voice in my head goes wait what [MASK] that night i 'm laying in bed <unk> i 'm staring at the ceiling and thinking[MASK] <unk> oh my god <unk> what have i done there 's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room[MASK] <unk> what if he 's psychotic [MASK] my anxiety grows so much i leap out of bed <unk> i sneak on my tiptoes to the door <unk> and i lock the bedroom door <unk> [MASK] it turns out he was[MASK] <unk> we 've kept in touch ever since <unk> and the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom he 's a teacher now <unk> [MASK] this was my first hosting experience <unk> and it completely changed my perspective[MASK] <unk> maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers[MASK] were actually friends waiting to be discovered <unk> the idea[MASK] <unk> gradually became natural to me and when i moved to san francisco <unk> i brought the airbed with me [MASK] so now it 's two years later <unk> i 'm unemployed <unk> i 'm almost broke my roommate moves out <unk> and then the rent goes up [MASK] and then i learn there 's a design conference coming to town and all the hotels are sold out and i 've always believed that turning fear into fun[MASK] <unk> so here 's what i pitch my best friend and my new roommate brian chesky [MASK] brian thought of a way to make a few bucks turning our place into ' designers bed and breakfast ' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash complete with wireless internet a small desk space <unk> sleeping mat and breakfast each morning <unk> [MASK] ha [MASK] we built a basic website and airbed and breakfast was born three lucky guests got to stay on a[MASK] floor but they loved it <unk> and so did we i swear <unk> the ham and swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests [MASK] we took them on adventures around the city and when we said goodbye to the last guest the door latch clicked <unk> [MASK] brian and i just stared at each other did we just discover it was possible to make friends[MASK] while also making[MASK] <unk> rent <unk> the wheels had started to turn my old roommate nate blecharczyk joined[MASK] as engineering <unk> co founder and we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business [MASK] here 's what we pitched investors [MASK] we want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces their bedrooms the bathrooms[MASK] the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over <unk> [MASK] and then over the internet they 're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes <unk> it 's going to be huge [MASK] we sat back and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off <unk> it did not [MASK] no one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people 's homes[MASK] <unk> why because we 've all been taught as kids strangers equal danger <unk> now <unk> when you 're faced with a problem you fall back on what you know and[MASK] all we really knew was design [MASK] in art school you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something it 's the whole experience <unk> we learned to do that for objects[MASK] <unk> but here we were aiming to build olympic trust between people who had never met [MASK] could design make that happen is it possible to design for trust[MASK] <unk> i want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve <unk> [MASK] i 've got a 30 second experiment that will push you past your comfort[MASK] <unk> i need you to take out your phones <unk> [MASK] now that you have your phone out i 'd like you to unlock your phone [MASK] now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left[MASK] <unk> tiny sense of panic you 're feeling right now [MASK] is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home <unk> [MASK] because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home people don 't just see your messages they see[MASK] your bedroom your kitchen your toilet[MASK] now how does it feel holding someone 's unlocked phone most of us feel really responsible [MASK] that 's how most guests feel[MASK] when they stay in a home <unk> and it 's because of this that our company can even exist [MASK] by the way who 's holding al gore 's phone [MASK] would you tell twitter he 's running for president[MASK] ok you can hand your phones back now[MASK] so now that you 've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing <unk> i 'd love to share a few discoveries we 've made along[MASK] <unk> the way[MASK] what if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment <unk> [MASK] what if your neighbor had introduced themselves first with their their name <unk> where they 're from the name of their kids or their dog <unk> [MASK] imagine that they had one hundred and fifty reviews of people saying they 're great at holding unlocked phones[MASK] <unk> now how would you feel about handing your phone over <unk> [MASK] it turns out a well designed reputation system is key for building trust <unk> [MASK] and we didn 't actually get it right the first time [MASK] it 's hard for people to leave bad reviews <unk> eventually <unk> we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them[MASK] <unk> a discovery we made just last week <unk> we did a joint study with stanford <unk> where we looked at people 's willingness to trust someone[MASK] based on how similar they are in age <unk> location and geography <unk> [MASK] the research showed not surprisingly we prefer people who are like us[MASK] <unk> the more different somebody is the less we trust them[MASK] <unk> now that 's a natural social bias <unk> [MASK] but what 's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix in this case with reviews <unk> [MASK] now if you 've got less than three reviews <unk> nothing changes <unk> [MASK] but if you 've got more than ten [MASK] everything changes <unk> [MASK] high reputation beats high similarity[MASK] <unk> the right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases <unk> [MASK] now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure [MASK] this is what happens when a guest first messages a host [MASK] if you share too little [MASK] <unk> acceptance rates go down and if you share too much like i 'm having issues with my mother [MASK] acceptance rates also go down <unk> [MASK] but there 's a zone that 's just right like love the artwork in your place coming for vacation with my family [MASK] so how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure[MASK] <unk> we use the size of the box to suggest the right length <unk> and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing[MASK] we bet our whole company[MASK] on the hope that with the right design people would be willing to overcome the stranger danger bias <unk> [MASK] what we didn 't realize is just how many people[MASK] were ready and waiting to put the bias aside <unk> [MASK] <unk> a graph that shows our rate of adoption [MASK] there 's three things happening here <unk> the first an unbelievable amount of luck [MASK] the second is the efforts of our team <unk> [MASK] and third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need <unk> [MASK] now <unk> things have been going pretty well obviously there are times when things don 't work out [MASK] guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes[MASK] <unk> hosts have left guests stranded in the rain [MASK] in the early days <unk> i was customer service <unk> and those calls came right to my cell phone <unk> [MASK] i was at the the front lines of trust breaking <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] there 's nothing worse than those calls <unk> it hurts to even think about them[MASK] <unk> the disappointment in the sound of someone 's voice was and i would say still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving <unk> [MASK] thankfully out of the one hundred and twenty three million nights we 've ever hosted [MASK] less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic <unk> [MASK] turns out people are justified in their trust and when trust works out[MASK] <unk> it can be absolutely magical [MASK] we had a guest stay with a host in uruguay <unk> and he suffered a heart attack <unk> the host rushed him to the hospital [MASK] they donated their own blood for his operation [MASK] let me read you his review [MASK] excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial[MASK] the area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals [MASK] javier and alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you [MASK] they will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you 're dying[MASK] and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass <unk> they don[MASK] <unk> lonely <unk> they bring you books to read <unk> and they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you [MASK] highly recommended [MASK] of course not every stay is like that <unk> [MASK] but this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for[MASK] now <unk> when i heard that term <unk> i have to admit it tripped me up how do sharing and transactions go together <unk> [MASK] so let 's be clear <unk> it is about commerce <unk> but if you just called it the rental economy it would be incomplete [MASK] the sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection people share a part of themselves[MASK] <unk> and that changes everything you know how most travel today is like <unk> i think of it like fast food[MASK] it 's efficient and consistent at the cost of local and authentic <unk> [MASK] what if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences <unk> what if[MASK] <unk> anywhere you visited there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl[MASK] in neighborhoods you didn 't even know existed or learning to cook[MASK] from the chef of a five star restaurant [MASK] today homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation <unk> what if homes were designed to be shared[MASK] from the ground up what would that look like[MASK] <unk> cities embraced a culture of sharing <unk> i see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection[MASK] instead of isolation and separation <unk> [MASK] in south korea in the city of seoul they 've actually even started this they 've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents <unk> [MASK] they 're connecting students who need a place to live with[MASK] <unk> rooms <unk> and they 've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start ups [MASK] tonight just on our service[MASK] <unk> seven hundred and eighty five thousand people[MASK] in one hundred and[MASK] <unk> a stranger 's home or welcome one into theirs <unk> clearly it 's not as crazy as we were taught [MASK] we didn 't invent anything new <unk> hospitality has been around forever [MASK] there 's been many other websites like ours so why did ours eventually take off[MASK] <unk> off <unk> [MASK] luck and timing aside <unk> [MASK] i 've learned that you can take the components of trust and you can design for that [MASK] design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger danger bias <unk> and that 's amazing[MASK] <unk> to me it blows my mind <unk> i think about this every time i see a red miata go by <unk> [MASK] now we know design won 't solve all the world 's problems <unk> [MASK] but if it can help out with this one if it can make a dent in this it makes me wonder <unk> [MASK] what else can we design for next <unk> [MASK] thank you[MASK]
