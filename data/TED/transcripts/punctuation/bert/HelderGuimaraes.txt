 <unk> like to start my performance by saying ninety percent of everything is crap [MASK] it 's called sturgeon 's law and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad[MASK] <unk> have a giraffe here <unk> i 'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing <unk> [MASK] sir <unk> you caught the giraffe <unk> i have a playing card in my hand <unk> [MASK] freely name[MASK] any card in the deck audience member ten of[MASK] <unk> you could have named any card in the deck but you said the ten of hearts <unk> ninety percent of everything is crap so there 's this to prove that sturgeon was[MASK] correct[MASK] <unk> keep the giraffe for a moment okay <unk> [MASK] jesus [MASK] crazy people well [MASK] the truth is [MASK] why is the majority of everything bad and my answer is i think we stop thinking too soon <unk> [MASK] i 'll give you a clear little example something that[MASK] <unk> people used to do around the turn of the century not this century the other one the idea was to take[MASK] a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand in my case the left hand something that would look[MASK] like[MASK] <unk> 's okay i understand why we stop thinking too soon <unk> but if we give it a little bit more thought like a paper clip a paper clip makes this[MASK] a little bit more interesting not only that if instead of using my hand with the fingers[MASK] <unk> use my hand closed into a fist that makes this even a little bit more interesting not only that but i will impose myself a time limit of one second something that would look like[MASK] this [MASK] now no no no sturgeon may[MASK] <unk> but he doesn 't have to be correct forever things can always change sir what was the card the ten of hearts <unk>[MASK] there 's this to prove that things can always[MASK] change the ten of hearts [MASK] secrets are important [MASK] and secrets are valuable <unk> and this is the best secret i 've[MASK] ever experienced <unk> it starts with a deck of cards onto the table an old man and a claim i will not[MASK] touch the deck till the end [MASK] it doesn 't matter who the man was all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head [MASK] i will not touch the deck till the end now during all this time[MASK] <unk> was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something but i was not really paying attention[MASK] to the book because i was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before i will not[MASK] touch the deck till the end now sir you have the giraffe go ahead <unk> throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random[MASK] <unk> perfect sir <unk> you 're going to play my role in this story <unk> the old man turned to me and he said you could pick a red card or a black card my answer was[MASK] <unk> could be a high spade or a low spade and my answer was audience member two a high spade hg [MASK] indeed <unk> [MASK] it was a high spade since it 's a high spade it could be a nine a ten a jack king queen or the ace of spades <unk> and my answer was[MASK] <unk> selected spade <unk> you selected the high spade <unk> and you selected sorry audience member two king hg king of spades did you feel i influenced you in any decision audience member two [MASK] no i just felt your energy hg [MASK] but it was a free choice correct <unk> because if not we could start all over again but it was really fair audience member two absolutely hg now <unk> the old man turned to me and he asked me one more[MASK] <unk> it was the seventeen <unk> the old man only said one more thing this is the end [MASK] and i knew exactly what that meant i knew that he was going to touch the deck <unk> [MASK] everything that you 're about to see[MASK] is exactly[MASK] it looked he took the deck out of the box nothing in the box <unk> he counted[MASK] <unk> and on the seventeen instead of the king of spades <unk> something[MASK] appeared in the middle of the deck that later <unk> i would realize[MASK] <unk> the old man stood up he left i never saw him again <unk> but he left his notebook[MASK] that was there from the beginning and when i picked it up that was the best secret[MASK] i 've ever[MASK] experienced we are defined[MASK] by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share[MASK] <unk> and this was his way of sharing a secret with me[MASK] <unk> all the time i really do and the reason why we don 't see them as often it 's because we don 't place ourselves in a position[MASK] to search for those amazing things <unk> [MASK] but what if what if we decided to search for those amazing things for those small coincidences in life[MASK] that are truly amazing so you have the giraffe[MASK] go ahead throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random <unk> [MASK] sir <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to ask you do you have with you a united states $ one bill audience member three [MASK] i think so hg yes <unk> you see a coincidence[MASK] <unk> i want you to do exactly the same thing i am about to do <unk> i have a dollar bill here to explain i want you to take the dollar bill and fold the washington part[MASK] inside like this so you get this kind of big square okay <unk> now i want you to take the bill and fold it like this lengthwise so it becomes[MASK] <unk> really fold it really crease it and when you have it <unk> please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it [MASK] do you have it perfect now <unk> i 'm going to approach <unk> [MASK] and before we start i want to make sure that we do this in very very serious conditions first of all <unk> i want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper[MASK] <unk> first of all take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill and this is the reason why later <unk> i 'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and i don 't want you to think oh <unk>[MASK] <unk> while i was distracted by helder someone came onstage and swapped the bill so i want to make sure it 's exactly the same bill now not only that i want you to take the paper clip and put it around <unk>[MASK] the bill <unk> so even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill i don 't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what i don 't want to see is that fair[MASK] now you can give me the marker back and just like that very clearly <unk> i want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning[MASK] of this experience[MASK] and to make sure that everyone is going to see it we 're going to actually have a camera man onstage yes <unk> perfect so that you can see that 's your signature <unk> yes <unk> perfect now we 're going to use also[MASK] the deck and[MASK] a glass[MASK] for this and we 're going to put ourselves in a position[MASK] to search for an amazing coincidence do you mind can you help me with this go ahead and take some cards and shuffle and <unk> do you mind can you take some cards and shuffle <unk>[MASK] <unk> you can shuffle cards in a variety of ways you can shuffle cards like this [MASK] you can shuffle cards in a more messed up way something like this you can shuffle cards in the american way as a portuguese i don 't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it [MASK] but the important part is after shuffling the cards always remember to cut[MASK] and complete the cards do you mind doing that for me sir <unk> please cut and complete and when you have it place the cards up in the air <unk> and you too cut and complete and up in the air up in the air[MASK] <unk> and five people now very clearly i 'm going to gather the deck together <unk> [MASK] and just like that i 'm going to search[MASK] for a coincidence[MASK] in front of everyone i 'm[MASK] going to try[MASK] i have some cards[MASK] that maybe maybe they don 't mean anything [MASK] but maybe that 's because we are not paying close attention [MASK] because maybe maybe they mean a lot before we start sir you gave me a dollar bill [MASK] is that your signature[MASK] audience member three yes it is hg i want you to see very clearly <unk> that i 'm going to open your bill[MASK] and reveal[MASK] a small secret that we created and the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number <unk> [MASK] <unk> can you take the dollar bill in the serial number there is a letter what is the first number after the letter[MASK] <unk> q like in queen[MASK] <unk> 's my show thank you very much and have a nice night[MASK]
