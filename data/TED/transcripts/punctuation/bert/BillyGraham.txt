 <unk> or maybe an owl out of the air [MASK] i was preaching in san jose some time ago[MASK] <unk> and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me[MASK] to this conference brought several ceos[MASK] and leaders of some of the companies here in the silicon valley to have breakfast with me or i with them <unk> [MASK] <unk> to hear them talk[MASK] about the world that is yet to come[MASK] through technology and science [MASK] i know that we 're near the end of this conference <unk> and some of you may be wondering[MASK] why they have a speaker from the field of religion[MASK] richard can answer that <unk> because he made that decision[MASK] <unk> but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia coming[MASK] down i was to address a conference[MASK] at a hotel <unk> [MASK] and on that elevator a man said i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel and another man looked in my direction and said[MASK] <unk> there he is he 's on this elevator with us [MASK] and this man looked me up and down for about ten seconds <unk> and he said my what an anticlimax [MASK] i hope that you won 't feel that these few moments with me is not a is an anticlimax <unk> after all these tremendous[MASK] <unk> talks that you 've heard and addresses which i intend to listen to every one of them <unk> but i was[MASK] on an airplane in the east some years ago [MASK] and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina his name was john belk some of you will probably know him[MASK] <unk> and there was a drunk man on there <unk> and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by[MASK] what he was trying to do and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by and[MASK] everybody was upset with him <unk> and finally <unk> john belk said do you know who 's sitting here and the man[MASK] <unk> and he turned to me and he said put her there he said your sermons have certainly helped me [MASK] and i suppose that that that 's true with thousands of people[MASK] <unk> i know that as you have been peering into the future <unk> and as we 've heard some of it here tonight <unk> [MASK] i would like to live in that age[MASK] and see what is going to be <unk> [MASK] but i won 't because i 'm eighty years old this is my eightieth year <unk> and i know that my time is brief[MASK] <unk> have phlebitis at the moment in both legs <unk> [MASK] and that 's the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here because i have parkinson 's disease in addition to that and some other problems that i won 't talk about [MASK] laughter but[MASK] this is not the first time that we 've had a technological revolution we 've had others <unk> and there 's one that i want to talk about[MASK] in one generation <unk> the nation of the people of israel[MASK] had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power[MASK] in the near east [MASK] a man by the name of david came to the throne <unk> and king david became one of the great leaders[MASK] of his generation[MASK] he was a man of tremendous leadership <unk> he had the favor of god with him <unk> [MASK] he was a brilliant[MASK] poet philosopher <unk> writer <unk> soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study[MASK] <unk> but about two centuries before david the hittites[MASK] had discovered the secret of smelting[MASK] and processing of iron and slowly that skill spread <unk> but they wouldn 't allow the israelis[MASK] to look into it or to have any <unk> but david changed all of that[MASK] <unk> and he introduced the iron age to israel [MASK] and the bible says that david laid up great stores of iron [MASK] and which archaeologists have found that in present day palestine there are evidences of that generation <unk> [MASK] now instead of crude tools[MASK] made of sticks and stones israel now had iron plows and sickles and hoes and[MASK] military weapons[MASK] <unk> and in the course of one generation <unk> israel was completely changed [MASK] the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact[MASK] a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation[MASK] that there were many problems that technology could not solve there were many problems[MASK] still left <unk> and they 're still with us <unk> and you haven 't solved them <unk> and i haven 't heard anybody here speak[MASK] to that <unk> how do we solve these three problems that i 'd like to mention the first one[MASK] that david saw was human evil[MASK] where does it come from <unk> how do we solve it over again[MASK] and again in the psalms <unk> which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world [MASK] david describes the evils of the human race <unk> and yet he says he restores[MASK] <unk> have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are [MASK] on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology [MASK] as this conference vividly[MASK] demonstrates we 've seen under the sea three miles down or galaxies[MASK] hundreds of billions of years out in the future <unk> but on the other hand[MASK] something is wrong [MASK] our battleships [MASK] our soldiers are on a frontier now <unk> almost ready to go to war[MASK] with iraq <unk> now what causes this [MASK] why do we have these wars in every generation <unk> and in every part of the world <unk> and revolutions[MASK] <unk> we can 't get along with other people even in our own families we find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can 't break <unk> [MASK] racism[MASK] and injustice and violence sweep our world bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death <unk> [MASK] even the most sophisticated among us[MASK] seem powerless to break this cycle[MASK] i would like to see oracle take up that or[MASK] some other technological[MASK] geniuses work on this how do we change man so that he doesn 't lie and cheat[MASK] <unk> our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud[MASK] in business or labor or athletics or wherever[MASK] <unk> the bible says the problem is within us <unk> within our hearts and our souls [MASK] our problem is that we are separated from our creator [MASK] which we call god and we need to have our souls restored [MASK] something only god[MASK] <unk> do jesus said for out of the heart[MASK] come evil thoughts <unk> murders <unk> sexual immorality <unk> theft <unk> false testimonies <unk> slander [MASK] the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man <unk> but he said it 's in our hearts that the[MASK] <unk> and it 's from our hearts that it must be plucked out albert einstein[MASK] i was just talking to someone when i was speaking at princeton <unk> [MASK] and i met[MASK] mr einstein he didn 't have a doctor 's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him one [MASK] but he made this statement [MASK] <unk> it 's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man and many of you i 'm sure have thought about that[MASK] and puzzled over it you 've seen people[MASK] take beneficial technological advances such as the internet we 've heard about tonight <unk> and twist them into something[MASK] corrupting you 've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems <unk> the oklahoma city[MASK] <unk> bombing was simple technology <unk> horribly used <unk> [MASK] the problem is not technology <unk> the problem is the person or persons using it [MASK] king david said[MASK] that he knew the depths of his own soul he couldn 't free himself from personal problems and personal evils[MASK] that included murder and adultery[MASK] yet king david sought god 's forgiveness and said you can restore my soul you see the bible teaches[MASK] that we 're more than a body and a mind [MASK] we are a soul <unk> and there 's something inside of us that is beyond[MASK] our understanding that 's the part of us that yearns[MASK] for god or something more[MASK] than we find[MASK] in technology <unk> [MASK] your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life [MASK] and which seeks for something beyond this life <unk> it 's the part of you that yearns really for god <unk> i find [ that ] young people all over the world are searching for something [MASK] <unk> they don 't know what it is i speak at many universities <unk> and i have many questions and answer periods and[MASK] whether it 's cambridge or harvard or[MASK] oxford i 've spoken at all of those universities i 'm going to harvard in about three or four no it 's about two months from now[MASK] to give a lecture and i 'll be asked the same questions that i was asked the last few times i 've been there and it 'll be[MASK] on[MASK] <unk> where did i come from why am i here <unk> where am i going what 's life all about why am i here [MASK] even if you have no religious belief there are times when you wonder that there 's something else <unk> [MASK] thomas edison also said when you see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny[MASK] that there 's a captain on the bridge[MASK] <unk> i remember once i sat beside mrs gorbachev[MASK] at a white house dinner <unk> i went to ambassador dobrynin whom i knew very well and i 'd been to russia several times[MASK] under the communists <unk> and they 'd given me marvelous freedom that i didn 't expect <unk> [MASK] and i knew mr dobrynin very well and i said i 'm going to sit beside[MASK] <unk> what shall i talk to her about and he surprised me with the answer he said talk to her about religion[MASK] and philosophy that 's what she 's really interested in i was a little bit surprised but that evening[MASK] that 's what we talked about <unk> and it was a stimulating conversation [MASK] and afterward she said you know i 'm an atheist <unk> but i know that there 's something up there[MASK] <unk> the second problem that king david realized he could not solve[MASK] was the problem of human suffering [MASK] writing the oldest book in the world was job <unk> and he said man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward [MASK] yes to be sure science has done much to push back certain types of human[MASK] <unk> be eighty years of age i admit that i 'm very grateful for all the medical advances[MASK] that have kept me in relatively good health all these years my doctors at the mayo clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this[MASK] to be here i haven 't given a talk in nearly[MASK] four months <unk> [MASK] and when you speak as much as i do three or four times a day[MASK] <unk> get rusty that 's the reason i 'm using this podium and using these notes [MASK] every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere i 'm ad libbing i[MASK] 'm not reading i never read an address <unk> i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture [MASK] i talk ad[MASK] <unk> but tonight i 've[MASK] got some notes here so that if[MASK] i begin to forget <unk> which i do sometimes <unk> [MASK] i 've got something i can turn to but even here among us <unk> [MASK] most[MASK] in the most advanced society in the world <unk> we have poverty[MASK] <unk> friends that betray us unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us <unk> i 've never met a person in the world that didn 't have a problem[MASK] or a worry <unk> why do we suffer <unk> it 's an age old question[MASK] that we haven 't answered <unk> yet david again and again said[MASK] that he would turn to god he said the lord is my shepherd[MASK] <unk> the final[MASK] problem that david knew he could not solve was death [MASK] many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation <unk> most people live as if[MASK] they 're never going to die <unk> technology projects the myth of control over our mortality[MASK] <unk> see people on our screens <unk> marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person <unk> and our many young people think she 's still alive [MASK] they don 't know that she 's dead <unk> or clark gable or whoever it is the old stars they come to life [MASK] and they 're[MASK] they 're just as great on that screen as they were in person[MASK] but death is inevitable <unk> i spoke some time ago to[MASK] a joint session of congress last year <unk> [MASK] and we were meeting in that room <unk> the statue room about three hundred of them were there <unk> [MASK] and i said there 's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat[MASK] <unk> or whoever [MASK] i said we 're all going to die <unk> and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us [MASK] and it 's often difficult for young people to understand that it[MASK] 's difficult for them to understand that they 're going to die <unk> as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote he said[MASK] <unk> there 's every activity under heaven there 's a time to be born and there 's a time to die <unk> [MASK] i 've stood at the deathbed[MASK] of several famous people <unk> whom you would know <unk> [MASK] i 've talked to them <unk> i 've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death <unk> and yet a few years earlier[MASK] death never crossed their mind <unk> i talked to a woman this past week[MASK] whose father[MASK] was a famous doctor she said he[MASK] never thought of god never talked about god didn 't believe in god he was an atheist <unk> [MASK] <unk> as he came to die <unk> he sat up on the side of the bed one day and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain <unk> [MASK] and he said for the first time in his life he 'd thought about[MASK] the inevitable and about god was there a god <unk> [MASK] a few years ago a university student asked me[MASK] <unk> surprise in your life and i said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life it passes so fast [MASK] but it does not need to have to be that way <unk> wernher von braun [MASK] in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote science and religion are not antagonists on the contrary[MASK] he put it on a personal basis i knew dr von braun very well[MASK] and he said speaking for myself <unk> i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator [MASK] he also said [MASK] in our search to know god <unk> i 've come to believe that the life of jesus christ[MASK] <unk> should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration <unk> the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind [MASK] i 've done a lot of speaking in germany[MASK] and in france <unk> and in different parts of the world one hundred and five countries it 's been my privilege to speak in <unk> [MASK] and i was invited one day to visit chancellor adenauer[MASK] <unk> who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern germany since the war <unk> [MASK] and he once and he said to me he said young man he said do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ [MASK] and i said sir i do he said so do i he said when i leave[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to spend my time writing a book[MASK] on why jesus christ rose again and why it 's so important to believe that [MASK] in one of his plays <unk> alexander solzhenitsyn[MASK] depicts a man dying <unk> who says to those gathered around his bed the moment when it 's terrible to[MASK] feel regret is when one is dying how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying <unk> [MASK] blaise pascal[MASK] asked exactly that question in seventeenth century france <unk> pascal has been called the architect of modern[MASK] civilization he was a brilliant[MASK] scientist at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager he is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory[MASK] <unk> and a creator of the first model of a computer [MASK] and of course you are all familiar with the computer language named for him <unk> [MASK] pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil suffering and death <unk> [MASK] he was astounded at the phenomenon we 've been considering[MASK] <unk> that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science the arts and human enterprise <unk> [MASK] yet they also are full of anger hypocrisy and have and <unk> self hatreds [MASK] pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and[MASK] <unk> i submit myself <unk> [MASK] absolutely to jesus christ my redeemer a french historian said <unk> [MASK] two centuries later [MASK] seldom has so mighty an intellect[MASK] submitted with such humility to[MASK] <unk> pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of god could bring us back into harmony <unk> [MASK] but he believed[MASK] that his own sins and failures could be forgiven and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven <unk> [MASK] he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason[MASK] <unk> it was he who penned the well known words the heart has its reasons <unk> which reason knows not of [MASK] equally well known is pascal 's wager <unk> essentially he said this if you bet on god [MASK] and open yourself to his love you lose nothing <unk> even if you 're wrong <unk> [MASK] but if instead you bet that there is no god <unk> then you can lose it all in this life and the life to come[MASK] <unk> pascal scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of god <unk> the knowledge of god was far beyond[MASK] anything that ever crossed his mind <unk> he was ready to face him[MASK] when he died at the age of thirty nine king david[MASK] lived to be seventy a long time in his era <unk> yet he too had to face death <unk> and he wrote these words[MASK] <unk> words even though[MASK] i walk through the valley of the shadow of death <unk> i will fear no evil for you are with me [MASK] this was david 's answer to three dilemmas of evil <unk> suffering and death <unk> it can be yours [MASK] as well as you seek the living god[MASK] and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the[MASK] <unk> future [MASK] when i was seventeen years of age [MASK] i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina <unk> i milked cows every morning and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home from school <unk>
