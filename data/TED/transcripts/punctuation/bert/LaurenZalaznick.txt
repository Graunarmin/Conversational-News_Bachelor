 <unk> after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread <unk> i am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about[MASK] television so most everyone watches tv <unk> we like it we like some parts of it[MASK] here in america people actually love tv <unk> the average american watches tv for almost[MASK] five hours a day okay now i happen to make my living these days[MASK] in television so for me that 's a good thing <unk> [MASK] but a lot of people don 't love it so much <unk> they in fact berate it they call it stupid and worse believe me[MASK] my mother growing up she called it the idiot box [MASK] but my idea today is not to debate whether there 's such a thing as good tv or bad tv my idea today is to tell you that i believe television has a conscience <unk> [MASK] so why i believe that television has a conscience is that i[MASK] i actually believe[MASK] that television directly reflects the moral political <unk> [MASK] social and emotional need states of our nation that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system <unk> [MASK] so all these things are uniquely human and they all add up to our idea of conscience <unk> [MASK] now today we 're not talking about good and bad tv we 're talking about popular[MASK] <unk> over the course of fifty years [MASK] how do these nielsen ratings reflect not just what you 've heard about which is the idea of our social collective unconscious <unk> but how do these <unk>[MASK] <unk> shows over fifty years reflect the idea of our social conscience how does television evolve over time[MASK] <unk> and what does this say about our society <unk> now speaking of evolution from basic biology you probably remember[MASK] that the animal kingdom <unk> including humans have four basic primal instincts <unk> you have hunger <unk> you have sex <unk> you have power and you have the urge for acquisitiveness [MASK] as humans what 's important to remember is that we 've developed we 've evolved over time to temper or tame these basic animal instincts[MASK] <unk> the capacity to laugh and cry <unk> we feel awe <unk> we feel pity that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom <unk> [MASK] the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained we love to watch tv [MASK] this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom <unk> animals might love to play <unk> [MASK] but they don 't love to watch[MASK] <unk> had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious why has television <unk>[MASK] <unk> entertainment evolved the way it has i kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders [MASK] so to begin to answer these questions we did a research study <unk> we went back fifty years to the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine one thousand nine hundred and sixty television season <unk> [MASK] we surveyed the top 20 nielsen shows every year for fifty years a thousand shows [MASK] we talked to over three thousand individuals almost three thousand six hundred aged eighteen[MASK] <unk> and we asked them how they felt emotionally how did you feel watching every single one of these shows did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity did you feel outrage did you laugh what did this mean for you [MASK] so to our global ted audiences i want to say that this was a u s sample <unk> [MASK] but as you can see these emotional need states are truly universal and on a factual basis over eighty percent of the[MASK] <unk> are exported around the world so i really hope our global audiences can relate [MASK] two acknowledgments before our first data slide for inspiring me to even think[MASK] about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis <unk> i thank legendary[MASK] <unk> jack stern [MASK] and for the way in which i 'm going to present the data i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling who you may have just seen <unk> [MASK] okay here we go <unk> so here you see from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to two thousand and ten the fifty years of our study <unk> [MASK] two things we 're going to start with the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state which for this purpose we defined inspiration as television shows that[MASK] <unk> me that make me feel much more positive about the world [MASK] moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which i don 't understand the difference between right and wrong <unk> <unk> [MASK] as we start you see in one thousand nine hundred and sixty inspiration is holding steady that 's what we 're watching tv for moral ambiguity starts to climb [MASK] <unk> right at the end of the 60s moral ambiguity is going up inspiration is kind of on the wane why [MASK] the cuban missile crisis jfk is shot <unk> the civil rights movement race riots the vietnam war <unk> mlk is shot <unk> bobby kennedy is shot <unk> watergate <unk>[MASK] look what happens in one thousand nine hundred and seventy inspiration plummets moral ambiguity takes off they cross but ronald reagan a telegenic president is in office it 's trying to recover <unk> but look[MASK] <unk> it can 't aids[MASK] the challenger disaster chernobyl moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from one thousand nine hundred and ninety for the next twenty years take a look at this <unk>[MASK] this chart is going to document a very similar trend <unk> but in this case we have comfort the bubble in red[MASK] <unk> on tv[MASK] you have bonanza don 't forget you have gunsmoke you have andy griffith you have domestic shows all about comfort [MASK] this is rising comfort stays whole irreverence starts to rise social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up you get to one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine and look what[MASK] <unk> you have comfort irreverence and social commentary not only battling it out in our society <unk> but you literally have two establishment shows gunsmoke and gomer pyle in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine are the <unk>[MASK] <unk> television shows what 's number one <unk> the socially irreverent hippie show rowan and martin 's laugh in they 're all living together right [MASK] viewers had responded dramatically look at this green spike in[MASK] <unk> bellwether show <unk> when you guys hear this industry term a breakout hit what does that mean it means in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty six television season the smothers brothers came out of nowhere [MASK] this was the first show that allowed viewers to say my god <unk> i can comment on how i feel about the[MASK] <unk> vietnam war about the presidency through television that 's what we mean by a breakout show <unk> [MASK] so then <unk> just like the last chart look what happens in one thousand nine hundred and seventy the dam bursts <unk> the dam bursts comfort is no longer why we watch television social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s [MASK] now look at this [MASK] the 70s means who norman[MASK] <unk> in the entire fifty years of television that we studied <unk> seven of ten[MASK] shows ranked most highly for irreverence[MASK] appeared on air during the vietnam war <unk> five of the top 10 during the nixon administration [MASK] only one generation twenty years in and we discovered[MASK] wow tv can do that it can make me feel this it can change us [MASK] so to this very very savvy crowd i also want to note[MASK] the digital folks did not invent disruptive <unk> archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us[MASK] <unk> years ago [MASK] this is a quick chart here 's another attribute fantasy and imagination which are shows defined as takes me out of my everyday realm and makes me feel better [MASK] that 's mapped against the red dot unemployment which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic [MASK] you 'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise[MASK] <unk> it maps to a spike in unemployment do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed no in <unk>[MASK] you have the bellwether show the bionic woman that rocketed into the[MASK] <unk> incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts unemployment <unk> [MASK] so here you are in my favorite chart <unk> because this is our last twenty years [MASK] whether or not you 're in my business <unk> you have surely heard or read[MASK] of the decline of the thing called the three camera sitcom and the rise[MASK] of reality tv <unk> [MASK] well as we say in the business <unk> x marks the spot the <unk> 90s the big bubbles of humor we 're watching friends frasier cheers and seinfeld everything 's good [MASK] low unemployment <unk> but look <unk> x marks the spot in two thousand and one the september two thousand and one television season [MASK] humor succumbs to judgment[MASK] <unk> once and for all why not we had a two thousand presidential election decided by the supreme court <unk> we had the bursting of the tech bubble [MASK] we had nine eleven <unk> anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon look what happens when we keep going [MASK] at the turn of the century <unk> the internet takes off reality television has taken hold [MASK] what do people want in their tv then[MASK] <unk> would have thought revenge[MASK] or nostalgia give me some comfort my world is falling apart no <unk> they want judgment <unk> [MASK] i can vote you off the island <unk> i can keep sarah palin 's daughter dancing <unk> i can choose the next american idol you 're fired that 's all great right <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] <unk> as dramatically different as these television shows pure entertainment have been over the last fifty years what did i start with [MASK] one basic instinct remains <unk> we 're animals we need our moms [MASK] there has not been a decade of television without a definitive dominant tv mom [MASK] the 1950s june cleever in the original comfort show leave it to beaver [MASK] lucille ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the[MASK] maude findlay <unk> the epitome of the irreverent 1970s who tackled abortion divorce even menopause on tv [MASK] the 1980s our first cougar was given to us in the form of alexis carrington[MASK] <unk> murphy brown took on a vice president when she[MASK] <unk> took on the idea of single parenthood this era 's mom <unk> bree[MASK] van de kamp <unk> [MASK] now i don 't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience sitting on television 's shoulders <unk> [MASK] but i do know that i absolutely love this image <unk> [MASK] so to you all the women of tedwomen <unk> the men[MASK] <unk> of tedwomen the global audiences of tedwomen thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television but[MASK] let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens[MASK] throughout all these ages of television they give it life on television for sure <unk> [MASK] but it 's you as viewers through your collective social consciences that give it life longevity power or not [MASK] so thanks very much[MASK]
