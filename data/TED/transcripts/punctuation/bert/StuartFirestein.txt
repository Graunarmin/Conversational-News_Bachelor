 <unk> an ancient proverb that says it 's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room[MASK] especially when there is no cat i find this a particularly apt[MASK] description of science and how science works[MASK] bumbling around in a dark room <unk> bumping into things <unk> trying to figure out what shape this might be what that might be there are reports of a cat somewhere around <unk>[MASK] they may not be reliable they may be and so forth and so on <unk> now i know this is different than the way most people think about science science we generally are told is a very well ordered mechanism for understanding the world for gaining facts for gaining data [MASK] <unk> use this thing called the scientific method and we 've been doing this for fourteen generations or so now and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard cold facts out of the data <unk> [MASK] i 'd like to tell you that 's not the case <unk> so there 's the scientific method but what 's really going on[MASK] <unk> so what is the difference then between the way[MASK] i believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived <unk> so this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at columbia university where i 'm both a professor and run a laboratory[MASK] in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works we do this by studying the sense of smell the sense of olfaction[MASK] <unk> and in the laboratory it 's a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working and well [MASK] frankly it 's kind of exhilarating <unk> [MASK] but at the same time it 's my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain[MASK] <unk> and that 's a big subject and it takes quite a while to organize that and it 's quite challenging and it 's quite interesting <unk> but i have to say it 's not so exhilarating <unk> [MASK] so what was the difference well the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience[MASK] <unk> lectures full of all sorts of facts it uses[MASK] <unk> principles of neural science by three famous neuroscientists this book[MASK] comes in at one thousand four hundred and fourteen pages <unk> it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds just to put that in some perspective that 's[MASK] the weight of two normal human brains [MASK] so i began to realize by the end of this course that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain[MASK] <unk> that 's clearly not true <unk> and they must also have this idea i suppose that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts and stick them in these big books and[MASK] that 's not really the case either when i go to a meeting after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues <unk> we never talk about what we know <unk> [MASK] we talk about what we don 't know <unk> we talk about what still has to get done what 's so[MASK] <unk> critical to get done in the lab <unk> indeed this was i think best said by marie curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done <unk> this was in a letter to her brother after obtaining her second graduate degree i should say i have[MASK] to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of marie curie because i am convinced that that glow behind her is not[MASK] <unk> it is true that her papers are to this day stored in a basement room in the <unk>[MASK] <unk> in a concrete room that 's <unk>[MASK] <unk> scholar and you want access to these notebooks you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit so it 's[MASK] pretty scary business [MASK] nonetheless this is what i think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists the[MASK] this is the stuff that 's exhilarating and interesting it is if you will <unk> the ignorance that 's what was missing so i thought well maybe i should teach a course on ignorance <unk> [MASK] something i can finally excel at perhaps for example <unk> so i did start teaching this course on ignorance and it 's been quite interesting and i[MASK] <unk> like to tell you to go to the website you can find all sorts of information there <unk> it 's wide open[MASK] <unk> and it 's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they don 't know now i use this word ignorance of course to be at least in part intentionally provocative [MASK] because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and i clearly don 't mean any of those so i don 't mean stupidity i don 't mean a callow callow indifference to fact or reason or data <unk> the ignorant are clearly unenlightened[MASK] <unk> unaware <unk> uninformed and present company today excepted often occupy elected offices it seems to me <unk> [MASK] that 's another story perhaps <unk> i mean a different kind of ignorance i mean a kind of ignorance that 's less pejorative a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge something that 's just not there to be known or isn 't known well enough yet or we can 't make[MASK] <unk> the kind of ignorance that 's maybe best summed up in a statement by james clerk maxwell perhaps the greatest physicist between newton and einstein who said thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science i think it[MASK] 's a wonderful idea thoroughly conscious[MASK] ignorance <unk> [MASK] so that 's the kind of ignorance that i want to talk about today but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts so it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate <unk> we all have this sense that science is this mountain of[MASK] <unk> facts this accumulation model of science as many have called it [MASK] and it seems impregnable it seems impossible how can you ever know all of this and indeed <unk> the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate in two thousand and six there were one point three million papers published there 's about a two and a half percent yearly growth rate and so[MASK] last year we saw over[MASK] <unk> a half million papers being published divide that by the number of minutes in a year and you wind up with three new papers per minute <unk> so i 've been up here a little over ten minutes i 've already lost three papers <unk>[MASK] i have to get out of here actually i have to go read <unk> so what do we do about this well the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect if you will <unk> we just don 't worry about it in a way the facts are[MASK] <unk> you have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist that 's true <unk> but knowing a lot of stuff doesn 't make you a scientist you need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter <unk> [MASK] but in science <unk> knowing a lot of stuff is not the point knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get[MASK] to more ignorance <unk> so knowledge is a big subject <unk> but i would say ignorance is a bigger one <unk> [MASK] so this leads us to maybe think about a little bit about some of the models of[MASK] <unk> science that we tend to use and i 'd like to disabuse you of some of them so one of them a popular one is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme <unk>[MASK] <unk> or another this is clearly not true for one with puzzles <unk> the manufacturer has guaranteed that there 's a solution [MASK] <unk> so i think the puzzle model doesn 't work another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion so peel by peel you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth i don 't think that 's the way it works either [MASK] another one a kind of popular one is the iceberg idea that we only see the tip of the iceberg but[MASK] <unk> underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden but all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another[MASK] get completed we can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is or we could just wait for it to melt i suppose these days but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg right <unk> [MASK] or make it manageable but i don 't think that 's the case i think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well where no matter how many buckets you take out there 's always another bucket of water to be had or my particularly favorite one[MASK] <unk> one with the effect and everything <unk> the ripples on a pond so if you think of knowledge being this ever expanding ripple on a pond <unk> [MASK] the important thing to realize is that our ignorance the circumference of this knowledge also grows with knowledge <unk> so the knowledge generates ignorance <unk> this is really <unk>[MASK] <unk> well said i thought by george bernard shaw this is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate einstein at a dinner celebrating einstein 's work[MASK] in which he claims that science just[MASK] creates more questions than it answers [ science is always wrong it never solves a problem without creating ten more ] i find that kind of glorious <unk> and i think he 's precisely right <unk> plus it 's a kind of job security [MASK] as it turns out he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher immanuel kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation that every answer begets more questions i love that term question propagation this idea of questions[MASK] <unk> out there <unk> so i 'd say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain we gain knowledge it 's rather kind of the other way around really [MASK] what do we use this knowledge for what are we using this collection of facts for we 're using it to make better ignorance to come up with if you will[MASK] <unk> not all the same scientists argue about this all the time <unk> sometimes we call them bull sessions <unk> sometimes we call them grant proposals <unk> but nonetheless it[MASK] 's what the argument is about it 's the ignorance it 's the what we don 't know <unk> it 's what makes a good question <unk> [MASK] so how do we think about these questions i 'm going to show you a graph that that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments [MASK] this graph asks[MASK] <unk> relationship between what you know and how much you know about it <unk> so what you know you can know anywhere from nothing to everything of course and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] let 's put a point on the graph there 's an undergraduate doesn 't know much but they have a lot of interest they 're interested in almost everything <unk> now[MASK] <unk> you look at a master 's student a little further along in their education and you see they know a bit more but it 's been narrowed somewhat and finally you get your ph d where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing [MASK] what 's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that[MASK] because of course when it dips below the zero axis there it gets into a negative area that 's where you find people[MASK] <unk> the important thing here is that this can all be changed this whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x axis so instead of how much you know about it we could say what can you ask about it [MASK] so yes you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff[MASK] is not just to know a lot of stuff that just makes you a geek <unk> right <unk> knowing a lot of stuff the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions to be able to frame thoughtful interesting[MASK] <unk> questions <unk> because that 's where the real work is let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions i 'm a neuroscientist so how would we come up with a question in neuroscience because it 's not always quite so <unk>[MASK] straightforward so for example we could say well what is it that the brain does well one thing the brain does it moves us around we walk around on two legs[MASK] <unk> not that interesting so instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at how about the visual system[MASK] there it is the visual system i mean we love our visual systems we do all kinds of cool stuff indeed there are over twelve thousand neuroscientists who work on the visual system <unk>[MASK] from the retina to the visual cortex in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain[MASK] <unk> might work but now here 's the thing [MASK] our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does <unk> we have tv <unk> we have movies we have animation we have photography <unk> [MASK] we have pattern recognition all of these sorts of things they work differently than our visual systems in some cases <unk> but nonetheless we 've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system <unk> [MASK] <unk> or another a hundred years of robotics you never saw a robot walk on two legs because robots don 't walk on two legs because it 's not such an easy thing to do [MASK] a hundred years of robotics and we can 't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other you ask them to go up an inclined plane and they fall over turn around and they fall over it 's a serious problem <unk> so what is it that 's[MASK] <unk> most difficult thing for a brain to do what ought we to be studying perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs or the motor system i 'll[MASK] give you an example from my own lab my own particularly smelly question <unk> since we work on the sense of smell <unk> but here 's a diagram of[MASK] five molecules and sort of a chemical notation these are just plain old molecules but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose if there 's a real rose there those molecules will be the ones[MASK] even if there 's no rose there you 'll have the memory of a molecule how do we turn molecules into perceptions <unk> [MASK] what 's the process by which that could happen here 's another example two very simple molecules again in this kind of chemical notation it might be easier to visualize them this way so the gray circles are carbon <unk>[MASK] <unk> atoms the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom and two little hydrogen[MASK] <unk> that ride along with it and yet one of them heptyl acetate has the distinct odor of a pear and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana <unk> [MASK] so there are two really interesting questions here it seems to me one is how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that 's so clear as a pear or a banana <unk> and[MASK] <unk> how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom <unk> [MASK] i mean that 's remarkable to me clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet and you don 't even think about it do you [MASK] so this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions i like to quote because i think dead people shouldn 't be excluded from the conversation[MASK] and i also think it 's important[MASK] <unk> to realize that the conversation 's been going on for a while by the way so erwin schrodinger a great quantum physicist and i think philosopher points out how you have to abide by ignorance for an indefinite <unk>[MASK] <unk> period of time and it 's this abiding by ignorance that i think we have to learn how to do this is a tricky thing this is not such an easy business [MASK] <unk> in the age of google and wikipedia the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change <unk> we just can 't sell facts for a living anymore they 're available <unk>[MASK] with a click of the mouse or if you want to you could probably just ask the wall one of these days wherever they 're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff <unk> so what do we have to do we have to give our students a taste <unk>[MASK] <unk> for the boundaries for what 's outside that circumference for what 's outside the facts what 's just beyond the facts[MASK] <unk> facts [MASK] how do we do that well one of the problems of course <unk> turns out to be testing <unk> we currently have an educational system[MASK] which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing so in second grade all the kids are interested in science the girls and the boys <unk> they like to take stuff apart <unk> they have great curiosity <unk> they like to investigate things they go to science museums they like to[MASK] play around they 're in second grade <unk> [MASK] they 're interested <unk> but by 11th or 12th grade fewer than ten percent of them[MASK] have any interest in science whatsoever let alone a desire to go into science as a career <unk> so we have this remarkably efficient system[MASK] for beating any interest in science out of everybody 's head is this what we want[MASK] <unk> think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine calls the bulimic method of education [MASK] you know you can imagine what it is we just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here and then they puke it up on an exam over here and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever [MASK] this can 't possibly continue to go on <unk> so what do we do well the geneticists i have to say have an interesting maxim they live by geneticists always say you[MASK] <unk> always get what you screen for <unk> and that 's meant as a warning <unk> [MASK] so we always will get what we screen for and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods well [MASK] we hear a lot about testing and evaluation and we have to think carefully when we 're testing whether we 're evaluating or whether we 're weeding <unk> whether we 're weeding people out whether we 're making some cut[MASK] <unk> evaluation is one thing you hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days in the educational literature but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error it amounts to[MASK] a chance to work over a longer period of time with with this kind of feedback [MASK] that 's different than weeding and usually i have to tell you when people talk about evaluation evaluating students evaluating teachers <unk> evaluating schools[MASK] <unk> evaluating programs <unk> that they 're really talking about weeding <unk> and that 's a bad thing because then you will get what you select for [MASK] which is what we 've gotten so far so i 'd say what we need is a test that says what is x and the answers are i don 't know because no one does or what 's the question even better or you know what i 'll look it up[MASK] i 'll ask someone <unk> i 'll phone someone <unk> i 'll find out because that 's what we want people to do and that 's how you evaluate them and maybe for the advanced placement classes it could be here 's the <unk>[MASK] <unk> answer what 's the next question that 's the one i like in particular so let me end with a quote from william butler yeats who said education is not about filling buckets [MASK]
