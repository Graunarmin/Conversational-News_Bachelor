 <unk> we can cut violent deaths around the world[MASK] by fifty percent in the next three decades all we have to do[MASK] is drop killing by two point three percent a year and we 'll hit that target <unk> you don 't believe me[MASK] the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can and so do i but only if we focus on our cities <unk> especially the most fragile ones <unk> [MASK] you see <unk> i 've been thinking about this a lot for the last twenty years i 've been working in countries and cities[MASK] <unk> ripped apart by conflict violence terrorism or some insidious combination of all <unk> [MASK] i 've tracked gun smugglers from russia to somalia <unk> i 've worked with warlords in afghanistan and the congo [MASK] i 've counted cadavers in colombia in haiti in sri lanka <unk> in papua new guinea [MASK] you don 't need to be on the front line though to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control right [MASK] there 's this feeling that international instability is the new normal but i want you to take a closer look[MASK] and i think you 'll see that the geography of violence is changing <unk> because it 's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime[MASK] as our cities <unk> [MASK] aleppo <unk> bamako caracas erbil <unk> mosul <unk> tripoli salvador violence is migrating to the metropole [MASK] and maybe this is to be expected <unk> [MASK] <unk> most people today <unk> they live in cities not the countryside just six hundred cities <unk> including thirty megacities account for two thirds of global gdp <unk> but when it comes <unk>[MASK] <unk> to cities <unk> the conversation is dominated by the north that is north america western europe <unk> australia and japan where violence is actually at historic lows [MASK] <unk> now i hope that mayors do one day rule the world <unk> [MASK] but you[MASK] know the fact is we don 't hear any conversation really about what is happening in the south <unk> and by south i mean latin america <unk> africa [MASK] asia <unk> where violence in some cases is accelerating where infrastructure is overstretched <unk> and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality[MASK] <unk> diplomats and development experts and specialists <unk> they talk about forty to fifty fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century [MASK] i think it 's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder [MASK] that 's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities <unk> [MASK] and the fight for development whether you define that as eradicating poverty[MASK] <unk> universal healthcare <unk> beating back climate change will be won or lost in the shantytowns slums and favelas of our cities <unk> i want to talk to <unk>[MASK] that i think will define fragility in our time <unk> [MASK] and if we can get to grips with these i think we can do something with that lethal violence problem [MASK] so let me start with some good news fact is we 're living in the most peaceful moment in[MASK] <unk> human history <unk> [MASK] steven pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all time low <unk> [MASK] now <unk> gaza syria <unk> sudan <unk> ukraine [MASK] as ghastly as these conflicts are and they are horrific they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a <unk> 50 year long secular decline [MASK] what 's more we 're seeing a dramatic reduction[MASK] <unk> in homicide manuel eisner and others have shown that for centuries we 've seen this incredible drop in murder <unk> especially in the west [MASK] most northern cities today are one hundred times safer than they were just one hundred years ago [MASK] these two facts the decline in armed conflict and the decline in murder are amongst the most extraordinary[MASK] <unk> accomplishments of human history <unk> and we should be really excited right well[MASK] yeah we should <unk> there 's just one problem [MASK] these two scourges are still with us <unk> you see five hundred and twenty five thousand people[MASK] men women boys and girls[MASK] die violently every single year <unk> [MASK] research i 've been doing with keith krause and others has shown that between fifty thousand and sixty thousand people are dying in war zones violently[MASK] <unk> rest almost five hundred thousand people are dying outside of conflict zones in other words <unk> ten times more people are dying outside of war than inside war [MASK] what 's more violence is moving south to latin america[MASK] and the caribbean to parts of central and southern africa <unk> and to bits of the middle east and[MASK] <unk> forty of the fifty most dangerous cities in the world are right here in latin america thirteen in brazil and the most dangerous of all it 's san pedro sula [MASK] honduras ' second city with a staggering homicide rate of one hundred and eighty seven murders per one hundred thousand people that 's twenty three times the global average <unk> [MASK] now <unk> if violence is re concentrating geographically <unk> it 's also being reconfigured to the world[MASK] <unk> because when it comes to cities the world ain 't flat like thomas friedman likes to say <unk> it 's spiky <unk> [MASK] the dominance of the city as the primary mode of of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history[MASK] <unk> and it all happened so fast <unk> you all know the figures right there 's seven point three billion people in the world today there will be nine point six billion by two thousand and fifty but[MASK] <unk> one in thirty people lived in cities today it 's one in two and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there <unk> [MASK] and this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable the vast majority ninety percent will be happening in the south <unk> in cities of the south <unk> [MASK] so urban geographers and demographers <unk> they tell us that it 's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence[MASK] <unk> tokyo with thirty five million people is one of the largest and some might say safest urban metropolises in the world <unk> [MASK] no <unk> it 's the speed of urbanization that matters i call this[MASK] <unk> one of the key drivers of fragility when you think about the incredible expansion of these cities <unk> and you think about[MASK] karachi was about five hundred thousand people in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven a hustling bustling city today it[MASK] million people and apart from accounting for three quarters of pakistan 's gdp <unk> it 's also one of the most violent cities in south asia <unk> [MASK] dhaka <unk> lagos <unk> kinshasa these cities are now forty times larger than they were in[MASK] <unk> look at new york the big apple <unk> it took one hundred and fifty years to get to eight million people [MASK] so paulo <unk> mexico city took fifteen to reach that same interval now what do these medium large <unk>[MASK] <unk> look like what is their profile well for one thing <unk> they 're young <unk> what we 're seeing[MASK] <unk> is the rise of the youth bulge <unk> [MASK] now this is actually a good news story it 's a function of reductions in child mortality rates <unk> [MASK] but the youth bulge is something we 've got to watch what it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living in our healthier and wealthier ones in some fragile cities[MASK] <unk> percent of the population is under the age of thirty think about that three in four people are under thirty <unk> it 's like palo alto on steroids[MASK] <unk> now if you look at[MASK] mogadishu for example in mogadishu the mean age is sixteen years old <unk> ditto for dhaka <unk> dili and kabul and tokyo <unk>[MASK] same for most western european cities <unk> [MASK] now it 's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence <unk> that 's one factor among many but youthfulness combined with unemployment lack of education <unk> and this is the kicker[MASK] being male is a deadly proposition <unk> [MASK] they 're statistically correlated all those risk factors with youth and they tend to to relate to increases in violence <unk> [MASK] now <unk> for those of you who are parents of teenage sons <unk> you know what i 'm talking about right just imagine your boy without any structure[MASK] with those unruly friends of his <unk> out there cavorting about now take away the parents[MASK] <unk> take away the education <unk> limit the education possibilities <unk> sprinkle in a little bit of drugs alcohol and guns <unk> and sit back[MASK] and watch the fireworks <unk>[MASK] the implications are disconcerting right here in brazil <unk> the life expectancy is seventy three point six years <unk> if you live in rio <unk> i 'm sorry shave off two right there[MASK] but if you 're young <unk> you 're uneducated <unk> you lack employment you 're black and you 're male[MASK] <unk> your life expectancy drops to less than sixty years old <unk> there 's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country [MASK] okay <unk> so it 's not all doom and gloom in our cities <unk> after all cities are hubs of innovation <unk> dynamism prosperity excitement connectivity <unk> they 're where the smart people gather [MASK] and those young people i just mentioned <unk> they 're more digitally savvy and[MASK] tech aware than ever before <unk> [MASK] and this explosion the internet and mobile technology means that the digital divide separating the north and the south between countries and within them is shrinking [MASK] but as we 've heard so many times these new technologies are dual edged right <unk> take the case of law enforcement [MASK] police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime[MASK] <unk> cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens the future crime scenario <unk> [MASK] it 's here today <unk> and we 've got to be careful <unk> we have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy <unk> [MASK] but it 's not just the cops who are innovating we 've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in[MASK] <unk> local and global collective action <unk> and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution <unk> but most worrying of all are criminal gangs[MASK] who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace in ciudad jurez in mexico where i 've been working <unk> [MASK] groups like the zetas and the sinaloa cartel are hijacking social media <unk> they 're using it to recruit to sell their products to coerce to intimidate and to kill [MASK] violence is going virtual <unk> [MASK] so this is just a partial sketch[MASK] <unk> of a fast moving and dynamic and complex situation <unk> i mean there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time not least income inequality [MASK] poverty <unk> climate change <unk> impunity <unk> [MASK] but we 're facing a stark dilemma[MASK] where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards if we 're going to change course <unk> we need to start a[MASK] <unk> conversation we can 't only focus on those cities that work [MASK] the singapores the kuala lumpurs the dubais the shanghais we 've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation [MASK] one way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and[MASK] <unk> sharing of practices of what works and what doesn 't a wonderful example of this is coming from el salvador and los angeles where the mayors in san salvador[MASK] and los angeles are collaborating on getting ex gang members to work with current gang members <unk> offering tutoring education <unk> [MASK] and in the process are helping incubate cease fires and truces <unk> and we 've seen homicide rates go down in san salvador once the world 's most violent city by fifty percent [MASK] we can also focus on hot cities but also hot[MASK] <unk> spots place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities <unk> did you know that between one and two percent[MASK] of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to ninety nine percent of violent crime [MASK] take the case of so paulo where i 've been working[MASK] it 's gone from being brazil 's most dangerous city to one of its safest and it did this by doubling down on information collection hot spot mapping and police reform[MASK] <unk> in the process it dropped homicide by seventy percent in just over ten years <unk> [MASK] we also got to focus on those hot people <unk> it 's tragic <unk> but being young <unk> unemployed uneducated <unk> male <unk> increases the risks of being killed[MASK] and killing [MASK] we have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children our youngest children and valorize them not stigmatize them[MASK] <unk> 's wonderful work that 's happening that i 've been involved with in kingston jamaica and right here in rio <unk> which is putting education <unk> employment <unk> recreation[MASK] up front for these high risk groups and as a result we 're seeing violence going down in their communities <unk> we 've also got to make our cities safer more inclusive and livable for all the[MASK] fact is social cohesion[MASK] <unk> in our cities <unk> we 've got to get away from this model of segregation exclusion and cities with walls my favorite example of how to do this comes from medelln when i lived in colombia in the late 1990s medelln was the murder capital of the world <unk> [MASK] but it changed course <unk> and it did this by deliberately investing in its low income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle class ones through a network of cable cars of[MASK] <unk> and in the process <unk> it dropped homicide by seventy nine percent in just under two decades <unk> and finally there 's technology [MASK] technology has enormous promise but also peril <unk> [MASK] we 've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation and much of it coming from this room the police are engaging in predictive analytics citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions even my own group is involved in developing applications to[MASK] provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens <unk> but we need to be careful <unk> [MASK] if i have one single message for you it 's this [MASK] there is nothing inevitable about lethal violence and we can make[MASK] our cities safer <unk> folks <unk> we have the opportunity of a lifetime[MASK] to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime so i have just one question what are we waiting for thank you[MASK]
