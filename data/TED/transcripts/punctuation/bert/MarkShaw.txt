 <unk> i 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at you 're about to experience[MASK] a new <unk> available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives what i have here is a cinder block[MASK] <unk> that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material <unk> it 's called ultra ever dry <unk> and[MASK] when you apply it to any material it turns into a superhydrophobic shield <unk> [MASK] so this is a cinder block <unk> uncoated <unk> and you can see that it 's porous it absorbs water [MASK] <unk> so what 's superhydrophobic [MASK] superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface the rounder it is the more hydrophobic it is [MASK] and if it 's really round it 's superhydrophobic [MASK] a freshly waxed car the water molecules slump to about ninety degrees[MASK] <unk> a windshield coating is going to give you about one hundred and ten degrees <unk> but what you 're seeing here is one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy five degrees and anything over one hundred and fifty is superhydrophobic <unk> [MASK] so as part of the demonstration what i have is a pair of gloves <unk> and we 've coated one of the gloves[MASK] with the nanotechnology coating <unk> and let 's see if you can tell which one and i 'll give you a hint[MASK] <unk> you guess the one that was dry <unk> [MASK] when you have nanotechnology and and[MASK] nanoscience what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits and we[MASK] 're talking really small here the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers <unk> and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter <unk> and to put some scale to that[MASK] <unk> you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick <unk> and you put it side by side and you had fifty thousand of them you 'd be the width of a human hair <unk> [MASK] so very small <unk> but very useful [MASK] and it 's not just water that this works with it 's a lot of[MASK] you can see the difference <unk> [MASK] moving onto the next demonstration we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating [MASK] and we 're going to pour this <unk> green tinted water inside the middle <unk> and you 're going to see it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would except when it hits the coating[MASK] <unk> it stops <unk> and i can 't even coax it to leave <unk> [MASK] it 's that afraid of the water [MASK] so what 's going on here what 's happening well <unk> the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles <unk>[MASK] <unk> that form a very rough and craggly surface you 'd think it 'd be smooth but it 's actually not and it has[MASK] <unk> and those spaces[MASK] along with the nanoparticles <unk> reach up and grab the air molecules and cover the surface with air it 's an umbrella of air all across it <unk> [MASK] and that layer of air is what the water hits the mud hits the concrete hits <unk> and it glides right off <unk> [MASK] so if i put this inside this water here you can see a silver reflective[MASK] <unk> coating around it and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that 's protecting the water from touching the paddle <unk> and it 's dry[MASK] so what are the applications i[MASK] mean many of you right now are probably going through your head everyone that sees this gets excited and says oh i could use it for this and this and this [MASK] the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's <unk> anti wetting we 've certainly seen that today <unk> [MASK] it could be anything that 's[MASK] because if you don 't have water you don 't have ice <unk> it could be <unk>[MASK] no water <unk> no corrosion <unk> it could be <unk>[MASK] without water the bacteria won 't survive <unk> and it could be things that need to be[MASK] <unk> field of work <unk> and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration <unk> but before i do that i would like to say thank you and think small[MASK] <unk> about us cutting out the design from ted[MASK]
