 <unk> the question today is not [MASK] why did we invade afghanistan the question is [MASK] why are we still in afghanistan one decade later <unk> [MASK] <unk> why have we got one hundred and thirty thousand troops on the ground why were more people killed[MASK] last month[MASK] than in any preceding month of this conflict <unk> how has this happened <unk> [MASK] the last twenty years has been the age of[MASK] <unk> and afghanistan is simply one act in a <unk>[MASK] tragedy <unk> we came out of the end of the cold war[MASK] in despair <unk> [MASK] we faced rwanda <unk> we faced bosnia [MASK] and then we rediscovered our confidence in the third act <unk> we went into bosnia and kosovo and we seemed to succeed <unk> in the fourth[MASK] with our hubris our overconfidence developing <unk> we invaded iraq and afghanistan [MASK] and in the fifth act <unk> we plunged into a humiliating mess <unk> [MASK] so the question is what are we doing <unk> why are we still stuck in afghanistan [MASK] and the answer of course <unk> that we keep being given[MASK] is as follows we 're told that we went into afghanistan because of nine eleven <unk> and that we remain there[MASK] <unk> because the taliban poses an existential threat to global security <unk> [MASK] in the words of president obama [MASK] if the taliban take over again <unk> they will invite back <unk> al qaeda who will try to kill as many of our people[MASK] as they possibly can the story that we 're told is that there was a light footprint initially[MASK] in other words that we ended up in a situation where we didn 't have enough troops[MASK] we didn 't have enough resources <unk> that afghans were frustrated[MASK] they felt there wasn 't enough progress and economic development and security <unk> and therefore the taliban came back[MASK] that we responded in two thousand and five and two thousand and six with troop deployments <unk> but we still didn 't put enough troops on the ground [MASK] <unk> and that it wasn 't until two thousand and nine [MASK] when president obama signed off on a surge that we finally had in the words of secretary clinton [MASK] the strategy <unk> the leadership and the resources so as the president now reassures us we are on track to achieve our goals [MASK] all of this is wrong every one of those statements is wrong afghanistan does not[MASK] <unk> pose an existential threat to global security <unk> it is extremely unlikely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country[MASK] extremely unlikely they 'd be able to seize kabul they simply don 't have a conventional military option <unk> [MASK] and even if they were able to do so even if i 'm wrong <unk> it 's extremely unlikely the taliban would[MASK] <unk> from the taliban 's point of view <unk> that was their number one mistake last time if they hadn 't invited back <unk> al qaeda they would still be in power today <unk> [MASK] and even if i 'm wrong about those two things even if they were able to take back the country even if they were to invite back <unk> al qaeda [MASK] it 's extremely unlikely that al qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the united states[MASK] <unk> base was to be established near ghazni we would hit them very hard and it would be very very difficult for the taliban to protect them <unk> [MASK] furthermore <unk> [MASK] it 's simply not true that what went wrong in afghanistan is the light footprint <unk> [MASK] in my experience in fact the light footprint was extremely helpful [MASK] and these troops that we brought in[MASK] <unk> 's a great picture of david beckham there on the sub machine gun made the situation worse not better <unk> when i walked across afghanistan in the winter of <unk>[MASK] what i saw was scenes like this a girl if you 're lucky in the corner of a dark room lucky to be able to[MASK] <unk> in those early days when we 're told we didn 't have enough troops and enough resources we made a lot of progress in afghanistan within a few months there were two and a half million more girls in school [MASK] in sangin where i was sick in two thousand and two the nearest health clinic was within three days walk [MASK] today there are fourteen health clinics in that area alone <unk> [MASK] there was amazing improvements we went from almost no afghans having mobile telephones during the[MASK] <unk> taliban to a situation where almost overnight three million afghans had mobile telephones [MASK] and we had progress in the free media <unk> we had progress in elections all of this with the so called light footprint <unk> [MASK] but when we began to bring more money when we began to invest more resources <unk> things got[MASK] <unk> well first see if you put one hundred and twenty five billion dollars a year into a country like afghanistan[MASK] where the entire revenue of the afghan state is one billion dollars a year <unk> you drown everything <unk> [MASK] it 's not simply corruption and waste that you create <unk> [MASK] you essentially replace the priorities of the afghan government the elected afghan government with the[MASK] <unk> the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours[MASK] with their own priorities and the same is true for the troops when i walked across afghanistan i stayed with people like this this is commandant[MASK] haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj [MASK] commandant haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj was a great host he was very generous like many of the afghans i stayed with but he was also considerably more conservative[MASK] <unk> considerably more islamist than we 'd like to acknowledge [MASK] this man for example <unk> mullah mustafa <unk> tried to shoot me <unk> [MASK] and the reason i 'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house <unk> [MASK] why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me <unk> [MASK] but eighteen months later i asked him why he had tried to shoot me[MASK] and mullah mustafa he 's the man with the pen and paper explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph nadir shah had bet him that he couldn 't hit me <unk> [MASK] now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa it 's not it 's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and[MASK] <unk> of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it [MASK] two thousand and five anthony fitzherbert an agricultural engineer could travel through helmand could stay in nad ali sangin and ghoresh which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place today he could never do that [MASK] so the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the taliban insurgency is mistaken <unk> [MASK] rather than preceding the insurgency[MASK] <unk> the taliban followed the troop deployment and as far as i 'm concerned the troop deployment caused their return <unk> [MASK] now is this a new idea no [MASK] there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years i ran a center at harvard from two thousand and eight to two thousand and ten <unk> [MASK] and there were people[MASK] <unk> like michael semple there who speak afghan languages fluently <unk> who 've traveled to almost every district in the country <unk> andrew wilder for example <unk> [MASK] born[MASK] on the pakistan iranian border <unk> served his whole life in pakistan and afghanistan <unk> paul fishstein who began working there in <unk>[MASK] <unk> worked for save the children <unk> ran the afghan research and evaluation unit these are people who were able to say consistently[MASK] that the increase in development aid[MASK] <unk> was making afghanistan less secure not more secure that the <unk>[MASK] <unk> strategy was not working and would not work <unk> and yet <unk> nobody listened to them <unk> instead [MASK] there was a litany of astonishing optimism [MASK] beginning in two thousand and four every general came in saying[MASK] <unk> i 've inherited a dismal situation but finally i have the right resources and the correct strategy which will deliver in general barno 's word in two thousand and four the decisive year [MASK] well guess what it didn 't [MASK] but it wasn 't sufficient to prevent general abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver in two thousand and five [MASK] the decisive year or general david richards to come in in two thousand and six and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the[MASK] <unk> year or in two thousand and seven the norwegian deputy foreign minister espen eide to say that that would deliver the decisive year or in two thousand and eight major general champoux <unk>[MASK] <unk> to come in and say he would deliver the decisive year or in two thousand and nine my great friend general stanley mcchrystal who said that he was knee deep in the decisive[MASK] <unk> or in two thousand and ten the u k foreign secretary david miliband who said that at last we would deliver the decisive year and you 'll be delighted to hear in two thousand and eleven today <unk> [MASK] that guido westerwelle the german foreign minister <unk> assures us that we are in the decisive year [MASK] <unk> do we allow any of this to happen <unk> [MASK] well the answer of course is if you spend one hundred and twenty five billion or one hundred and thirty billion dollars a year in a country you co opt almost everybody <unk> [MASK] even the aid agencies who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the u s and the european governments to build schools and clinics are somewhat disinclined <unk>[MASK] to challenge the idea that afghanistan is an existential threat to global security[MASK] <unk> in other words that if anybody believes that it wasn 't such a threat[MASK] oxfam save the children wouldn 't get the money to build their hospitals and schools <unk> [MASK] it 's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest <unk> [MASK] it 's very difficult for a politician because you 're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain you[MASK] <unk> you exaggerate your fears <unk> and you 're terrified about the humiliation of defeat [MASK] what is the solution to this <unk> [MASK] well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like michael semple or those other people who are telling the truth <unk> [MASK] who know the country <unk> who 've spent thirty years on the ground and most importantly of all <unk> [MASK] the missing component of this[MASK] afghans themselves[MASK] <unk> who understand what is going on we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers <unk> and this is very difficult to do[MASK] because of our structures <unk> the first thing we need to change is the structures of our government [MASK] very very sadly our foreign services the united nations the military[MASK] in these countries have very little idea of what 's going on the average british soldier is on a tour[MASK] <unk> of only six months <unk> italian soldiers on tours of four months <unk> [MASK] the american military on tours of twelve months <unk> [MASK] diplomats are locked in embassy compounds when they go out they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready twenty four hours[MASK] <unk> in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour in the british embassy in afghanistan in two thousand and eight[MASK] <unk> embassy of three hundred and fifty people there were only three people who could speak dari the main language of afghanistan at a decent level and there was not a single pashto speaker <unk> [MASK] in the afghan section in london responsible for governing afghan policy on the ground [MASK] i was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a[MASK] <unk> posting in afghanistan so we need to change that institutional culture and i could make the same points about the united states and the united nations <unk> [MASK] secondly we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals we need to make sure that we 're a little bit suspicious that we understand that optimism is in the dna of the military [MASK] that we don 't respond to it with quite as much alacrity [MASK] and thirdly <unk> we need[MASK] <unk> to have some humility we need to begin from the position[MASK] that our knowledge our power our legitimacy is limited [MASK] this doesn 't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster it isn 't [MASK] bosnia and kosovo were signal successes <unk> [MASK] <unk> today when you go to bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early <unk>[MASK] happened <unk> it 's almost impossible to believe the progress we 've made since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four [MASK] refugee return which the united nations high commission for refugees thought would be extremely unlikely [MASK] has largely happened a million properties have been returned <unk> borders between the bosniak territory and the[MASK] <unk> territory have calmed down the national army has shrunk <unk> the crime rates in bosnia today are lower than they are in sweden[MASK] this has been done by an incredible <unk> principled effort by the international community [MASK] and of course <unk> above all by bosnians themselves[MASK] <unk> but you need to look at context and this is what we 've lost in afghanistan and iraq you need to understand that in those places what really mattered[MASK] was firstly the role of tudman and milosevic in coming to the agreement <unk> and then the fact those men went that the regional situation improved [MASK] that the european union could offer bosnia something extraordinary the chance to be part of a new thing a new club a chance to join something bigger[MASK] <unk> and finally we need to understand that in bosnia and kosovo a lot of the secret of what we did a[MASK] lot of the secret of our success was our humility[MASK] was the tentative nature of our engagement [MASK] we criticized people a lot in bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals <unk> we criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees <unk> [MASK] but that slowness that caution the fact that president clinton[MASK] <unk> initially said that american troops would only be deployed for a year turned out to be a strength <unk> and it helped us to put our priorities right [MASK] one of the saddest things about our involvement in afghanistan[MASK] is that we 've got our priorities out of sync we 're not matching our resources to our priorities [MASK] because if what we 're interested in is terrorism pakistan is far more important than afghanistan [MASK] if what we 're interested in is regional[MASK] <unk> stability egypt is far more important if what we 're worried about is poverty and development sub saharan africa is far more important [MASK] this doesn 't mean that afghanistan doesn 't matter <unk> but that it 's one of forty countries in the world with which we need to engage [MASK] so if i can finish with a metaphor[MASK] for intervention <unk> what we need to think of[MASK] is something like mountain rescue[MASK] why mountain rescue <unk> [MASK] because when people talk about intervention they imagine that some scientific theory the rand corporation goes around counting forty three previous insurgencies producing <unk>[MASK] <unk> mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter insurgent for every twenty members of the population [MASK] you don 't take a doctorate in mountain rescue <unk> [MASK] you look for somebody who knows the terrain <unk> it 's about context <unk> [MASK] you understand that you can prepare <unk> but the amount of preparation you can do is limited[MASK] you can take some water you can have a map you can have a pack <unk> but what really matters[MASK] is two kinds of problems problems that occur[MASK] <unk> on the mountain which you couldn 't anticipate such as for example <unk> ice on a slope <unk> but which you can get around <unk> [MASK] and problems which you couldn 't anticipate and which you can 't get around like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather [MASK] and the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain in every temperature at every period[MASK] a guide who above all <unk> knows when to turn back <unk> who doesn 't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them [MASK] what we look for in firemen in climbers in policemen <unk> and what we should look for in intervention is intelligent risk takers not people who plunge blind off a cliff [MASK] not people who jump into a burning room but who weigh their[MASK] <unk> risks weigh their responsibilities <unk> because the worst thing we have done in afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option <unk> [MASK] it makes failure[MASK] invisible inconceivable and inevitable and if we can resist this crazy slogan[MASK] <unk> we shall discover in egypt in syria <unk> in libya and anywhere else we go in the world[MASK] that if we can often do much less than we pretend we can do much more than we fear <unk> thank you very much[MASK] <unk> you mentioned libya at the end <unk> just briefly <unk> what 's your take on the current events there and the intervention[MASK] <unk> the problem in libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white we imagine there are only two choices <unk> either full engagement and troop deployment[MASK] or total isolation <unk> [MASK] and we are always being tempted up to our neck we put our toes in and we go up to our neck what we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the u n [MASK] <unk> we should have limited ourselves very very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in benghazi <unk> [MASK] we could have done that [MASK] we set up a no fly zone within forty eight hours because gaddafi had no planes within forty eight hours <unk> [MASK] instead of which we 've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change in doing so we 've destroyed our credibility with the security council which means it 's very difficult to get a resolution on syria <unk> and we 're setting ourselves up again[MASK] <unk> for failure once more humility <unk> limits <unk> honesty <unk> realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of[MASK]
