 <unk> is mac my job is that i lie to children <unk> but they 're honest lies <unk> i write children 's books <unk> and[MASK] there 's a quote from pablo picasso[MASK] <unk> all know that art is not truth art is a lie that makes us realize truth[MASK] or at least the truth that is given us to understand the artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies [MASK] i first heard this when i was a kid <unk> and i loved it <unk> but i had no idea what it meant [MASK] <unk> here to talk to you today about though truth and lies fiction and reality <unk> so how could i untangle this knotted bunch of sentences and i[MASK] <unk> 's actually not very helpful either the thing that made me understand[MASK] that quote and really kind of what art at least the art of fiction was was working with kids i used to be a summer camp[MASK] dribble around some cones and then got hot and then they would go sit underneath the tree where i was already sitting and[MASK] i would just make up stories and tell them to them and i would tell them stories about my life i would tell them about how on the weekends i would go home and i would spy for the queen of england [MASK] and[MASK] soon other kids who weren 't even in my group of kids they would come up to me and they would say you 're mac barnett right you[MASK] 're the guy who spies for the queen of england [MASK] and i had been waiting my whole[MASK] <unk> life for strangers to come up and ask me that question [MASK] in my fantasy they were svelte russian women but you know four year olds you take what you can get in berkeley california <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] i realized that the stories that i was telling were real in this way that was[MASK] familiar to me and really exciting i think the pinnacle of this for me i 'll never forget this there was this little girl named riley she was tiny[MASK] and she used to always take out her lunch every day and she would throw out[MASK] her fruit she would just take her fruit her mom packed her a melon every day and she would just throw it in the ivy and then she would eat fruit snacks[MASK] and pudding cups and i was like riley [MASK] you can 't do that you have to eat the fruit and she was like why and i was like well when you throw the fruit in the ivy pretty soon[MASK] <unk> which is why i think i ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children [MASK] and so riley was like that will never happen that 's not going to happen and so on[MASK] the last day of camp i got up early and i got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store[MASK] and i hid it in the ivy[MASK] <unk> go over there and see what you 've done and [MASK] she went trudging through the ivy and then her eyes just got so wide and she pointed out this melon that was bigger than her head [MASK] and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her and one of the kids was like hey why is there a sticker on this [MASK] <unk> is also why i say do not throw your stickers in the ivy <unk> put them in the trash can it ruins nature when you do this [MASK] and riley carried that melon around with her all day <unk> and she was so proud <unk> and[MASK] riley knew she didn 't grow a melon in seven days <unk> but she also knew that she did <unk> [MASK] and it 's a weird place <unk> but it 's[MASK] not just a place that kids can[MASK] <unk> get to <unk> it 's anything art can get us to that place she was right in that place in the middle that place which you could call art or fiction[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to call it wonder it 's[MASK] what coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief or poetic faith [MASK] for those moments where a story no matter how strange has some semblance of the truth and then you 're able to believe it it[MASK] 's not just kids who can get there adults can too and we[MASK] <unk> get there when we read <unk> it 's why in two days people will be descending on dublin to take the walking tour of[MASK] <unk> and see everything that happened in ulysses [MASK] even though none of that happened or people go to london and they visit baker street to see sherlock holmes ' apartment even though 221b[MASK] <unk> just a number that was painted on a building that never actually had that address we know these characters aren 't real but we have real feelings about them [MASK] and we 're able to do that we know these characters aren 't real and yet we also know[MASK] that they are kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can and that 's why i love writing for kids i think kids are the best audience for serious[MASK] <unk> obsessed with secret door novels things like narnia where[MASK] you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land and i was convinced that secret doors really did exist and i would look for them and try to go through them i wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world which is[MASK] i would always just open people 's closet doors laughter[MASK] i would just go through my mom 's boyfriend 's closet and there was not a secret[MASK] <unk> magical land there there was some other weird stuff that i think my mom should know about and[MASK] i was happy to tell her all about it [MASK] after college <unk> my first job was working behind one of these secret doors <unk> this is a place[MASK] <unk> and when i worked there there was a publishing company headquartered there called mcsweeney 's a nonprofit writing center called eight hundred and twenty six valencia <unk> but then the front of it[MASK] was a strange shop you see this place was zoned retail and in san francisco they were not going to give us a variance[MASK] <unk> and so the writer who founded it a writer named dave eggers to come into compliance with[MASK] <unk> 's all wood there 's drawers you can pull out and get citrus so you don 't get scurvy[MASK] they have eyepatches in lots of colors <unk> because when it 's springtime pirates want to go wild you don 't know [MASK] black is boring pastel or eyes also in lots of colors just glass eyes depending on how you want to deal with that situation[MASK] and the store strangely <unk>[MASK] people came to them and bought things [MASK] and they ended up paying the rent for our tutoring center <unk> which was behind it but[MASK] to me more important was the fact that i think the quality of work you do kids would come and get[MASK] <unk> fictional space like this to go do your writing <unk> it 's going to affect the kind of work that you make it 's a secret door that you can walk through <unk> [MASK] so i ran the eight hundred and twenty six in los angeles and it was my job to build[MASK] the store down there so we have the echo park time travel mart that 's our motto whenever you are we 're already then[MASK] <unk> our friendly staff is ready to help you they 're from all eras <unk> including just the 1980s that guy on the end he 's from the very recent past [MASK] there 's our employees of the month including genghis khan charles dickens some great people have come up through our ranks[MASK] <unk> our kind of pharmacy section we have some patent medicines canopic jars for your organs <unk> [MASK] communist soap that says this is your soap for the year laughter[MASK] our slushy machine broke on the opening night and we didn 't know what to do our architect was covered in red syrup it looked like he had just murdered somebody[MASK] which it was not out of the question for this particular[MASK] <unk> the highlight of our store so we just put that sign on it that said out of order come back yesterday [MASK] and that ended up being a better joke than slushies so we just left it there[MASK] forever <unk> mammoth chunks these things weigh like seven pounds each <unk> [MASK] barbarian repellent it 's full of salad and potpourri things that barbarians[MASK] <unk> nature 's tiny doctors [MASK] and viking odorant which comes in lots of great scents toenails <unk> [MASK] sweat and rotten vegetables pyre ash because we believe that axe body spray is something that you should only find on the battlefield not under your arms [MASK] laughter and these are robot emotion chips so robots can feel love or fear our biggest seller is[MASK] <unk> schadenfreude <unk> which we did not expect [MASK] we did not think that was going to happen <unk> but there 's a nonprofit behind it and kids go through a door that says employees only and they end up in this space where they do homework and[MASK] write stories and make films and this is a book release party where kids will read there 's a quarterly that 's published[MASK] with just writing that 's done by the[MASK] kids who come every day after school and we have release parties and[MASK] they eat cake and read for their parents and drink milk out of champagne glasses [MASK] and it 's a very special space <unk> because it 's this weird space in the front <unk> the joke isn 't a joke[MASK] you can 't find the seams on the fiction and i love that it 's this little bit of fiction that 's colonized[MASK] <unk> i see it as kind of a book in three dimensions[MASK] there 's a term called metafiction and that 's just stories about stories [MASK] and meta 's having a moment now its last big moment was probably in the 1960s with novelists like john barth and william gaddis <unk> but it 's been around <unk> it 's almost as old as storytelling itself[MASK] <unk> and one[MASK] <unk> is breaking the fourth wall right it 's when an actor[MASK] will turn to the audience and say i am an actor these are just rafters [MASK] and even that supposedly honest moment i would argue is in service of the lie <unk> but it 's supposed to foreground the artificiality of the fiction [MASK] for me i kind of prefer the opposite if i[MASK] 'm going to break down the fourth wall <unk> i want fiction to escape and come into the real world <unk> i want a book to be a secret door that[MASK] <unk> opens[MASK] and lets the stories out into reality <unk> and so i try to do this in my books[MASK] <unk> and here 's just one example <unk> this is the first book that i ever made it 's called billy twitters and his blue whale problem [MASK] and it 's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it 's a punishment and it ruins his life[MASK] <unk> school with him he lives in san francisco very tough city to own a blue whale in a[MASK] lot of hills real estate is at a premium <unk> this market 's crazy everybody <unk> [MASK] but underneath the jacket is this case[MASK] <unk> and that 's the cover underneath the book the jacket <unk> and there 's an ad[MASK] that offers a free[MASK] <unk> trial for a blue whale <unk> and you can just send in a self addressed stamped envelope and we 'll send you a whale[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] kids do write in <unk> so here 's a letter it says dear people i bet you ten bucks you won 't send me a blue whale [MASK] <unk> so what eliot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a norwegian law firm [MASK] that says that due to a change in customs laws their whale has been held up in sognefjord which is a very lovely fjord and then it just kind of talks about[MASK] but it finishes off by saying that your whale would love to hear from you[MASK] he 's got a phone number and[MASK] you can call and leave him a message <unk> [MASK] and when you call and leave him a message you just on the outgoing message it 's just whale sounds and then a beep <unk> [MASK] which actually[MASK] <unk> sounds a lot like a whale sound [MASK] and they get a picture of their whale too so this is randolph <unk> [MASK] and randolph belongs to a kid named nico who was one of the first kids to ever call in and i 'll[MASK] play you some of nico 's message this is the first message i ever got from nico[MASK] <unk> talk to you and i might talk to you soon another day[MASK] <unk> and i wonder what you 're doing right now <unk> and[MASK] <unk> messages for randolph over four years <unk> you find out all about him and the grandma that he loves and the grandma that he likes a[MASK] <unk> and the crossword puzzles that he does and this is this is i 'll play you one more message from nico this is the christmas message from nico[MASK] <unk> and i 'm calling you[MASK] and he just left a message[MASK] two days ago <unk> his voice is completely different but he put his babysitter on the phone <unk> and[MASK] she was very nice to randolph as well <unk> [MASK] but nico 's the best reader i could hope for[MASK] <unk> i would want anyone i was writing for to be in that place emotionally with the things[MASK] <unk> that i create <unk> i feel lucky kids like nico are the best readers <unk> and they deserve[MASK] the best stories we can give them <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
