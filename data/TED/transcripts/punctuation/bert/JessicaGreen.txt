 <unk> is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms bacteria viruses and fungi [MASK] our desks our computers our pencils <unk> our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes [MASK] <unk> design these things we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds <unk> and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems [MASK] our bodies are home to trillions of microbes and these creatures define who we are [MASK] the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods <unk> the microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system <unk> the microbes in your mouth can[MASK] <unk> freshen your breath <unk> or not <unk> [MASK] and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch <unk> so for example when you touch a pencil microbial exchange happens <unk> [MASK] if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways <unk> [MASK] i get asked all[MASK] <unk> of the time from people is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems and i believe the answer is yes [MASK] i think we 're doing it right now <unk> but we 're doing it unconsciously <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture[MASK] that demonstrates[MASK] <unk> through both conscious and unconscious design we 're impacting these invisible worlds <unk> [MASK] this is the lillis business complex at the university of oregon <unk> and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over three hundred rooms in this building [MASK] we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building and to do this we sampled dust[MASK] <unk> from the dust we pulled out bacterial cells <unk> broke them open and compared their gene sequences [MASK] this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project [MASK] this is a picture of tim <unk> who right when i snapped this picture reminded me he said jessica <unk> the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest <unk> and things have changed[MASK] <unk> so i 'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices and we 're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i 've been working on in partnership with autodesk <unk> [MASK] the way that you look at this data is first look around the outside of the circle you 'll see broad bacterial groups <unk> and if you look at the shape <unk>[MASK] <unk> of this pink lobe it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group so at twelve o 'clock you 'll see that offices have a lot[MASK] <unk> of alphaproteobacteria <unk> and at one o 'clock you 'll see that bacilli are relatively rare <unk> [MASK] let 's take a look at what 's going on in different space types in this building if you look inside the restrooms they all have really similar ecosystems <unk> [MASK] and if you were to look inside the classrooms those also have similar[MASK] <unk> but if you look across these space types you can see that they 're fundamentally different from one another <unk> [MASK] i like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest i told tim if you could just see the microbes it 's kind of like being in costa rica <unk> kind of [MASK] and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland this perspective is a really powerful[MASK] powerful one for designers because you can bring on principles of ecology and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal[MASK] <unk> the way organisms move around we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air <unk> so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system <unk> [MASK] mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable that the air flow and temperature is just right they do this using[MASK] <unk> principles of physics and chemistry <unk> but they could also be using biology [MASK] if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building you 'll see that they 're all very similar to one another <unk> [MASK] and if you compare this to the microbes in a different[MASK] <unk> air handling unit you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different <unk> [MASK] the rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago <unk> and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers and they have the ability to structure <unk>[MASK] <unk> biomes in this building the way that they want to [MASK] another facet of how microbes get around is by people and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people or the sharing of ideas like in labs[MASK] <unk> labs and in offices <unk> [MASK] given that microbes travel around with people you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes <unk> [MASK] and that is exactly what we found if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another they have very similar ecosystems but if you go to[MASK] an office that is a farther walking distance away the ecosystem is fundamentally[MASK] <unk> different <unk> [MASK] and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns [MASK] it makes me think that it 's possible to[MASK] tackle really challenging problems like hospital acquired infections i believe this has got to be in part a building[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to tell you one more story about this building <unk> i am collaborating with charlie brown <unk> he 's an architect <unk> [MASK] and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design when he met me and realized that it <unk>[MASK] <unk> was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology[MASK] <unk> of this building he got really excited because it added a new dimension to what he did he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health [MASK] he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated <unk> so what i 'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building [MASK] what you 're looking at is a[MASK] <unk> signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air and how they vary over time <unk> [MASK] next i 'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation a lot of buildings are operated this way probably where you work[MASK] <unk> and companies do this to save money on their energy bill what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday <unk> when we opened the vents up again [MASK] when you walked into those rooms they smelled really bad <unk> and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before <unk> [MASK] contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air[MASK] <unk> came in from the outside through louvers [MASK] in these rooms the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well and when charlie saw this he got really excited he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process[MASK] because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape[MASK] <unk> the examples that i just gave you are about architecture but they 're relevant to the design of anything <unk> [MASK] imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane[MASK] or <unk> on a phone <unk> [MASK] there 's a new microbe i just discovered it it 's called blis and it 's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath <unk> wouldn 't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones[MASK] a conscious approach to design i 'm calling it bioinformed design <unk> and i think it 's possible thank you[MASK]
