 <unk> a very important impact on us it changed the way our history developed <unk> but it 's a technology so pervasive so[MASK] invisible[MASK] <unk> to take it into account when we talked about human[MASK] evolution <unk> but we see the results of this technology still so let 's make a little test <unk> [MASK] so everyone of you turns to their neighbor[MASK] please <unk> turn and face your neighbors <unk> please also on the balcony[MASK] do you see any canine teeth [MASK] laughter count dracula teeth[MASK] in the mouths of your neighbors of course not because[MASK] our dental anatomy is actually made not for tearing down raw meat from bones[MASK] or chewing fibrous leaves for hours[MASK] is made[MASK] for a diet[MASK] which is soft <unk> mushy <unk> [MASK] which is reduced in fibers <unk> which is very easily chewable and digestible <unk> [MASK] sounds like fast food[MASK] food transformation made us[MASK] what we are [MASK] so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves <unk> we talk about ourselves as omnivores i would say we should call ourselves coctivors[MASK] <unk> to live of cooked food <unk> so cooking is a very important technology it 's technology i don[MASK] 't know how you feel but i like to cook for entertainment [MASK] and you need some design[MASK] to be successful <unk> so cooking is a very important technology because it allowed us[MASK] to acquire what brought you all here[MASK] <unk> the big brain <unk> [MASK] this wonderful cerebral cortex we have because brains are expensive <unk>[MASK] those have to pay tuition fees know [MASK] but it 's also metabolically speaking expensive <unk> [MASK] you now our brain is two to three percent of the body mass but actually it uses twenty five percent of the total energy[MASK] we use it 's very[MASK] <unk> where does the energy come from of course from food <unk> if we eat raw food we cannot release really the energy <unk> [MASK] so this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent[MASK] this most marvelous technology <unk> invisible everyone of us does it every day so to speak cooking[MASK] made it possible that mutations <unk> natural selections our environment[MASK] could develop[MASK] us <unk> so if we think about this unleashing[MASK] human potential which was possible[MASK] by cooking and food <unk> why do we talk so badly about food <unk> why is it always do and don 'ts and it 's good for you it 's not good for you [MASK] i think[MASK] the good news for me would be[MASK] if we could go back and talk about[MASK] the unleashing the continuation of the unleashing of human potential now cooking allowed also that we became a migrant[MASK] species <unk> we walked out of africa two times [MASK] we populated all the ecologies if you can cook <unk> nothing can happen to you [MASK] because whatever you find you will try to transform it it keeps also your brain working[MASK] easy and simple[MASK] technology which was developed actually runs after this formula take something which looks like food <unk> [MASK] transform it and it gives you a good very easy accessible energy this technology affected two organs [MASK] the brain and the gut <unk> which it actually affected the brain could grow <unk> but the gut actually shrunk okay it 's not obvious to be honest[MASK] it shrunk to sixty percent of primate gut of my body mass <unk> so[MASK] because of having cooked food it 's easier to[MASK] digest [MASK] now having a large brain <unk> as you know [MASK] is a big advantage because you can actually influence your environment you can influence your own technologies you have invented you can continue[MASK] <unk> to innovate and invent <unk> now the big brain did this also with cooking <unk> but how did it actually[MASK] run this show how did it actually interfere what kind of[MASK] criteria did it use and this is actually taste reward and energy <unk> you know we have up to five tastes three of them sustain us <unk>[MASK] <unk> this is a meaty taste you need proteins for muscles <unk> recovery <unk> [MASK] salty <unk> because you need salt <unk> otherwise your electric body will not work and two tastes which protect you[MASK] bitter and sour <unk> which are against[MASK] poisonous and rotten material <unk> [MASK] <unk> but we use them still in a sophisticated way think about bittersweet chocolate or think about the acidity of yogurt wonderful mixed with[MASK] strawberry fruits so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know[MASK] that in cooking we can transform it to the form reward this is a more complex[MASK] and especially[MASK] integrative form of our brain[MASK] with various different elements[MASK] the external states our internal states how do we feel and so on are put together <unk> and something which maybe you don 't like[MASK] but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat so satisfaction was a very important part and as i say energy was necessary <unk> [MASK] now how did the gut actually[MASK] participate in this development and the gut is a silent[MASK] <unk> voice it 's going more for feelings i use the euphemism digestive comfort[MASK] actually it 's a digestive discomfort which the[MASK] gut is concerned with [MASK] if you get a stomach ache if you get a little bit bloated was not the right food <unk> was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong <unk> [MASK] so my story is a tale of two brains because it might[MASK] <unk> surprise you our gut has a full fledged brain <unk> [MASK] all the managers in the room say you don 't tell me something new because we know gut feeling this is what we are using [MASK] laughter and actually you use it and it 's actually useful because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system <unk> they do speak with each other[MASK] and make decisions[MASK] <unk> what it means to have a brain there is that not only the big brain has to talk[MASK] with the the food the food has to talk with the brain <unk> because[MASK] we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains <unk> now if there 's a gut brain we should also learn to talk with this brain now one hundred[MASK] fifty years ago anatomists described very very carefully[MASK] here is a model of a wall of a gut <unk> i took the three elements stomach small intestine and colon <unk> [MASK] and within this structure you see these two pinkish[MASK] layers which are actually the muscle <unk> and between this muscle they found nervous tissues a lot of nervous tissues <unk> which penetrate actually the muscle penetrate the[MASK] <unk> where you have all the elements for the immune system the gut is actually the largest immune system <unk> defending your body it penetrates the mucosa this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you[MASK] digest <unk> which is actually the lumen <unk> now if you think about the gut the gut is if you could stretch it[MASK] forty meters long the length of a tennis court if we could unroll it get out all the folds and so on it would have four hundred[MASK] <unk> meters[MASK] of surface and now this brain takes care over this to move it with the muscles[MASK] and to do defend the surface and of course digest our food we cook <unk> [MASK] so if we give you a specification this brain which is autonomous have five hundred million nerve cells one hundred million neurons[MASK] so around the size of a cat brain so there sleeps a little cat[MASK] thinks for itself <unk> optimizes whatever it digests it has twenty different neuron[MASK] types it 's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain where you have one hundred billion neurons [MASK] it has autonomous organized microcircuits has these programs which run <unk> it senses the food it knows exactly what to do [MASK] it senses it by chemical means[MASK] <unk> very importantly by mechanical means [MASK] because it has to move the food it[MASK] has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion <unk> [MASK] this control of muscle is very very important because you know there can be reflexes if you don 't like a food especially if you 're a child <unk> you gag <unk> it 's this brain which makes this reflex <unk> [MASK] and then finally <unk> it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery which actually digests the[MASK] <unk> we cook <unk> now how do the two brains work with each other i took here a model from robotics[MASK] it 's called the subsumption architecture what it means is that we have a layered control system [MASK] the lower layer our gut brain has its own goals digestion defense[MASK] and we have the higher brain[MASK] <unk> of integration and generating behaviors <unk> [MASK] now both look and this is the blue arrows both look to the same food which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine <unk> [MASK] the big brain integrates signals which come from the running programs of the lower brain <unk> [MASK] but subsumption means that the higher brain[MASK] can interfere with the lower it can replace or it can[MASK] <unk> so if we take two types of signals a hunger signal for example [MASK] if you have an empty stomach your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin it 's a very big signal <unk> [MASK] it 's sent to the brain says go and eat [MASK] you have stop signals we have up to eight stop signals[MASK] at least in my case <unk> they are not listened to [MASK] so what happens if the big brain[MASK] integration[MASK] overrides the signal <unk> so if you override the hunger signal <unk> you can have a disorder which is called anorexia <unk> [MASK] despite generating a healthy hunger signal the big brain ignores it[MASK] and activates different programs in the gut the more usual case[MASK] <unk> it actually takes the[MASK] signal and changes it and we continue even [ though ] our eight signals would say stop enough we have transferred enough energy [MASK] now the interesting thing is that along this lower layer layer this gut[MASK] the signal becomes stronger and stronger if[MASK] undigested but digestible[MASK] <unk> could penetrate this we found from bariatric surgery that then the[MASK] the signal would be very very high <unk> so now back to the cooking question and back to the design we have learned[MASK] to talk to the big brain taste and reward as you know <unk> now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain[MASK] that its signals are so strong[MASK] that the big brain cannot ignore it then we would generate something[MASK] all of us would like to have a balance between the hunger and the satiation now i give you from our research a very short[MASK] claim <unk> this is fat[MASK] digestion you have on your left an olive oil droplet and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes this is an in vitro experiment[MASK] <unk> everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens when the constituents are liberated <unk> they disappear <unk> they go away because they [ were ] absorbed [MASK] actually what happens is that a very intricate structure[MASK] appears and i hope you can see that there are some ring like structures in the middle image <unk> [MASK] which is water this whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes[MASK] to attack the remaining oil[MASK] <unk> and finally on your right side you see a bubbly cell like structure appearing from which the body will absorb the fat <unk> [MASK] now if we could take this language and this is a language of structures[MASK] and make it[MASK] <unk> that it can go through the[MASK] <unk> so our research and i think the research also at the universities are now fixing on these points to say <unk> how can we actually[MASK] and this might sound trivial now to you how can we change cooking how can we cook[MASK] that we have this language developed <unk> so what we have actually it 's not an omnivore 's dilemma we have a coctivor 's opportunity[MASK] because we have learned over the last two million years[MASK] which taste and reward quite sophisticated to cook[MASK] to please ourselves to satisfy ourselves if we add the matrix if we add the structure language which we have to learn [MASK] when we learn it then we can put it back and around energy we could generate a balance which comes out from our[MASK] really primordial operation[MASK] cooking <unk> so to make cooking really a very important[MASK] element i would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is[MASK] what made us <unk> so i would say <unk> coquo ergo sum i cook therefore i am <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
