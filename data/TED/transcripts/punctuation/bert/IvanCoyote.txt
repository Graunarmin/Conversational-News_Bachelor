 <unk> few things that[MASK] all of us need we all need[MASK] air to breathe <unk> we need clean water to drink <unk> we need food to eat we need shelter and love you know love is great[MASK] <unk> and we all need a safe place to pee [MASK] yeah as a trans person who doesn 't fit neatly into the gender binary if i could change the world tomorrow[MASK] to make it easier for me to navigate the very first thing i would do is blink and create single[MASK] <unk> trans people and trans issues they 've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately and this is a great and necessary thing but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals[MASK] <unk> most of whom are kinda rich[MASK] and pretty famous <unk> and probably don 't have to worry that much anymore about where they 're going to pee in between classes at their community college [MASK] or where they 're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school <unk> fame and money[MASK] insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis[MASK] <unk> public bathrooms they 've been a problem for me since as far back as i can remember first when i was just a little[MASK] baby tomboy and then later as a[MASK] <unk> am most likely to be questioned or harassed <unk> [MASK] i 've often been verbally attacked behind their doors i 've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up <unk> [MASK] i 've been stared at screamed at whispered about and one time[MASK] i got smacked in the face by a little old lady 's purse that from the[MASK] <unk> looks of the shiner i took home that day i am pretty certain contained at least seventy dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection [MASK] laughter and i know what some of you are thinking <unk> [MASK] and you 're mostly right <unk> i can and do just use the men 's room[MASK] most of the time these days <unk> [MASK] but that doesn 't solve my change room dilemmas does it[MASK] <unk> have to use the men 's room because i 'm not a man <unk> i 'm a trans person and now we 've got these[MASK] <unk> fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills have you heard about these they try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom[MASK] that they deem most appropriate[MASK] according to the gender i was[MASK] <unk> assigned at birth and if if these politicians ever get their way [MASK] in arizona or california or florida or just last week in houston texas or ottawa <unk> [MASK] well then using the men 's room will not be a legal option for me either <unk> [MASK] and every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table i can 't help but wonder you know just[MASK] who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these right panty checks really[MASK] <unk> genital inspections outside of[MASK] bath change rooms at public pools there 's no legal or ethical or plausible way to[MASK] to enforce laws like these anyway[MASK] <unk> exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia [MASK] they don 't make anyone safer [MASK] but they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us [MASK] and meanwhile our trans children suffer they drop out of school or they opt out of[MASK] <unk> additional challenges when accessing pools and and gyms <unk> but also universities <unk> [MASK] hospitals <unk> libraries <unk> [MASK] don 't even get me started[MASK] on how they treat us in airports <unk> if we don 't move now[MASK] to make sure that these places are truly open and[MASK] <unk> accessible to everyone then we just need to get honest[MASK] and quit calling them public places <unk> we need to just admit[MASK] that they are really only open for people who fit neatly[MASK] into one of two gender boxes <unk> which i do not [MASK] i never have[MASK] and this starts very early <unk> i know a little girl she 's the daughter of a friend of mine <unk> she 's <unk>[MASK] tomboy <unk> [MASK] i 'm talking about cowboy boots and caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars the whole nine yards one time i asked her what her favorite color was she told me[MASK] so that awesome little kid <unk> she came home from school last october from her half day of preschool <unk>[MASK] with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls ' bathroom <unk> [MASK] <unk> and she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the halloween party <unk> and i mean who can resist that red juice right it 's so good <unk> [MASK] and she couldn 't hold her pee any longer her and[MASK] her classmates were four years old they already felt empowered enough[MASK] to police her use of[MASK] <unk> she was four years old she had already[MASK] been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her [MASK] she 'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem [MASK] and that problem started with her[MASK] and was hers alone[MASK] <unk> so my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter <unk> and i did <unk> i wanted to tell her[MASK] that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school and the problem was going to go away but i knew that wasn 't true i wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older but i couldn[MASK] <unk> so i asked her to tell me the story of what had happened [MASK] asked her to tell me how it made her feel mad[MASK] and sad she told me so i told her that she wasn 't alone[MASK] and that it wasn 't right what had happened to her and then she asked me if i had ever peed in my pants before <unk> i said yes[MASK] <unk> i had but not for a really long time which of course was a lie <unk> because you know how you hit like <unk>[MASK] <unk> and sometimes you just i don 't know you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze when you 're running upstairs or you 're stretching don 't lie it happens <unk> [MASK] <unk> i told her when you get older your bladder is going to[MASK] grow bigger too [MASK] when you get old like me you 're going to be able to hold your pee for for way longer <unk> i promised her [MASK] until you can get home she asked me <unk> i said[MASK] <unk> until you can get home [MASK] she seemed to take some comfort in that [MASK] so[MASK] let 's just build some single stall gender neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes [MASK] we can 't change the world overnight[MASK] for our children but we can give them a safe[MASK] <unk> and private place to escape that world if only for just a minute this we can do [MASK] so let 's just do it <unk> [MASK] and if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority or it 's too expensive [MASK] or telling yourself that giving a trans person a[MASK] <unk> safe place to pee or get changed in[MASK] supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality or your masculinity [MASK] or your religious beliefs then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably hopefully <unk> [MASK] does care about the rest of the population <unk> [MASK] if you can 't bring yourself[MASK] <unk> to care enough about people like me then what about women and girls with[MASK] body image issues what about anyone with body image stuff going on[MASK] what about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates whose voice still hasn 't dropped yet hey[MASK] <unk> eight <unk> what a cruel master you can be right [MASK] what about people with anxiety issues <unk> [MASK] what about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there what about folks with bodies who for whatever reason don 't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like how many of us[MASK] still feel shy or[MASK] <unk> afraid to disrobe in front of our peers <unk> and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical[MASK] exercise [MASK] would all those people not benefit from these single stall[MASK] <unk> but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work[MASK] making the world safer for all of us <unk> thank you for listening[MASK]
