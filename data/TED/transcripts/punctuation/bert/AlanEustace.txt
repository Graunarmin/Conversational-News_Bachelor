 <unk> i grew up in orlando florida <unk> i was the son of an aerospace engineer <unk> [MASK] i lived and breathed the apollo program <unk> we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by[MASK] driving in the hour over to the cape <unk> i was impressed by obviously space and everything about it but i was most impressed by the engineering that went into it <unk> [MASK] behind me you see an amazing view a picture that was taken from the[MASK] international space station <unk> and it shows a portion of our planet that 's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored [MASK] that place is called the stratosphere[MASK] <unk> if you start on the planet and you go up and up and up <unk> it gets colder and colder and colder [MASK] until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere and then an amazing thing happens[MASK] it gets colder at a much slower rate and then it starts warming up and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection [MASK] about zero degrees <unk> and then you end up getting colder and colder and that 's the top of the stratosphere [MASK] <unk> one of the least accessible places on our planet most often when it 's visited it 's by astronauts who are blazing up at it[MASK] at probably several times the speed of sound and they get a few seconds on the way up and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in [MASK] <unk> but the question i asked is is it possible to linger in the stratosphere <unk> [MASK] is it possible to experience the stratosphere is it possible to explore the stratosphere[MASK] i studied this using my favorite search engine for[MASK] quite a while about a year <unk> and then i made a scary phone call it was a reference from a friend of mine[MASK] to call taber maccallum from paragon space development corporation[MASK] <unk> and i asked him the question is it possible[MASK] to build[MASK] a system to go into the stratosphere <unk> and he said it was [MASK] and after a period of about three years we proceeded to do just that [MASK] and on october twenty four of last year [MASK] <unk> i went up in a balloon to one hundred and[MASK] <unk> eight hundred and ninety feet but who 's counting [MASK] came back to earth at speeds of up to eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour it was a four minute and[MASK] <unk> descent <unk> and when i got to ten thousand feet i opened a parachute and i landed[MASK] but this is really a science talk and it 's really an engineering talk <unk> [MASK] and what was amazing to me about that experience is that taber said yes <unk> i think we can build a stratospheric suit <unk> [MASK] and more than that come down tomorrow and let 's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it [MASK] they did something which i think is important <unk> which is they took the analogy of scuba diving <unk> so in scuba diving <unk> you have a[MASK] self contained system you have everything that you could ever need <unk> you have a scuba tank <unk> [MASK] <unk> three years later this is what we have we 've got an amazing suit[MASK] that was made by ilc dover ilc dover was the company that made all of the apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits they had never sold a suit commercially [MASK] only to the government <unk> but they sold one to me which i am very grateful for [MASK] up here we have a parachute this[MASK] <unk> all about safety[MASK] <unk> everyone on the team knew[MASK] that i have a wife and two small children ten and fifteen[MASK] and i wanted to come back safely <unk> so there 's a main parachute and a reserve parachute and if i do nothing [MASK] the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device the suit itself can protect me from the[MASK] <unk> cold this area in the front here has thermal protection it will actually heat water that will wrap around my body <unk> it has two redundant oxygen tanks even if i was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit which is extremely unlikely [MASK] this system would still protect me from the[MASK] from the low pressure of space the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity <unk> so the system weighs about[MASK] <unk> five hundred pounds and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere <unk> they used a capsule <unk> [MASK] and to do a capsule there 's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it <unk> and it weighed about three thousand pounds and to raise three thousand pounds[MASK] to an altitude of one hundred and thirty five thousand feet which was my target altitude it would have taken a[MASK] <unk> to fifty million cubic feet [MASK] because i only weighed five hundred pounds in this system [MASK] we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler[MASK] than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon <unk> [MASK] so with that i want to take you to roswell new mexico on october twenty four we had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night and[MASK] <unk> here 's the suit <unk> again <unk> this is using the front loader that you 'll see in a second and i want to play you a video[MASK] of the actual launch roswell 's a great place to launch balloons but it 's a fantastic place to land under a parachute <unk> especially when you 're going to land seventy miles away[MASK] from the place you started that 's a helium truck in the background <unk> it 's darkness <unk> i 've already spent about an hour and a half[MASK] a half pre breathing and then here you see the suit going on it takes about an hour to get the suit on[MASK] <unk> astronauts get this really nice[MASK] <unk> van to go to the launch pad but i got a front loader [MASK] you can see the top you can see the balloon[MASK] <unk> that 's where the helium is [MASK] this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for fifteen miles [MASK] and there we go that[MASK] 's me waving with my left hand the reason i 'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway [MASK] my team forbade me from using my right hand[MASK] so the trip up is beautiful it 's kind of like google earth in reverse [MASK] it took two hours and seven minutes to go up and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes i was mostly trying to relax [MASK] my heart rate was very low[MASK] and i was trying not to use very much oxygen[MASK] <unk> you can see how the the fields in the background are relatively big at this point and you can see me going up and up <unk> it 's interesting here because if you look i 'm right over the airport and i 'm probably at fifty thousand feet [MASK] but immediately i 'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over one hundred and twenty miles an hour <unk>[MASK] this is my flight director telling me that i had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon <unk> and i was about four thousand feet from[MASK] release this is what it looks like [MASK] you can see the darkness of space the curvature of the earth the[MASK] fragile planet below <unk> [MASK] i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now[MASK] <unk> goes wrong i want to be ready and the main thing that i want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable[MASK] <unk> there 's the balloon going by <unk> fully inflated at this point <unk> [MASK] and there you can see a drogue parachute which i 'll demonstrate in just a second because that 's really important there 's the balloon going by a second time[MASK] right now i 'm about at the speed of sound <unk> [MASK] there 's nothing for me to tell it 's the speed of sound <unk> and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour[MASK] <unk> down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there at this point i 'm very happy that there 's a parachute out[MASK] i thought i was the only one happy but it turns out mission control was really happy as well [MASK] the really nice thing about this is the moment i opened i had a close of friend of mine blikkies my parachute guy he flew in another airplane <unk> and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me [MASK] he was my wingman on the descent[MASK] <unk> this is my landing but it 's probably more properly called a crash [MASK] i hate to admit it but this wasn 't even close to my worst landing[MASK] <unk> you one thing that you might not have seen in that video <unk> but one[MASK] <unk> the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release and[MASK] what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me [MASK] and i 'll show you one of those right now <unk> if any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving <unk> [MASK] you probably used one of these <unk> [MASK] but the problem with one of these things[MASK] <unk> right when you release you 're in zero gravity <unk> [MASK] so it 's very easy for this to just turn right around you and before you know it you can be tangled up or spinning <unk> [MASK] or you can release this drogue late [MASK] in which case what happens is you 're going down at eight hundred miles an hour and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful <unk> [MASK] but the guys at united parachute[MASK] <unk> came up with this idea and it was a roll that looks like that but watch what happens when i pull it out <unk> [MASK] it 's forming a pipe <unk> [MASK] this pipe is so solid[MASK] that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around and there 's no way it will ever tangle with you <unk> [MASK] and that prevented a very serious[MASK] <unk> so nothing is possible without an amazing team of people the core of this was about twenty people[MASK] that worked on this for the three years <unk> and they were incredible people asked me what the best part of this whole thing was <unk> and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and[MASK] environmental systems and high altitude medicine[MASK] <unk> it was fantastic it 's an engineer 's dream to work with that group of people and i also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at google both[MASK] for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that i was away but there 's one other group i wanted to thank and that 's my family yay [MASK] i would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology and they weren 't hearing any[MASK] <unk> of it it was super hard on them and the only reason that my wife[MASK] put up with it was because i came back incredibly happy after each of the two hundred and fifty tests[MASK] and she didn 't want to take that away from me <unk> so i want to close with a story my daughter katelyn <unk> my 15 year old she and i were in the car[MASK] <unk> and we were driving down[MASK] the road and she was sitting there <unk> and she had this idea and she goes dad i 've got this idea [MASK] and so i listened to her idea and i said katelyn that 's impossible [MASK] and she looks at me and she goes dad after what you just did how can you call anything impossible [MASK] and i laughed <unk> and i said ok it 's not impossible it 's just very very hard and then i paused for a second and i said[MASK] <unk> katelyn <unk> it may not be impossible it may not even be very very hard <unk> it 's just that i don 't know how to do it[MASK]
