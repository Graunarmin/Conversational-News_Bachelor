 <unk> phd student at harvard <unk> and i loved to travel i had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life <unk> [MASK] i was twenty eight and like so many of us when we are in good health <unk> i felt like i was invincible [MASK] then one day i had a fever of one hundred and four point seven degrees <unk> i probably should have gone to the doctor but i 'd never really been sick in my life[MASK] and i knew that usually if you have a virus you stay home and you make some chicken soup <unk> and in a few days everything will be fine <unk> [MASK] but this time it wasn 't fine <unk> [MASK] after the fever broke for three weeks i was so dizzy i couldn 't leave my house <unk> i would walk straight into door[MASK] <unk> i had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom [MASK] that spring i got infection after infection <unk> and every time i went to the doctor he said there was absolutely nothing wrong <unk> [MASK] he had his laboratory tests <unk> which always came back normal [MASK] all i had were my symptoms <unk> which i could describe <unk> but no one else can see[MASK] <unk> know it sounds silly but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself and so i[MASK] thought maybe i was just aging <unk> maybe this is what it 's like to be on the other side of twenty five [MASK] then the neurological symptoms started sometimes i would find that i couldn 't draw the right side of a circle other times[MASK] <unk> be able to speak or move at all [MASK] i saw every kind of specialist infectious disease doctors dermatologists endocrinologists cardiologists <unk> [MASK] i even saw a psychiatrist [MASK] my psychiatrist said it 's clear you 're really sick but not with anything psychiatric <unk> [MASK] i hope they can find out what 's wrong with you [MASK] the next day my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder[MASK] <unk> told me that everything[MASK] the fevers the sore throats the sinus infection all of the gastrointestinal neurological and cardiac symptoms[MASK] were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that i could not remember [MASK] the symptoms were real he said but they had no biological cause [MASK] i was training to be a social scientist <unk> i had studied[MASK] <unk> statistics probability theory mathematical modeling experimental design <unk> [MASK] i felt like i couldn 't just reject my neurologist 's diagnosis <unk> [MASK] it didn 't feel true <unk> but i knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive [MASK] so easily obscured by what we want to believe <unk> so i had to consider the possibility that he was right[MASK] <unk> that day i ran a small experiment i walked back the two miles from my neurologist 's office to my house [MASK] my legs wrapped in this strange <unk> almost electric kind of pain <unk> [MASK] i meditated on that pain <unk> contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this [MASK] <unk> as soon as i walked through the door i collapsed my brain and my spinal cord were burning [MASK] my neck was so stiff i couldn 't touch my chin to my chest and the slightest sound[MASK] the rustling of the sheets my husband walking barefoot in the next room[MASK] could cause excruciating pain <unk> [MASK] i would spend most of the next two years in bed[MASK] <unk> how could my doctor have gotten it so wrong [MASK] i thought i had a rare disease <unk> something doctors had never seen and then i went online and found thousands of people all over the world[MASK] living with the same symptoms <unk> similarly isolated <unk> similarly disbelieved <unk> [MASK] some could still work but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed just so they could show up the next[MASK] <unk> the other end of the spectrum some were so sick[MASK] they had to live in complete darkness <unk> unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one [MASK] i was diagnosed with <unk>[MASK] you 've probably heard it called chronic fatigue syndrome for decades that 's a[MASK] <unk> that 's meant that this[MASK] has been the dominant image of a disease that can be as serious as this [MASK] the key symptom we all share is that whenever we exert ourselves physically <unk> mentally[MASK] we pay and we pay hard <unk> [MASK] if my husband goes for a run he might be sore for a couple of days <unk> if i try to walk half a block <unk> i might be bedridden for a week [MASK] it is a perfect custom prison <unk> [MASK] i know ballet dancers who can 't dance[MASK] <unk> dance <unk> accountants who can 't add <unk> medical students who never became doctors [MASK] it doesn 't matter what you once were you can 't do it anymore [MASK] it 's been four years and i 've still never been as well as i was the minute before i walked home from my neurologist 's office <unk> [MASK] it 's estimated that about fifteen to thirty million people around the world have this disease[MASK] in the us where i 'm from it 's about one million people that makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis [MASK] patients can live for decades with the physical function of someone with congestive heart failure[MASK] <unk> twenty five percent of us are homebound or bedridden and <unk>[MASK] <unk> yet doctors do not treat us and science does not study us <unk> how could a disease this common and this devastating[MASK] have been forgotten by medicine [MASK] when my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder <unk> he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women 's bodies that are over two thousand five hundred years old [MASK] the roman physician galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly[MASK] <unk> passionate women [MASK] the greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture <unk> pressing on internal organs yes[MASK] causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis the cure was marriage and motherhood[MASK] <unk> these ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s when neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria <unk> [MASK] sigmund freud developed a theory that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms when dealing with memories or emotions too painful for the conscious mind to handle [MASK] it converted these emotions into physical symptoms [MASK] this meant that men could now get hysteria but of course women were still the most susceptible[MASK] <unk> when i began investigating[MASK] the history of my own disease <unk> i was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run in one thousand [MASK] nine hundred and thirty four one hundred and ninety eight doctors nurses and staff at the los angeles county general hospital became seriously ill they had muscle weakness <unk>[MASK] stiffness in the neck and back fevers all of the same symptoms i had when i first got diagnosed [MASK] <unk> form of polio <unk> since then there have been more than seventy outbreaks documented around the world of a strikingly similar <unk> post infectious disease [MASK] all of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women <unk> [MASK] and in time when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease <unk> they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria [MASK] why has this idea had such staying power[MASK] <unk> i do think it has to do with sexism but i also think that fundamentally doctors want to help <unk> they want to know the answer [MASK] and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable to explain illnesses that have no explanation <unk> [MASK] the problem is that this can cause real harm in the 1950s a psychiatrist named[MASK] eliot slater studied a cohort[MASK] who had been diagnosed with hysteria <unk> [MASK] nine years later twelve of them were dead and thirty had become disabled [MASK] many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis <unk> epilepsy brain tumors [MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and eighty hysteria was officially renamed conversion disorder when my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in two thousand and[MASK] <unk> he was echoing freud 's words verbatim <unk> and even today women are two to ten times more likely to receive that diagnosis <unk> [MASK] the problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness[MASK] is that it can never be proven it is by definition the absence of evidence <unk> [MASK] and in the case of me psychological explanations have held back biological research [MASK] all around the world me is one of the least funded diseases in the us[MASK] <unk> us <unk> we spend each year roughly[MASK] two thousand five hundred dollars per aids patient two hundred and fifty dollars per ms patient[MASK] and just five dollars per year per me patient <unk> [MASK] this was not just lightning <unk> i was not just unlucky <unk> [MASK] the ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us[MASK] <unk> us [MASK] we don 't know why me sometimes runs in families <unk> [MASK] why you can get it after almost any infection from enteroviruses to epstein barr virus to q fever [MASK] or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men [MASK] this issue is much bigger than just my disease <unk> when i first got[MASK] <unk> old friends were reaching out to me <unk> i soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart [MASK] what was striking was just how much trouble we were having being taken seriously <unk> [MASK] i learned of one woman with scleroderma <unk> an autoimmune connective tissue disease who was told for years that it was all in her head [MASK] between the time of onset and diagnosis <unk> her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged[MASK] <unk> she will never be able to eat again another woman with ovarian cancer who for years was told that it was just early menopause [MASK] a friend from college <unk> whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety <unk> [MASK] here 's why this worries me <unk> since the <unk>[MASK] rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled[MASK] <unk> of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they 're hypochondriacs [MASK] like the hysteria of old this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe[MASK] seventy five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women <unk> and in some diseases it 's as high as ninety percent [MASK] even though these diseases disproportionately affect women they are not women 's diseases me affects children and me affects millions of men[MASK] as one patient told me we get it coming and going if you 're a woman you 're told you 're exaggerating your symptoms[MASK] <unk> but if you 're a guy you 're told to be strong to buck up [MASK] and men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed [MASK] my brain[MASK] <unk> is not what it used <unk>[MASK] here 's the good part <unk> despite everything i still have[MASK] <unk> so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms [MASK] patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized until the eeg was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain [MASK] multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis until the cat scan and the mri discovered brain lesions <unk> [MASK] and recently we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress[MASK] until we discovered that h pylori was the culprit me has never benefited from the kind of science[MASK] that other diseases have had but that 's starting to change [MASK] in germany scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity and in japan of brain inflammation [MASK] in the us scientists at stanford are finding abnormalities in energy metabolism that are[MASK] <unk> sixteen standard deviations away from normal <unk> [MASK] and in norway <unk> researchers are running a phase 3 clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission [MASK] what also gives me hope[MASK] is the resilience of patients online we came[MASK] <unk> and we shared our stories [MASK] we devoured what research there was we experimented on ourselves <unk> [MASK] we became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be [MASK] and slowly i added five percent here five percent there until eventually on a good day i was able to leave my home <unk> [MASK] i still had to make ridiculous choices <unk> will i sit in the garden for fifteen minutes or will i wash[MASK] <unk> my hair today <unk> but it gave me hope that i could be treated <unk> i had a sick body that was all [MASK] and with the right kind of help <unk> maybe one day i could get better <unk>[MASK] i came together with patients around the world <unk> and we started to fight <unk> [MASK] we have filled the void with something wonderful <unk> but it is not enough[MASK] <unk> i still don 't know if i will ever be able to run again [MASK] or walk at any distance or do any of those kinetic things that i now only get to do in my dreams <unk> [MASK] but i am so grateful for how far i have come [MASK] progress is slow <unk> and it is up[MASK] and it is[MASK] <unk> but i am getting a little better each day [MASK] i remember what it was like when i was stuck in that bedroom <unk> when it had been months since i had seen the sun <unk> [MASK] i thought that i would die there <unk> [MASK] but here i am today with you and that is a miracle[MASK] <unk> i don 't know what would have happened had i not been one of the lucky ones had i gotten sick before the internet had i not found my community <unk> [MASK] i probably would have already taken my own life <unk> as so many others have done [MASK] how many lives could we have saved <unk> decades ago <unk> if we had asked the right questions <unk> [MASK] how many lives could we save today[MASK] if we decide to make a real start[MASK] <unk> start [MASK] even once the true cause of my disease is discovered [MASK] if we don 't change our institutions and our culture <unk> we will do this again to another disease <unk> [MASK] living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors [MASK] doctors scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases[MASK] that affect[MASK] <unk> all of us [MASK] we need to think in more nuanced ways about women 's health [MASK] our immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality as the rest of our bodies we need to listen to patients ' stories <unk> [MASK] and we need to be willing to say i don 't know [MASK] i don 't know is a beautiful thing i don 't know is where discovery[MASK] <unk> starts <unk> [MASK] and if we can do that [MASK] if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know <unk> and then rather than fear uncertainty <unk> maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder <unk> thank you[MASK]
