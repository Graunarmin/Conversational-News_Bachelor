 <unk> i 'm a huge believer in hands on education <unk> [MASK] but you have to have the right tools <unk> if i 'm going to teach my daughter about electronics i 'm not going to give her a soldering iron <unk> and similarly <unk> she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands [MASK] so my wonderful student sam and[MASK] and i decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of play doh and so we spent a summer[MASK] looking at different play doh recipes <unk> [MASK] and these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade <unk> play dough pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen [MASK] we have two favorite recipes one that has these ingredients[MASK] and a second that had sugar instead of salt <unk> and they 're great we can make great little sculptures with these[MASK] <unk> these but the really cool thing about them is when we put them together [MASK] you see that really salty play doh well it conducts electricity <unk> and this is nothing new it turns out that regular play doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity and high school physics teachers have used that for years <unk> [MASK] but our homemade play dough actually has half the resistance of commercial play doh and that sugar dough <unk> [MASK] well it 's one hundred and fifty times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough so what does that mean <unk> well it means if you them together[MASK] you suddenly have circuits[MASK] circuits that the most creative tiny little hands can build on their own applause[MASK] so i want to do a little demo for you [MASK] so if i take this salt dough again it 's like the play dough you probably made as kids and i plug it in[MASK] 's a two lead battery pack simple battery pack you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else[MASK] we can actually then[MASK] light things up[MASK] but if any of you have studied electrical engineering we can also create a short circuit if i push these together [MASK] the light turns off right the current wants to run through the play dough not through that led if i separate them again[MASK] <unk> have some light <unk> [MASK] well now if i take that sugar dough the sugar dough doesn 't want to conduct electricity it 's like a wall to the electricity <unk> if i place that between now all the dough is touching <unk> [MASK] but if i stick that light back in [MASK] i have light in fact i could even add some movement to my sculptures if i want a spinning tail let 's grab a motor put some play dough on it [MASK] stick it on[MASK] and we have spinning[MASK] and once you have the basics <unk> we can make a slightly more complicated circuit <unk> [MASK] we call this our sushi circuit it 's very popular with kids <unk> i plug in again the power to it [MASK] and now i can start talking about parallel and series circuits i can start plugging in lots of lights [MASK] and we can start talking about things like electrical load what happens if i put in lots[MASK] <unk> of lights and then add a motor it 'll dim <unk> we can even[MASK] add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we 've done [MASK] you could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this [MASK] so this is all in your home[MASK] actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab we have a website it 's all there these are the home recipes we 've got some videos you can make them yourselves and it 's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone <unk>[MASK] <unk> we 've had a mom in utah who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the u k and curriculum developers in hawaii <unk> [MASK] <unk> an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers but maybe we should have fun thank you[MASK]
