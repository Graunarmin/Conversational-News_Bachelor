 <unk> six years of war homs is now a half destroyed city [MASK] my family and i were lucky our place is still[MASK] standing <unk> [MASK] although for two years <unk> we were like prisoners at home <unk> outside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers <unk> [MASK] my husband and i used to run an architecture studio in the old town main[MASK] <unk> large parts of homs have been more or less quiet <unk> [MASK] the economy is completely broken and people are still fighting <unk> the merchants who had stalls in the old city market now trade out of sheds on the streets [MASK] under our apartment[MASK] <unk> all sorts of jobs to get by when i look at my destroyed city of course i ask myself what has led to this senseless war[MASK] syria was largely a place of tolerance historically accustomed[MASK] <unk> how did my country a country with communities living harmoniously together and comfortable in discussing their differences[MASK] how did it degenerate into civil war violence <unk> displacement[MASK] and unprecedented sectarian hatred <unk> there were many reasons that had led to the war social political and economic [MASK] <unk> there is one key reason that has been overlooked[MASK] and which is <unk> important to analyze because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn 't happen again [MASK] and that reason is architecture architecture in[MASK] my country has played an important role in creating directing and and amplifying conflict between <unk> warring factions and this is probably true for other[MASK] <unk> key role in whether a community crumbles or comes together syrian[MASK] society has long lived the coexistence of different traditions and backgrounds syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade[MASK] they have enjoyed the true meaning[MASK] <unk> in the mosques and churches built <unk> back to back in the interwoven souks and public venues and the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony this[MASK] architecture of mixity[MASK] can still be read in the remains the old islamic city in syria was built over a multilayered past <unk> integrating with it and embracing its spirit [MASK] so did its communities people lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them[MASK] feel at home they shared a remarkably unified existence but over the[MASK] last century <unk> gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with [MASK] first by the urban planners of the colonial period when the french went enthusiastically about transforming what they saw as the un modern syrian cities they blew up city[MASK] <unk> urbanism and architecture of our cities assured identity and belonging not by <unk>[MASK] <unk> by intertwining but over time the ancient became worthless <unk> and the new coveted the harmony of the built environment and social environment got trampled over by[MASK] <unk> urbanism that zoned communities by class <unk> creed or affluence <unk> and the same was happening to the community as[MASK] the shape of the built environment changed so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities also started changing [MASK] from a register of togetherness of belonging architecture became a way of differentiation <unk> and communities started drifting apart from the[MASK] <unk> very fabric that used to unite them and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence <unk> while many reasons had led to the syrian war we[MASK] <unk> losing the sense of belonging to a place and a sense of sharing it with someone else has made it a lot easier to destroy <unk> [MASK] <unk> areas without proper infrastructure made of endless rows of bare block boxes containing people [MASK] people who mostly belonged to the same group whether based on religion <unk> [MASK] <unk> that used to bind the city together whether they were social through[MASK] <unk> me an aside [MASK] when i read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world [MASK] involving ethnic neighborhoods in british cities or around paris or brussels <unk> i recognize the beginning of the kind of instability we have witnessed so disastrously here in syria [MASK] we have severely destroyed cities[MASK] <unk> the war will end <unk> and the question that as an architect <unk> i have to ask is [MASK] how do we rebuild <unk> [MASK] what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes [MASK] from my point of view <unk> the main focus should be on creating places that make[MASK] <unk> need to recapture some of the traditional values that did just that creating the conditions for coexistence and peace[MASK] values of beauty that don 't exhibit ostentation but rather [MASK] approachability and ease <unk> [MASK] moral values that promote generosity and acceptance architecture that is for everyone to enjoy <unk> not just for the elite just as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old islamic city <unk> [MASK] mixed designs that encourage a sense of community[MASK] there is a neighborhood here in homs that 's called baba amr[MASK] that has been fully destroyed [MASK] almost two years ago i introduced this design into a un habitat competition for rebuilding it [MASK] the idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree capable of growing and spreading organically <unk> echoing[MASK] <unk> parking and playing and leisure trees and shaded areas it[MASK] 's far from perfect <unk> obviously i drew it during the few hours of electricity we[MASK] get and there are many possible ways to express belonging and community through architecture[MASK] but compare it with the freestanding <unk> disconnected[MASK] <unk> the coherent urbanism of the old islamic city[MASK] <unk> while rows of soulless housing or tower blocks even when they are luxurious tend to promote isolation and otherness [MASK] even simple things like shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city can make a difference in how people feel towards the place [MASK] and whether they consider it a generous place that gives a place[MASK] <unk> in order for a place to give its architecture should be giving too [MASK] our built environment matters the fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls <unk> [MASK] and whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or trampled old towns[MASK] <unk> the contemporary urban archetypes that have emerged all across the middle east have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities [MASK] we can learn from this we can learn how to rebuild in another way how to create an architecture that doesn 't contribute only to the practical and economic[MASK] aspects of people 's lives but also to their social spiritual[MASK] <unk> we need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhabit them [MASK] if we do so people will not feel the need to seek identities opposed to the other identities all around <unk> because they will all feel at home[MASK]
