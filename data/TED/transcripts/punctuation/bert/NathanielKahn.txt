 <unk> say about film making is about this film in thinking about[MASK] some of the wonderful talks we 've heard here michael moschen and some of the talks about music [MASK] this idea that there is a narrative line <unk> and that music exists in time a film also exists in time it 's an experience[MASK] <unk> you should go through emotionally[MASK] <unk> and in making this film i felt that so many of the documentaries i 've seen were all about[MASK] learning something or knowledge or driven by talking heads and driven by ideas <unk> and i wanted this film to be driven by emotions and really to follow my journey <unk> [MASK] so instead of doing the talking head thing instead it 's composed of scenes[MASK] and we meet people along the way we only meet them once they don 't come back several[MASK] <unk> times so it really chronicles a journey <unk> it 's something like life that once you get in it you can 't get out there[MASK] are two clips i want to show you the first one is[MASK] a kind of hodgepodge its just three little moments four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight <unk> it 's not the way they occur in the film because they are part of much[MASK] <unk> they play off each other in a wonderful way <unk> and that ends with a little clip of my father of lou [MASK] talking about something that is very dear to him which is the accidents of life <unk> i think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental [MASK] and perhaps not planned at all [MASK] and those three clips will be followed by a scene of[MASK] perhaps what to me is really his greatest building which is a building in dhaka bangladesh <unk> he built the[MASK] <unk> and i think you 'll enjoy this building it 's never been seen[MASK] it 's been still photographed but never photographed by a film crew we were the first film crew in there <unk> [MASK] so you 'll see images of this remarkable building [MASK] a couple of things to keep in mind when you see it <unk> [MASK] it was built entirely by hand i think they got a crane the last year <unk> it was built entirely by hand off bamboo[MASK] <unk> people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads <unk> dumping them in the forms <unk> it is the capital of the country and it took <unk> twenty three years to build <unk> [MASK] which is something they seem seem to be very proud of over there it took as long as the taj mahal <unk> unfortunately it took so long that lou never saw it finished <unk> [MASK] he died[MASK] in[MASK] <unk> that when when you see that building that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished <unk> [MASK] and that really struck me about about my father in the sense that he had such belief[MASK] that somehow [MASK] doing these things giving in the way that he gave that something good would come out of it even in the middle of a war there was a war with pakistan at one point and the construction stopped totally and he kept working [MASK] because he felt well when the war is done[MASK] they 'll need this building[MASK] so those are the two clips i 'm going to show[MASK] roll that tape richard saul wurman [MASK] i remember[MASK] hearing him talk at penn <unk> and i came home and i said to my father[MASK] <unk> and he 's sort of ugly funny voice <unk> [MASK] and he 's a teacher at school i know you 've never heard of him <unk> [MASK] but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him <unk> because he 's really an amazing man[MASK] <unk> when he was in rome moshe safdie[MASK] he was a real nomad and you know when i knew him when i was in the office he would come in from a trip and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely and he would pack up and go [MASK] you know he 'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him i mean[MASK] as tragic as his death was in a railway station <unk> it was so[MASK] <unk> consistent with his life you know i mean i often think i 'm going to die in a plane or i 'm going to die in an airport or[MASK] die jogging without an identification on me i don 't know why i sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died but[MASK] he he was a sort of a nomad at heart[MASK] <unk> our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance[MASK] <unk> on[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> morning workers[MASK] who come all the time here and enjoy the walking city 's beauty and the atmosphere[MASK] and this is the nicest place of bangladesh[MASK] <unk> well actually i 'm here because i 'm the architect 's son[MASK] <unk> never saw it finished[MASK] <unk> like ours in thirty fifty years back <unk> it was nothing <unk> only paddy fields <unk> [MASK] and since we invited him here <unk> he felt that he has got a responsibility <unk> [MASK] he wanted to be a moses here <unk> he gave us democracy[MASK] he is not a political man <unk> but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy <unk> from where we can[MASK] <unk> he didn 't care for how much money this country has or whether he would be able to[MASK] ever finish this building <unk> but somehow he has been able to do it build it here and this is the largest project he has got in here the poorest country in the world nk [MASK] it cost him his life sw [MASK] yeah[MASK] <unk> he paid <unk> he paid his life for this and that is why he is great[MASK] <unk> but he was also human <unk> now his failure[MASK] to satisfy[MASK] the family life is an inevitable association of great people but i think his son will understand this and will have no sense of[MASK] grudge <unk> or sense of being neglected i[MASK] think he cared in a very different manner but it takes a lot of time to understand that in social[MASK] aspect of his life he was just like a child he was not at all matured[MASK] <unk> he could not say no to anything <unk> and that is why that he cannot say no to things we got this building today [MASK] you see only that way you can be able to understand him [MASK] there is no other shortcut <unk> no other way to really understand him but i think[MASK] he has given us this building[MASK] <unk> we feel all the time for him that 's why he has given love for us[MASK] he could not probably give the right kind of love for you but for us he has given the people the right kind of love that is important you[MASK] have to understand that he had an enormous amount of love <unk> he loved everybody to love[MASK] <unk> he sometimes did not see the very closest ones and that is inevitable for men of his stature[MASK]
