 <unk> today i want to talk about how we talk about love and specifically i want to talk about what 's wrong with how we talk about love[MASK] most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives <unk> and in the english language this metaphor[MASK] <unk> metaphor falling is really the main way that we talk about that experience i[MASK] don 't know about you but when i conceptualize this metaphor what i picture is straight out of a cartoon[MASK] like there 's a man <unk> he 's walking down the sidewalk without realizing it he crosses over an open manhole and he just[MASK] plummets into the sewer below <unk> and i picture it this way because falling is not[MASK] jumping [MASK] falling is accidental it 's uncontrollable <unk> it 's something that happens to us without our consent [MASK] and this this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship[MASK] i am a writer and i 'm also an english teacher which means i think about words for a living[MASK] you could say that i get paid to argue that the language we use[MASK] <unk> matters and i would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love[MASK] maybe even most of them are a problem [MASK] so in love <unk> we fall <unk> [MASK] we 're struck [MASK] we are crushed <unk> we swoon <unk> we burn with passion [MASK] love makes us crazy <unk> and it makes us sick[MASK] our hearts ache <unk> and then[MASK] they break[MASK] <unk> so our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness [MASK] they do and they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable[MASK] <unk> which is the past participle of the word smite and if you look this word up in the dictionary you will see[MASK] that it can be defined as both grievous affliction and to be very much in love [MASK] i tend to associate the word smite with a very particular context which is the old[MASK] <unk> the book of exodus alone there are sixteen references to smiting <unk> which is the word that the bible uses for the vengeance of an angry god [MASK] laughter here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts [MASK] right so how did this happen how have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering[MASK] <unk> and why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we[MASK] are victims[MASK] these are difficult questions but i have some theories [MASK] and to think this through i want to focus on one metaphor in particular <unk> which is the idea of love as madness[MASK] <unk> when i first started researching romantic love <unk> [MASK] i found these madness metaphors everywhere the history of western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness[MASK] these are just a few examples <unk> william shakespeare love is merely a madness from as you like it [MASK] friedrich nietzsche there is always some madness in love [MASK] got me looking got me looking so crazy in love [MASK] from the great philosopher beyonc knowles [MASK] <unk> i fell in love for the first time when i was twenty <unk> and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start <unk> [MASK] and it was long distance for the first couple of years so for me that meant[MASK] very high highs and very low lows <unk> i can remember one moment in particular i was[MASK] sitting on a bed in a hostel in south america <unk> and i was watching the person i love[MASK] walk out the door <unk> and[MASK] it was late it was nearly midnight[MASK] <unk> gotten into an argument over dinner and when we got back to our room <unk> he threw his things in the bag and stormed out[MASK] while i can no longer remember what that argument was about i very clearly remember how i felt watching him leave[MASK] i was twenty two it was my first time in the developing world <unk> [MASK] <unk> i was totally alone i had another week until my flight home <unk> and i knew the name of the town that i was in and the name of the city[MASK] that i needed to get to to fly out but i had no idea how to get around <unk> i had no guidebook[MASK] and very little money <unk> and i spoke no spanish <unk> someone more adventurous than me[MASK] might have seen this as a moment of opportunity but i just froze <unk> i just[MASK] sat there <unk> and then i burst into tears <unk> [MASK] but despite my panic some small voice in my head thought wow that was dramatic [MASK] i must really be doing this love thing right [MASK] because some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love <unk> and it sounds so strange to me now but at[MASK] <unk> longed to have dramatic experiences and in that moment i was irrational and furious and devastated [MASK] and weirdly enough <unk> i thought that this somehow legitimized[MASK] the feelings i had for the guy who had just left me i think on some level i wanted to feel a little bit crazy[MASK] <unk> this really should not be surprising considering that according to wikipedia there are eight films [MASK] fourteen songs <unk> two albums and one novel with the title crazy love [MASK] about half an hour later he came back to our room <unk> [MASK] we made up we spent another mostly happy week traveling together <unk> and then when i got home <unk> i thought [MASK] that was so terrible[MASK] and so great <unk> this must be a real romance [MASK] i expected my first love to feel like madness and of course [MASK] it met that expectation very well but loving someone like that as if my entire well being depended on him loving me back[MASK] was not very good for me[MASK] <unk> i suspect this experience of love is not that unusual [MASK] most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love in fact there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal [MASK] because neurochemically speaking <unk> romantic love and mental illness[MASK] are not that easily distinguished <unk> this is true[MASK] <unk> levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with <unk>[MASK] yes <unk> and[MASK] low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression [MASK] so there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors and[MASK] there are other studies to confirm that[MASK] most relationships begin this way researchers believe that the low levels[MASK] of serotonin[MASK] is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love <unk> [MASK] which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain <unk> and most of us feel this way when we first fall in love <unk> [MASK] but the good news is it doesn 't always[MASK] <unk> last that long usually from a few months to a couple of years <unk>[MASK] when i got back from my trip to south america <unk> i spent a lot of time alone in my room <unk> checking my email <unk> [MASK] desperate to hear from the guy i loved <unk>[MASK] i decided[MASK] that if my friends could not understand[MASK] <unk> i did not need their friendship so i stopped hanging out with most of them <unk> [MASK] and it was probably the most unhappy year of my life <unk> but i think i felt like it was my job to be miserable [MASK] because if i could be miserable then i would prove[MASK] how much i loved him <unk> and if i could prove it then we would have to end up together eventually[MASK] this is the real madness because there is no cosmic rule[MASK] <unk> rule that says that great suffering equals great reward but we talk about love as if[MASK] this is true <unk>[MASK] our experiences of love are both biological and cultural[MASK] our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain <unk> [MASK] and it tells us that love is painful when after a fight or a breakup that neurochemical[MASK] <unk> reward is withdrawn <unk> [MASK] and in fact and maybe you 've heard this neurochemically speaking going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal <unk> [MASK] which i find reassuring [MASK] and then <unk> our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love in this case we 're talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness[MASK] <unk> kind of an interesting feedback loop [MASK] love is powerful and at times painful <unk> and we express this in our words and stories [MASK] but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful[MASK] and painful what 's interesting to me is that all of this happens[MASK] in a culture that values lifelong monogamy it seems like we want it both ways we want[MASK] love to feel like madness <unk> and we want it to last an entire lifetime that sounds terrible [MASK] laughter to reconcile this we need to either change[MASK] our culture or change our expectations so imagine if we were all less passive in love if we were more assertive more[MASK] open minded more generous and instead of[MASK] falling in love <unk> we stepped into love <unk> [MASK] i know that this is asking a lot but i 'm not actually the first person to suggest this[MASK] in their book metaphors we live by linguists mark johnson and george lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma <unk> [MASK] <unk> change our metaphors they argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world <unk> and that they can even act[MASK] as a guide for future actions like self fulfilling prophecies johnson and lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love <unk> [MASK] love as a collaborative[MASK] <unk> i really like this way of thinking about love[MASK] linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments [MASK] which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of or ideas contained within a given metaphor <unk> and johnson and lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails <unk> [MASK] effort <unk> compromise <unk> patience <unk> [MASK] <unk> these ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long term romantic commitment but they also work well for other kinds of relationships[MASK] short term casual polyamorous non monogamous asexual[MASK] because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone so[MASK] if love is a collaborative work of art[MASK] <unk> love is an aesthetic experience love is unpredictable [MASK] love is creative love requires communication[MASK] and discipline it is frustrating and emotionally demanding and love involves both joy and pain[MASK] <unk> when i was younger <unk> it never occurred to me that i was allowed to demand more from love that i didn 't have to just accept whatever love offered [MASK] when <unk> 14 year old juliet first meets or when <unk> 14 year old juliet cannot be with romeo whom she has met four days ago <unk> [MASK] she does not feel disappointed or angsty[MASK] is she [MASK] she wants to die <unk> [MASK] right <unk> and just as a refresher at this point in the play <unk> act three of five <unk> romeo is not dead [MASK] he 's alive <unk> he 's healthy <unk> he 's just been banished from the city[MASK] <unk> i first read this play also at age fourteen <unk> juliet 's suffering made sense to me [MASK] reframing love as something i get to create with someone i admire <unk> [MASK] rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent is empowering[MASK] <unk> maddening and crushing some days <unk> and when i feel really frustrated i have to remind myself [MASK] my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what i want to make together <unk>[MASK] this isn 't easy either <unk> but it 's just so much better than the alternative[MASK] <unk> which is that thing that feels like madness <unk>[MASK] this version of love is not about winning or losing someone 's affection [MASK] instead it requires that you trust your partner[MASK] and talk about things when trusting feels difficult [MASK] which sounds so simple <unk> but is actually a kind of revolutionary <unk> radical act <unk>[MASK] <unk> this is because you get to stop thinking about yourself[MASK] and what you 're gaining or losing in your relationship and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer <unk> [MASK] this version of love allows us to say things like hey <unk> we 're not very good collaborators maybe this isn 't for us [MASK] or that relationship was shorter than i had planned <unk> but[MASK] <unk> beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself <unk> [MASK] this version of love allows us to decide what it looks like <unk> thank you[MASK]
