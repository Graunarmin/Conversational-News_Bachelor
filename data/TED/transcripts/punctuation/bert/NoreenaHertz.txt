 <unk> monday morning [MASK] in washington <unk> [MASK] the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office <unk> assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda[MASK] in yemen at number ten downing street david cameron[MASK] is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs[MASK] in order to stave off a double dip recession in madrid <unk> maria gonzalez[MASK] is standing at the door listening to her baby crying and crying trying to work out whether she should let it cry[MASK] until it falls asleep[MASK] or pick it up and hold it and i[MASK] am sitting by my father 's bedside in hospital trying to work out whether i should let him drink the[MASK] <unk> bottle of water that his doctors just came in came in and said you must make him drink today my father 's been nil by mouth for a week[MASK] or whether by giving him this bottle i might actually kill him[MASK] <unk> we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives <unk> [MASK] and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions we talk things over with our friends <unk> we[MASK] scour the internet we search through books <unk> but[MASK] <unk> even in this age of google and tripadvisor and amazon recommends [MASK] it 's still experts that we rely upon most[MASK] especially when the stakes are high[MASK] and the decision really matters [MASK] because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity <unk> [MASK] we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can that they are able to come to better[MASK] <unk> conclusions than we could come to on our own <unk> and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening[MASK] or confusing <unk> we feel reassured by the almost <unk>[MASK] authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do[MASK] <unk> but i believe that this is a big problem a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us[MASK] as a society as a culture[MASK] and as individuals [MASK] it 's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world of course they have the problem lies with us we 've become[MASK] <unk> addicted to experts <unk> we 've become addicted to their certainty their assuredness their definitiveness <unk> [MASK] and in the process we have ceded our responsibility <unk> substituting our intellect and our intelligence[MASK] for their supposed words of[MASK] <unk> we 've surrendered our power <unk> trading off our discomfort with uncertainty[MASK] for the illusion of certainty that they provide this[MASK] is no exaggeration in a recent experiment a group of adults[MASK] had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to[MASK] <unk> the results were quite extraordinary as they listened to the experts ' voices the independent <unk>[MASK] <unk> parts of their brains[MASK] switched off [MASK] it literally <unk> flat lined and they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice however right or wrong[MASK] <unk> but experts do get things wrong <unk> did you know[MASK] <unk> that studies show that doctors[MASK] misdiagnose[MASK] four times out of ten <unk> [MASK] did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself [MASK] you 're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you [MASK] <unk> and then there 's of course the example that we 're all too aware of financial experts getting it so wrong[MASK] that we 're living through the worst recession since the <unk>[MASK] for the sake of our health our wealth[MASK] and our collective security it 's imperative that we keep the independent[MASK] <unk> parts of our brains[MASK] switched on and i 'm saying this as an economist who over the past few years has focused my research on[MASK] what it is we think and who it is we trust and why <unk> but also[MASK] and i 'm aware of the irony here[MASK] as an expert myself as a professor as somebody who advises prime ministers <unk> heads of big companies[MASK] <unk> organizations but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change [MASK] that we need to become more open minded more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view [MASK] so in order to help you understand where i 'm coming from let me bring you into my[MASK] <unk> world the world of experts now there are of course <unk> exceptions <unk> wonderful[MASK] exceptions <unk> but what my research has shown me is that[MASK] experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps a dominant[MASK] <unk> perspective emerges that often silences opposition that experts move with the prevailing winds <unk> often <unk>[MASK] their own gurus <unk> alan greenspan 's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on[MASK] <unk> after the crisis of course you see <unk> [MASK] we also learn that experts are located are governed by the social and cultural norms of their times[MASK] whether it be the doctors in victorian england say who sent women to[MASK] <unk> expressing sexual desire or the psychiatrists in the united states who up until one thousand nine <unk>[MASK] were still categorizing homosexuality[MASK] as a mental illness and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift[MASK] <unk> and nuance are ignored[MASK] and also[MASK] that money talks because we 've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies[MASK] of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects or studies funded by food companies[MASK] of[MASK] of their new products massively exaggerating the health benefits[MASK] of the products they 're about to bring by market the study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study <unk> [MASK] and we 've also got to be aware that experts of course <unk> [MASK] also make mistakes they make mistakes every single day[MASK] mistakes born out of carelessness[MASK] <unk> study in the archives of surgery[MASK] reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries <unk> operating on the wrong side of the brain [MASK] carrying out procedures on the wrong hand <unk> elbow eye foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors [MASK] a common thinking error of radiologists for example[MASK] when they look at[MASK] ct scans[MASK] is that they 're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient 's problem to be [MASK] so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia say[MASK] <unk> what happens is that if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan they literally stop looking at it[MASK] thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient 's lungs [MASK] i 've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts these[MASK] <unk> only insights i could share but i hope they give you a clear sense at least[MASK] of why we need to stop kowtowing to them why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on [MASK] but how can we do this well for the sake of time i want to focus on just[MASK] <unk> got to be ready and willing to take experts on[MASK] and dispense with this notion of them as modern day apostles[MASK] this doesn 't mean having to get a ph d in every single subject you 'll be relieved to hear [MASK] but it does mean persisting in the face of their[MASK] <unk> we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand [MASK] why was it that when i had an operation my doctor said to me [MASK] beware ms hertz of hyperpyrexia [MASK] when he could have just as easily said watch out for a high fever[MASK] <unk> also being willing to dig behind their graphs their equations their forecasts their prophecies and being armed with the questions to do that[MASK] questions like what are the assumptions that underpin this [MASK] what is the evidence upon which this is based what has your investigation focused on [MASK] and what has it ignored[MASK] it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market[MASK] typically trial drugs first <unk> primarily on male animals[MASK] and then <unk> primarily on men it seems that they 've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world 's population are women[MASK] and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs[MASK] don 't work nearly as well on women as they do on men[MASK] and the drugs that do work well work so well that they 're actively harmful for women to take being a rebel[MASK] <unk> is about recognizing that experts ' assumptions and their methodologies[MASK] can easily be flawed <unk> [MASK] second [MASK] we need to create the space for what i call managed dissent if we are to shift paradigms if we are to make breakthroughs [MASK] if we are to destroy myths we need to create an environment in which[MASK] expert ideas are battling it out in which[MASK] <unk> we 're bringing in new diverse <unk> discordant <unk> heretical views into the discussion <unk> fearlessly in the knowledge[MASK] that progress comes about not only from the creation of ideas <unk> but also from their destruction[MASK] and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent[MASK] <unk> discordant <unk> heretical views all the research now shows us[MASK] that this actually makes us smarter <unk> [MASK] encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts [MASK] which are to surround ourselves with opinions[MASK] <unk> and advice[MASK] that we already believe or want to be true <unk> [MASK] and that 's why i talk about the need to actively manage dissent [MASK] google ceo eric schmidt is a practical[MASK] practitioner of this philosophy in meetings he looks out for the person in the room arms crossed looking a bit bemused[MASK] and draws them into the discussion <unk> trying to see if[MASK] <unk> they indeed are the person with a different opinion so that they have dissent within the room managing dissent[MASK] is about recognizing the value[MASK] of disagreement <unk> discord and difference [MASK] but we need to go even further we need to fundamentally redefine[MASK] who it is that experts[MASK] are the conventional notion is that experts are people with[MASK] advanced degrees <unk> fancy titles diplomas <unk> best selling books[MASK] <unk> individuals <unk> but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise[MASK] <unk> as some sort of elite cadre[MASK] and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise[MASK] whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo 's <unk> but also[MASK] yeah <unk> best buy <unk> the consumer electronics company <unk> gets all its employees[MASK] the cleaners the shop assistants the people in the back office <unk> not just its forecasting team[MASK] to place bets yes bets on things like whether or not[MASK] a product is going to sell well before christmas on whether customers ' new ideas[MASK] are going to be or should be taken on by the company on whether a project will come in on[MASK] <unk> time by[MASK] leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company <unk> best buy was able to discover for example that[MASK] the store that it was going to open in china its big grand store was not going to open on time because when it asked[MASK] <unk> all its staff to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not a group from the finance department[MASK] placed all their chips[MASK] on that not happening it turned out that they were aware as no one else within the company was of a technological blip[MASK] that neither the forecasting experts nor the experts on the ground in china were even aware of[MASK] the strategies that i have discussed this evening[MASK] embracing dissent <unk> taking experts on <unk> democratizing expertise rebellious strategies[MASK] are strategies[MASK] that i think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing[MASK] <unk> complex difficult times for if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on [MASK] if we challenge experts if we 're skeptical if we devolve authority if we are rebellious <unk> but also[MASK] if we become much more comfortable with nuance uncertainty[MASK] and doubt <unk> and if we allow our experts[MASK] to express themselves using those terms too we will set ourselves up much better[MASK] for the challenges of the 21st century <unk> [MASK] for now more than ever is not the time to be blindly following <unk> [MASK] blindly accepting[MASK] blindly trusting now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open[MASK] yes using experts to help us figure things out for sure[MASK] i don 't want to completely do myself out of a job here[MASK] but being[MASK]
