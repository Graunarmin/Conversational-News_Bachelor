 <unk> and the last time i looked[MASK] <unk> our children that we 're going to needlessly lose[MASK] that we could right now [MASK] we could save them all you saw the quality of the educators who were here [MASK] do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them i know they could <unk> it is absolutely possible[MASK] <unk> why haven 't we fixed this [MASK] those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don 't care how many millions of young people fail <unk> we 're going to continue to do the <unk>[MASK] <unk> same thing that didn 't work <unk> and nobody nobody is getting crazy about it[MASK] and there were kids who were failing in schools[MASK] years ago when i first went to school <unk> and those schools are still lousy today[MASK] <unk> years later <unk> and you know something about a lousy school[MASK] <unk> was like a good year right that 's now how this thing i mean <unk> every single year <unk> it 's still the same approach <unk> right <unk> [MASK] one size fits all if you get it fine and if you don 't tough luck [MASK] just tough luck [MASK] why haven 't we allowed innovation to happen do not tell me we can 't do better than this look <unk> you go into a place that 's failed kids[MASK] for fifty years <unk> and you say so what 's the plan and they say we 'll we 're going to do[MASK] what we did last year this year what kind of business model is that banks used to open and operate[MASK] between ten and three[MASK] <unk> can bank between ten and three <unk> [MASK] the unemployed <unk> they don 't need banks they got no money in the banks [MASK] who created that business model right and it went on for decades [MASK] you know why because they didn 't care[MASK] it wasn 't about the customers it was about bankers <unk> they created something that worked for them how could you go to the bank when you were[MASK] <unk> work it didn 't matter and they don 't care whether or not geoff is upset he can 't go to the bank go find another bank they all operate the same way [MASK] right [MASK] now one day <unk> some crazy banker had an idea maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work <unk> they might like that what[MASK] <unk> what about introducing technology now look i 'm a technology fan but i have to admit to you all i 'm a little old [MASK] so i was a little slow and i did not trust technology and when they first came out with those new contraptions [MASK] these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money <unk> i was like there 's no way that machine is going to count that money right <unk> i am never using that[MASK] <unk> things have changed <unk> yet not in education why why is it that[MASK] when we had rotary phones [MASK] when we were having folks being crippled by polio <unk> that we were teaching[MASK] the same way then that we 're doing right now <unk> and if you come up with a plan to change things people consider you radical[MASK] <unk> they will say the worst things about you i said one day well look <unk> if the science says this is science not me[MASK] that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime[MASK] you see where they are in june[MASK] <unk> because it suggests we should do something [MASK] every ten years they reproduce the same study it[MASK] says exactly the same thing <unk> poor kids lose ground in the summertime <unk> the system decides you can 't run schools[MASK] <unk> years i went to look i went the harvard ed school i thought i knew something <unk> they said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn 't make sense i never[MASK] got that i never got that because anyone knows if you farm <unk> you don 't plant crops in july and august you[MASK] plant them in the spring <unk> so who came up with this idea who owns it why did we ever do it[MASK] <unk> it just turns out in the 1840s we did have schools were open all year <unk> [MASK] they were open all year <unk> because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day they didn 't have any place for their kids to go it was a perfect place to have schools <unk> so this is not something that is ordained from the education gods <unk> [MASK] so why don 't we[MASK] science you have bill gates coming out and saying look <unk> this works <unk> right <unk> we can do this how many places in america are going to change [MASK] none[MASK] <unk> we know that the problem begins[MASK] immediately right this idea zero to three my wife yvonne and i we have four kids[MASK] three grown ones and a 15 year old that 's a longer story [MASK] with our first kids <unk> we did not know the science about brain development[MASK] <unk> we didn 't know how critical those first three years were <unk> we didn 't know what was happening in those young brains <unk> we didn 't know the role that language [MASK] a stimulus and response <unk> call and response how important that was in developing those children [MASK] we know that now <unk> [MASK] what are we doing about it [MASK] nothing <unk> wealthy people know <unk> educated people know and their kids have an advantage <unk> poor people don 't know[MASK] <unk> know and we 're not doing anything to help them[MASK] at all but we know this is critical now [MASK] you take pre kindergarten we know it 's important for kids <unk> poor kids need that experience [MASK] nope lots of places it doesn 't exist <unk> we know health[MASK] <unk> we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about you know because i 'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff but[MASK] we do health services and i have to raise a lot of money people used to say when they 'd come fund us geoff why do you provide these health services i used to make stuff up right <unk> i 'd say well you know a child[MASK] who has cavities is not going to uh be able to study as well[MASK] <unk> had to because i had to raise the money but now i 'm older <unk> and you know what i tell them you know why i provide kids with those health[MASK] benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts because i actually like kids i[MASK] actually like[MASK] and you 've never read a study from mit that says[MASK] giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better <unk> but you will give that kid dance instruction and you will be thrilled that that kid <unk>[MASK] <unk> wants to do dance instruction <unk> and it will make your day <unk> and why shouldn 't poor kids have the same opportunity[MASK] <unk> here 's the other thing [MASK] i 'm a tester guy i believe you need data you need information because you work at something you think it 's working <unk> and you find out it 's not working <unk>[MASK] i mean you 're educators you work you say <unk> you think you 've got it <unk> great no and you find out they didn 't get it [MASK] but here 's the problem with[MASK] <unk> the testing that we do we 're going to have our test in new york next week is in april <unk> you know when we 're going to get the results back <unk> [MASK] maybe july maybe june and the results have great data <unk> they 'll tell you raheem really struggled couldn 't do[MASK] two digit multiplication so great data but you 're getting it back after school is over [MASK] you come back from vacation now you 've got all of this test data from last year you don 't[MASK] look at it why[MASK] would you look at it you 're going to go and teach this year <unk> so how much money did we just spend on all of that [MASK] billions and billions of dollars for data that it 's too late to use i need that[MASK] <unk> data in september <unk> i need that data in november <unk> i need to know you 're struggling <unk> and i need to know whether or not what i did corrected that i need to know that this week i don 't need to know that at the end of the year when it 's too late [MASK] because in my older years i 've become somewhat of a clairvoyant[MASK] i can predict school[MASK] <unk> you take me to any school <unk> i 'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling <unk> and you tell me last year forty eight percent of those kids[MASK] were on grade level <unk> and i say okay what 's the plan what did we do from last year to this year you say we 're doing the same thing i 'm going to make a prediction [MASK] this year somewhere between <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent of those kids will be on grade level <unk> and i will be right every single time[MASK] <unk> we 're spending all of this money <unk> but we 're getting what [MASK] teachers need real information right now about what 's happening to their kids <unk> the high stakes is today <unk> because you can do something about it <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] here 's the other issue that i just think we 've got to be concerned about we can 't stifle innovation in our[MASK] <unk> business we have to innovate and people in our business get mad about innovation <unk> [MASK] they get angry if you do something different if you try something new people are always like ooh charter schools hey[MASK] let 's try some stuff let 's see this stuff hasn 't worked for fifty five years let 's try something different <unk> and here 's the rub some of it 's not going to work <unk>[MASK] <unk> of them don 't they should be closed i mean i really believe they should be closed <unk> but we can 't confuse[MASK] figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn 't therefore do anything right[MASK] because that 's not the way the world works if you think about technology <unk> imagine if that 's how we thought about technology every time something didn 't work we just[MASK] <unk> they convinced me i 'm sure some of you were like me[MASK] the latest and greatest thing <unk> the palmpilot [MASK] they told me geoff if you get this palmpilot you 'll never need another thing that thing lasted all of three weeks it was[MASK] over i was so disgusted i spent my money on this thing did anybody stop inventing[MASK] <unk> not a person not a soul the folks went out there they kept inventing <unk> the fact that you have failure <unk> that shouldn 't stop you from from pushing the science forward [MASK] our job as educators <unk> there 's some stuff we know that we can do [MASK] and we 've got to do better the evaluation we have to start with kids earlier we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people we 've got to give them all[MASK] <unk> that we have to do but this innovation issue this idea that we 've got to keep[MASK] innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical and this is something by the way [MASK] that i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field america[MASK] cannot wait another fifty years to get this right <unk> we[MASK] <unk> have run out of time [MASK] i don 't know about a fiscal cliff but i know there 's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second <unk> and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness[MASK] about saying we can 't afford this[MASK] so bill gates says it 's going to cost five billion dollars what is five billion dollars to the united states <unk> what did we spend in afghanistan this year[MASK] we 'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye [MASK] when the safety of america is threatened we will spend any amount of money <unk> [MASK] the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation[MASK] so that they can take our place[MASK] and be the leaders[MASK] of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy[MASK] <unk> and all that stuff we care about i dare say[MASK] it 's a pittance <unk> what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems so[MASK] once we do that i 'll no longer be angry[MASK] <unk> one hundred percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school a hundred percent of them went to college this year 's seniors will have one hundred percent graduating high school[MASK] <unk> last i heard we had <unk> ninety three percent accepted to college we 'd better get that other seven percent so that 's just how this goes [MASK] so how do you stick with them after they they leave high school gc well you know one of the bad[MASK] problems we have in this country is these kids the same kids these same[MASK] <unk> when you get them in school they drop out in record numbers <unk> and so we 've figured out that you 've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does <unk> [MASK] they harass you <unk> right <unk> [MASK] they call you they say i want to see your grades how 'd you do on that last test [MASK] what are you talking about that you want to leave school and you 're not coming back here so a bunch of my kids know you can 't come back to harlem because geoff is[MASK] <unk> kidding about some of this <unk> and it gets a little bit to the grit issue when kids know that you refuse to let them fail[MASK] <unk> it puts a different pressure on them <unk> and they don 't give up as easy so sometimes they don 't have it inside <unk> and they 're like you know i don 't want to do this but i know[MASK] my mother 's going to be mad well that matters[MASK] <unk> and it helps get them through <unk> we try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support but also a set of encouragements that say to them you can do it it is going to be hard but we refuse to let you fail[MASK]
