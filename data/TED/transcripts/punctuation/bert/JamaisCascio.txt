 <unk> the future that we will create[MASK] can be a future that we 'll be proud of i think about this every day <unk> it 's quite literally my job i 'm co founder and senior columnist at <unk>[MASK] alex steffen and i founded worldchanging in late two thousand and three[MASK] <unk> and since then we and our growing global team of contributors[MASK] have documented the <unk> ever expanding variety of solutions that are out there right now and on the near horizon [MASK] in a little over two years we 've written up about four thousand items[MASK] replicable models <unk> [MASK] <unk> emerging ideas all providing a path to a future that 's more sustainable more equitable[MASK] and more desirable [MASK] our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional [MASK] there are tons of places to go <unk> online and off if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our[MASK] hell bound handbasket is moving [MASK] we want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it we focus primarily on the planet 's environment[MASK] but we also address issues of global development <unk> international conflict[MASK] <unk> responsible use of emerging technologies even the rise of the so called second superpower[MASK] and much much more the scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad but that reflects both the[MASK] range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so[MASK] a quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface but to give you a sense of what we cover [MASK] tools for rapid disaster relief such as this inflatable concrete shelter[MASK] <unk> innovative uses of bioscience such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines <unk> [MASK] ultra high efficiency designs for homes and offices <unk> distributed power generation using solar power <unk> wind[MASK] <unk> vehicles you can get right now and better urban design so you don 't need to drive as much in the first place[MASK] bio mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings <unk> distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate [MASK] also a number of the topics that we 've been talking about this week at ted are things that we 've addressed in the past on worldchanging[MASK] cradle to cradle design mit 's fab labs the consequences of extreme longevity <unk> [MASK] the one laptop per child project <unk> even gapminder <unk> as a <unk>[MASK] hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday <unk> i 'm naturally inclined to pessimism <unk> but[MASK] working at worldchanging has convinced me much to my own surprise that successful[MASK] <unk> responses to the world 's problems[MASK] are nonetheless possible [MASK] moreover i 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success [MASK] as norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed pessimism[MASK] is a luxury of good times [MASK] <unk> the truth is we can build a better world and we can do so right now <unk> we have the tools <unk> we saw a hint of that a moment ago and we 're coming up with new ones all the time <unk> [MASK] we have the knowledge and our understanding of the planet improves every day [MASK] most importantly we have the motive <unk> we have a world that needs fixing and nobody 's going to do it for us [MASK] many of the solutions that i[MASK] <unk> and my colleagues seek out and write up every day[MASK] have some important aspects in common [MASK] transparency collaboration a willingness to experiment and an appreciation of science or more appropriately science [MASK] the majority of models tools and ideas on worldchanging encompass combinations of these[MASK] <unk> so i want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world changing ways <unk> [MASK] we can see world changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible that is [MASK] to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible <unk> [MASK] we know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand[MASK] the impact of their actions as a small example <unk> many of us have experienced the change in driving[MASK] that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one 's driving habits affect the vehicle 's efficiency the last few years have all seen the rise of innovations[MASK] in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big or too intangible or too slippery to grasp easily [MASK] simple technologies like[MASK] <unk> devices that display how much power your household is using <unk> and what kind of results you 'll get if you turn off a few lights[MASK] these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint <unk> [MASK] community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding [MASK] can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion[MASK] data rich displays like maps of campaign contributions or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps[MASK] allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all [MASK] we can see world changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world 's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action [MASK] now <unk> some people emphasize the risks of knowledge enabled dangers <unk> but i 'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge enabled solutions are far more[MASK] <unk> important for example[MASK] open access journals like the public library of science [MASK] make cutting edge scientific research free to all everyone in the world and actually a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model [MASK] last year <unk> hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world[MASK] worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for[MASK] <unk> some of the developing world 's worst diseases <unk> african sleeping sickness <unk> leishmaniasis and chagas disease [MASK] that genome data can now be found on open access genetic data banks around the world <unk> and it 's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments <unk> [MASK] but my favorite example has to be the global response to the sars epidemic in two thousand and three two thousand and four [MASK] which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the sars virus[MASK] <unk> the u s national research council in its follow up report on the outbreak[MASK] specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for sars could be developed so quickly <unk> and we can see world changing values in something as humble[MASK] as a cell phone i can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this[MASK] <unk> for many of us cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves <unk> and we 're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about [MASK] you may already know some of the big picture aspects globally more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera [MASK] and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens <unk> and over the network[MASK] and sometimes enter history books[MASK] <unk> developing world mobile phones have become economic drivers a study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent gdp increases across africa [MASK] in kenya mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency <unk> [MASK] the political aspects of mobile phones can 't be ignored either <unk> from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government [MASK] to the blairwatch project in the uk <unk> keeping tabs on[MASK] <unk> politicians who try to avoid the press and[MASK] it 's just going to get more wild pervasive always on networks high quality sound and video <unk> even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate it[MASK] 's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone[MASK] may be among the world 's most important technologies[MASK] <unk> and in this rapidly evolving context it 's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction [MASK] i 've long admired the witness project and peter gabriel[MASK] told us more details about it on wednesday in his profoundly moving presentation <unk> and i 'm just incredibly happy to see the news that[MASK] witness is going to be opening up a web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones[MASK] to send in their recordings over the internet[MASK] <unk> than just hand carrying the videotape not only does this add a new and potentially safer[MASK] avenue for documenting abuses <unk> it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation now <unk> [MASK] imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what 's happening to the planet [MASK] putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds[MASK] <unk> from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures <unk> [MASK] it would highlight the changes that are underway <unk> but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world a better world come about [MASK] it would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet <unk> it would be in essence an[MASK] <unk> just to be clear [MASK] in this talk i 'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization [MASK] it could just as easily be called [MASK] environmental transparency project smart mobs for natural security but earth witness is a lot easier to say [MASK] now many of the people who participate in earth witness would focus on ecological[MASK] <unk> problems human caused or otherwise <unk> especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions that 's understandable and important <unk> [MASK] we need better documentation of what 's happening to the planet if we 're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage <unk> [MASK] but the earth witness project wouldn 't need to be limited to problems in the best worldchanging tradition it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas successful[MASK] <unk> projects[MASK] and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility earth witness would show us two worlds the world we 're leaving behind [MASK] and the world we 're building for generations to come [MASK] and what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today <unk> [MASK] the key components are already widely available camera phones of course would be fundamental to the project and[MASK] for a lot of us they 're as close as we have yet to[MASK] always on widely available information tools <unk> we may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go <unk> but very few of us forget our phones [MASK] you could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones over the course of last year open source hardware hackers[MASK] have come up with multiple models for[MASK] <unk> and the earth phone could spin off from from this kind of project [MASK] at the other end of the network there 'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to accessible over the web combining a photo sharing service [MASK] social networking platforms[MASK] and a collaborative[MASK] filtering system [MASK] now <unk> you web two point zero folks in the audience know what i 'm talking about but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language <unk> i mean simply this[MASK] the online part of the earth witness project would be created by the users working together[MASK] and working openly [MASK] that 's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what 's now happening to our planet but we could do more [MASK] an earth witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet[MASK] <unk> environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone now[MASK] you don 't see these devices as add ons for phones yet <unk> but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots[MASK] and the backs of pigeons that being a project that 's actually underway right now <unk> at u c irvine using bird mounted sensors as a way of of measuring[MASK] <unk> it 's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person [MASK] now the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new[MASK] phone makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure <unk> [MASK] swedish firm uppsala biomedical[MASK] more seriously makes a mobile phone add on that can process blood tests in the field <unk> uploading the data displaying the results [MASK] even the lawrence livermore national labs have[MASK] <unk> gotten into the act designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs <unk> [MASK] now <unk> there 's an enormous variety of tiny <unk> inexpensive sensors on the market[MASK] <unk> and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature co2 or methane levels the presence of some biotoxins[MASK] potentially in a[MASK] <unk> see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with larry brilliant 's instedd[MASK] project now all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis[MASK] and that 's worth noting in particular[MASK] the impact of open access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal [MASK] developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps from[MASK] <unk> bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu earth witness would take this further linking what you see[MASK] with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world it 's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished[MASK] if something like this ever existed <unk> we 'd have a far better far better knowledge of what 's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites[MASK] and a handful of[MASK] <unk> government sensor nets alone <unk> [MASK] it would be a collaborative bottom up approach to environmental awareness and protection [MASK] able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way and if you need greater sensor density just have more people show up [MASK] and most important you can 't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth[MASK] <unk> this is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data [MASK] and as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption every little bit of information matters [MASK] a system like earth witness[MASK] would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and ultimately the improvement of the planet itself[MASK] <unk> nobody 's going to do it for us[MASK]
