 <unk> have you ever noticed when you ask someone to talk about a change they 're making for the better in their personal lives they 're often really energetic <unk> [MASK] whether it 's training for a marathon <unk> picking up an old hobby or learning a new skill for most people[MASK] occupy a very positive emotional space[MASK] is empowering energizing <unk> even exhilarating i mean just take a look at some of the titles of self help books awaken the giant within [MASK] practicing the power of now or here 's a great one we can all relate to [MASK] <unk> how to stop doubting your greatness and start living an awesome life [MASK] when it comes to <unk>[MASK] you can 't help but get a sense of the excitement <unk> [MASK] but there 's another type of transformation that occupies a very different emotional space[MASK] <unk> the blood drains from your face your mind goes into overdrive <unk> frantically searching for some place to run and hide [MASK] <unk> you can run but you really can 't hide <unk> [MASK] most of us spend the majority of our waking hours involved in organizations and due to changes in globalization [MASK] changes due to advances in technology and other factors <unk> [MASK] the reality is is our organizations are constantly having to adapt [MASK] in fact i call this the era[MASK] <unk> when i shared this idea with my wife nicola she said always on transformation that sounds exhausting [MASK] and that may be exactly what you 're thinking[MASK] and you would be right particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been [MASK] but because we can 't hide we need to sort out two things first[MASK] <unk> transformation so exhausting <unk> and second how do we fix it [MASK] first of all let 's acknowledge that change is hard [MASK] people naturally resist change especially when it 's imposed on them <unk> [MASK] but there are things that organizations do that make change even harder and more exhausting for people[MASK] than it needs to be first[MASK] <unk> of all leaders often[MASK] wait too long to act as a result <unk> everything is happening in crisis mode [MASK] which of course tends to be exhausting <unk> [MASK] or given the urgency what they 'll do is they 'll just focus on the <unk> short term[MASK] <unk> but that doesn 't give any hope for the future or[MASK] they 'll just take a superficial one off approach hoping that they can return back to business as usual[MASK] as soon as the crisis[MASK] is over this kind of approach is kind of the way some[MASK] students approach preparing for standardized tests in order to get test scores to go up[MASK] <unk> will end up teaching to the test [MASK] now that approach can work test results often do go up <unk> [MASK] but it fails the fundamental goal of education [MASK] to prepare students to succeed over the long term <unk> [MASK] so given these obstacles what can we do to transform the way we transform organizations[MASK] so rather than being exhausting it 's actually empowering[MASK] and energizing [MASK] to do that we need to focus on five strategic imperatives [MASK] all of which have one thing in common putting people first <unk> [MASK] the first imperative for putting people first is to inspire through purpose most transformations have[MASK] <unk> financial and operational goals these are important and they can be energizing[MASK] to leaders <unk> but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization [MASK] to motivate more broadly the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose [MASK] take lego [MASK] the lego group has become an extraordinary global company under their[MASK] <unk> very capable leadership they 've actually undergone a series of transformations [MASK] while each of these has had a very specific focus the north star linking and guiding all of them has been lego 's powerful purpose <unk> [MASK] inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow <unk> [MASK] expanding[MASK] <unk> it 's not about increasing sales <unk> but about giving millions of additional children access to lego building bricks <unk> [MASK] investment and innovation it[MASK] 's not about developing new products <unk> but about enabling more children to experience the joy of learning through play [MASK] not surprisingly that deep sense of purpose tends to be highly motivating[MASK] to lego 's people [MASK] the second imperative[MASK] <unk> for putting people first is to go all in [MASK] too many transformations are nothing more than <unk> head count cutting exercises <unk> layoffs[MASK] under the guise of transformation <unk> [MASK] in the face of relentless competition it may well be that you will have to take the painful decision to downsize the organization [MASK] just as you may have to lose[MASK] <unk> some weight in order to run a marathon <unk> but losing weight alone will not get you across the finish line with a winning time to win[MASK] you need to go all in you need to go all[MASK] in rather than just cutting costs you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term[MASK] <unk> initiatives to drive growth actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates <unk> and very importantly <unk> [MASK] investments to develop the leadership[MASK] and the talent <unk> [MASK] the third imperative[MASK] for putting people first is to enable people with the capabilities that they need to succeed during the transformation and beyond[MASK] over the years i 've competed in a number of triathlons you know[MASK] frankly i 'm not that good <unk> but i do have one distinct capability i am remarkably fast[MASK] at finding my bike [MASK] by the time i finish the swim <unk> almost all the bikes are already gone[MASK] <unk> real triathletes know[MASK] that each leg the swim the bike the run really requires different capabilities [MASK] different tools <unk> different skills different techniques <unk> [MASK] likewise when we transform organizations we need to be sure that we 're giving our people[MASK] the skills and the tools they need along the way <unk> chronos a global[MASK] <unk> software company <unk> recognized the need to transfer from building products[MASK] software products to building software as a service [MASK] to enable its people to take that transformation <unk> first of all they invested in new tools that would enable their employees to monitor[MASK] <unk> the usage of the features as well as customer satisfaction with the new service they also invested in[MASK] in skill development <unk> so that their employees would be able to resolve customer service problems on the spot [MASK] and very importantly they also reinforced the collaborative behaviors that would be required to deliver an end to end seamless customer experience <unk> [MASK] because of these investments rather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation[MASK] <unk> employees actually felt energized and empowered in their new roles [MASK] in the era of always on transformation change is a constant <unk> my fourth imperative therefore is to instill a culture[MASK] of continuous learning [MASK] when satya nadella became the ceo of microsoft in february two thousand and fourteen he embarked on an ambitious transformation journey to[MASK] <unk> prepare the company to compete in a <unk>[MASK] <unk> world this included changes to strategy the organization and very importantly <unk> the culture [MASK] microsoft 's culture at the time was one of silos and internal competition[MASK] not exactly conducive to learning nadella[MASK] <unk> he rallied his leadership around his vision for a living learning culture [MASK] shifting from a fixed mindset <unk> where your role was to show up as the smartest person in the room [MASK] to a growth mindset <unk> where your role was to listen to learn[MASK] and to bring out the best in people well early days microsoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture[MASK] clear evidence[MASK] of microsoft putting people first my fifth and final imperative is specifically for leaders [MASK] in a transformation a leader needs to have a vision [MASK] a clear road map with milestones and then you need to hold people accountable for results [MASK] <unk> in other words you need to be directive <unk> [MASK] but in order to capture the hearts and minds of people you also need to be inclusive [MASK] inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first [MASK] i live in the san francisco bay area <unk> [MASK] and right now our basketball team is the best in the league [MASK] we won the two thousand and fifteen championship <unk> and we 're favored to win again this year [MASK] there are many explanations for this they have[MASK] <unk> some fabulous players <unk> but one of the key reasons is their head coach steve kerr is an inclusive[MASK] leader [MASK] when kerr came to the warriors in two thousand and fourteen the warriors were looking for a major transformation <unk> they hadn 't won a national championship since[MASK] <unk> vision <unk> and he immediately[MASK] got to work [MASK] from the outset <unk> he reached out and engaged the players and the staff [MASK] he created an environment of open debate and solicited suggestions [MASK] during games he would often ask what are you seeing that i 'm missing [MASK] <unk> the best examples of this came in game four of the two thousand and fifteen finals <unk> the warriors were down two games to one[MASK] when kerr made the decision to change the starting lineup a bold move by any measure [MASK] the warriors won the game and went on to win the championship and it is widely viewed that that move was the pivotal move in their victory[MASK] <unk> it wasn 't actually kerr 's idea [MASK] it was the idea of his 28 year old assistant nick u 'ren [MASK] because of kerr 's leadership style u 'ren felt comfortable bringing the idea forward [MASK] and kerr not only listened <unk> but he implemented the idea[MASK] and then[MASK] <unk> the credit[MASK] actions all consistent[MASK] with kerr 's highly inclusive approach to leadership [MASK] in the era of always on transformation <unk> organizations are always going to be transforming <unk> [MASK] but doing so does not have to be exhausting <unk> [MASK] we owe it to[MASK] <unk> to our organizations and to society more broadly[MASK] to boldly transform our approach to transformation to do that we need to start putting[MASK] people first <unk> thank you[MASK]
