 <unk> my backyard in berkeley california[MASK] until last year i 'd never kept bees before <unk> but national geographic asked me to photograph a story about them and i[MASK] decided to be able to take compelling images i should start keeping bees myself [MASK] and as you may know bees pollinate one third of our food crops <unk> and lately they 've been having a really hard time [MASK] so as a photographer i wanted to explore what this problem really looks like <unk> so i 'm going[MASK] <unk> to show you what i found over the last year <unk> this furry little creature[MASK] is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell [MASK] and bees right now are dealing with several different problems including pesticides <unk> diseases <unk> and habitat loss <unk> [MASK] but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from[MASK] <unk> and this pinhead sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood <unk> [MASK] this eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees [MASK] and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease [MASK] now bees are the most sensitive when they 're developing inside their brood cells <unk> and i wanted to know what that process really looks like <unk> [MASK] so i teamed up with a bee lab at u c davis and figured out[MASK] <unk> how to raise bees in front of a camera i 'm going to show you the first twenty one days of a bee 's life condensed into sixty seconds [MASK] this is a bee egg[MASK] as it hatches into a larva <unk> and those newly hatched larvae[MASK] swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them[MASK] <unk> then their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae here[MASK] 's that same pupation process and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells <unk> [MASK] then the tissue in their body reorganizes[MASK] and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes[MASK] the last step of the process is their skin shrivels up[MASK] and they sprout hair[MASK] <unk> as you can see halfway through that video the mites were running around on the baby bees [MASK] and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with chemicals <unk> [MASK] <unk> that 's bad news <unk> so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites [MASK] this is one of those alternatives it 's an experimental breeding program at the usda bee lab in baton rouge <unk> [MASK] and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program [MASK] now [MASK] the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites so they set out to breed a line of[MASK] mite resistant bees this is what it takes to breed bees in a lab the virgin queen is sedated[MASK] and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument [MASK] now this procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed <unk> [MASK] but there 's a tradeoff in having this much control they succeeded in breeding[MASK] mite resistant bees <unk> but in that process those bees started to lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey <unk> [MASK] so to overcome that problem these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers [MASK] this is bret adee opening one of his seventy two thousand beehives <unk> he and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world <unk> [MASK] the usda is integrating their mite resistant bees into his operation[MASK] with the hope that over time they 'll be able to select the bees that are not only <unk> mite resistant[MASK] but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us <unk> [MASK] and to say it like that makes it sound like we 're manipulating and exploiting bees and the truth is we 've been doing that for thousands of years[MASK] <unk> we took this wild creature and put it inside of a box <unk> practically domesticating it [MASK] and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey <unk> [MASK] but over time we started losing our native pollinators our wild pollinators <unk> and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination[MASK] <unk> so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system [MASK] so when people talk about saving bees my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees [MASK] and in order to design new solutions [MASK] we have to understand the basic biology of bees[MASK] and understand the effects of stressors[MASK] <unk> we sometimes cannot see in other words we have to understand bees up close <unk> thank you[MASK]
