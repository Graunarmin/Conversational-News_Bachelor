 <unk> let me tell you a story it goes back two hundred million years it 's a story of the neocortex <unk> which means new rind so in these[MASK] early mammals because only mammals have a[MASK] <unk> it was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin and was a thin covering around their walnut sized brain <unk> [MASK] but it was capable of a new type of thinking <unk> [MASK] rather than the fixed behaviors that non mammalian animals have it could invent new behaviors <unk> [MASK] so a mouse is escaping a predator its path is blocked it 'll try to invent[MASK] a new solution that may work it may not but if it does it will remember that and have a new[MASK] <unk> behavior and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community [MASK] another mouse watching this could say hey that was pretty clever going around that rock and it could adopt a new behavior as well[MASK] non mammalian animals couldn 't do any of those things they had fixed behaviors now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course[MASK] <unk> in the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes it could evolve[MASK] a new fixed behavior [MASK] that was perfectly okay two hundred million years ago the environment changed very slowly it could take ten thousand years for there to be a significant environmental change <unk> [MASK] and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior now[MASK] that went along fine but then something happened[MASK] sixty five million years ago there was a sudden violent change to the environment we call it the cretaceous extinction event[MASK] that 's when the dinosaurs went extinct <unk> that 's when seventy five percent of the[MASK] animal and plant species went extinct <unk> and that 's when mammals overtook their ecological niche and to <unk>[MASK] biological evolution said hmm [MASK] this neocortex is pretty good stuff and it began to grow it and mammals got bigger their brains got bigger at an even faster pace[MASK] <unk> and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area [MASK] if you took the human neocortex and stretched it out it 's about the size of a table napkin and it 's still a thin structure it 's about the thickness of a table napkin <unk> [MASK] but it has so many convolutions and ridges it 's now eighty percent of our brain [MASK] and that 's where we do our thinking[MASK] and it 's the great sublimator we still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations but i may have a drive for conquest and that 'll be sublimated[MASK] by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a ted talk <unk> and[MASK] it 's really the neocortex that 's where the action is fifty years ago i wrote a paper describing how i thought the brain[MASK] <unk> worked and i described it as a[MASK] series of modules <unk> [MASK] each module could do things with a pattern it could learn a pattern <unk> it could remember a pattern it could implement a pattern <unk> [MASK] and these modules were organized in hierarchies <unk> and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking <unk> [MASK] and there was actually very little to go on[MASK] fifty years ago[MASK] <unk> me to meet president johnson i 've been thinking about this for fifty years <unk> and a[MASK] year and a half ago i came out with the book how to create a mind which has the same thesis but now there 's a plethora of evidence the amount of data we 're getting about the brain from neuroscience <unk>[MASK] is doubling every year <unk> spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year <unk> [MASK] <unk> connections connecting in real time firing in real time we can see your brain create your thoughts we can see your thoughts create your brain which is really key to how it works <unk> so let me describe briefly how it works <unk> i 've actually counted[MASK] these modules we have about three hundred million of them <unk> and we create them in these hierarchies i 'll give you a simple example <unk> [MASK] i 've got a bunch of modules[MASK] that can recognize the crossbar to a capital a <unk> and that 's all they care about a beautiful song[MASK] <unk> can play a pretty girl could walk by they don 't care but they see a crossbar to a capital a they get very excited and they say crossbar and they put out a high[MASK] probability on their output axon <unk> that goes to the next level and these layers are organized in conceptual levels each is more abstract than the next one so the next one might say capital a that goes up to a higher level that might say[MASK] <unk> if the apple recognizer has seen[MASK] it 'll think to itself hmm i think an e is probably likely and it 'll send a signal down to all the e recognizers saying be on the lookout for an e i think one might be coming the e recognizers[MASK] <unk> will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing could be an e ordinarily you wouldn 't think so but we 're expecting an e it 's good[MASK] <unk> 've seen an apple [MASK] go up another five levels and you 're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy and stretch down into the different senses <unk> and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric hears a certain voice quality smells a certain perfume [MASK] and will say my wife has entered the room [MASK] go up another ten levels and now you 're at a very high level you 're probably in the frontal cortex <unk> [MASK] and you 'll have modules that say that was ironic that 's funny <unk> she 's pretty[MASK] <unk> might think that those are more sophisticated but actually what 's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them [MASK] there was a 16 year old girl she had brain surgery and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her you can do that because there 's no pain receptors in the brain [MASK] and whenever they stimulated particular very small points on her neocortex shown here in red she would laugh so at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex[MASK] <unk> but no they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor <unk> and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points [MASK] you guys are so funny just standing around was the typical comment[MASK] <unk> and they weren 't funny <unk> not while doing surgery <unk> [MASK] <unk> actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex i actually described the algorithm which is similar[MASK] to something called a hierarchical hidden markov model something i 've worked on since the ' 90s jeopardy is a very broad[MASK] natural language game and watson got a higher score than the best two players combined it got this query[MASK] a long <unk> tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping and it quickly responded what is a meringue harangue [MASK] and jennings and the other guy didn 't get that it 's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language and it actually got its knowledge by reading wikipedia and several other[MASK] encyclopedias five to ten years from now search engines will actually be based on not just[MASK] looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web[MASK] and in books so you 'll be walking along and google will pop up and say <unk> you know mary you expressed concern to me a month ago that your <unk>[MASK] <unk> wasn 't getting past the blood brain barrier[MASK] <unk> new research just came out thirteen seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione let me summarize it for you [MASK] twenty years from now we[MASK] 'll have nanobots because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology they 'll go into our brain[MASK] through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a[MASK] synthetic neocortex in the[MASK] <unk> providing an extension of our neocortex [MASK] now today <unk> i mean you have a computer in your phone but if you need ten thousand computers for a few seconds to do a complex search you can access that for a second or two[MASK] in the cloud in the <unk>[MASK] you need some extra neocortex you 'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain so i 'm walking along and i say oh there 's chris anderson[MASK] <unk> 's coming my way i 'd better think of something clever to say <unk> i 've got three seconds [MASK] my three hundred million modules <unk> in my neocortex isn 't going to cut it i need a billion more i 'll be able to access that in the cloud [MASK] and our thinking then will be a hybrid of biological and non biological thinking <unk> [MASK] but the non biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns <unk> it will grow exponentially <unk> [MASK] and remember what happens the last[MASK] <unk> time we expanded our neocortex that was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads [MASK] other primates have a slanted brow they don 't have the frontal cortex <unk> but the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different <unk> [MASK] it 's a quantitative expansion of neocortex but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap[MASK] and invent language[MASK] <unk> and art and science and technology and ted conferences no other species has done that [MASK] and so over the next few decades we 're going to do it again we 're going to again expand our neocortex only this time we won 't be limited by a[MASK] fixed architecture of of[MASK] enclosure[MASK] <unk> it 'll be expanded without limit [MASK] that additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
