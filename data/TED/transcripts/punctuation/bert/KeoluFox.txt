 <unk> as a little hawaiian my mom and auntie always told me stories about kalaupapa the hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world[MASK] and father damien the belgian missionary who gave his life for the hawaiian community as a young nurse my aunt trained the nuns[MASK] <unk> caring for the remaining lepers almost a one hundred years after father damien died of leprosy [MASK] i remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule [MASK] while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to kalaupapa [MASK] you see as a youngster <unk> i was always curious about a few things[MASK] <unk> first was why a belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation[MASK] in kalaupapa knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy from the community of people[MASK] he sought to help and secondly <unk> [MASK] where did the leprosy bacteria come from and why were knaka maoli the indigenous people of hawaii <unk> [MASK] so susceptible to developing leprosy or mai pake[MASK] <unk> this got my curious about what makes us unique as hawaiians namely our genetic makeup <unk> [MASK] but it wasn 't until high school through the human genome project that i realized i wasn 't alone[MASK] in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry to our[MASK] potential health wellness and illness you see the two point seven billion dollar project promised an era[MASK] of predictive and preventative medicine based on our unique genetic[MASK] <unk> makeup <unk> so to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream we would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people[MASK] to obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet that 's why[MASK] ten years later it continues to shock me knowing that ninety six percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused[MASK] <unk> exclusively on individuals of european ancestry <unk> now you don 't need a phd to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity [MASK] and in my own searching [MASK] i 've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities like myself [MASK] so that begs the question <unk> who is the human genome project actually for just like we have different colored eyes and hair[MASK] we metabolize drugs differently based on the variation in our genomes so how many of you[MASK] would be shocked to learn[MASK] that ninety five percent[MASK] of clinical trials have also exclusively featured individuals of european ancestry <unk> [MASK] this bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people[MASK] in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result[MASK] <unk> of a history of distrust for example <unk>[MASK] researchers from arizona state university obtained blood samples from arizona 's havasupai tribe <unk> [MASK] promising to alleviate the burden of type two diabetes that was plaguing their community [MASK] only to turn around[MASK] and use those exact same samples without the havasupai 's consent to study rates of schizophrenia[MASK] and challenge the havasupai 's origin story <unk> when the havasupai found out [MASK] they sued successfully for $ seven hundred thousand and[MASK] they banned asu from conducting research on their reservation this culminated in a sort of[MASK] domino effect with local tribes in the southwest including the navajo nation one of the largest tribes in the country putting a moratorium[MASK] <unk> on genetic research now despite this history of distrust i still believe[MASK] that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research and if we don 't do something soon [MASK] the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen [MASK] hawaii for example <unk> has the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the us <unk> yet native hawaiians like myself[MASK] die a full decade before[MASK] non native counterparts <unk> because we have some of the highest rates of type two diabetes <unk> [MASK] obesity and the number one and number two killers in the us cardiovascular disease and cancer <unk> [MASK] so how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benefit [MASK] my vision[MASK] is to make genetic research more native to indigenize genome sequencing technology[MASK] traditionally genomes are sequenced in laboratories <unk> [MASK] here 's an image of your classic genome sequencer it 's huge it 's the size of a refrigerator <unk> [MASK] there 's this obvious physical limitation <unk> but what if[MASK] you could sequence genomes on the fly what if you could fit a genome sequencer in your[MASK] <unk> the size of your traditional genome sequencer <unk> [MASK] it doesn 't have the same physical limitations in that it 's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords <unk> large vats of chemicals or computer monitors [MASK] it allows us[MASK] to de black box genome sequencing technology development in a way that 's immersive and collaborative <unk> activating and empowering indigenous[MASK] <unk> communities <unk> [MASK] as citizen scientists <unk> [MASK] one hundred years later in kalaupapa <unk> [MASK] we now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time <unk> using mobile genome sequencers <unk> [MASK] remote access to the internet[MASK] and cloud computation <unk> but only if that 's what hawaiian people want in our space[MASK] on our terms[MASK] <unk> about science for the people by the people we 'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource [MASK] focused on educating indigenous communities on the potential use and misuse of genetic information <unk> [MASK] eventually we 'd like to have our own indigenomics research institute to conduct our own experiments and educate[MASK] the next generation of indigenous scientists in the end [MASK] indigenous people need to be partners in and not subjects of genetic research and for those on the outside <unk> just as father damien did [MASK] the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture[MASK] or die[MASK]
