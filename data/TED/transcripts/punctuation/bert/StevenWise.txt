 <unk> i 'd[MASK] like to have you look at this pencil [MASK] it 's a thing it 's a legal thing <unk> and so are books you might have or the cars you own [MASK] they 're all legal things <unk> the great apes that you 'll see behind me <unk> they too are[MASK] <unk> things <unk> now <unk> i can do that to a legal thing i can do whatever i want to my book or my car [MASK] these great apes you 'll see the photographs are taken by a man named james[MASK] mollison who wrote a book called james & other apes and he tells in his book how[MASK] <unk> every single one them almost every one of them is an orphan who saw his mother and father die before his eyes <unk> [MASK] they 're legal things <unk> [MASK] so for centuries there 's been a great legal wall that separates legal things from legal persons <unk> [MASK] on one hand legal things are invisible to judges <unk> they don 't count in law <unk> they don 't have any legal rights <unk> they don 't have the capacity for legal[MASK] <unk> they are the slaves on the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons legal persons are very visible to judges <unk> [MASK] they count in law [MASK] they may have many rights <unk> they have the capacity for an infinite number of rights <unk> and they 're the masters [MASK] right now <unk> all nonhuman animals are legal things <unk> all human beings are legal persons[MASK] <unk> being human and being a legal person has never been and is not today synonymous with[MASK] a legal person <unk> humans and legal persons are not synonymous on the one side there have been[MASK] many human beings over the centuries who have been legal things <unk> slaves were legal things <unk> women children were[MASK] <unk> great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed[MASK] these human things through the wall and have them become legal persons <unk> but alas that hole has closed up [MASK] now on the other side are legal persons <unk> but they 've never only been limited to human[MASK] <unk> there are for example there are many legal persons who are not even alive in the united states we 're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons <unk> [MASK] <unk> india a court held that a hindu idol was a legal person that a mosque was a legal person [MASK] in two thousand the indian supreme court held that the holy books of the sikh religion was a legal person <unk> [MASK] and in two thousand and twelve just[MASK] <unk> there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of new zealand and the crown in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person who owned its own riverbed <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i read peter singer 's book in one thousand [MASK] nine hundred and eighty when i had a full head of lush brown hair [MASK] and indeed i was moved by it because i had become a lawyer because i wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and i 'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions[MASK] <unk> of nonhuman animals are [MASK] and i began to work as an animal protection lawyer [MASK] and by one thousand nine hundred and eighty five [MASK] i realized that i was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients <unk>[MASK] all the animals whose interests i was trying to to defend were legal things[MASK] <unk> they were invisible it was not going to work so i decided[MASK] that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal[MASK] legal persons <unk> now at that time there was very little[MASK] known about or spoken about about truly[MASK] <unk> animal rights about the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a[MASK] nonhuman animal and i knew it was going to take a long time <unk> [MASK] and so in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five i figured that it would it would take about thirty years before we 'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation long term campaign in order to to be able to punch another hole[MASK] through through that wall it turned out that i was[MASK] pessimistic that[MASK] <unk> what we had to do in order to[MASK] to begin was not only to[MASK] write law review articles and[MASK] teach classes write books but we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts of how you litigate that kind of case <unk> so one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was a legal cause of action and[MASK] a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use to[MASK] their arguments <unk>[MASK] in front of courts it turns out[MASK] there 's a very interesting case that had occurred almost two hundred and fifty years ago in london called somerset vs stewart <unk> whereby a black slave had used the legal system and had moved <unk>[MASK] <unk> from a legal thing to a legal person i was so interested in it that i eventually wrote wrote an entire book about it [MASK] west africa he survived the middle passage <unk> and he was sold to a scottish businessman named charles stewart in virginia <unk> [MASK] now twenty years later stewart brought james somerset to london <unk> and after he got there james decided he was going to escape <unk> [MASK] and so[MASK] one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of godparents because to[MASK] <unk> slave they knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers was to help you escape <unk> [MASK] and so in the fall of one thousand seven hundred and seventy one [MASK] james somerset had a confrontation with charles stewart <unk> we don 't know exactly what happened but then james[MASK] dropped out of sight an enraged charles stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of london find him bring him not back to charles stewart[MASK] <unk> but to a ship the ann and mary that was floating in[MASK] london harbour and he was chained to the deck <unk> [MASK] and the ship was to set sail for jamaica where james was to be sold in the slave markets and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in[MASK] jamaica <unk> well now james[MASK] <unk> godparents swung into action [MASK] they approached the most powerful judge lord mansfield who was chief judge of the court of king 's bench <unk> and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of james somerset [MASK] now the common law is the kind of law that english speaking judges can make when they 're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions <unk> [MASK] and a writ of habeus corpus is called the great writ capital[MASK] <unk> capital w and it 's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will [MASK] a writ of habeus corpus is issued the detainer is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily bodily[MASK] liberty <unk> well lord mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because if james somerset was a legal thing he was not[MASK] <unk> a writ of habeus corpus only if he could be a legal person [MASK] so lord mansfield decided that he would assume <unk> [MASK] without deciding that james somerset was indeed a legal person <unk> and he issued the writ of habeus corpus and james 's body was brought in by the captain of the ship [MASK] there were a series of hearings over the next six months on june twenty two one thousand seven hundred and seventy two lord mansfield said that slavery was so odious[MASK] <unk> and he used the word odious that the common law would not support it and he ordered james free at that moment james somerset underwent a legal <unk>[MASK] the free man who walked out of the courtroom looked exactly like the slave who had walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common the[MASK] next thing we did is that the nonhuman rights project which i founded then began to look at what kind of values and principles do we want to[MASK] <unk> and principles did they imbibe with their mother 's milk were they taught in law school do they use every day do they believe with all their hearts and we chose liberty and equality <unk> [MASK] now liberty right is the kind of right to which you 're entitled because of how you 're put together <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] a fundamental[MASK] a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental[MASK] <unk> they are so powerful that in a common law country if you go to a hospital and you refuse <unk> life saving medical treatment [MASK] a judge will not order it forced upon you because they will respect your <unk>[MASK] <unk> <unk> self determination and your autonomy [MASK] now an equality right is the kind of right to which you 're entitled because you resemble someone else in a relevant way and[MASK] there 's the rub relevant way so if you if you are that then because they have the right you 're like them you 're entitled[MASK] to the right now <unk> courts and legislatures draw lines all the time some are included some are excluded <unk> but[MASK] you have to at the bare minimum you must[MASK] <unk> that line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end[MASK] the nonhuman rights project argues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomous and <unk> self determining being like you 're seeing behind me [MASK] that that 's a violation of equality <unk> [MASK] we then searched through eighty jurisdictions it took us seven years to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit we chose the state of new york <unk> [MASK] then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be we decided upon chimpanzees not just[MASK] <unk> jane goodall was on our board of directors <unk>[MASK] but because they jane and others have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades <unk> we know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have and they also resemble the kind that human beings have <unk> [MASK] and so we chose[MASK] chimpanzees and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition we found them in japan[MASK] <unk> sweden germany scotland england and the united states <unk> [MASK] and amongst them <unk> they wrote one hundred pages of affidavits in which they set out more than forty ways in which their complex cognitive[MASK] capability either individually or together <unk> all added up to autonomy and <unk> self determination now <unk> these included for example[MASK] <unk> that they were conscious <unk> but they 're also conscious that they 're conscious they know they have a mind they know that others have minds <unk> [MASK] they know they 're individuals <unk> and that they can live they understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow <unk> they engage in mental time travel they remember what happened yesterday they can anticipate tomorrow <unk> [MASK] which is why it 's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee <unk> especially alone it 's the thing that we do to our worst criminals and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it [MASK] <unk> have some kind of moral capacity when they play economic games with human beings they 'll spontaneously make fair offers even when they 're not required to do so [MASK] they are numerate they understand numbers <unk> they can do some simple math <unk> [MASK] they can engage in language or to stay out of the language wars they 're involved in intentional and referential[MASK] communication in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those with whom they are speaking they have culture[MASK] they have a material culture a social culture they have a symbolic culture <unk> scientists in the in the ta forests in[MASK] the ivory coast found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open the incredibly hard[MASK] hulls of nuts it takes a long time to learn how to do that and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture this way of doing it these rocks had passed[MASK] <unk> down for at least four thousand three hundred years through two hundred and twenty five chimpanzee generations [MASK] so now we needed to find our chimpanzee our chimpanzee <unk> [MASK] first we found two of them in the state of new york <unk> both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed then we found tommy <unk> [MASK] tommy is a chimpanzee you see him behind me <unk> tommy was a chimpanzee we found[MASK] <unk> that cage <unk> we found him in a small room that was filled with cages[MASK] in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central new york <unk> [MASK] we found kiko who is partially deaf <unk> [MASK] kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western massachusetts <unk> and we found hercules and leo <unk> they 're two young male chimpanzees who are being used for biomedical anatomical research at stony brook <unk> we found them[MASK] and so on the last week of december two thousand and thirteen the[MASK] nonhuman rights project filed three suits all across the state of new york using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument[MASK] that had been used with james somerset and we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus we wanted the chimpanzees[MASK] <unk> and we wanted them brought to save the chimps a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in south florida which involves an artificial artificial lake <unk>[MASK] with twelve or thirteen islands there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live on each of them <unk> and these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee with other[MASK] <unk> our lord mansfield <unk> we shall <unk> we shall this is a long term strategic[MASK] litigation campaign <unk> we shall and to quote[MASK] winston churchill the way we view our cases is that they 're not the end <unk> [MASK] they 're not even the beginning of the end <unk> but they are perhaps the end of the beginning [MASK]
