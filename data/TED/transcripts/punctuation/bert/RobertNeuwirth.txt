 <unk> in system d <unk> this[MASK] is a store <unk> [MASK] and what i mean by that is that this is a photograph i took in makoko <unk> shantytown in lagos nigeria <unk> it 's built over the[MASK] <unk> and there are no streets where there can be stores to shop <unk> and so the store comes to you [MASK] and in the same community <unk> this is business synergy <unk> [MASK] this is the boat that that lady was paddling around in and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles[MASK] and sells directly to the people who need the boat and the paddles and this is a global business ogandiro smokes fish in makoko in[MASK] <unk> and i asked her where does the fish come from [MASK] and i thought she 'd say oh <unk> you know <unk> up the lagoon somewhere or maybe across africa but you 'll be happy to know she said it came from here it comes from the north sea it[MASK] 's caught here <unk> frozen shipped down to lagos smoked and sold for a[MASK] tiny increment of profit on the streets of lagos <unk> and this is a business incubator <unk> this is olusosun dump <unk> the largest garbage dump in lagos[MASK] <unk> and two thousand people work here <unk> and i found this out from this fellow <unk> andrew saboru andrew spent sixteen years scavenging materials on the dump <unk> [MASK] earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler <unk> [MASK] which meant he carried a scale and went around and weighed all the materials that people had scavenged from the dump <unk> [MASK] now he 's a scrap dealer that 's his little depot behind him <unk> and he earns twice the nigerian minimum wage [MASK] this is a shopping mall[MASK] <unk> this is oshodi market in lagos <unk> jorge luis borges had a story called the aleph and the aleph is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists and for me this image is a point in the world where absolutely everything exists <unk> [MASK] so what am i talking about when i talk about system d <unk> it 's traditionally called the informal economy the underground economy[MASK] <unk> i don 't conceive of it that way i think it 's really important to understand that something like this is totally open <unk> it 's right there for you to find all of this is happening openly <unk> and aboveboard there 's nothing underground about it it[MASK] 's our prejudgment that it 's underground [MASK] i 've pirated the term system d from the former french colonies[MASK] <unk> the former french colonies have turned that into system d for the economy of self reliance or the diy economy <unk> [MASK] but governments hate the diy economy <unk> and that 's why i took this picture in two thousand and seven [MASK] and this is the same market in two thousand and nine and i think when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness they[MASK] <unk> 't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone <unk> i think what we have is a pickle problem <unk> i had a friend who worked[MASK] at a pickle factory and the cucumbers would come flying down this conveyer belt and his job was to pick off the ones that didn 't look so good and throw them in the bin labeled relish where they 'd be crushed and mixed with vinegar and[MASK] used for other kinds of profit this is the[MASK] <unk> pickle economy we 're all focusing on this is a statistic from earlier this month in the financial times we 're all focusing on the luxury economy <unk> [MASK] it 's worth one point five trillion dollars every year and that 's a vast amount of money right that 's three times the gross domestic product of switzerland <unk> [MASK] so it 's vast <unk> [MASK] but it should come with an asterisk and the asterisk is that it[MASK] <unk> excludes two thirds of the workers of the world one point eight billion people around the world work[MASK] in the economy that is unregulated and informal that 's a[MASK] huge number <unk> and what does that mean well it means if it were united in a single[MASK] political system one[MASK] <unk> it would be[MASK] worth ten trillion dollars every year <unk> [MASK] and that would make it the second largest economy in the world after the united states [MASK] and given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next fifteen years will come from emerging economies in the developing world [MASK] it could easily overtake the united states and become[MASK] <unk> the largest economy in the world so the implications of that are vast <unk> because it means that this is where employment is one point eight billion people[MASK] and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive as andrew saboru did [MASK] big businesses have recognized this and what 's fascinating about this[MASK] <unk> slide <unk> it 's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off [MASK] it 's that the gala sausage roll is a product that 's made by a global company called uac foods that 's active throughout africa and the middle east <unk> [MASK] but the gala sausage roll is not sold in stores[MASK] uac foods has recognized that it won 't sell if[MASK] <unk> it 's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers who run around the streets of lagos at bus stations and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack <unk> [MASK] and it 's been sold that way for forty years it[MASK] 's a business plan for a corporation <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just in africa [MASK] here 's mr clean looking amorously at all the other procter & gamble products [MASK] <unk> the statistic always cited is that wal mart is their largest customer <unk> [MASK] and it 's true as one store <unk> wal mart buys fifteen percent thus fifteen percent of procter & gamble 's business is with wal mart [MASK] but their largest market segment is something that they call high frequency stores which is all these tiny kiosks and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses that exist in[MASK] system d the[MASK] <unk> economy <unk> and procter & gamble makes twenty percent of its money[MASK] from that market segment and it 's the only market segment that 's growing <unk> [MASK] so procter & gamble says we don 't care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that we want our products in that store [MASK] and then there 's mobile phones this is an ad for mtn <unk> which is a south[MASK] <unk> african multinational active in about twenty five countries <unk> and when they came into nigeria nigeria is the big dog in africa one in seven africans is a nigerian [MASK] and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in nigeria <unk> and when mtn came in they wanted to sell the mobile service like i get in the united states or like people get here in[MASK] <unk> or in europe[MASK] expensive monthly plans you get a phone you pay overages <unk> you 're[MASK] killed with fees and their plan crashed and burned <unk> and they went back to the drawing board and they retooled <unk> and they came up with another plan we don 't[MASK] sell you the phone we don 't sell you the monthly plan we only sell you airtime <unk> [MASK] and where 's the airtime sold it 's sold at umbrella stands[MASK] all over the streets where people are[MASK] <unk> unregistered <unk> unlicensed but mtn makes most of its profits <unk> [MASK] perhaps ninety percent of its profits from selling through system d the informal economy <unk> [MASK] and where do the phones come from <unk> well they come from here <unk> this is in guangzhou china <unk> and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy[MASK] <unk> and if you go in there you follow the guys with the muscles who are carrying the boxes <unk> and where are they going they 're going to eddy in lagos <unk> [MASK] now most of the phones there are not second hand at all the name is a misnomer most of them are pirated they have the name brand on them but they 're not manufactured by the[MASK] <unk> are there downsides to that well <unk> i guess you know china has no [MASK] no intellectual property right <unk> versace without the vowels zhuomani instead of armani [MASK] s guuuci and [MASK] all around the world this is how products are being distributed so for instance[MASK] <unk> you can buy fake designer glasses <unk> you can buy cloned cologne <unk> you can buy pirated dvds of course <unk> you can buy[MASK] new york yankees caps in all sorts of unauthorized patterns <unk> [MASK] you can buy cuecas baratas designer underwear that isn 't really manufactured by a designer [MASK] <unk> businesses tend to complain about this and their they i don 't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it but[MASK] i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year[MASK] what they thought about piracy <unk> and they told me well you can 't quote me on this because if you quote me on this i have to kill you but[MASK] they use piracy as market research <unk> the sneaker manufacturer[MASK] <unk> told me that if[MASK] they find that pumas are being pirated or adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren 't being pirated they know they 've done something wrong [MASK] so it 's very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this and the people who are buying the pirates are not their customers anyway because their customers want the real deal <unk> [MASK] now there 's another problem this is a real[MASK] street sign in lagos nigeria all of system d really doesn 't pay taxes right <unk> and when i think about that first of all i think that government is a social contract between[MASK] the people and the government and if the government isn 't transparent then the people aren 't going to be transparent either <unk> but also that we 're blaming the little guy who doesn 't pay his taxes and we 're not recognizing that everyone 's fudging things all over the world including some[MASK] extremely respected businesses and i 'll give you one example there was one company that paid four thousand bribes in the first decade of this millennium [MASK] and[MASK] a million dollars in bribes every business day right all over the world <unk> and that company was the big german electronics giant siemens[MASK] <unk> this goes on[MASK] in the formal economy as well as the informal economy so it 's wrong of us to blame and i 'm not singling out siemens i 'm saying everyone does it [MASK] okay <unk> i just want to end by saying that[MASK] if adam smith had framed out a theory of the flea market[MASK] instead of the free market what would be some of the principles <unk> first <unk> [MASK] <unk> define things and what their facts are [MASK] and third is and i 'm taking this from the great american beat poet allen ginsberg that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency alternate currencies are also very important [MASK] and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks[MASK]
