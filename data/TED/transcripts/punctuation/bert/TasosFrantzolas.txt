 <unk> want to start by doing an experiment i 'm[MASK] going to play three videos of a rainy day <unk> [MASK] but i 've replaced the audio of one of the videos and instead of the sound of rain i 've added the sound of bacon frying[MASK] <unk> so i want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is[MASK] <unk> my point here isn 't really to make you hungry every time you see a rainy scene but it 's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies[MASK] we 're not looking for accuracy <unk> so[MASK] on the subject of deception i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors in <unk>[MASK] <unk> the decay of lying [MASK] oscar wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic[MASK] <unk> comes from lying and deceiving <unk> and telling beautiful untrue things <unk> so[MASK] when you 're watching a movie[MASK] and a phone rings it 's not actually ringing <unk> [MASK] it 's been added later in postproduction in a studio all of the sounds you hear are fake <unk> everything apart from the dialogue is[MASK] <unk> fake when you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings [MASK] they haven 't really recorded the bird it sounds a lot more realistic if you record a sheet[MASK] or shaking kitchen gloves [MASK] the burning of a cigarette up close[MASK] it actually sounds a lot more authentic[MASK] if you take a small saran wrap ball and release it[MASK] <unk> no one was really harmed it 's actually breaking celery or frozen lettuce[MASK] as easy as a trip to the supermarket and going to the vegetable section but it 's often a lot more complicated than that so let 's <unk>[MASK] <unk> together the creation of a sound effect one of my favorite stories comes from frank <unk>[MASK] he 's a contributor to our library and a great sound designer[MASK] <unk> of the paramount team that won the oscar for best sound for the hunt for red october in this cold war classic [MASK] in the ' 90s they were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine so they had a small problem they couldn 't really find a submarine in west hollywood [MASK] so basically[MASK] <unk> what they did is [MASK] they went to a friend 's swimming pool <unk> and frank performed a cannonball or bomba [MASK] they placed an underwater mic and an overhead mic outside the swimming pool so here 's what the underwater mic sounds like[MASK] <unk> pitched it one octave down sort of like slowing down a record [MASK] and then they removed a lot of the high frequencies [MASK] and pitched it down another octave [MASK] and then they added a little bit of[MASK] <unk> and by looping and repeating that sound they got this [MASK] churns so creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion that we 're inside[MASK] <unk> you 've created your sounds and you 've synced them to the image you want those sounds to live in the world of the story <unk> [MASK] and one the best ways to do that is to add reverb <unk> [MASK] so this is the first audio tool i want to talk about reverberation or reverb is the[MASK] persistence of the[MASK] sound after the original sound has ended so it 's sort of like[MASK] the all the reflections from the materials the objects and the walls around the sound take for example the sound of a gunshot <unk> the original <unk>[MASK] <unk> sound is less than half a second long [MASK] by adding reverb <unk> we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom gunshot reverbs in bathroom[MASK] <unk> gives us a lot of information about the space between the listener and the original sound source if the sound is the taste then[MASK] reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound but reverb can do a lot more listening[MASK] <unk> to a sound with a lot less reverberation than the on screen action is going to immediately signify to us that we 're listening to a commentator <unk>[MASK] to an objective narrator that 's not participating in the on screen action <unk> [MASK] <unk> in cinema are often heard with zero reverb because that 's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear [MASK] on the completely other side <unk> adding a lot of reverb to a voice is going to make us think that we 're listening to a flashback [MASK] or perhaps that we 're inside the head of a character[MASK] or that we 're listening to the voice of god or even more powerful[MASK] <unk> what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use <unk> [MASK] well <unk> here 's a really big one [MASK] it 's silence a few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention [MASK] and in[MASK] the western[MASK] <unk> world we 're not really used to verbal silences they 're considered awkward or rude <unk> [MASK] so silence preceding verbal communication[MASK] can create a lot of tension <unk> but imagine a really big hollywood movie <unk> where it 's full of explosions and automatic[MASK] automatic guns loud stops being loud anymore[MASK] <unk> after a while so in a yin yang way silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect <unk> [MASK] but what does silence mean well <unk> it depends how it 's used in each film [MASK] silence can place us inside the head of a character or provoke thought <unk> we often[MASK] <unk> being deep in thought <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] apart from having one meaning <unk> silence becomes a blank canvas upon which[MASK] the viewer is invited to the paint their own thoughts <unk> but i want to make it clear <unk> there is no such thing as[MASK] <unk> and i know this sounds like the most pretentious ted talk statement ever <unk> but[MASK] even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation and zero external sounds you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood <unk> [MASK] and in cinema traditionally <unk> there was never a silent moment because of the sound of the projector [MASK] and even in today 's dolby world [MASK] there 's not really any moment of silence[MASK] <unk> you listen around you [MASK] there 's always some sort of noise [MASK] now since there 's no such thing as silence what do filmmakers and sound designers use <unk> well <unk> [MASK] as a synonym they often use[MASK] are the unique background sounds that are specific to each location each location has a unique sound[MASK] and each room has a unique sound which is called room tone so here 's a recording of a market in morocco voices [MASK] music and here 's a recording of times square in new york[MASK] <unk> inside the room the ventilation <unk> the heating the fridge here 's a recording of my apartment in brooklyn[MASK] so <unk> birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality [MASK] perhaps because as a species <unk> we 've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years birds[MASK] on the other hand industrial sounds[MASK] have been introduced to us a little more recently [MASK] even though i really like them personally they 've been used by one of my heroes david lynch <unk> and his sound designer alan <unk> splet industrial sounds often carry negative connotations [MASK] now sound effects can tap into our emotional memory[MASK] occasionally they can be so significant that they become a character in a movie [MASK] the sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger [MASK] church bells can remind us of the passing of time or perhaps our own mortality[MASK] ring and breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship[MASK] or a friendship[MASK] played very loud may remind us[MASK] of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear[MASK] <unk> be seen that 's what we call offscreen sounds or <unk>[MASK] <unk> sounds[MASK] well <unk> the term acousmatic comes from pythagoras in ancient greece <unk> who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years not revealing himself to his disciples <unk> [MASK] i think the mathematician and philosopher thought that [MASK] in that way[MASK] his students might focus more on the voice and his words and its meaning <unk> rather than the visual of him speaking so sort of like the wizard of oz or one[MASK] thousand nine hundred and eighty four 's big brother <unk> separating the voice from its[MASK] <unk> separating cause and effect sort of creates a sense of ubiquity or[MASK] and therefore authority <unk> there 's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound nuns in monasteries[MASK] in rome and venice used to sing in rooms up in galleries[MASK] close to the ceiling creating the illusion that we 're listening to angels up in the sky[MASK] <unk> wagner famously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience <unk> and one of my heroes <unk> aphex twin famously hid in dark corners of clubs [MASK] i think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source you create a sense of mystery this has been seen in cinema over and over with hitchcock and ridley scott in[MASK] <unk> without knowing its source is going to create some sort of tension <unk> [MASK] also <unk> [MASK] it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have and can show something that wasn 't there during filming <unk> [MASK] and if all this sounds a little theoretical i wanted to play a little video[MASK] sort of trying to to demonstrate with these tools[MASK] is that sound is a language <unk> it can trick us by transporting us geographically <unk> [MASK] it can change the mood it can set the pace it[MASK] can make us laugh or it can make us scared[MASK] on a personal level i fell in love with that language a few years ago <unk> and somehow managed to make it into some sort of[MASK] <unk> profession <unk> and i think with our work through the sound library we 're trying to kind of[MASK] expand the vocabulary of that language and[MASK] in that way <unk> we want to offer the right tools to sound designers <unk> filmmakers and video game and[MASK] <unk> to keep telling even better stories and creating even more beautiful lies <unk> so thanks for listening[MASK]
