high price to pay for my freedom <unk> and for questioning the patriarchy <unk> but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two [MASK] once when my daughter paula was in her twenties <unk> she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move[MASK] we had a memorable fight <unk> feminism is dated <unk> [MASK] yes for privileged women like my daughter

reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules [MASK] the rules change all the time but they always benefit them [MASK] and in this case the trickle down effect
