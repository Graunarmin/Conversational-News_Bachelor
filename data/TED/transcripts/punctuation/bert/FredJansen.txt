 <unk> like to take you on the epic quest of the rosetta spacecraft [MASK] to escort and land the probe on a comet <unk> this has been my passion for the past two years [MASK] in order to do that i need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system[MASK] <unk> go back four and a half billion years there was a cloud of gas and dust in the center of this cloud our sun formed and ignited <unk> [MASK] along with that what we now know as planets comets and asteroids formed <unk> [MASK] what then happened <unk> according to theory is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation [MASK] comets massively impacted the earth and[MASK] <unk> delivered water to earth <unk> [MASK] they probably also delivered complex organic material to earth [MASK] and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life <unk> you can compare this to having to solve a <unk> 250 piece puzzle and not a 2 000 piece puzzle <unk> [MASK] afterwards <unk> the big planets like jupiter and saturn they were not in their place where they are now and they interacted gravitationally and[MASK] <unk> they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean and what we now know as comets ended up in something called the kuiper belt [MASK] which is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of neptune <unk> [MASK] and sometimes these objects run into each other <unk> [MASK] and they gravitationally deflect <unk> and then the gravity of jupiter pulls[MASK] <unk> them back into the solar system <unk> [MASK] and they then become the comets as we see them in the sky <unk> the important thing here to note is that in the meantime <unk> the four and a half billion years <unk> these comets <unk>[MASK] <unk> have been sitting on the outside of the solar system <unk> and haven 't changed deep frozen versions of our solar system [MASK] <unk> ion tail which is charged particles <unk> and they follow the magnetic field in the solar system <unk> [MASK] there 's the coma and then there is the nucleus which here is too small to see and you have to remember that in the case of rosetta the spacecraft is in that center pixel we are only twenty thirty forty kilometers away from the comet <unk> [MASK] so what 's important to remember comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed[MASK] <unk> so they 're ideal to study the components that were present at the time when earth and life <unk> started <unk> [MASK] comets are also suspected of having brought the elements which may have <unk> bootstrapped life <unk>[MASK] esa set up its long term horizon two thousand program which contained one cornerstone which would be a[MASK] <unk> mission to a comet in parallel a small mission to a comet what you see here giotto was launched and <unk>[MASK] flew by the comet of halley[MASK] with an armada of other spacecraft from the results of that mission it became immediately clear that comets were ideal bodies to study[MASK] to understand our solar system and thus the rosetta mission was approved in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three[MASK] <unk> and originally it was supposed to be launched in two thousand and three but a problem arose with an ariane rocket <unk> however [MASK] our p r department in its enthusiasm had already made one thousand delft blue plates[MASK] with the name of the wrong comets so i 've never had to buy any china since that 's the positive part [MASK] once the whole problem was solved <unk> we left earth in two thousand and four to the[MASK] <unk> this comet had to be specially selected because a you have to be able to get to it and b it shouldn 't have been in the solar system too long <unk> this particular comet has been in the solar system <unk>[MASK] <unk> since one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine that 's the first time when it was deflected by jupiter and it got close enough to the sun to start changing <unk> so it 's a very fresh comet <unk> [MASK] <unk> throughout its whole tour through the solar system closest approach to the sun[MASK] as we will see in august <unk> and then away again to the exterior <unk> it 's the first ever landing on a comet [MASK] we actually orbit the comet using something which is not normally done with spacecraft normally you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are [MASK] in this case that 's not enough we navigated by looking at landmarks on the[MASK] <unk> recognized features boulders craters and that 's how we know where we are respective to the comet [MASK] and of course <unk> it 's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of jupiter on solar cells <unk> now this sounds more heroic than it actually is because the technology to use[MASK] radio isotope thermal generators wasn 't[MASK] <unk> in europe at that time so there was no choice <unk> but these solar arrays are big <unk> this is one wing <unk> and these are not specially selected small people they 're just like you and me [MASK] laughter we have two of these wings[MASK] <unk> square meters now later on of course <unk> when we got to the comet <unk> you find out[MASK] that sixty five square meters of sail close to a body which is outgassing[MASK] <unk> is not always a very handy choice <unk> [MASK] now how did we get to the comet <unk> because we had to go there for the rosetta scientific objectives very far away four times the distance of the earth to the sun and also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel [MASK] because we 'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed <unk> [MASK] so what do you do you use gravitational flybys <unk> [MASK] <unk> where you pass by a planet at very low altitude a few thousand kilometers <unk> and then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free <unk> [MASK] we did that a few times <unk> we did earth <unk> we did mars <unk> we did twice earth again <unk> and we also flew by two asteroids lutetia and steins [MASK] then in two thousand and eleven we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble[MASK] <unk> we couldn 't actually[MASK] save the spacecraft anymore <unk> so we went into hibernation <unk> everything was switched off except for one clock [MASK] here you see in white the trajectory and the way this works <unk> you see that from the circle where we started <unk> the white line <unk> actually you get more and more and more elliptical <unk>[MASK] <unk> and then finally we approached the comet in may two thousand and fourteen <unk> and we had to start doing the rendezvous[MASK] <unk> on the way there we flew by earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras <unk> this is the moon rising over earth [MASK] and this is what we now call a selfie which at that time by the way that word didn 't exist [MASK] laughter it 's at mars <unk> it was taken by the civa camera <unk> that 's one of the cameras on the lander <unk> [MASK] and it just looks under the solar arrays and you see the planet mars and the solar array in the distance[MASK] <unk> when we got out of hibernation in january two thousand and fourteen <unk> [MASK] we started arriving at a distance of two million kilometers from the comet in may however [MASK] the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast we were going two thousand eight hundred kilometers an hour faster than the comet <unk> so we had to brake we had to do eight maneuvers <unk> and you see here some of them were really big [MASK] we had to brake[MASK] the first one by a few hundred kilometers[MASK] <unk> per hour and actually the duration of that was seven hours <unk> and it used two hundred and eighteen kilos of fuel [MASK] and those were seven nerve wracking hours <unk> because in two thousand and seven there was a leak in the system of the propulsion of rosetta <unk> and we had to close off a branch so the system was actually operating at a pressure which it was never designed or qualified for[MASK] in the vicinity of the comet <unk> and these were the first pictures we saw the true comet rotation period is twelve and a half hours so this is accelerated <unk> [MASK] but you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought <unk> this is not going to be an easy thing to land on we had hoped for some kind of <unk>[MASK] thing where you could easily land but we had one hope[MASK] <unk> it was smooth <unk> no [MASK] that didn 't work either [MASK] so at that point in time it was clearly unavoidable we had to map this body in all the detail you could get because we had to find an area which is five hundred meters in <unk>[MASK] <unk> diameter and flat <unk> why five hundred meters <unk> that 's the error we have on landing the[MASK] <unk> so we went through this process and we mapped the comet we used a technique called photoclinometry you use shadows thrown by the sun [MASK] what you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the[MASK] comet and the sun shines from above from the shadow we with our brain can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is [MASK] you can program that in a computer you then cover the whole comet[MASK] <unk> and you can map the comet <unk> for that we flew special trajectories starting in august [MASK] first a triangle of one hundred kilometers on a side at one hundred kilometers ' distance <unk> and we repeated the whole thing at fifty kilometers [MASK] at that time we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles <unk> and we could use this technique to map[MASK] the whole thing <unk> now <unk> this led to a selection of landing sites this[MASK] <unk> whole process we had to do to go from the mapping of the comet to actually finding the final landing site [MASK] was sixty days <unk> we didn 't have more to give you an idea the average mars mission[MASK] takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet about where shall we go we had sixty days and that was it [MASK] we finally selected the final landing site and the commands were prepared for[MASK] <unk> the way this works is that rosetta has to be at the right point in space and aiming towards the comet because the lander is passive the lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet rosetta had to turn around to get its cameras to actually look[MASK] at philae while it was departing and to be able to communicate with it <unk> now <unk> the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours <unk> [MASK] now do a simple calculation <unk> if the[MASK] <unk> velocity of rosetta is off by one centimeter per second <unk> seven[MASK] hours is twenty five thousand seconds <unk> that means two hundred and fifty two meters wrong on the comet <unk> [MASK] so we had to know the velocity of rosetta much better than one centimeter per second <unk> [MASK] and its location in space better than one hundred meters at five hundred million kilometers from earth[MASK] that 's no mean feat <unk> [MASK] let me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments <unk> i won 't bore you with all the details of of all the instruments <unk> but it 's got everything we can sniff gas we can measure[MASK] dust particles <unk> the shape of them the composition <unk> there are magnetometers <unk> everything [MASK] this is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density at the position of rosetta[MASK] so it 's gas which has left the comet the bottom graph is september of last year <unk> there is a long term variation which in itself is not surprising <unk> but you see the sharp peaks <unk> this is a comet day <unk> [MASK] you can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas and the fact that the comet is rotating <unk> so there is one[MASK] <unk> there is a lot of stuff coming from it gets heated in the sun and then cools down on the back side <unk> and we can see the density variations of this [MASK] these are the gases and the organic compounds that we already have measured you will see it 's an impressive list and there is much much much more <unk>[MASK] <unk> to come <unk> because there are more measurements actually there is a conference going on <unk> in houston at the moment where many of these results are presented [MASK] <unk> particles now for you this will not look very impressive but the scientists were thrilled when they saw this two dust particles <unk> the right one they call boris <unk> and they shot it with tantalum[MASK] in order to be able to analyze it <unk> now we found sodium and magnesium <unk> what this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials at the time the solar system was formed <unk> so we learned things about which materials[MASK] <unk> were there when the planet was made [MASK] of course one of the important elements is the imaging [MASK] this is one of the cameras of rosetta the osiris camera and this actually was the cover of science magazine on january twenty three of this year [MASK] nobody had expected this body to look like this boulders rocks if anything it looks more like the half dome in yosemite than anything else[MASK] <unk> we also saw things like this dunes <unk> and what look to be on the righthand side wind blown shadows now we know these from mars <unk> but this comet doesn 't have an atmosphere <unk> so it 's a bit difficult to create a wind blown shadow <unk> [MASK] it may be local outgassing [MASK] stuff which goes up and comes back we don 't know <unk> so there is a lot[MASK] <unk> you see the same image twice on the left hand side you see in the middle a pit <unk> on the right hand side if you carefully look there are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit <unk> [MASK] so this is the activity of the comet <unk> apparently at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are and where the material evaporates into space [MASK] there is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet <unk> you see it[MASK] <unk> it 's a kilometer long <unk> and it 's two and a half meters wide some people suggest[MASK] that actually when we get close to the sun the comet may split in two and then we 'll have to choose which comet do we go for the lander[MASK] again <unk> lots of instruments <unk> mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill etc [MASK] but much the same as rosetta and that is because you want to compare[MASK] what you find in space with what[MASK] <unk> find on the comet <unk> these are called ground truth measurements <unk>[MASK] these are the landing descent images that were taken by the osiris camera <unk> you see the lander getting further and further away from rosetta [MASK] on the top right you see an image taken at sixty meters by the lander sixty meters above the surface of the comet the boulder there is some ten meters <unk> [MASK] so this is one of the last images we took[MASK] <unk> before we landed on the comet <unk> [MASK] here you see the whole sequence again <unk> but from a different perspective <unk> and you see three blown ups from the bottom left to the middle[MASK] of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet <unk> then at the top [MASK] there is a before and an after image of the landing the only problem with the after image is there is no lander [MASK] but if you carefully look at the right hand side of this[MASK] <unk> image we saw the lander still there <unk> but it had bounced it had departed again <unk> now on[MASK] a bit of a comical note here is that originally rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce <unk> that was discarded because it was way too expensive now we forgot but the lander knew [MASK] <unk> during the first bounce in the magnetometers you see here the data from them from the three axes x y and z [MASK] halfway through you see a red line at that red line <unk> there is a change what happened <unk> apparently is during the first bounce <unk> somewhere we hit the edge <unk>[MASK] of a crater with one of the legs of the lander and the rotation velocity of the lander changed <unk> [MASK] it 's a <unk>[MASK] a leg of the lander <unk> standing on a comet [MASK] this for me is one of the very best images of space science i have ever seen [MASK] one of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander[MASK] <unk> the blue area here is where we know it must be we haven 't been able to find it yet <unk> but the search is continuing as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work <unk>[MASK] <unk> again <unk> we listen every day <unk> and we hope that between now and somewhere in april the lander will wake up again <unk> [MASK] <unk> so it looks like a very big rock but it 's not [MASK] the activity increase we saw in june july august last year was a four fold activity increase by the time we will be at the sun there will be one hundred kilos a second[MASK] leaving this comet gas dust whatever <unk> that 's one hundred million kilos a day <unk> [MASK] then finally the landing day <unk> i will never forget absolute madness two hundred and fifty tv crews in germany the[MASK] <unk> was interviewing me and another tv crew who was following me all day were filming me being interviewed and it went on like that for the whole day <unk> [MASK] the discovery channel crew[MASK] actually caught me when leaving the control room <unk> and they asked the right question <unk> and man i got into tears <unk> and i still feel this for a month and a half[MASK] <unk> i couldn 't think about landing day without crying <unk> and i still have the emotion in me with this image of the comet <unk> i would like to leave you thank you[MASK]
