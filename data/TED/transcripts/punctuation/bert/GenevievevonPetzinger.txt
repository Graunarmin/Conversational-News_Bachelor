 <unk> there 's something about caves[MASK] a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in [MASK] as you pass through the portal between light and dark you enter a subterranean world[MASK] a place of perpetual gloom[MASK] of earthy smells of hushed silence [MASK] long ago in europe <unk> ancient people also entered these underground worlds [MASK] as witness to their passage they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings like this panel of humans triangles and zigzags[MASK] from ojo guarea in spain you now walk the same path as these early artists[MASK] and in this surreal <unk> otherworldly place [MASK] it 's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth [MASK] or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend <unk> [MASK] when i 'm in a cave i often find myself wondering[MASK] what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark[MASK] in this video clip that was shot half a kilometer or about a third of a mile underground in the cave of cudon in spain [MASK] we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave as we crawled forward <unk>[MASK] with the ceiling getting ever lower we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer dylan could no longer achieve focus on the[MASK] <unk> ceiling with his dslr camera [MASK] so while he filmed me [MASK] i kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a <unk> point and shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion [MASK] half a kilometer underground <unk> seriously <unk> what was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp[MASK] <unk> you know this is the kind of question that i 'm trying to answer with my research i study some of the oldest art in the world [MASK] it was created by these early artists in europe between ten thousand and forty thousand years ago <unk> [MASK] and the thing is is that i 'm not just studying it because it 's beautiful though some of it certainly is <unk> but what i 'm[MASK] <unk> interested in[MASK] is the development of the modern mind of the evolution of creativity of imagination of abstract thought [MASK] about what it means to be human [MASK] while all species communicate in one way or another only we humans have really taken it to another level [MASK] our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story [MASK] our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange[MASK] <unk> made possible in large part by our ability to communicate[MASK] in particular <unk> using graphic or written forms of communication <unk> [MASK] the thing is though that we 've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long[MASK] that it 's easy to forget that certain abilities haven 't already existed it 's one of the things i find most fascinating about studying our deep history[MASK] those people didn 't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on they were the original shoulders <unk> [MASK] and while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time [MASK] what i want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication [MASK] there are three main types of communication <unk> spoken gestural so things like sign language[MASK] and graphic communication[MASK] spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral <unk> it requires close contact for a message to be sent and received <unk> [MASK] and after the moment of transmission it 's gone forever [MASK] graphic communication on the other hand <unk> decouples that relationship and with its invention it became possible for the first time[MASK] for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place[MASK] <unk> and time europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves rock shelters[MASK] and even a few surviving open air sites <unk> [MASK] but this is not the europe we know today [MASK] this was a world dominated by towering ice sheets three to four kilometers high with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra [MASK] this was the ice age[MASK] <unk> over the last century more than three hundred and fifty ice age rock art sites have been found across the continent [MASK] decorated with animals abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from grotta dell 'addaura in sicily <unk> [MASK] they provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early[MASK] <unk> since their discovery it 's been the animals that have received the majority of the study[MASK] like this black horse from cullalvera in spain <unk> or this unusual purple bison from la <unk> pasiega [MASK] but for me it was the abstract shapes what we call geometric signs that drew me to study the art [MASK] the funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images[MASK] <unk> but when i started on this back in two thousand and seven [MASK] there wasn 't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were [MASK] nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time <unk> [MASK] before i could even get started on my questions [MASK] my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites the problem was that while they were[MASK] well documented at some sites <unk> usually the ones with the very nice animals there was also a large number of them[MASK] where it was very vague there wasn 't a lot of description or detail some of them hadn 't been visited in half a century or more [MASK] these were the ones that i targeted for my field work [MASK] over the course of two years my faithful husband dylan[MASK] <unk> in france spain portugal and sicily <unk> [MASK] and it was totally worth it we found new <unk> undocumented geometric signs at seventy five percent of the sites we visited [MASK] this is the level of accuracy i knew i was going to need if i wanted to start answering those larger questions[MASK] <unk> time span and the entire continent of europe that is a very small number [MASK] now if these were random doodles or decorations we would expect to see a lot more variation <unk> [MASK] but instead what we find are the same signs repeating across both space and time [MASK] some signs start out[MASK] <unk> strong before losing popularity and vanishing while other signs are later inventions [MASK] but sixty five percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period[MASK] things like lines rectangles triangles ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the ice age at a 10 000 year old site high in the pyrenees[MASK] <unk> and while certain signs span thousands of kilometers [MASK] other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns [MASK] with some being limited to a single territory like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern spain <unk> [MASK] and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs [MASK] on a side note there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found[MASK] <unk> all the way from france and spain to indonesia and australia with many of the same signs appearing in such far flung places[MASK] especially in that thirty thousand to 40 000 year range it 's starting to seem increasingly likely[MASK] that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in africa <unk> but that i 'm afraid is a subject for a future talk so back to the matter at hand <unk> [MASK] there could be no doubt[MASK] <unk> in france we might not know what they meant <unk> but the people of the time certainly did <unk> [MASK] the repetition of the same signs for so long and at so many sites[MASK] tells us that the artists were making intentional choices <unk> if we 're talking about[MASK] <unk> than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world [MASK] i 'm not talking about writing yet [MASK] there 's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language something which is a requirement for a full writing system <unk> [MASK] nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet <unk> [MASK] but what we do have are some intriguing[MASK] like this panel from la pasiega in spain <unk> known as the inscription [MASK] with its symmetrical markings on the left possible stylized representations of hands in the middle and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right <unk> [MASK] the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world[MASK] sumerian cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs the earliest chinese script all emerged between four thousand and five thousand years ago[MASK] with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations where the meaning and the image were the same [MASK] so a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal it[MASK] 's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized until they almost become unrecognizable[MASK] and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those[MASK] <unk> other missing words in language things like pronouns adverbs adjectives [MASK] so knowing all this it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from ice age europe were truly abstract written characters <unk> [MASK] instead what 's much more likely[MASK] is that these early artists were also making counting marks maybe like this row of lines from[MASK] <unk> representations of things from the world around them [MASK] could some of the signs be weaponry or housing or what about celestial objects like star constellations [MASK] or maybe even rivers mountains trees landscape features <unk> possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange <unk> bell shaped signs from the site[MASK] <unk> but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree [MASK] some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites <unk> [MASK] but i believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole [MASK] the irony in all of this of course is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category i have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart[MASK] as different types of imagery are identified and separated off [MASK] now don 't get me wrong the later creation of fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right <unk> [MASK] but it 's important to remember that those early writing systems didn 't come out of a vacuum and that even five thousand years ago people were already building on something much older[MASK] <unk> with its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years[MASK] to the geometric signs of ice age europe and far beyond [MASK] to that point deep in our collective history <unk> when someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark <unk> [MASK] and forever changed the nature of how we communicate[MASK]
