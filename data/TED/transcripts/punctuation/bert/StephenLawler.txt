 <unk> what i want to talk to you about today is[MASK] virtual worlds digital globes the 3 d web [MASK] the metaverse what does this all mean for us what it means is the web is going to become an exciting[MASK] <unk> place again it 's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world [MASK] with graphics computing power <unk> low latencies [MASK] these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives <unk> [MASK] so the virtual earth initiative and other[MASK] types of these initiatives are all[MASK] <unk> about extending[MASK] our current search metaphor when you think about it we 're so constrained by browsing the web remembering urls <unk> saving favorites [MASK] as we move to search <unk> we rely on the relevance rankings the web matching the index crawling but we want to use our brain <unk> we want to navigate [MASK] <unk> discover information in order to do that we have to put you as a user back in the driver 's seat we need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer <unk> [MASK] so what better way[MASK] to put you back in the driver 's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day why not leverage the learnings[MASK] that you 've been learning your entire life <unk> so virtual earth is about[MASK] starting off creating the first digital representation comprehensive of the entire[MASK] <unk> world what we want to do is mix in all types of data [MASK] tag it attribute it metadata get the community to add local depth <unk> global perspective local knowledge [MASK] so when you think about this problem <unk> what an enormous undertaking <unk> where do you begin <unk> well <unk> we collect data from satellites[MASK] <unk> an engineering problem a mechanical problem <unk> a logistical problem <unk> an operational problem [MASK] here is an example of our aerial camera this is panchromatic it 's actually four color cones in addition <unk>[MASK] we collect four gigabits per second of data if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down that 's equivalent to to a constellation of twelve satellites[MASK] <unk> at highest res capacity <unk> [MASK] we fly these airplanes at five thousand feet in the air you can see the camera on the front <unk> we collect multiple viewpoints vantage points <unk> angles textures [MASK] we bring all that data back in [MASK] we sit here you know think about the ground vehicles the human scale what do you see in person <unk> we need to capture that up close to establish that what it 's[MASK] i bet many of you have seen the[MASK] apple commercials kind of poking at the pc for their brilliance and simplicity [MASK] so a little unknown secret is did you see the one with the[MASK] the guy he 's got the web cam the poor pc guy they 're duct taping his head they 're just wrapping it on him well a little unknown secret is his brother[MASK] actually works on the virtual earth team[MASK] <unk> so they 've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here but let me tell you[MASK] it doesn 't affect his day job [MASK] we think a lot of good can come from this technology this was after katrina <unk> we were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone we flew the area we imaged it we sent in people we took[MASK] <unk> disaster areas we helped with the first responders the search and rescue often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house[MASK] was on virtual earth we made it all freely available on the web just to it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause when we think about[MASK] how all this[MASK] comes together it 's all about software algorithms and math you know we capture this imagery but to build the 3 d models we need to do[MASK] <unk> the images we have to bundle adjust them <unk> find tie points <unk> extract geometry from the images [MASK] this process is a very calculated process in fact it was always done manual <unk> hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they 'd have to do it manually [MASK] they 'd drive the streets with lasers called lidar[MASK] <unk> collected information with photos they 'd manually build each building <unk> we do this all through software algorithms and math a highly automated pipeline creating these cities <unk> we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities [MASK] and that 's how we 're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream [MASK] we think about the user interface what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives[MASK] <unk> how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model[MASK] <unk> 'll wrap up by showing you the[MASK] this is a <unk> brand new peek i haven 't really shown into the lab area of virtual earth what we 're doing is people like this a lot this bird 's eye imagery we work with it 's this high resolution data but what we 've found is they like the fluidity of the 3 d model [MASK] a child can navigate with an xbox controller or a game controller so here what we 're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the[MASK] <unk> space you can see all types of resolution from here i can slowly pan the image[MASK] over i can get the next image i can blend and transition by doing this i don 't lose the original detail in fact i might be recording history the freshness the capacity <unk> i can turn this image i can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles[MASK] <unk> what we 're trying to do is[MASK]
