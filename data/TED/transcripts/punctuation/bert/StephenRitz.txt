 <unk> a teacher and this is my world <unk> and along the way i 've started noticing i 'm on my[MASK] <unk> third generation of kids that they 're getting bigger they 're getting sicker [MASK] in addition to these complexities i just learned that seventy percent of the kids that i see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition[MASK] the realities of my community are simple they look like this <unk> [MASK] kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this and as jobs continue to leave my community and energy continues to come in be exported in it 's no wonder that really some people refer to the south bronx as a desert <unk> [MASK] but i 'm the oldest[MASK] <unk> sixth grader you 'll ever meet so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that i 'm hoping to share with you all today[MASK] <unk> and with that note <unk> i come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live learn and earn in a better one so i 'm here to tell you a story about me and <unk>[MASK] <unk> this wall that i met outside which i 'm now bringing inside <unk> and it starts with three people [MASK] my passionate borough president and a guy named george irwin from green living technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology[MASK] <unk> but it all starts with seeds in classrooms <unk> in my place which looks like this [MASK] and i 'm here today[MASK] hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp and that 's really what this is all about and it starts with incredible kids like this who come early and stay late[MASK] <unk> all of my kids are either iep or ell learners most come with a lot of handicaps most are homeless and many are in foster care almost all of my kids live below poverty <unk> [MASK] but with those seeds from day one we are growing in my classroom and this is what it looks like in my classroom and you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds <unk> and then you notice that those seeds become farms across the bronx that look like this <unk> [MASK] but again <unk> [MASK] i am not a farmer[MASK] i 'm a teacher and i don 't like weeding and i don 't like back breaking labor <unk> so i wanted to figure out how i could get this kind of success into something small like this and bring it into my classroom so that <unk>[MASK] <unk> handicapped kids could do it kids who didn 't want to be outside could do it and everyone could have access <unk> so i called george irwin <unk> and what do you know <unk> he came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall <unk> [MASK] <unk> and lo and behold we gave birth to the first edible wall in new york city so if you 're hungry get up and eat you can do it right now my kids play cow all the time okay[MASK] but we were just getting started the kids loved the technology so we called up george and we said we gotta learn more now mayor bloomberg thank you very much we no longer need work permits <unk> which comes with slices and bonded contractors we 're available for you we decided to go to boston <unk> [MASK] and my kids from the poorest congressional district in[MASK] <unk> america became[MASK] the first to install a green wall designed by a computer with real live learning tools twenty one stories up if you 're going to go visit it it 's on top of the john hancock building <unk> [MASK] but closer to home we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that[MASK] <unk> heirloom students making heirloom sauce with plastic forks <unk> and we get it into the cafeteria and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers <unk> and that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in america <unk>[MASK] <unk> with our bronx borough president and what 'd we do then well <unk> i met nice people like you and they invited us to the hamptons[MASK] <unk> so i call this from south bronx to southampton [MASK] and we started putting in roofs that look like this <unk> and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this <unk> wow people noticed <unk> and so we got invited back this past <unk>[MASK] <unk> summer and we actually moved into the hamptons payed three thousand five hundred dollars a week for a house <unk> and we learned how to surf <unk> and when you can do stuff like this[MASK] these are my kids putting in this technology and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that[MASK] <unk> looks like this this is the new green graffiti <unk> [MASK] so <unk> you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids besides changing landscapes and mindsets <unk>[MASK] <unk> it does it gets me to meet incredible contractors like this <unk> jim ellenberger from ellenberger services <unk> and this is where it becomes true triple bottom line <unk> because jim[MASK] <unk> realized that these kids my future farmers really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for new yorkers <unk> right in their own neighborhood <unk> and this is what my kids are doing making living wage <unk> now <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you 're like me you live in a building there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars i don 't have it but if you need a toilet fixed or you know some shelving <unk> i gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me that 's the beauty of this economy[MASK] <unk> licensed and bonded in trade and that 's my first student to open up the first in his family to have a bank account [MASK] this immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an <unk> atm [MASK] and this is the true triple bottom line because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this <unk> wow people noticed <unk> and notice they did so cnn called and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer 's market <unk> [MASK] and then when rockefeller center said nbc could you put this thing up on the walls we were delighted <unk> but this i show you when kids from the poorest congressional district in america[MASK] wall <unk> design it plant it and install it in the heart of new york city that 's a true s se puede moment really scholastic if you ask me[MASK] but this is not a getty image that 's a picture i took of my bronx borough president addressing my kids in his house not the jailhouse making them feel a part of it that 's our state senator gustavo rivera and bob bieder coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important[MASK] when the bronx borough president shows up and the state senator comes to our class believe you me the bronx can change attitudes now we are poised ready willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we 've never even imagined <unk> [MASK] and when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he 's got to lose weight <unk> [MASK] so do i and i tell you what i 'm doing it and[MASK] so are the kids[MASK] <unk> then celebrities started <unk> produce pete can 't believe what we grow <unk> lorna sass came and donated books okay <unk> we 're feeding seniors <unk> and when we realized that we were growing for food justice <unk>[MASK] <unk> in the south bronx so did the international community and my kids in the south bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference and that 's just great except what about locally <unk> [MASK] <unk> the most disenfranchised and marginalized were able to roll out one hundred gardens to new york city public schools that 's triple bottom line <unk> okay <unk> a year ago today i was invited <unk>[MASK] <unk> to the new york academy of medicine <unk> i thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy new york made sense especially when the resources were free so thank you all and i love them they introduced me to the new york city strategic alliance for health again free[MASK] <unk> don 't waste them <unk> and what do you know <unk> six months later <unk> my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence[MASK] for creating a healthy school environment <unk> the greenest class in new york city <unk> but more importantly is my kids learned to get [MASK] they learned to give <unk> and we took the money that we made from our farmer 's market and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world so we started giving back <unk> and that 's when i realized that the greening of america starts[MASK] first with the pockets then with the heart and[MASK] <unk> then with the mind so we were onto something <unk> and we 're still onto something and thank god trinity wall street noticed because they gave us the birth of green bronx machine we 're three thousand strong right now <unk> [MASK] <unk> and what does it really do it teaches kids to re vision their communities so when they grow up in places like this they can imagine it like this and my kids <unk> trained and certified ma you get the tax abatement thank you mayor bloomberg can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that and that[MASK] <unk> me people is another true s se puede moment now [MASK] how does it start it starts in schools no more little knicks and little nets <unk> [MASK] group by broccoli <unk> group by your favorite vegetable something you can aspire to okay and these are my future farmers of america growing up in brook park on 141st street the most migrant <unk>[MASK] <unk> community in america when tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this <unk> it 's no wonder we get fruit like that and i love it and so[MASK] <unk> teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down <unk> and that 's a true s se puede moment <unk> and again <unk> brook park[MASK] feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint the poorest congressional district in america the most migratory community in america[MASK] <unk> the south bronx of america <unk> and we 're doing it [MASK] how does it start well look at jose 's attention to detail <unk> thank god omar knows that carrots come from the ground and not aisle nine at the supermarket or through a <unk> bullet proof window or through a piece of styrofoam <unk> [MASK] and when henry knows that green is good <unk> so do i and when you expand their palates you expand their vocabulary <unk> and most importantly when you put big kids together with little kids you get the big fat white guy out of the middle[MASK] <unk> this kind of accountability amongst peers which is incredible god i 'm going to run out of time so i 've gotta keep it moving but[MASK] this is my weekly paycheck for kids that 's our green graffiti this is what we 're doing <unk> and behold the glory and bounty that is bronx county <unk> nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other <unk> i gotta tell you i 'm a protective[MASK] parent but those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains we 're also designing coin[MASK] <unk> ponds for the rich and affluent we 're also becoming children of the corn creating farms in the middle of fordham road for awareness and window bottles out of

engaged and man are they so that 's my incredible classroom that 's the food where does it go zero miles to plate right down into the cafeteria or more importantly to local shelters where most of our
