 <unk> that mathematics is a very powerful language <unk> it has generated considerable insight in physics in biology and economics <unk> but not that much in the humanities and in history <unk> [MASK] i think there 's a belief that it 's just impossible that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind that you cannot measure history[MASK] but i don 't think that 's right i want to show you a couple of examples why <unk> [MASK] so my collaborator erez and i were considering the following fact that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language [MASK] that 's a powerful historical force <unk> so the king of england alfred the great <unk> will use a vocabulary and and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop[MASK] <unk> changes over time and it 's a powerful force <unk> so erez and i wanted to know more about that so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule past tense conjugation <unk> [MASK] so you just add ed to a verb at the end to signify the past today i walk yesterday i walked [MASK] but some verbs are irregular yesterday i thought [MASK] now what 's interesting about that is irregular verbs between alfred and[MASK] <unk> have become more regular like the verb to wed that you see here has become regular <unk> [MASK] so erez and i followed the fate of over one hundred irregular verbs through twelve centuries of english language [MASK] and we saw that there 's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change <unk> [MASK] namely if a verb is one hundred times more frequent than another it regularizes ten times slower [MASK] that 's a piece of history <unk> but it comes in a[MASK] <unk> in some cases math can even help explain or propose explanations for historical forces <unk> [MASK] so here steve pinker and i were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries there 's actually a well known regularity to them[MASK] where the number of wars that are one hundred times deadlier is ten times smaller <unk> [MASK] so there are thirty wars that are about as deadly as the six days war but there 's only four wars that are one hundred times deadlier like world war i so what kind of[MASK] <unk> historical mechanism can produce that what 's the origin of this <unk> [MASK] so steve and i through mathematical analysis [MASK] propose that there 's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this which lies in our brains this is a very well known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways[MASK] quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a[MASK] <unk> committing ten thousand soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot it 's relatively enormous if you 've already committed one thousand soldiers previously <unk> [MASK] but it doesn 't sound so much <unk> it 's not relatively enough it won 't make a difference if you 've already committed one hundred thousand soldiers previously <unk> [MASK] so you see that because of the way we perceive quantities as the war drags on the number of soldiers committed to[MASK] <unk> and the casualties will increase not linearly like ten thousand eleven thousand twelve thousand[MASK] but exponentially ten thousand later twenty thousand later forty thousand <unk> and so that explains this pattern that we 've seen before <unk> so here mathematics is able to link[MASK] a well known feature of the individual mind[MASK] historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents <unk> so these types of[MASK] <unk> few of them <unk> [MASK] but i think in the next decade they will become commonplace the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace <unk> [MASK] so there 's about one hundred and thirty million books that have been written since the dawn of time <unk> [MASK] companies like google have digitized many of them above twenty million actually [MASK] and when the stuff of history is available in digital form [MASK] it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture[MASK] <unk> so i think in the next decade the sciences and the humanities will come closer together[MASK] to be able to answer deep questions about mankind [MASK] and i think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that [MASK] it will be able to reveal new trends in our history <unk> sometimes to explain them and maybe even in the future to predict what 's going to happen [MASK]
