 <unk> it is very fashionable[MASK] and proper to speak about food in all its forms all its colors <unk> aromas[MASK] <unk> after the food goes through the[MASK] digestive system [MASK] when it is thrown out as crap [MASK] it is no longer fashionable to speak about it it is rather revolting [MASK] i 'm a guy who has graduated from[MASK] <unk> gram vikas which means village development organization [MASK] was working in the area of renewable energy on the most part we were producing biogas [MASK] biogas for[MASK] rural kitchens <unk> we produce[MASK] <unk> person that i am i would like to call it bullshit <unk> [MASK] but realizing later on how important were[MASK] sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way <unk> [MASK] we[MASK] <unk> in india[MASK] and most developing countries[MASK] are because of poor quality water <unk> [MASK] and when we look at the reason for poor quality water you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste[MASK] <unk> rawest form <unk> finds its way back to[MASK] drinking water <unk> bathing water <unk> washing water <unk> irrigation water <unk> whatever water you see <unk> [MASK] and this is the cause for eighty percent of the diseases[MASK] in rural areas in[MASK] <unk> it is unfortunately[MASK] only the women who carry water <unk> so for all domestic needs women have to carry water <unk> [MASK] so that is a pitiable[MASK] state of affairs [MASK] open defecation is rampant seventy percent of india defecates in the open [MASK] they sit there out in the open with the wind on their sails <unk> hiding their faces[MASK] <unk> their bases <unk> and sitting there in pristine glory[MASK] seventy percent of india and if you look at the world total <unk> [MASK] sixty percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by indians[MASK] <unk> i don 't know if[MASK] we indians can be proud of such a distinction [MASK] so we [MASK] together with a lot of villages we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation [MASK] and we came together and formed[MASK] a project called mantra mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas[MASK] so we are speaking about transformation transformation in rural areas [MASK] villages that agree to implement this project <unk> [MASK] they organize a legal society where the general body consists of all members[MASK] who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and[MASK] <unk> on who look after the operation and maintenance <unk> they decide to build a toilet[MASK] and a shower room <unk> and from[MASK] a protected water source water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and[MASK] piped to all households through[MASK] <unk> three taps one in the toilet one in the shower one in the kitchen twenty four hours a day [MASK] the pity is that our cities like new delhi and bombay <unk> do not have[MASK] <unk> which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter that poor people deserve poor solutions[MASK] and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions this combined with a nobel[MASK] <unk> most economic is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink[MASK] we are fighting against this <unk> we feel that[MASK] the poor have been humiliated for centuries <unk> and[MASK] even in sanitation <unk> they should not be humiliated sanitation is more about dignity than about[MASK] <unk> human disposal of waste <unk> and so you build these toilets and very often we have to hear that[MASK] the toilets are better than their houses and you can see that in front are the attached houses[MASK] and the others are the toilets so these people[MASK] <unk> a single exception of a family in a village decide to build a toilet a bathing room <unk> and[MASK] for that they come together collect all the local materials local materials like rubble <unk> [MASK] sand <unk> aggregates [MASK] usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost of external materials like cement steel toilet commode[MASK] and they build a toilet and a bathing room <unk> [MASK] also all the unskilled laborers that is daily wage earners <unk> mostly landless are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and[MASK] plumbers so while these people are being trained others are collecting the materials <unk> and when both are[MASK] <unk> ready <unk> they build[MASK] a toilet a shower room <unk> and of course also a[MASK] water tower <unk> an elevated water reservoir [MASK] we use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste <unk> from the toilet the muck comes into the first leach pit <unk> [MASK] and when it is full it is blocked and it can go[MASK] <unk> to the next <unk> but we discovered that[MASK] if you plant banana trees <unk> papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits [MASK] they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get[MASK] very tasty[MASK] bananas papayas if any of you come to[MASK] <unk> i would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you so there you can see[MASK] the completed toilets the water towers this is in a village where most of the people <unk> are even illiterate <unk> [MASK] it is always a 24 hour water supply because[MASK] water gets polluted very often when you store it a child dips his his or her hand into it[MASK] something falls into it so no water is stored it 's always on tap [MASK] this is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed <unk> and that is the end product <unk> [MASK] because it has to go high <unk> [MASK] and there is some space available <unk> two or three rooms are made under the water tower <unk> which are used by the village for different[MASK] <unk> committee meetings <unk> we have had clear evidence[MASK] of the great impact of this program <unk> [MASK] before we started there were as usual more than eighty percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases <unk> but[MASK] after this <unk> we have empirical[MASK] <unk> usually used to spend especially in the summer months about six to seven hours a day[MASK] carrying water <unk> [MASK] and when they went to carry water <unk> because as i said earlier it[MASK] 's only women who carry water they used to take their[MASK] little children girl children <unk> also to carry water or else to be back at home to look after the siblings <unk> so there[MASK] <unk> nine percent of girl children attending school even if there was a school <unk> and boys <unk> about thirty percent <unk> [MASK] but girls it has gone to about[MASK] ninety percent and boys <unk> almost to one hundred percent [MASK] <unk> vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners [MASK] because they have gone through this training to be masons and plumbers[MASK] and bar benders <unk> now their ability to earn has increased[MASK] three hundred to four hundred percent <unk> so this is a democracy in action because[MASK] <unk> governing board the committee people are questioning people are governing themselves <unk> people are learning to manage their own affairs <unk> [MASK] they are taking their own futures into their hands <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] that is democracy at the grassroots level in action [MASK] more than one thousand two hundred villages have so far done this [MASK] it benefits over four hundred thousand people[MASK] and it 's still going on and i hope it continues to move ahead [MASK] for india[MASK] and such developing countries armies and armaments <unk> [MASK] software companies and spaceships[MASK] may not be as important as[MASK] taps and toilets <unk> thank you <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
