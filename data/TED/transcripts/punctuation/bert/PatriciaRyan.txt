 <unk> you think i 've lost my way and somebody 's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat [MASK] <unk> come to visit the children [MASK] how long are you staying [MASK] well actually i hope for a while longer yet <unk> i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over thirty years[MASK] now that statistic[MASK] is quite shocking <unk> and i want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of english <unk> [MASK] i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi <unk> [MASK] and one fine day she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary <unk> but it was she who ended up learning all[MASK] <unk> the arabic words for the local plants as well as their uses medicinal uses cosmetics cooking <unk> herbal [MASK] how did those students get all that knowledge of course from their grandparents and even their <unk>[MASK] it 's not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations but sadly[MASK] <unk> today languages are dying at an unprecedented rate a language dies every fourteen days [MASK] now at the same time english is the undisputed global language <unk> [MASK] could there be a connection well i don 't know <unk> but i do know that i 've seen a lot of changes <unk> when i first came out to the gulf i came to kuwait[MASK] in the days when it was still a hardship[MASK] actually not that long ago that is a little bit too early <unk> [MASK] but nevertheless <unk> i was recruited by the british council along with about <unk> twenty five other teachers <unk> and we were the first <unk> non muslims to teach in the state schools there in kuwait [MASK] we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education[MASK] <unk> and of course the u k benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth <unk> okay <unk> now[MASK] this is the major change that i 've seen how teaching english has morphed[MASK] from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today no longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum[MASK] and no longer the sole domain of mother england it has become a bandwagon for every english speaking nation on earth <unk> [MASK] and why not after all the best[MASK] education according to the latest world university rankings is to be found in the universities of the[MASK] <unk> everybody wants to have an english education naturally <unk> but if you 're not a native speaker you have to pass a test <unk> now can it be right[MASK] to reject a student on linguistic ability alone <unk> perhaps you have a computer scientist who 's a genius would he need the same language as a lawyer for example <unk> [MASK] <unk> i don 't think so [MASK] we english teachers reject them all the time we put a stop sign <unk> and we stop them in their tracks they can 't pursue their dream any longer ' til they get english <unk> [MASK] now[MASK] let me put it this way <unk> if i met[MASK] a monolingual dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer <unk> would i stop him from entering my british university i don 't think so[MASK] <unk> indeed that is exactly what we do we english teachers are the gatekeepers <unk> [MASK] and you have to satisfy us first that your english is good enough <unk> [MASK] now it can be dangerous to give too much power[MASK] to a narrow segment of[MASK] <unk> i hear you say [MASK] what about the research it 's all in english [MASK] so the books are in english the journals are done in english <unk> [MASK] but that is a self fulfilling prophecy it feeds the english requirement <unk> and so it goes on i ask you what happened to translation [MASK] if you think about the islamic golden age[MASK] <unk> there was lots of translation then they translated from latin and greek[MASK] into arabic into persian <unk> and then it was translated on into the germanic languages of europe and the romance languages [MASK] and so light shone upon the dark ages of europe [MASK] now don 't get me wrong i am not against teaching english all you english teachers out there[MASK] <unk> i love it that we have a global language we need one today more than ever <unk> but i am against using it as a barrier [MASK] do we really want to end up with six hundred languages and the main one being english or chinese <unk> [MASK] we need more than that where do we draw the line this system[MASK] <unk> and i want to remind you that the the giants upon whose shoulders today 's intelligentsia stand[MASK] did not have to have english <unk> they didn 't have to pass an english test case in point <unk> einstein he by the[MASK] <unk> way was considered remedial at school because he was in fact dyslexic [MASK] but fortunately for the world he did not have to pass an english test because they didn 't start until <unk>[MASK] with toefl the american test of english <unk> now[MASK] it 's exploded there are lots and lots of tests of english and millions and millions of students take these tests every year[MASK] now you might think you and me those fees aren 't bad they 're okay but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people [MASK] so immediately we 're rejecting them it[MASK] brings to mind a headline i saw recently education the great divide [MASK] now i get it i understand why people would want to focus on english <unk> [MASK] they want to give their children[MASK] <unk> best chance in life [MASK] and to do that they need a western education [MASK] because of course the best jobs go to people out of the western universities that i put on earlier it 's a circular thing <unk> [MASK] okay <unk> let me tell you a story about two scientists two english scientists[MASK] <unk> they were doing[MASK] an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals <unk> [MASK] but they couldn 't get the results they wanted they really didn 't know what to do [MASK] until along came a german scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does german[MASK] <unk> if you can 't think a thought you are stuck <unk> but if[MASK] another language can think that thought then by cooperating we can achieve and learn so much more [MASK] my daughter came to england from kuwait she had studied science and mathematics in arabic[MASK] <unk> it into english at her grammar school and she was[MASK] the best in the class at those subjects <unk> which tells us[MASK] that when students come to us from abroad <unk> [MASK] we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know <unk> and they know it in their own language <unk> [MASK] when a language dies we don 't know what we lose with that language this is i don 't know if you saw it on cnn[MASK] <unk> recently they gave the heroes award to a young kenyan shepherd boy[MASK] who couldn 't study at night in his village like all the village children because the kerosene lamp it had smoke and it damaged his eyes <unk> [MASK] and anyway there was never enough kerosene because what does a dollar a day buy for[MASK] <unk> and now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home [MASK] when he[MASK] received his award he said these lovely words the children can lead africa from what it is today a dark continent to[MASK] a light continent a simple idea <unk> but it could have such far reaching consequences [MASK] people who have no light whether it 's physical or metaphorical <unk> cannot pass our exams <unk> [MASK] and we can never know what they know <unk> [MASK] let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark let us celebrate[MASK] <unk> diversity mind your language <unk> use it to spread great ideas[MASK]
