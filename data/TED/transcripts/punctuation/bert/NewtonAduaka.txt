 <unk> very strange for me because im not used to doing this i usually stand on the other side of the light and now i 'm feeling the pressure i put other people into[MASK] <unk> and it 's hard[MASK] <unk> really painted a very good background as to[MASK] the impulse behind my work and what drives me and my sense of of loss and trying to find[MASK] the answer to the big questions <unk> but this for me i mean coming here to do this feels[MASK] <unk> sculptor that i like very much <unk> giacometti who after[MASK] many years of living in france and learning <unk> you know <unk> studying and[MASK] working he returned home and he was asked what did you produce what have you[MASK] done with so many years of being away and he sort of he showed a handful of figurines and[MASK] obviously they were is this what you spent years doing and we expected[MASK] huge[MASK] masterpieces[MASK] what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a mans life search [MASK] thought everything just[MASK] <unk> in a reduced small version in a way i feel like that i feel like im coming home to[MASK] talk about what ive been away doing for for twenty years <unk> and i will start with a[MASK] brief taster of what ive been about a handful of films nothing much two feature films and a handful of short films[MASK] <unk> mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to nigeria[MASK] <unk> you is a waste of time marcus[MASK] <unk> like me not getting a break in life marcus so what solutions do you offer <unk> i mean the job of a poet is[MASK] <unk> a sure sign of his inability to express himself[MASK] <unk> can you not shut up now you talk straight to me[MASK] <unk> do you think about your movie d1 my movies they are ok <unk> fine they are better than making documentaries no one ever sees[MASK] <unk> trying to capture what cinema is for me and where i 'm coming from in terms of cinema <unk> the first piece <unk> was [MASK] really there 's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling she 'll be happy there[MASK] <unk> the sentiments of someone that 's been away from home and that was something that i went through you know and i 'm still going through i 've not been home for quite a while for about five years now i 've been away[MASK] twenty years in total [MASK] and so its its really it 's really[MASK] how suddenly you know <unk> this was made in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven which is the time of abacha the military[MASK] <unk> for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is [MASK] how and it 's sort of [MASK] perhaps romantic but i think <unk> i think beautiful because you you just need something to hold on to especially in a society where you feel[MASK] <unk> which takes us to the next piece where the young man talks about lack of opportunity <unk> living as a as a black person in europe[MASK] <unk> the glass ceiling that we all know about that we all talk about <unk>[MASK] and his reality <unk> again this was my this was me talking about this was again the time of multiculturalism in in the united kingdom <unk> and there was this buzzword and it[MASK] <unk> trying to say what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people and what what would a child[MASK] what does a child like jamie the young boy think i mean with all this anger that 's[MASK] built up inside of him <unk> what happens with that what of course happens with that is violence <unk> which we see when[MASK] we talk about the ghettos and we talk about <unk> you know[MASK] <unk> and manifests itself as riots <unk> like the one in france two years ago where i live which shocked everybody because everyone thought oh well france is a liberal society but[MASK] i lived in england for eighteen years i 've lived in france for about four and i feel actually thrown back twenty years living in france[MASK] <unk> and then the third piece <unk> the third piece for me is the question what is cinema to you what do you do with cinema there[MASK] 's a young director hollywood director with his friends fellow filmmakers[MASK] talking about what cinema means i suppose that will take me to[MASK] <unk> my last piece what cinema means for me <unk> my life started as a[MASK] i started life in one thousand nine hundred and sixty six a few months before the biafran which lasted for three years and it was three years of war so[MASK] that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece[MASK] <unk> to school with your brother[MASK] this[MASK] <unk> injection made us not to have mind[MASK] <unk> of rufus you are ezra the coward hes not taking care of his troops troop [MASK] <unk> the diamonds end up in his pocket[MASK] <unk> help of others that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war more than[MASK] <unk> begin a healing process and finally to as an act of closure to a terrible period in this countrys history the beginning of hope[MASK] <unk> like to remind you youre not on[MASK] trial here for any crimes you committed e we were fighting for our freedom [MASK] if killing in a war is a crime then you have to charge every soldier[MASK] <unk> the world war is a crime yes <unk> but i did not start it you too are a retired general not so cc yes [MASK] correct e so you too must stand trial then [MASK] our government was corrupt lack of education[MASK] was their way to control power <unk> if i may ask do you pay for school in your country[MASK] you are richer than us but we pay for school [MASK] your country talks about democracy but you support corrupt governments[MASK] like my own why because you want our diamond [MASK] <unk> to say that my point really here is that while were making all these huge advancements[MASK] for me you know i think we should[MASK] africa should move forward but we should remember so we do not go back here again thank you emeka okafor [MASK] thank you newton [MASK] one of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched[MASK] is this sense of[MASK] the psychological trauma[MASK] of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers <unk> and[MASK] considering where you are coming from and when we consider the extent to which its not[MASK] taken as seriously as it should be what would you have to say about that na in the process[MASK] <unk> of my research i actually spent a spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this <unk> and i remember i met a lot of[MASK] child soldiers <unk> <unk> ex combatants as they[MASK] like to be called i met psychosocial[MASK] psychosocial workers[MASK] <unk> the flight back on my last trip i remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself[MASK] if any kid in the west in the western world went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through[MASK] <unk> they will be[MASK] in therapy for the rest of their natural lives[MASK] <unk> so for me the thought that we have all these children its a generation we have a whole generation of children who have[MASK] who have been put through so so much psychological psychological trauma or damage and africa has to live with that but im just saying to factor[MASK] <unk> that in factor that in with all this great advancement all this pronouncement of great achievement [MASK] thats really my
