 <unk> you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far <unk> most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light <unk>[MASK] <unk> we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes the sun[MASK] <unk> burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon [MASK] and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in cosmic history <unk> [MASK] and with all of our modern telescopes[MASK] <unk> 've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang <unk> [MASK] and yet the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn 't silent <unk> i 'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack <unk>[MASK] is played on space itself because space can wobble like a drum <unk> it can ring out a kind of[MASK] <unk> recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold [MASK] now we 'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sonic composition [MASK] and[MASK] while we 've never heard the sounds from space <unk> we really should[MASK] <unk> in the next few years start to turn up the volume on what 's going on out there so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe <unk> we turn our <unk>[MASK] <unk> focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song which i 'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be[MASK] <unk> now black holes are dark against a dark sky <unk> we can 't see them directly they 're not brought to us with light at least not directly <unk> we can see them indirectly because black <unk>[MASK] <unk> holes wreak havoc on their environment they destroy stars around them they churn up debris in their surroundings <unk> but they won 't come to us directly through light we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very[MASK] <unk> and yet black holes may be heard even if they 're not seen [MASK] and that 's because they bang on space time like a drum <unk> [MASK] now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein to whom we owe so much einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were <unk>[MASK] <unk> empty <unk> it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without[MASK] <unk> this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe <unk>[MASK] einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe <unk> it would curve space and a freely[MASK] freely falling object would pass by let 's say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space it was einstein 's great general theory of relativity <unk> [MASK] now even light will be bent by those paths and you can be bent so much that you 're caught in orbit around the sun as the earth is or the moon around the earth these are the natural curves in space <unk> [MASK] what einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to[MASK] <unk> kilometers so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across you would make a black hole <unk> an object so dense <unk>[MASK] that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe <unk> it wasn 't einstein who realized this it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i joined the german army already an accomplished scientist[MASK] <unk> working on the russian front i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire <unk>[MASK] <unk> and then in between calculating einstein 's equations as you do in the trenches <unk> and he was reading einstein 's recently published general theory of relativity[MASK] <unk> and he was thrilled by this theory <unk> and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space <unk>[MASK] <unk> would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be <unk>[MASK] <unk> dragged down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow [MASK] <unk> you will see the war has been kind to me enough despite the heavy gunfire[MASK] <unk> i 've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and einstein was very impressed with his exact solution and i should hope also the dedication of the scientist [MASK] this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions <unk> and he took schwarzschild 's idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week[MASK] <unk> but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades <unk>[MASK] before the term black hole was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they 're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime[MASK] <unk> now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it 's actually not massive enough [MASK] but if we did a little thought experiment as einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers and putting a tiny <unk>[MASK] <unk> little earth around it in orbit maybe thirty kilometers outside of of the[MASK] <unk> because now the sun 's gone we have no other source of light so let 's make our little earth self illuminated [MASK] and you would realize you could put the earth in a happy orbit even thirty km outside of this[MASK] crushed black hole <unk> this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan more or less it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth <unk> but basically <unk>[MASK] <unk> that 's what we 're talking about we 're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan <unk> so we[MASK] <unk> move this earth very close thirty kilometers outside and we notice it 's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there 's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in [MASK] but what 's very impressive is that from our vantage point <unk> we can always see the earth it cannot hide behind the black[MASK] <unk> the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us so you can 't hide anything behind a black hole <unk> if this were battlestar galactica and you 're fighting the cylons don 't hide behind the black hole[MASK] they can see you <unk> [MASK] now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it 's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy [MASK] and if one were to eclipse the milky way this is what it would look like we would see[MASK] <unk> shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole <unk>[MASK] <unk> we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened <unk> [MASK] <unk> light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it 's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us and even <unk>[MASK] <unk> though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before[MASK] we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it 's a total death experience [MASK] and there 's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel <unk> [MASK] now we 've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole <unk> but black holes can be heard even if[MASK] <unk> they 're not seen[MASK] imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together <unk> maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two <unk>[MASK] <unk> black holes each one ten times the mass of the sun so now we 're going to crush them down to sixty kilometers across <unk> they can be spinning hundreds of times a <unk>[MASK] <unk> second at the end of their lives they 're going around each other very near the speed of light so they 're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction[MASK] <unk> of a second <unk> and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on space time space squeezes <unk>[MASK] <unk> and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out[MASK] <unk> thirty years for anyone in the world to crack this problem this was one of the groups <unk> it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves <unk> and if you can see <unk>[MASK] <unk> it 's kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves they 're literally the sounds of space ringing <unk> and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one[MASK] spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day [MASK] if you were standing near enough <unk> your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space <unk> you would literally hear the sound <unk> now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what 's going on [MASK] but[MASK] i 'd like to play for you the sound that we predict this is from my group a slightly less[MASK] <unk> glamorous[MASK] computer modeling imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole <unk> the sound you 're hearing is the light black hole banging[MASK] <unk> on space each time it gets close if it gets far away it 's a little too quiet <unk> [MASK] <unk> wobbling it like a drum and we can predict what the sound will be we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder <unk> and eventually we 're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy[MASK] <unk> it 's gone <unk> now i 've never heard it that loud it 's actually more dramatic at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic it 's sort of like ding ding ding this is[MASK] another sound from my group no i 'm not showing you any images because black holes don 't leave behind helpful trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves[MASK] <unk> but if you were to[MASK] float by[MASK] <unk> in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving [MASK] want to get away from the sound <unk> [MASK] both black holes are moving <unk> both black holes are getting closer together in this case they 're both wobbling quite a lot <unk> [MASK] and then they 're going to merge[MASK] <unk> now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now[MASK] that 's our prediction for what we 'll see luckily we 're at this safe distance in long beach california and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged <unk> and surely[MASK] <unk> the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too <unk>[MASK] <unk> quiet for any of us to ever hear there are very industrious experiments being built on earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an[MASK] <unk> over four kilometers it 's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it 's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there 's also a mission proposed <unk>[MASK] <unk> for space <unk> which hopefully will launch in the next ten years called lisa and lisa will be able to see <unk>[MASK] <unk> black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun in this hubble image we see two[MASK] <unk> they look like they 're frozen in some embrace and each one probably harbors a super massive black hole at its core <unk> [MASK] but they 're not frozen they 're actually merging these two black holes are colliding <unk> and they will merge over a billion year time scale it 's beyond our <unk>[MASK] <unk> human perception to pick up a song of that duration but lisa could see the final[MASK] <unk> black holes earlier in the universe 's history the last fifteen minutes before they fall together <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just black holes but it 's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang when that expression was coined it was derisive <unk>[MASK] <unk> like oh who would believe in a big bang but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang [MASK] <unk> we don 't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there 's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you 're inside the big bang it 's everywhere it 's all around you and the space <unk>[MASK] <unk> is wobbling chaotically <unk> fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star[MASK] is a habitable planet <unk> and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two <unk>[MASK] <unk> black holes collided that song has been ringing through space for all that time we weren 't even here <unk> it gets closer and closer forty thousand[MASK] <unk> 're still doing cave paintings it 's like hurry build your instruments it 's getting closer and closer and in twenty <unk> whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity we 'll build them we 'll turn on the machines and bang we 'll catch it[MASK] the first song from space <unk> if it was the big bang we were going to pick up it would sound like this [MASK] it 's a terrible sound <unk> it 's literally the definition of noise it 's white noise it 's such a chaotic ringing but it 's around us[MASK] everywhere[MASK] <unk> presumably if it hasn 't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe [MASK] so within the next few years we 'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render[MASK] the universe in audio <unk> but if we detect those earliest moments it[MASK] <unk> bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang <unk> which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest <unk> most elusive questions if we <unk>[MASK] <unk> run the movie of our universe backwards <unk> we know that there was a big bang in our past <unk> [MASK] <unk> happen again i mean in the spirit of rising to ted 's challenge to reignite wonder <unk> we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly <unk>[MASK] might evade us forever <unk> but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we 're just a branch off of a multiverse each branch with its own big bang[MASK] <unk> in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without maybe some with sentient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but somehow fundamentally connected to us [MASK] so we have to wonder if there is a multiverse in some other patch of that multiverse are there creatures <unk> here 's my[MASK] <unk> are there other creatures in the multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own origins and if they are [MASK] i can imagine them[MASK] as we are calculating <unk> writing computer code building instruments <unk> trying to detect that faintest sound[MASK] of their origins and wondering who else is out there <unk> thank you[MASK]
