 <unk> this is my great uncle my father 's father 's younger brother his name was joe mckenna <unk> he was[MASK] a young husband and a semi pro basketball player and a fireman in new york city <unk> family history[MASK] <unk> says he loved being a fireman and so in one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight on one of his days off he elected to hang out at the firehouse [MASK] to make himself useful that day he started polishing all the brass <unk> [MASK] the railings on the fire truck the fittings on the walls <unk> and one of the fire hose nozzles a giant heavy piece of metal [MASK] toppled off a shelf[MASK] and hit him[MASK] <unk> a few days later his shoulder started to hurt [MASK] two days after that he spiked a fever [MASK] the fever climbed and climbed his wife was taking care of him but nothing she did made a difference and when they got the local doctor in [MASK] nothing he did mattered either [MASK] they flagged down a cab[MASK] and took him to the hospital the nurses there recognized right away[MASK] that he had an infection what at the time they would have called blood poisoning and though they probably didn 't say it they would have known right away[MASK] that there was nothing they could do [MASK] there was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections didn 't exist yet <unk> the first[MASK] <unk> the first antibiotic was three years in the future [MASK] people who got infections either recovered if they were lucky or they died [MASK] my great uncle was not lucky <unk> [MASK] he was in the hospital for a week <unk> shaking with chills <unk> dehydrated and delirious sinking into a coma as his organs failed [MASK] his condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to[MASK] <unk> dilute the infection surging through his blood nothing worked <unk> he died <unk> he was thirty years old [MASK] if you look back through history most people died the way my great uncle died [MASK] most people didn 't die of cancer or heart disease <unk> the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the west today [MASK] they didn 't die of those diseases because[MASK] <unk> they didn 't live long enough to develop them [MASK] they died of injuries being gored by an ox <unk> shot on a battlefield [MASK] crushed in one of the new factories of the industrial revolution[MASK] and most of the time from infection which finished what those injuries began [MASK] all of that changed when antibiotics arrived[MASK] suddenly infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days [MASK] it seemed like a miracle and ever since we have been living inside the golden epoch[MASK] of the miracle drugs and now we are coming to an end of it my great uncle died in the last days of the[MASK] <unk> era we stand today on the threshold of the[MASK] <unk> era in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one joe had[MASK] will kill people[MASK] once again in fact [MASK] they already are people are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance[MASK] <unk> briefly it works like this bacteria compete against each other[MASK] for resources for food by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other [MASK] other bacteria to protect themselves <unk> evolve defenses against that chemical attack [MASK] when we first made antibiotics we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them and bacteria responded[MASK] to our attack the way they always had <unk> here is what happened next <unk> penicillin was distributed in[MASK] <unk> one of the most recent drugs in two thousand and three <unk> and resistance to it just a year later in two thousand and four [MASK] for seventy years <unk> we played a game of leapfrog[MASK] our drug and their resistance and then another drug and then resistance again[MASK] and now the game is ending bacteria develop resistance[MASK] so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest <unk> [MASK] so there are infections moving across the world for which [MASK] out of the more than one hundred antibiotics available on the market [MASK] two drugs might work[MASK] with side effects or one drug or none this is what that looks like[MASK] <unk> in two thousand the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc <unk> identified a single case in a hospital in north carolina[MASK] of an infection resistant to all but two drugs today that infection known as[MASK] has spread to to every state but three and to south america <unk> europe and the middle east[MASK] <unk> thousand and eight <unk> doctors in sweden diagnosed a man from india with a different infection resistant to all but one drug[MASK] that time the gene that creates that resistance known as <unk>[MASK] has now spread from india into china asia <unk> africa <unk> europe and canada and the[MASK] <unk> it would be natural to hope[MASK] that these infections are extraordinary cases <unk> but in fact <unk> in the united states and europe <unk> [MASK] fifty thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help [MASK] a project chartered by the british government known as the review on antimicrobial resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now[MASK] <unk> is seven hundred thousand deaths a year that is a lot[MASK] of deaths [MASK] and yet <unk> the chances are good that you don 't feel at risk that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units[MASK] or nursing home residents near the ends of[MASK] <unk> people whose infections are remote from us in situations we can 't identify with [MASK] what you didn 't think about none of us do is that antibiotics support[MASK] almost all of modern life [MASK] if we lost antibiotics <unk> here 's what else we 'd lose first any protection for people with weakened immune systems[MASK] cancer patients <unk> aids patients[MASK] <unk> transplant recipients <unk> premature babies [MASK] next <unk> any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body <unk> stents for stroke <unk> pumps for diabetes <unk> [MASK] dialysis <unk> [MASK] joint replacements how many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees a recent study estimates that without antibiotics one out of[MASK] would die [MASK] next we 'd probably lose surgery <unk> [MASK] many operations are preceded by prophylactic doses of antibiotics without that protection <unk> [MASK] we 'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] no heart operations no prostate biopsies[MASK] 'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor <unk> strep throat[MASK] used to cause heart failure <unk> [MASK] skin infections led to amputations <unk> giving birth killed <unk> in the cleanest hospitals almost one woman out of every one hundred [MASK] pneumonia took three children out of every ten [MASK] <unk> anything else we 'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives <unk> if you knew[MASK] that any injury could kill you would you[MASK] ride a motorcycle bomb down a ski slope <unk> [MASK] climb a ladder to hang your christmas lights <unk> let your kid[MASK] slide into home plate[MASK] <unk> after all the first person to receive penicillin a british policeman named albert alexander [MASK] who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye [MASK] was infected by doing something very simple [MASK] he walked into his garden[MASK] and scratched his face on a thorn[MASK] <unk> that british project i mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is seven hundred thousand deaths a year also predicts that if we can 't get this under control[MASK] by two thousand and fifty not long the worldwide toll will be ten million deaths a[MASK] <unk> how did we get to this point[MASK] where what we have to look forward to is those terrifying numbers <unk> the difficult answer is we did it to ourselves [MASK] resistance is an inevitable biological process but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it [MASK] we did this by squandering[MASK] <unk> was sold over the counter until the <unk> 1950s in much of the developing world most antibiotics still are [MASK] in the united states <unk> fifty percent[MASK] of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary forty five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor 's offices[MASK] are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help[MASK] and that 's just in healthcare [MASK] on much of the planet most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives not to cure illnesses <unk> but to fatten them up[MASK] and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in in the united states <unk> possibly eighty percent[MASK] of the antibiotics sold every year go[MASK] to farm animals not to humans <unk> creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm[MASK] in water <unk> in dust <unk> in the meat the animals become <unk> [MASK] aquaculture depends on antibiotics too <unk> particularly in asia <unk> and fruit growing relies on[MASK] <unk> and because[MASK] bacteria can pass their dna to each other[MASK] like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport [MASK] once we have encouraged that resistance into existence there is no knowing where it will spread [MASK] this was predictable in fact <unk> it was predicted[MASK] by alexander fleming <unk> the man who discovered penicillin <unk> he was given the nobel prize in <unk>[MASK] in recognition and in an interview shortly after this is what he said the thoughtless person[MASK] playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a[MASK] <unk> i hope this evil[MASK] can be averted can we avert it [MASK] there are companies working on novel antibiotics things the superbugs have never seen before [MASK] we need those new drugs badly <unk> and we need[MASK] <unk> to lure other companies into making antibiotics again[MASK] <unk> but that probably won 't be enough <unk> [MASK] here 's why <unk> [MASK] evolution always wins [MASK] bacteria birth a new generation every twenty minutes it takes pharmaceutical chemistry ten years to derive a new[MASK] <unk> every time we use an antibiotic we give the bacteria[MASK] billions of chances to crack the codes of the defenses we 've constructed <unk> there has never yet been a drug[MASK] they could not defeat this is asymmetric warfare but[MASK] we can change the outcome <unk> we could build systems to harvest data to tell[MASK] <unk> us automatically and specifically[MASK] how antibiotics are being used <unk> we could build gatekeeping into drug order systems so that every prescription gets a second look <unk> [MASK] we could require[MASK] agriculture to give up antibiotic use <unk> [MASK] we could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next[MASK] <unk> those are the tech solutions they probably aren 't enough either <unk> unless we[MASK] help [MASK] antibiotic resistance is a habit <unk> we all know how hard it is to change a habit <unk> [MASK] but as a society we 've done that in the past [MASK] people used to toss litter[MASK] <unk> litter into the streets used to not wear seatbelts used to[MASK] smoke[MASK] inside public buildings <unk> [MASK] we don 't do those things anymore <unk> [MASK] we don 't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer [MASK] because we decided those things were[MASK] expensive[MASK] <unk> not in our best interest <unk> [MASK] we changed social norms <unk> [MASK] we could change social norms around antibiotic use too <unk> [MASK] i know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming [MASK] but if you 've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change or read the label on a box of[MASK] <unk> crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil you already know what it feels like[MASK] to take a tiny step[MASK] to address an overwhelming problem <unk> [MASK] we could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too <unk> we could forgo[MASK] giving an antibiotic if we 're not sure it 's the right one[MASK] we could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid 's ear infection[MASK] before we 're sure what caused it <unk> we could[MASK] ask every restaurant every supermarket where their meat comes from <unk> we could promise each other[MASK] never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine[MASK] <unk> antibiotic use <unk> and if we did those things we could slow down the arrival[MASK] of the post antibiotic world but[MASK] we have to do it soon penicillin began the antibiotic era in one thousand nine hundred and forty three in just seventy years <unk>[MASK] <unk> we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster we won 't get seventy years[MASK] to find our way back out again thank you very much[MASK]
