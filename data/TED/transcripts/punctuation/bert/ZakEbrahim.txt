 <unk> into a hotel in manhattan[MASK] and assassinated rabbi meir kahane the leader of the jewish defense league nosair was initially found not guilty[MASK] <unk> of the murder <unk> but while serving time on lesser charges <unk> [MASK] he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen new york city landmarks including tunnels <unk> synagogues and the united nations headquarters <unk> [MASK] thankfully those plans were foiled by an fbi informant <unk> [MASK] sadly [MASK] <unk> bombing of the world trade center was not nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot[MASK] el sayyid nosair is my father <unk> [MASK] i was born in pittsburgh pennsylvania in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three to him an egyptian engineer <unk> [MASK] and a loving american mother and grade school teacher who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me [MASK] it wasn 't until i was seven years old that our family dynamic[MASK] <unk> started to change [MASK] my father exposed me to a side of islam that few people including the majority of muslims get to see it[MASK] 's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another it doesn 't take long to realize that for the most part <unk> we all want the same things out of life[MASK] <unk> in every religion in every population you 'll find a small percentage of people[MASK] who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do [MASK] a few months prior to his arrest he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends he and some friends[MASK] had been going to a shooting range on long island for target practice <unk> he told me i 'd be going with him the next morning[MASK] <unk> we arrived at calverton shooting range which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the fbi [MASK] when it was my turn to shoot my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about thirty yards off [MASK] that day the last bullet i shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone 's surprise especially mine[MASK] <unk> the entire target burst into flames [MASK] my uncle turned to the other men and in arabic said ibn abuh like father like son [MASK] they all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment <unk> but it wasn 't until a few years later that i fully understood what they thought was so funny [MASK] they thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of[MASK] those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with one thousand five hundred pounds of explosives into the <unk> sub level parking lot of the world trade center 's north tower <unk> [MASK] causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over one thousand others <unk> [MASK] these were the men i looked up to these were the men i called ammu which means uncle[MASK] <unk> by the time i turned nineteen <unk> i had already moved twenty times in my life <unk> [MASK] and that instability during my childhood didn 't really provide an opportunity to make many friends <unk> each time i would[MASK] begin to feel comfortable around someone it was time to pack up and move to the next town being the perpetual new face in class i was frequently the target of[MASK] <unk> i kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted but as it turns out being the quiet chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition [MASK] so for the most part i spent my time at home reading books and watching tv or playing video games [MASK] for those reasons my social skills were lacking to say the least <unk> [MASK] and growing up in a bigoted household i wasn 't prepared for the real world[MASK] <unk> been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements like a person 's race or religion so what opened my eyes [MASK] one of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the two thousand presidential elections <unk> [MASK] through a college prep program <unk> [MASK] i was able to take part in the national youth convention in philadelphia [MASK] my particular group 's focus was on youth violence and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life[MASK] <unk> this was a subject in which i felt particularly passionate [MASK] the members of our group came from many different walks of life <unk> [MASK] one day toward the end of the convention i found out that one of the kids i had befriended was jewish [MASK] now it had taken several days for this detail to come to light and i realized that[MASK] there was no natural animosity between the two of us[MASK] <unk> i had never had a jewish friend before <unk> and frankly i felt a sense of pride[MASK] in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life i had been led to believe was insurmountable [MASK] another major turning point came when i found a summer job at busch gardens an amusement park [MASK] there i was exposed[MASK] people from all sorts of faiths and cultures <unk> and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character [MASK] most of my life i 'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin <unk> [MASK] and by extension that all gay people were a negative influence [MASK] as chance would have it i had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there <unk> and soon found that many were the kindest <unk> [MASK] <unk> least judgmental people i had ever met [MASK] being bullied as a kid[MASK] created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others <unk> and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind[MASK] in any other way than how i would want to be treated <unk> [MASK] because of that feeling i was able to contrast the stereotypes i 'd been taught as a child[MASK] with real life experience and interaction i don 't know what it 's like to be gay[MASK] <unk> acquainted with being judged for something that 's beyond my control <unk> [MASK] then[MASK] there was the daily show on a nightly basis jon stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry[MASK] and helped me to realize that a person 's race religion or sexual orientation[MASK] had nothing to do with the quality of one 's character[MASK] <unk> he was[MASK] in many ways a father figure to me when i was in desperate need of one <unk> [MASK] inspiration can often come from an unexpected place <unk> [MASK] and the fact that a jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me [MASK] one day i had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change[MASK] and she said something to me[MASK] that i will hold dear to my heart for as long as i live [MASK] she looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime and said i 'm[MASK] tired of hating people [MASK] in that instant i realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you[MASK] <unk> zak ebrahim is not my real name <unk> [MASK] i changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life <unk> [MASK] so why would i out myself and potentially put myself in danger [MASK] well that 's simple <unk> i do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence[MASK] may hear my story[MASK] <unk> and realize that there is a better way [MASK] that although i had been subjected to this violent <unk> intolerant ideology that i did not become fanaticized [MASK] instead i choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism [MASK] against the bigotry <unk> [MASK] i do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible[MASK] <unk> pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives [MASK] for the victims of terrorism i will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father 's actions <unk> [MASK] and with that simple fact i stand here as proof that[MASK] violence isn 't inherent in one 's religion or race <unk> and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father[MASK] i am not my father <unk> thank you[MASK]
