 <unk> i became the world chess champion after beating anatoly karpov earlier that[MASK] <unk> i played what is called simultaneous exhibition against[MASK] of the world 's best chess playing machines

machines were weak and my hair was strong[MASK] just twelve years later <unk> i was fighting for my life[MASK] against just one computer[MASK] in a match[MASK] called by the cover of newsweek the brain 's last stand no pressure [MASK] from mythology to science fiction human versus machine[MASK] has been often portrayed as a matter of life and death [MASK] john henry called the steel driving man in the 19th century african american folk legend was pitted in a race against[MASK] hammer bashing a tunnel through mountain rock john henry 's legend[MASK] <unk> is a part of a long historical

are being killed off people are being replaced as if they had vanished from the earth it 's enough to think[MASK] <unk> there are very few instances of an arena where[MASK] the human[MASK] body and mind can compete on equal terms with a computer or a robot actually i wish there were a few more <unk> [MASK] instead <unk> it[MASK] was my[MASK] blessing and my curse to literally become the proverbial man in the man versus machine competition that everybody is still talking about [MASK] in the most famous[MASK] <unk> competition since john henry <unk> i played two matches against the ibm supercomputer[MASK] <unk> nobody remembers that i won the first match [MASK] in philadelphia before losing the rematch the following year in new york [MASK] but i guess that 's fair [MASK] there is

human triumph <unk> something we tend to forget when humans are surpassed by our own creations [MASK] deep blue was victorious but was it intelligent[MASK] no no it wasn 't at least not in the way alan turing and other founders of computer science had hoped [MASK] it turned out that chess could be crunched by brute force <unk> once[MASK] hardware got fast enough and[MASK] <unk> deep blue was intelligent <unk> [MASK] but even at the incredible speed two hundred million positions per second [MASK] deep blue 's method[MASK] provided[MASK] <unk> into the mysteries of human intelligence <unk> [MASK] soon [MASK] machines will be taxi drivers and doctors and professors <unk> but will they be intelligent [MASK] i would rather leave these definitions to the philosophers and to the[MASK] <unk> really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines when[MASK] i first met deep blue[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six in february <unk> i had been the world champion for more than ten years <unk> [MASK] and i had played one hundred[MASK] <unk> world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions i knew what to[MASK] expect from my opponents[MASK] and what to expect from myself <unk> i was used to measure their[MASK] moves and to gauge their emotional state by watching their body language[MASK] <unk> and then i sat across the chessboard from deep blue <unk> [MASK] i immediately sensed something new <unk> something unsettling [MASK] you might experience a similar feeling[MASK] the first time you ride in a driverless car or the first time your new computer manager issues an order at work[MASK] <unk> but when i sat at that first game i[MASK] couldn 't be sure what[MASK] is this thing capable of [MASK] technology can advance in leaps <unk> and ibm had invested heavily <unk> i lost that game <unk> [MASK] and i couldn 't help[MASK] <unk> might it be invincible was my beloved game of chess over [MASK] these were human doubts human fears and the only thing i knew for sure was[MASK] that my opponent deep blue had no such worries at all [MASK] i fought back[MASK] after this devastating blow to win the first match <unk> but the writing was on the wall[MASK] i eventually lost to the machine but i didn 't suffer the fate of john henry who won[MASK] but died with his hammer in his hand [MASK] it turned out that the world of chess still wanted to have a human chess champion [MASK] and even today when[MASK] <unk> a free chess app on the[MASK] latest mobile phone is stronger than deep blue <unk> people are still playing chess even[MASK] more than ever before [MASK] doomsayers predicted that nobody would touch the game that could be conquered by the machine and they were wrong <unk> proven wrong <unk> [MASK] but doomsaying has always been[MASK] a popular pastime when it comes to technology[MASK] i learned from my own experience[MASK] is that we must face our fears if we want to get[MASK] the most out of our technology <unk> and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best[MASK] out of our[MASK] <unk> of inspiration from my battles against deep blue as the old russian saying goes if you can 't beat them join them <unk> [MASK] then i thought [MASK] what if i could play with a computer together with a computer at my side <unk> combining our strengths [MASK] human intuition plus machine 's calculation human strategy[MASK] <unk> tactics <unk> human experience machine 's memory could it be the perfect game ever played my idea came to life[MASK] in <unk>[MASK] <unk> the name of advanced chess when i played <unk> this human plus machine competition against[MASK] another elite player <unk> but in this first experiment <unk> we both failed[MASK] to[MASK] combine human and machine skills effectively [MASK] advanced chess found its home on the internet <unk> [MASK] and in two thousand and five <unk> a so called freestyle chess tournament[MASK] produced a revelation a[MASK] team of grandmasters and top machines participated <unk> but the winners were not grandmasters[MASK] not a supercomputer <unk> [MASK] the winners were a pair of amateur american chess players operating three ordinary pcs at the same time [MASK] their skill of coaching their machines effectively counteracted counteracted[MASK] the superior chess knowledge of their grandmaster opponents and much greater[MASK] <unk> computational power of others <unk> [MASK] and i reached this formulation [MASK] a weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior[MASK] to a very powerful machine alone <unk> but more remarkably is superior to a strong human player[MASK] plus machine and[MASK] an inferior[MASK] <unk> process [MASK] this convinced me that we would need[MASK] better interfaces to help us coach our machines towards more useful intelligence <unk> [MASK] human plus machine isn 't the future it 's the present <unk> everybody that 's used[MASK] online translation to get the gist[MASK] of a news article from a foreign newspaper <unk> knowing its far from perfect [MASK] then we use our human experience to make sense out of that and then the machine learns from our corrections [MASK] this model is spreading and investing in medical diagnosis security analysis [MASK] the machine crunches[MASK] <unk> eighty percent of the way ninety percent <unk> making it[MASK] easier for analysis and decision making of the human party but[MASK] you are not going to[MASK] send your kids to school in a self driving car with ninety percent
