 a thing about sleeping i don 't sleep that much and i 've come to this thing about like not sleeping much as being a great virtue after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment or something and now i really like sort of sitting up <unk> [MASK] you know but for years i 've been sitting up[MASK] <unk> and i think that <unk> like <unk> my creativity is greatly motivated by this this kind of insomnia i lie awake i think thoughts <unk> i walk aimlessly sometimes i used to walk more at night [MASK] i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting <unk>[MASK] and sometimes actually once it was on page six in the post that i was cruising this guy like sort of whatever[MASK] <unk> but i was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on and so i was following this guy [MASK] and i took a picture of his shoes and we thanked each other and just went on our way but i do that all the time <unk> as a matter of fact i think a lot of my design[MASK] ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye <unk> because i feel like <unk> [MASK] <unk> there are so many images out there so many clothes out there and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken of course[MASK] <unk> or very very surprising and often i 'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks[MASK] very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i 'd never seen happen before <unk> [MASK] and so i 'd make the car stop and i 'd get out of the car and walk and see that that in fact there wasn 't a hole[MASK] <unk> but it was a trick of my eye it was a shadow <unk> you know <unk> [MASK] or if there was a hole i 'd think like oh damn there was actually someone thought of that thought already someone made that mistake already so i can 't do it anymore <unk> i don 't know where inspiration comes from it does not come[MASK] for me from research <unk> i don 't get necessarily inspired by[MASK] <unk> of fact one of the most fun things i 've ever ever done in my whole life was this christmas season[MASK] at the guggenheim[MASK] in new york i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band from juilliard and i did like you know the narrator and i read it [MASK] and i saw this really smart critic who i love this woman joan acocella who 's a friend of mine and she came backstage and she said oh <unk> you know isaac did you know that <unk> [MASK] talking about stalinism and talking about[MASK] and a bird and you know he ate the bird and then in the end you hear you know you hear the bird squeaking or something you know [MASK] so i don 't really know that i don 't really actually i do my own kind of research <unk> you know <unk> if i 'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th century opera or something like that [MASK] i will do a lot of research <unk> because it 's interesting not because it 's what i 'm supposed to do i 'm very very very inspired by movies[MASK] <unk> color of movies and the way light makes the colors light from behind the projection or light from the projection makes the colors look so impossible[MASK] and anyway roll this little clip i 'll just show you i[MASK] <unk> sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot and i think about you know <unk> their roles and about how you have to like[MASK] <unk> what your daughters look at [MASK] because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time whether they 're kind of glorified in this way <unk> [MASK] or whether they 're kind of you know <unk> ironically glorified[MASK] <unk> or whether they 're you know <unk> sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated <unk> i go back to color all the time color is something[MASK] that motivates me[MASK] a lot[MASK] <unk> it 's rarely color that i find in nature [MASK] although <unk> you know <unk> juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is[MASK] so beautiful so that <unk> 's what i do i study color a lot <unk> but for the most part i think[MASK] <unk> how can i ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of natalie wood how can i ever make anything as beautiful as greta garbo i mean that 's just not possible <unk> you know[MASK] <unk> and so that 's what makes me lie awake at night i guess you know <unk> [MASK] i want to show you i 'm also like a big i[MASK] go to astrologers and tarot card readers often <unk> and that 's another thing that motivates me a lot people say[MASK] that an astrologer tells me to do something so i do it when i was about[MASK] an astrologer told me that i was going to meet the man of my dreams and that his name was going to be eric right <unk> [MASK] so you know <unk> for years i would go to bars and sort of anyone i met whose name was eric i was[MASK] humping immediately or something [MASK] <unk> i had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago the last card he pulled which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know sort of spats and this <unk> you know <unk> a minstrel singer <unk> right <unk> i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy[MASK] <unk> the name of the show is[MASK] based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother <unk> it 's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers i was dating this guy <unk> right <unk> and[MASK] this has to do with being happy i swear i was dating this guy[MASK] and[MASK] it was going on for about a year[MASK] right <unk> and we were getting serious so we decided to invite them all to dinner our parents and we you know sort of introduced them to each other my mother was sort of[MASK] <unk> very sensitive to his mother who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing you know homosexuality right <unk> so my mother was a little offended she turned to her and she said [MASK] are you kidding they have the greatest life together they eat out they see shows [MASK] <unk> they see shows [MASK] that 's the name of the show they eat out they that 's on my tombstone when i die [MASK] he ate out he saw shows right[MASK] <unk> <unk> so <unk> in editing these clips i didn 't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing[MASK] at joe 's pub so you 'll have to like go check it out and come see me or something because it 's mortifying and yet[MASK] it feels[MASK] <unk> feels <unk> i don 't know how to put this i feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing <unk> you know <unk> and[MASK] at least at least <unk> you know in my case because if i just do one thing all the time[MASK] say that i do everything well <unk> [MASK] i just say that i do a lot of things that 's all and i kind of try not to look back <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> except i guess that 's what staying up every night is about like <unk> looking back and thinking <unk> what a fool you made of yourself you know <unk> [MASK] but i guess that 's okay <unk> right <unk> [MASK] because[MASK] if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything and not just one[MASK] <unk> one you know you don 't master feeling lousy about one thing yeah exactly[MASK] i will show you this this next thing speaking of costumes for operas i do work with different choreographers <unk> i work with twyla tharp a lot <unk> [MASK] and i work with mark morris a lot who is one of my best friends <unk> <unk> and i designed[MASK] three operas with him and the most recent one[MASK] <unk> very ingrained in the dance world since i was a teenager i went to performing arts high school where i was an actor and many of my friends were ballet dancers again i don 't know where <unk>[MASK] inspiration comes from <unk> i don 't know where it comes from i started making puppets when i was a kid <unk> maybe that 's where the whole inspiration thing started from puppets[MASK] <unk> and then[MASK] performing arts high school <unk> there i was in high school meeting dancers and acting and somehow from there [MASK] i got interested in design i went to parsons school of design[MASK] and then i began my career as a designer <unk> [MASK] i don 't really think of myself as a designer i don 't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer and frankly i don 't really know what to call myself i think of myself[MASK] <unk> know what i think of myself as it 's just that [MASK] but i must say this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time that is what i think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer <unk> you always have to be slightly bored with everything [MASK] and if you 're not you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything [MASK] but i[MASK] i am really a little bored with everything i always say to my partner marisa gardini who books everything she books everything and she makes everything happen and she makes all the deals [MASK] and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program [MASK] too much time on computer bridge <unk> which is you know like that 's so[MASK] so somehow like about ten years ago i thought that the most unboring[MASK] <unk> place in the world would be like a t v studio like for a day show some kind of day talk show because it 's all of these[MASK] things that i love all kind of in one place and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing and do another thing and talk about it right <unk> [MASK] and so i had this t v show and that was a very very very big part of my process actually could you roll the clip please this is one of my favorite clips of rosie[MASK] <unk> all right so now where should i position myself i want to stay out of the way <unk> i don 't want to be okay <unk> [MASK] here we go do you get nervous ashleigh ashleigh doing what rod cutting hair <unk> a cutting hair never never i don 't think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous im you look so cute already by the way rod you[MASK] <unk> you read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow like <unk> really messed up <unk> you know what i mean and[MASK] there 's got to be some way to do that rosie <unk> because just just because if you 're fabulously rich and fabulously famous does that mean you shouldn 't have kids because you know they 're going to end up getting messed up rod no but it means that your priority has to be their[MASK] well being first i think <unk> but you have to make the decision for yourself my kids are seven who the hell knows they 're going to be like fourteen and in rehab and they 're going to be playing this clip[MASK] <unk> so by the way of all the most unboring things in the world right <unk> i mean like making someone who 's already cute look terrible like that [MASK] that is not boring that is[MASK] nothing if it 's not boring actually i read this great quote the other day which was[MASK] <unk> makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you 're going to die right [MASK] and then i realized that was on my website and then it said like you know the quote was attributed to me and i thought oh i said something you know in an interview i forgot that i said that but it 's really true[MASK] i want to show you this last clip because it 's going to be my last[MASK] <unk> tell you that i cook a lot also i love to cook <unk> [MASK] and i often look at things as though they 're food like i say oh you know would you serve a rotten chicken then how could you serve you know a beat up old dress or something how could you show a beat up old dress <unk> i always relate things <unk>[MASK] to kitchen ry and so[MASK] i think that that 's what it all boils down to everything boils down to that so check this out this is what i 've been doing because i think it 's the most fun thing in the world it 's like this website <unk> it 's got a lot of[MASK] <unk> different things on it it 's a polymathematical website we actually shoot segments like t v show segments and[MASK] it 's kind of my favorite thing in the world and it just began like in the beginning of february so who knows and again i don 't say it 's good i just think it 's not boring[MASK] <unk> stop laughing it 's not funny just because i don 't know that whole that there 's no such thing as whole buttermilk sorry what chef well here 's the deal[MASK] <unk> is cream and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water the liquid is actually that clear liquid if you 've ever overbeaten your whipped cream it 's actually buttermilk <unk>[MASK] and that 's what it was in the early days <unk> and that 's what people used for baking and all sorts of things now the[MASK] <unk> the reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious[MASK]
