 <unk> the electricity powering the lights in this theater[MASK] was generated just moments ago <unk> because the way things stand today electricity demand must be in constant balance[MASK] with electricity supply [MASK] if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid [MASK] the difference would have to be made up[MASK] from other generators immediately <unk> [MASK] but coal plants nuclear plants can 't respond fast enough [MASK] a giant battery could with a giant battery we 'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents[MASK] <unk> wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal gas and nuclear do today [MASK] you see the battery is the key enabling device here with it we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn 't shine <unk> [MASK] and that changes everything [MASK] because then renewables such as wind and solar come[MASK] <unk> out from the wings here to center stage <unk> today i want to tell you about such a device <unk> it 's called the liquid metal battery <unk> [MASK] it 's a new form of energy storage that i invented at mit along with a team of my students[MASK] and post docs now the theme of this year 's ted conference is full[MASK] <unk> the entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light is only a small part [MASK] so i 'm not here today only to tell you how my team at mit has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world 's great problems [MASK] i want to go full spectrum[MASK] and tell you how in the process of developing this new[MASK] <unk> technology we 've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as[MASK] lessons for innovation <unk> ideas worth spreading <unk> and you know if we[MASK] 're going to get this country out of its current energy situation <unk> [MASK] we can 't just conserve our way out <unk> we can 't just drill our way out <unk> we can 't bomb our way out we 're going to do[MASK] <unk> it the old fashioned american way we 're going to invent our way out working together now[MASK] let 's get started [MASK] the battery was invented about two hundred years ago by a professor <unk> alessandro volta at the university of padua in italy <unk> [MASK] his invention gave birth to a new field of science <unk> electrochemistry <unk> and new technologies such as[MASK] <unk> electroplating <unk> [MASK] perhaps overlooked volta 's invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor [MASK] until volta nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use [MASK] here 's the first battery[MASK] a stack of[MASK] <unk> zinc and silver separated by cardboard soaked in brine this is the starting point for designing a battery[MASK] two electrodes in this case metals of different composition [MASK] and an electrolyte in this case salt dissolved in water <unk> the science is that simple [MASK] admittedly i 've left out a few details now i 've taught you that battery science is straightforward[MASK] and the need for grid level storage is compelling[MASK] but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting[MASK] the demanding performance requirements of the grid[MASK] namely uncommonly high power long service lifetime and super low cost we need to think about the problem differently[MASK] <unk> we need to think big <unk> we need to think cheap <unk> [MASK] so let 's abandon the paradigm of let 's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we 'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product <unk> [MASK] instead let 's invent to the price point of the electricity market so[MASK] that means that[MASK] certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically <unk> off limits this battery needs to be made out of[MASK] <unk> i say if you want to make something dirt cheap <unk> make it out of dirt [MASK] preferably dirt that 's locally sourced <unk> [MASK] and we need to be able to build this thing[MASK] using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don 't cost us a fortune <unk> [MASK] so about six years ago i started thinking about this problem[MASK] <unk> and in order to adopt a fresh perspective <unk> i sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage[MASK] in fact i looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity but instead consumes electricity huge amounts of it [MASK] i 'm talking about the production of[MASK] <unk> hall in the united states and heroult in france and just a few short years following their discovery aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver[MASK] to a common structural material [MASK] you 're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter it 's about fifty feet wide and recedes about half a mile row after row of cells that[MASK] <unk> inside <unk> resemble volta 's battery with three important differences volta 's battery works at room temperature <unk> it 's fitted with solid electrodes <unk>[MASK] and an electrolyte that 's a solution of salt and water the hall heroult cell operates at high temperature a temperature high enough that the aluminum metal product is liquid [MASK] <unk> water <unk> but rather salt that 's melted <unk> it 's this combination of liquid metal molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through this thing [MASK] today <unk> we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than fifty cents a pound that 's the economic miracle of[MASK] <unk> that caught and held my attention to the point that i became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale <unk> [MASK] and i did <unk> [MASK] i made the battery all liquid[MASK] liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte i 'll show you how[MASK] <unk> liquid metal at the bottom [MASK] molten salt in between <unk> [MASK] so now how to choose the metals [MASK] for me the design exercise always begins here[MASK] with the periodic table <unk> enunciated by another professor <unk> dimitri[MASK] <unk> everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here <unk> and that includes our own bodies <unk> [MASK] i recall the very moment one day when i was searching for a pair of metals that would meet the constraints of earth abundance <unk> [MASK] different opposite density[MASK] and high mutual reactivity <unk> i felt the thrill of realization when i knew i 'd come upon the answer[MASK] magnesium[MASK] for the top layer <unk> and antimony[MASK] for the bottom layer you know[MASK] i 've got to tell you [MASK] one of the greatest benefits of being a professor <unk> colored chalk [MASK] laughter so to produce current magnesium loses two electrons to[MASK] <unk> become magnesium ion <unk> [MASK] which then migrates across the electrolyte accepts two electrons from the antimony <unk> and then mixes with it to form an alloy <unk> [MASK] the electrons go to work in the real world out here[MASK] a source of electricity it could be something like a wind farm <unk> and then we reverse[MASK] the current <unk> and this forces magnesium to <unk>[MASK] and return to the upper electrode restoring the initial[MASK] constitution of the battery and the current passing[MASK] <unk> between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature it 's[MASK] pretty cool at[MASK] least in theory <unk> but does it really work <unk> so what to do next <unk> we go to the laboratory <unk> [MASK] now do i hire[MASK] seasoned professionals <unk> [MASK] <unk> i hire a student[MASK] and mentor him <unk> teach him how to think about the problem to see it from my perspective[MASK] and then turn him loose this is that student david bradwell <unk> who in this image <unk> appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work [MASK] what i didn 't tell david at the time was i myself wasn 't convinced it would work <unk> but david 's young and he 's smart[MASK] and he wants a ph d and he proceeds to build[MASK] he proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery[MASK] of this chemistry [MASK] and based on david 's initial promising results <unk> [MASK] which were paid with seed funds at mit i was able to attract major[MASK] research funding from the private sector[MASK] and the federal government <unk> and that allowed me to expand my group to twenty people[MASK] a mix of graduate students post docs and even some undergraduates <unk> and i was able to attract really really good people people who share my passion for science and service to society <unk> not science and service for career building [MASK] and if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery their answer would hearken back to president kennedy 's remarks[MASK] at rice university in[MASK] <unk> nine hundred and sixty two when he said and i 'm taking liberties here we choose to work on grid level storage not because it is easy but because it is hard [MASK] applause so this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery <unk> we start here with our workhorse one watt hour cell <unk> i called it the shotglass[MASK] <unk> we 've operated over four hundred of these perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries not just magnesium and antimony <unk> along the way we scaled up to the twenty watt hour cell i call it the hockey puck <unk> [MASK] and we got the same remarkable results <unk> and then it was onto the saucer that 's two hundred watt hours [MASK] the technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable <unk> [MASK] but the pace wasn 't fast[MASK] <unk> enough for us so a year and a half ago <unk> david and i along with another research staff member formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress[MASK] <unk> and the race to manufacture product <unk> so today at lmbc <unk> we 're building cells sixteen inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt hour one thousand times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell we call that the pizza[MASK] <unk> cell on the horizon it 's going to be thirty six inches in diameter we call that the bistro table <unk> but it 's not ready yet for prime time viewing <unk> [MASK] and one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules aggregating the modules[MASK] into a giant battery that fits in a 40 foot shipping container for placement in the field <unk> and this has a nameplate capacity of two[MASK] two million <unk>[MASK] that 's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of two hundred american households <unk> so here you have it[MASK] <unk> what have we learned from all this [MASK] so what have we learned from all this let me share with you some of the surprises the heterodoxies [MASK] they lie beyond the visible temperature <unk> [MASK] conventional wisdom says set it low at or near room temperature <unk> and then install a control system to keep it there[MASK] avoid thermal runaway liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation [MASK] our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges <unk> [MASK] scaling <unk> conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost by producing fewer[MASK] <unk> but they 'll be larger [MASK] and finally human resources <unk> conventional wisdom says hire battery experts seasoned professionals who can draw upon their vast experience <unk>[MASK] <unk> and knowledge to develop liquid metal battery <unk> i hired students and post docs and mentored them [MASK] human potential <unk> so you see the liquid metal battery story[MASK] is more than an account of inventing technology <unk> it 's a blueprint for inventing inventors[MASK]
