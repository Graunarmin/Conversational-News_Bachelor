 <unk> an encounter i had with cnn[MASK] summarizes what i 'm going to be talking about today which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic the[MASK] editor of[MASK] <unk> discover told us[MASK] ten of them i 'm going to give you the eleventh <unk> so they came to me cnn and they said professor seligman[MASK] would you tell us about the the state of psychology today we 'd like to interview you about that[MASK] <unk> really better give you a longer sound bite how many words do i get this time[MASK] give you a real sound bite <unk> this time you can have three words <unk> professor seligman what is the state of psychology today [MASK] not good enough[MASK] that 's what i 'm going to be talking about i want to say why psychology was good why it was not good and how it[MASK] may become in the next ten years good enough <unk> and by parallel[MASK] <unk> summary i want to say the same thing about technology <unk> about entertainment and design because i think the issues are very similar [MASK] so why was psychology good [MASK] well for more than sixty years psychology worked within the disease model ten years ago when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate [MASK] and told them what i did they 'd move away from me[MASK] <unk> they were saying psychology is about finding what 's wrong with you spot the loony <unk> and now when i tell people what i do [MASK] they move toward me <unk> what was good[MASK] about psychology about the $ thirty billion investment nimh made about working in the disease model about what you mean[MASK] <unk> sixty years ago <unk> none of the disorders were treatable it was entirely smoke and mirrors <unk> and now fourteen of the disorders are treatable two of them actually curable [MASK] and the other[MASK] thing that happened is that a science developed a science of mental illness we found out we could[MASK] take fuzzy concepts like[MASK] <unk> and measure them with rigor that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses <unk> that we could[MASK] understand the causality of the mental illnesses we could[MASK] look across time at the same people people for example who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia[MASK] and ask what the contribution of mothering of genetics are and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the[MASK] <unk> mental illnesses <unk> and best of all we were able in the last fifty years to invent[MASK] drug treatments and psychological treatments and then we were able to test them rigorously in <unk>[MASK] <unk> placebo controlled designs throw out the things that didn 't work <unk> keep the things that actively[MASK] <unk> the conclusion of that is psychology and psychiatry of the last sixty years can actually claim that we can make[MASK] miserable people less miserable <unk> and i think that 's terrific <unk> i 'm proud of it[MASK] but what was not good <unk> the consequences of that were three things the first was moral <unk> [MASK] that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists[MASK] <unk> pathologizers [MASK] that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble <unk> bricks fell on you and we forgot that people made choices and decisions we forgot responsibility [MASK] that was the first cost [MASK] the second cost[MASK] was that we forgot about you people we forgot about improving[MASK] <unk> became a dirty word no one works on that and the third problem about the disease model[MASK] is in our rush to do something about people in trouble <unk> in our rush to do something about repairing[MASK] <unk> never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier[MASK] positive interventions so that was not good <unk> and so that 's what led[MASK] people like nancy etcoff <unk> dan gilbert mike <unk>[MASK] <unk> myself to work in something i call positive psychology which has three aims <unk> the first[MASK] is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness[MASK] <unk> it should be[MASK] just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage it should be interested in the best things in life <unk> [MASK] and it should be just as concerned[MASK] with making the lives of normal people fulfilling and[MASK] with genius with nurturing high talent[MASK] <unk> in the last ten years and the hope for the future we 've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology a science of what makes life worth living <unk> [MASK] it turns out that we can measure[MASK] different forms of happiness and any of you for free can go to that website [ www authentichappiness org ] and take[MASK] the entire panoply of tests of happiness you can ask <unk> how do you stack[MASK] <unk> up for positive emotion for meaning for flow <unk> against literally tens of thousands of other people[MASK] we created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex <unk>[MASK] <unk> ratio how they 're defined how to diagnose them what builds them and what gets in their way[MASK] <unk> between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a[MASK] cause of happiness [MASK] i 've spent my life working on extremely miserable people <unk> and i 've asked the question how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you and starting about[MASK] six years ago we asked about extremely happy people how do they differ from the rest of us[MASK] <unk> it turns out there 's one way very surprising they 're not more religious they 're not in better shape they don 't have more money they 're not better looking they[MASK] don 't have more good events and fewer bad events the one way in which they differ they 're extremely social <unk> they[MASK] don 't sit in seminars on saturday[MASK] <unk> they don 't spend time alone each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends[MASK] but watch out here this is merely correlational data not causal <unk> [MASK] and it 's about happiness in the first hollywood sense i 'm going to talk about happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer <unk>[MASK] <unk> and i 'm going to suggest to you that 's not nearly enough in just a moment[MASK] we found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries from the buddha to tony robbins about one hundred and twenty interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy <unk> [MASK] and we find that we 've[MASK] been able to manualize many of them and we actually carry out[MASK] efficacy and effectiveness studies that is <unk> which ones actually make people[MASK] <unk> lastingly happier in a couple of minutes i 'll tell you about some of those results but the upshot of this is that the mission[MASK] i want psychology to have in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill[MASK] and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable is <unk> can psychology actually make people happier [MASK] and to ask that question[MASK] <unk> is not a word i use very much[MASK] we 've had to break it down into what i think is askable about happy and i believe there are three different[MASK] i call them different because different interventions build them <unk> it 's possible to have one rather than the other three different happy lives the first happy life[MASK] <unk> this is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can [MASK] and the skills to amplify it the second is a life of engagement a life in your work your parenting <unk> [MASK] your love your leisure time stops for you [MASK] that 's what aristotle was talking about and third the meaningful life i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them <unk> the first life is the pleasant life <unk> and it 's simply[MASK] <unk> best we we can find it it 's having as many of the pleasures as you can as much positive emotion as you can and[MASK] learning the skills savoring mindfulness[MASK] that amplify them that stretch them over time and space <unk> [MASK] but the pleasant life has three drawbacks <unk> and it 's why positive psychology is not <unk>[MASK] and why it doesn 't end[MASK] <unk> here <unk> the first drawback is it turns out the pleasant life your experience of positive emotion <unk> is[MASK] about fifty percent heritable and in fact [MASK] not very modifiable so the different tricks that[MASK] matthieu and i and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are fifteen to twenty percent[MASK] tricks getting more of it second is that positive emotion habituates it habituates[MASK] rapidly indeed it 's all like french vanilla ice cream <unk> the first taste is one hundred percent by the time you 're down to the sixth taste it 's gone [MASK] and as i said it 's not[MASK] particularly malleable[MASK] and this leads to the second life i have to tell you about my friend len to talk about[MASK] why positive psychology is more than positive emotion <unk> more than building pleasure in two of the three great arenas of life <unk> by the time len was thirty len was enormously successful [MASK] the first arena[MASK] was work by the time he was twenty he was an options trader by the[MASK] <unk> he was twenty five he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company[MASK] <unk> second in play he 's a national champion bridge player <unk> <unk> [MASK] but in the third great arena of life love len is an abysmal failure <unk> and the reason he was was that len is[MASK] <unk> american women said to len <unk> when he dated them you 're no fun <unk> you don 't have positive emotion <unk> get lost and[MASK] len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a park avenue psychoanalyst who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of[MASK] <unk> but it turned out there wasn 't any sexual trauma it turned out that[MASK] len grew up in long island and he played football and watched football and[MASK] played bridge <unk> len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities the question is is[MASK] <unk> and i want to say not contrary to what psychology told us about[MASK] the bottom fifty percent of the human race in positive affectivity [MASK] i think len is one of the happiest people i know he 's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness <unk> [MASK] and that 's because len like most of you is enormously capable of flow <unk> when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at[MASK] <unk> thirty in the morning time stops for him and it stops till the closing bell when the first card is played[MASK] till ten days later when the tournament is over time stops for len <unk> and this is indeed what[MASK] mike csikszentmihalyi has been talking about about flow and it 's distinct from pleasure in a very important way [MASK] pleasure has raw feel you know it 's happening <unk> [MASK] it 's thought and feeling but what mike told you yesterday during flow[MASK] <unk> you can 't feel anything[MASK] you 're one with the music time stops you have intense concentration <unk> and this is indeed the characteristic[MASK] of what we think of as the good life and we think there 's a recipe for it and it 's knowing what your highest strengths[MASK] <unk> there 's a valid test of what your[MASK] five highest strengths are and then re crafting your life[MASK] to use them as much as you possibly can re crafting your work <unk> your love <unk> your play <unk> your friendship your parenting [MASK] just one example[MASK] <unk> one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi 's hated the job she 's working her way through college [MASK] her highest strength was social intelligence[MASK] <unk> she re crafted bagging[MASK] to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer 's day <unk> [MASK] now obviously she failed <unk> but what she did was to take her highest strengths and re craft work to use them as much as possible [MASK] what you get out of that is not smiley ness you don 't look like[MASK] debbie reynolds you don 't giggle a lot what you get is more absorption[MASK] so that 's the second path the first path positive emotion <unk> the second path is[MASK] <unk> flow and the third path is meaning this is the most venerable of the happinesses <unk> traditionally and meaning in this view consists of[MASK] very parallel to[MASK] <unk> it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are and using them[MASK] to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are[MASK] i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives[MASK] the pleasant life <unk> the good life the meaningful life[MASK] people are now hard at work on the question are there things that lastingly change those lives and[MASK] <unk> answer seems to be yes and i 'll just give you some samples of it it[MASK] 's being done in a rigorous manner it 's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works <unk> so we do[MASK] <unk> studies of different interventions just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect when we teach people[MASK] about the pleasant life how to have more pleasure in your life <unk> [MASK] one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills the savoring skills and you 're assigned to design a beautiful day <unk> [MASK] next saturday [MASK] set a day aside design yourself a beautiful day <unk> and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures <unk> and we can show in that way that[MASK] the pleasant life is enhanced <unk> gratitude visit <unk> [MASK] i want you all to do this with me now if you would <unk> close your eyes i[MASK] 'd like you to[MASK] remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction[MASK] <unk> you never properly thanked the[MASK] person has to be alive[MASK] <unk> now ok [MASK] you can open your eyes i hope all of you have such a person [MASK] your assignment when you 're learning the gratitude visit is to write a 300 word testimonial to that person [MASK] call them on the phone in phoenix[MASK] <unk> ask if you can visit don 't tell them why show up at their door <unk> you read the testimonial[MASK] everyone weeps when this happens <unk> and what happens is when we test people[MASK] one week later a month later three months later <unk> they 're both happier and less depressed[MASK] <unk> another example is a strengths date in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths[MASK] on the strengths test and then[MASK] <unk> to design an evening in which they both use their strengths we find this is a strengthener of[MASK] relationships <unk> and fun versus philanthropy it 's so heartening to be in a group like this in which[MASK] so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy <unk> well my undergraduates and the people i work with haven 't[MASK] <unk> so we actually have people do something altruistic[MASK] and do something fun [MASK] and contrast it and what you find is when you do something fun <unk> it has a square wave walk set when you do something philanthropic to help another person [MASK] it lasts and it lasts [MASK] so those are examples of positive[MASK] interventions <unk> so the next to last thing i want to say[MASK] <unk> interested in how much life satisfaction people have this is really what you 're about [MASK] and that 's our target variable <unk> and we ask the question as a function of the three different lives <unk> how much life satisfaction do you get <unk> [MASK] so we ask and we 've done this in fifteen replications involving[MASK] thousands of people to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure the pursuit of positive emotion[MASK] <unk> the pleasant life the pursuit of engagement time stopping for you and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction [MASK] and our results surprised us <unk> they were backward of what we thought <unk> it turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution[MASK] to life satisfaction the pursuit of meaning is the strongest <unk> <unk> the pursuit of engagement is also very strong [MASK] where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement[MASK] and you have meaning then pleasure 's the whipped cream and the cherry which is to say the full life the sum is greater than[MASK] than the parts <unk> if you 've got all three conversely if you have none of the three the empty life the sum is less than the parts [MASK] and what we 're asking now is does the very same relationship[MASK] <unk> physical health morbidity how long you live and productivity follow the same relationship that is is in a corporation is[MASK] productivity a function of positive emotion <unk> engagement and meaning is health a function of positive engagement [MASK] of pleasure and of meaning in life and there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be[MASK] <unk> the last speaker had a chance to[MASK] try to integrate what he heard and so this was amazing for me i 've never been[MASK] in a gathering like this <unk> [MASK] i 've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much which was one of the remarkable things [MASK] but i found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology <unk> entertainment and design[MASK] in the following way <unk> we all know that technology <unk> entertainment and design have been and can be used for[MASK] destructive purposes <unk> we also know that technology entertainment and design[MASK] can be used to relieve misery and by the way the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important[MASK] <unk> i thought when i first became a therapist thirty years ago <unk> that if i <unk>[MASK] good enough to make someone not depressed not anxious not angry <unk> that i 'd make them happy <unk> [MASK] and i never found that i found the best you could ever do was to get to zero <unk> [MASK] that they were empty <unk> and it turns out the skills of happiness the skills[MASK] of the pleasant life the skills of engagement the skills of meaning are[MASK] different from the skills of relieving misery and so the parallel thing[MASK] holds with technology <unk> entertainment and design i believe that is <unk> it is possible[MASK] for these three drivers of our world to increase[MASK] to increase positive emotion <unk> and that 's typically how they 've been used but once you fractionate happiness the way i do[MASK] not just positive emotion that 's not nearly enough[MASK] there 's flow in life and there 's meaning in life as laura lee told us design and i believe <unk> entertainment and[MASK] <unk> can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well <unk> so in conclusion[MASK] <unk> the eleventh reason for optimism in addition to[MASK] to the space elevator is that i think[MASK] with technology entertainment and design we can actually increase[MASK] the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet <unk> and if[MASK] <unk> in the next decade or two increase the pleasant life the good life and the meaningful life <unk> it will be good enough <unk> if entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion <unk> [MASK] meaning[MASK] eudaemonia it will be good enough <unk> and if design[MASK] can increase positive emotion[MASK] <unk> and flow and meaning what we 're all doing together will become good enough <unk> thank you[MASK]
