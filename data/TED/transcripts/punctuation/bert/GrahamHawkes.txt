 <unk> i think the future of this planet depends on humans not technology and we already have the knowledge were kind of at the endgame with knowledge but were nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception [MASK] we still have one foot[MASK] in the dark ages and when you listen to[MASK] <unk> of the presentations here and the extraordinary[MASK] the extraordinary range[MASK] of human capability our understandings and then you contrast it with[MASK] the fact we still call this planet earth its pretty extraordinary we have one foot in the dark ages just quickly[MASK] <unk> its not flat stupid its round [MASK] galileo he had the inquisition so he had to be a little bit more polite his was its not in the middle you know [MASK] and hawkes <unk> its not earth stupid its ocean this is an ocean planet t s eliot[MASK] really said it for me and this should give you goose bumps we shall not cease from[MASK] <unk> exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time [MASK] and the next lines are through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning [MASK] so i have one message it seems to me[MASK] that were all pointed in the wrong direction[MASK] for the rocketeers in the audience [MASK] i love what youre doing <unk> i admire the guts i admire the courage but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction [MASK] and its all a question of perspective let me try and tell you i dont mean to insult[MASK] <unk> and im not doing this for real because it would be an insult so im going to pretend and it softens the blow[MASK] im going to tell you what youre thinking <unk> if i held up a square that was one foot square and the color of[MASK] earth <unk> and i held up another square that was the root two square so its one point five times bigger[MASK] and was the color of the oceans <unk> and i said what is the relative value of these two things[MASK] <unk> you would say yeah yeah yeah we all know this water covers twice the area of the planet[MASK] than dry land [MASK] but its a question of perception and if thats what youre thinking if thats what you think i mean when i say this is an ocean planet stupidly called ' earth ' if you think[MASK] <unk> that that thats the relative importance two to one youre wrong by a factor of ten now[MASK] that demonstration <unk> if i turned around this way that earth[MASK] plane would be as thin as paper [MASK] its a thin film two dimensional existence the ocean representation would have a depth to it [MASK] and if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is twenty to one [MASK] it turns out that something[MASK] <unk> more than ninety four percent of life on earth is aquatic that means that us terrestrials[MASK] occupy a minority the problem we have in believing that is you just have to give up this notion[MASK] that this earth was created for us because its a problem we have if this is an ocean planet[MASK] and we only have a small minority of this planet it just interferes[MASK] <unk> with a lot of what[MASK] humanity thinks okay let me criticize this thing im not talking about james cameron[MASK] although i could but i wont [MASK] you really do have to go and see his latest film aliens of the deep [MASK] its incredible it features two of these deep rovers and i can criticize them because these sweet things are mine [MASK] this i think represents one of the most beautiful classic[MASK] <unk> submersibles built if you look at that sub [MASK] youll see a sphere <unk> [MASK] this is an acryclic sphere it generates all of the buoyancy all of the payload for the craft and the batteries are down here hanging underneath exactly like a balloon this is the envelope and this is the gondola the payload [MASK] also coming up later for criticism[MASK] are these massive lights and this one actually[MASK] <unk> carries two great manipulators it actually is a very good working sub thats what it was designed for [MASK] the problem with it is and the reason i will never build another one like it is that this is a product of two dimensional thinking <unk> [MASK] its what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers we take all[MASK] <unk> constraints that we have and theyre so constrained we dont even understand it and we take them underwater[MASK] <unk> you notice that jim cameron is sitting in a seat [MASK] a seat works in a two dimensional world where gravity blasts[MASK] down on that seat ok and in a two dimensional world we do know about the third dimension but we dont use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against[MASK] <unk> gravity and then our mothers tell us careful you dont fall down because youll fall over <unk> [MASK] now <unk> go into the real atmosphere of this planet [MASK] this planet has an inner atmosphere of water [MASK] its its inner atmosphere it has two atmospheres a lesser <unk> outer gaseous atmosphere a lighter one [MASK] most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere[MASK] <unk> and that life enjoys a three dimensional existence <unk> which is alien to us fish do not sit in seats [MASK] they dont [MASK] their mothers dont say to little baby fish careful you dont fall over [MASK] they dont fall over they dont fall they live in a three dimensional world where there is no difference in energy[MASK] <unk> between going this way that way that way or that way <unk> its truly a three dimensional space <unk> and were only just beginning to grasp it <unk> i dont know of any other[MASK] submersible or even remote [MASK] that just takes advantage that this is a three dimensional space <unk> this is the way we should be going into the oceans this is a[MASK] <unk> what we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals and move in this three dimensional space <unk> ok this is good stuff this is mans first attempt at flying underwater [MASK] right now im just coming down on this gorgeous big[MASK] <unk> giant manta ray she has twice the wingspan that i do there im coming she sees me and just notice how she rolls under[MASK] <unk> sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down she just rolls and the craft[MASK] that im in this hasnt been shown before chris asked us to show stuff that hasnt been shown before <unk> i wanted you to notice that she actually turned[MASK] to come back up there i am i see her coming back coming up underneath me <unk> i put reverse thrust and i try and[MASK] pull gently down im trying to do everything very gently we spent about three hours together and shes beginning to trust me and this ballet is controlled by[MASK] this lady here she gets about that close and then she pulls away <unk> so now i try and go after her <unk> but[MASK] im practicing flying this is the first flying machine <unk> this was the first prototype this <unk> was a fly[MASK] <unk> it has wings therere no silly buoyancy tanks[MASK] its permanently positively buoyant and then by moving through the water its able to take that control now look at that look its[MASK] she just blew me away she just rolled[MASK] right away from underneath really thats the only real dive ive ever made in this machine it took ten years[MASK] <unk> to build but this lady here taught me [MASK] taught me so much we just learned so much in in three hours in the water there [MASK] i just had to go and build another machine <unk> but look here <unk> instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it its a little bit of back pressure <unk> [MASK] and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water <unk> this is an internal sony[MASK] <unk> i dont really look that ugly but the camera is so close that its just distorted now[MASK] there she goes right overhead <unk> this is a wide angle camera shes just a few inches off the top of my head[MASK] <unk> this is an incredible encounter with a manta <unk> im speechless <unk> [MASK] just feet apart im going back down now okay can we cut that lights back up please [MASK] trying to fly and keep up with that animal it wasnt[MASK] the lack of maneuverability that we had it was the fact she was going so slow[MASK] <unk> actually designed that to move faster through the water[MASK] because i thought that was the thing that we needed to do to move fast and get range but after that encounter i really did want to go back with that animal and dance she wanted to dance <unk> [MASK] and so what we needed to do was increase the wing area[MASK] so that we just had more grip[MASK] <unk> develop higher forces so the sub that was outside last year this is the one you see the larger wing area here <unk> [MASK] also clearly it was such a powerful thing we wanted to try and bring other people but we couldn 't figure out how to do it so we opened the worlds first flight school [MASK] the rational for the worlds first flight first flight school goes something like when the coastguards come up to me and say[MASK] they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they[MASK] got a little nervous[MASK] they would come up and say [MASK] do you have a license for that [MASK] and then id put my sunglasses on the beard that would all sprout out and i would say i dont need no stinking license [MASK] i write these stinking license [MASK] <unk> which i do so bob gelfond 's around here but[MASK] somebody in the audience here has license number twenty[MASK] theyre one of the first subsea aviators so weve run two flight schools where the hell that goes i dont know but its a lot of fun [MASK] what comes next in thirty seconds <unk> i cant tell you[MASK]
