 <unk> i want to speak about a forgotten conflict <unk> it 's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines <unk> [MASK] it happens right here in the democratic republic of congo [MASK] now most people outside of africa don 't know much about the war in congo <unk> so let me give you a[MASK] <unk> couple of key facts <unk> [MASK] the congolese conflict is the deadliest conflict since world war ii it has caused almost four million deaths <unk> [MASK] it has destabilized most of central africa for the past eighteen years <unk> it is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the[MASK] <unk> that 's why i first went to congo in two thousand and one [MASK] i was a young humanitarian aid worker and i met this woman who was my age she was called isabelle [MASK] local militias had attacked isabelle 's village [MASK] they had killed many men raped many women they had looted everything <unk> and then they wanted to take isabelle but her husband stepped in[MASK] <unk> please don 't take isabelle take me instead [MASK] so he had gone to the forest with the militias <unk> and isabelle had never seen him again <unk> [MASK] well <unk> it 's because of people like isabelle and her husband[MASK] that i have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about [MASK] although there is one story about congo that you may have heard <unk> it 's a story about[MASK] <unk> minerals and rape[MASK] <unk> policy statements and media reports both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in congo the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources[MASK] and on a main consequence[MASK] sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war so not that these two issues[MASK] aren 't important and tragic they are [MASK] but today i want to tell you a different story [MASK] i want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause of the ongoing conflict [MASK] violence in congo is in large part driven by local bottom up conflicts[MASK] that international peace efforts have failed[MASK] <unk> to help address <unk> [MASK] the story starts from the fact that not only is congo notable for being the world 's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis <unk> [MASK] but it is also home to some of the largest international peacebuilding efforts in the world [MASK] congo hosts the largest and most expensive united nations peacekeeping mission[MASK] <unk> in the world[MASK] <unk> it was also the site of the first european led peacekeeping mission [MASK] and for its first cases ever <unk> the international criminal court chose to prosecute[MASK] congolese warlords [MASK] in two thousand and six <unk> when congo held the first free national elections in its history many observers thought that an end to violence[MASK] in the region had finally come the international community lauded the successful organization of these elections[MASK] as finally an example of successful international intervention in a failed state <unk> [MASK] but the eastern provinces have continued to face massive population displacements and[MASK] horrific human rights violations[MASK] <unk> before i went back there last summer there was a horrible massacre in the province of south kivu[MASK] thirty three people were killed they were mostly women and children <unk> and many of them were hacked to death [MASK] during the past eight years fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited full scale civil and international war[MASK] so basically <unk> every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace the conflict explodes again <unk> why [MASK] why have the massive international efforts failed to help congo achieve lasting peace[MASK] and security well my answer to this question revolves around two central observations[MASK] first one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in congo is fundamentally local[MASK] and when i say local i really mean at the level of the individual the family the clan the municipality the community the district sometimes the[MASK] <unk> for instance you remember the story of isabelle that i told you <unk> well <unk> the reason why militias had attacked isabelle 's village[MASK] was because they wanted to take the land[MASK] that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive <unk> the second central observation[MASK] is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a[MASK] <unk> dominant peacebuilding culture so[MASK] what i mean is that western and african diplomats united nations peacekeepers[MASK] <unk> donors <unk> the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict they all share a specific way of seeing the[MASK] <unk> i was one of these people and i shared this culture <unk> so i know all too well how powerful it is [MASK] throughout the world <unk> and throughout conflict zones <unk> [MASK] this common culture shapes the intervener 's understanding of the causes of violence[MASK] as something that is primarily located in the national and international[MASK] <unk> it shapes our understanding of the path toward peace[MASK] as something again that requires top down intervention to address national and international tensions <unk> [MASK] and it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors as engaging in national and international peace processes <unk> [MASK] even more importantly[MASK] <unk> so for instance in congo because of how they are socialized and trained <unk> [MASK] united nations officials donors diplomats <unk> the staff of most nongovernmental organizations <unk> [MASK] they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a[MASK] to them the violence they see is[MASK] the consequence of tensions between president kabila and various national opponents <unk> and tensions between congo <unk> rwanda[MASK] and uganda in addition these international peacebuilders view local conflicts[MASK] as simply the result[MASK] of national and international tensions <unk> insufficient state authority <unk> [MASK] and what they call the congolese people 's so called inherent penchant for violence [MASK] the dominant culture also constructs intervention at the national and international levels[MASK] as the only natural and legitimate task for united nations staffers and diplomats[MASK] and it elevates the organization of general elections which is now a sort of cure all [MASK] as the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism over more effective state building approaches <unk> [MASK] and that happens not only in congo but also in many other conflict zones[MASK] <unk> let 's dig deeper into the other main sources of violence [MASK] in congo <unk> continuing violence is motivated not only by the national and international causes[MASK] but also by longstanding bottom up agendas[MASK] whose main instigators are villagers traditional chiefs community chiefs or ethnic leaders [MASK] many conflicts revolve around political[MASK] <unk> social and economic stakes that are distinctively local [MASK] for instance <unk> there is a lot of competition at the village or district level[MASK] over who can be chief of village or chief of territory according to traditional law <unk> and who can control the distribution of land[MASK] and the exploitation of local mining sites this competition often[MASK] <unk> results in localized fighting for instance in one village or territory [MASK] and quite frequently it escalates into generalized fighting so across a whole province and even at times into neighboring countries [MASK] take the conflict between congolese of rwandan[MASK] <unk> during belgian colonization <unk> [MASK] when both communities competed over access to land and to local power [MASK] then in one thousand nine hundred and sixty after congolese independence <unk> it escalated[MASK] because each camp tried to align with national politicians[MASK] <unk> but still to advance their local agendas <unk> and then at the time of the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four genocide in rwanda [MASK] these local actors allied with congolese and rwandan armed groups <unk> but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the kivus [MASK] and since then these local disputes over land and local power have fueled violence and they have regularly jeopardized[MASK] the national and international settlements <unk> [MASK] so we can wonder why in these circumstances[MASK] the international peacebuilders have failed to help implement local peacebuilding programs <unk> and the answer[MASK] is that international interveners deem the resolution of grassroots conflict[MASK] an unimportant <unk> unfamiliar and illegitimate task <unk> [MASK] the very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally with existing cultural norms <unk> and it threatens key organizational interests [MASK] <unk> the very identity of the united nations as this macro level diplomatic organization would be upended[MASK] if it were to refocus on local conflicts [MASK] and the result is that neither the internal resistance to the dominant ways of working nor the external shocks[MASK] have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate their understanding of violence[MASK] and intervention [MASK] and so far there have been only very few exceptions there have been exceptions but only very few exceptions to this broad pattern <unk> [MASK] so to wrap up[MASK] <unk> the story i just told you is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture shapes the intervener 's understanding of what the causes[MASK] <unk> violence are how peace is made <unk> and what interventions should accomplish [MASK] these understandings enable international <unk> peacebuilders[MASK] to ignore the micro level foundations that are so necessary for sustainable peace <unk> [MASK] the resulting inattention to local conflicts leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term[MASK] <unk> and potential war resumption in the long term [MASK] and what 's fascinating is that this analysis helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict and international intervention failures [MASK] in africa and elsewhere [MASK] local conflicts fuel violence in most war and[MASK] <unk> and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive bottom up peacebuilding initiatives <unk> [MASK] these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable [MASK] one of the best examples is the contrast between the relatively peaceful situation in somaliland <unk> [MASK] which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives[MASK] and the violence prevalent in the rest of somalia <unk> where peacebuilding has been mostly top down and[MASK] there are several other cases in which local grassroots conflict resolution has made a crucial difference <unk> [MASK] so if we want international peacebuilding to[MASK] <unk> must be resolved from the bottom up[MASK] <unk> and again <unk> it 's not that national and international tensions don 't matter they do <unk> [MASK] and it 's not that national and international peacebuilding isn 't necessary <unk> it is [MASK] instead <unk> it is that both[MASK] and local nongovernmental organizations local authorities and civil society representatives should be the main actors in the bottom up process <unk> [MASK] so of course there are obstacles local actors often lack the funding and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity[MASK] to implement effective local peacebuilding programs so[MASK] <unk> actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution [MASK] as for congo what can be done <unk> [MASK] after two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions <unk> it 's clear that we need to change our approach <unk> [MASK] based on my field research i believe that international and congolese actors[MASK] should pay more attention to[MASK] the resolution of land conflict[MASK] and the promotion of inter community reconciliation <unk> [MASK] so for instance in the province of the kivus the life and peace institute and its congolese partners[MASK] have set up <unk>[MASK] <unk> forums to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence[MASK] that 's the kind of program that is sorely needed throughout eastern congo <unk> [MASK] it 's with programs like this that we can help people like isabelle and her husband <unk> [MASK] so these will not be magic wands <unk> but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence they could definitely be[MASK]
