 <unk> era of computer interfaces like they 're very kind of they don 't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and i 'd like to change all that <unk> hit me <unk>[MASK] <unk> so i mean this is the kind of status quo interface right it 's very flat kind of rigid and ok so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable mac <unk> you know[MASK] <unk> but really it 's the kind of same old crap we 've had for the last <unk> you know thirty years [MASK] like i think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers i mean it 's point and click it 's like the menus icons[MASK] <unk> it 's all the kind of same thing and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real desk <unk> it 's so much more subtle so much more <unk>[MASK] <unk> visceral <unk> and i 'd like to bring that experience to the desktop so i kind of have a[MASK] this is this is bumptop it 's kind of like a new approach to[MASK] desktop computing so you can bump things they 're all physically <unk> you know manipulable and stuff[MASK] <unk> point and click it 's like a push and pull things collide as you 'd expect them just like on my real desk <unk> i can let me just grab these guys i can turn things into piles[MASK] instead of just the folders that we have [MASK] and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid or you know flip through them like a book[MASK] or i can lay them out like a deck of cards[MASK] when they 're laid out i can pull things to new locations or delete things[MASK] or just quickly sort a whole pile you know just immediately right[MASK] <unk> and then <unk> it 's all smoothly animated instead of these jarring changes you see in today 's interfaces <unk> also if i want to add something to a pile well how do i do that i just toss it[MASK] <unk> 's added right to the top it 's a kind of nice way [MASK] also some of the stuff we can do is for these individual icons we thought i mean how can we play with the idea of an icon and push that further and one of the things i can do is make it bigger <unk>[MASK] if i want to emphasize it and make it more important <unk> but what 's really cool is that since there 's a physics simulation running under this it 's actually heavier so the lighter stuff[MASK] <unk> also like a subtle channel of conveying information right this is heavy so it feels more important <unk> [MASK] so it 's kind of cool <unk> despite computers everywhere paper really hasn 't disappeared because it has a lot of i think valuable properties and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system[MASK] so one of the things you can do to our icons just like paper is crease them[MASK] and fold them[MASK] just like paper remember[MASK] <unk> you know <unk> something for later or if you want to be destructive you can just crumple it up[MASK] and you know toss it to the corner <unk> also just like paper around our workspace we 'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later <unk> and i can do the same thing[MASK] here <unk> and you know you 'll see <unk> post it notes and things like that around people 's offices and i can pull them off when i[MASK] <unk> the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that you know okay well my real desk is really messy i don 't want that mess on my[MASK] computer so one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of[MASK] so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned more boring but[MASK] you still have that kind of colliding and bumping and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop let[MASK] <unk> just break this shelf okay[MASK] that shelf broke <unk> i think beyond the icons i think another really cool domain for this software i think it applies to more than just icons[MASK] and your desktop[MASK] but browsing photographs i think you can really enrich[MASK] the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of you know <unk> photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing i can toss these things around they 're so[MASK] so much more tangible and and touchable and you know i can double click on something to take a look at it and i can do all that kind of same stuff i showed you before so i can pile things up [MASK] i can flip through it i can you know[MASK] okay let 's move this this photo to the back let 's delete this guy here <unk> and[MASK] i think it 's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting[MASK]
