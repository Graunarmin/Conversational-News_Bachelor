 <unk> i was very glad to see goldie hawn because i had[MASK] <unk> an apology to make to her i 'd had dinner with her[MASK] about two years ago and i 'd[MASK] she had this big wedding ring and i put it on my[MASK] on my finger and i couldn 't get it off and[MASK] i went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why i had another woman 's big massive big wedding ring on my finger [MASK] and anyway the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it[MASK] cut off[MASK] <unk> going to put up some[MASK] some slides of some of[MASK] your companies here you 've started one or two in your time[MASK] <unk> so <unk> you know <unk> virgin atlantic virgin records i guess it all started with a magazine called student[MASK] <unk> and then yes all these other ones as well i mean <unk> how do you do this[MASK] <unk> i mean i think i learned early on that if you can run one company <unk> you can really run any companies i mean companies are all about[MASK] finding finding the right[MASK] <unk> drawing out the best in people and i just love learning and i 'm incredibly inquisitive and[MASK] i love taking on you know the status quo and trying to turn it upside down so[MASK] i 've seen life as one long[MASK] one long learning process and if i see you know <unk> if i fly on somebody else 's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one which it wasn 't[MASK] twenty one years ago then i 'd think well <unk> you know maybe i can create the kind of airline that i 'd like to fly on and so you know so[MASK] got one secondhand seven hundred and forty seven from boeing and gave it a go ca well that was a bizarre thing because you[MASK] you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy <unk> and in fact [MASK] <unk> in a way it almost took down your empire at one point i had a conversation with[MASK] one of the investment bankers who at the time when you you basically sold[MASK] virgin records[MASK] and invested heavily in virgin atlantic and his view was that you were trading you know [MASK] the world 's fourth biggest record company for the twenty fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind [MASK] why did you do that rb well[MASK] i think[MASK] that[MASK] there 's a very thin dividing line between success[MASK] <unk> and failure and i think if you start a business without financial backing <unk> you 're likely to[MASK] go the wrong side of that dividing line we had[MASK] we were being attacked by british airways they were trying to put our airline out of business and they launched what 's become known as the dirty tricks[MASK] <unk> the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless[MASK] i chipped in a chip and in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company <unk> i had to sell the[MASK] <unk> you use the virgin brand a lot and it seems like you 're getting synergy from one thing to the other what does the brand stand for in your head rb [MASK] well i like to think it stands for quality that you know [MASK] <unk> we have a lot of fun[MASK] and i think the people who work for it enjoy it as i say we go in and shake up other other industries and i think[MASK] you know we do it differently and i think that industries are not quite the same as a result of virgin attacking the market ca i mean there are a[MASK] <unk> i was actually also curious why i think you missed an opportunity with your your condoms launch you called it mates i mean couldn 't you have used the virgin brand for that as well ain[MASK] 't virgin no longer[MASK] <unk> often when you launch a company and you get customer complaints <unk> you know you can deal with them but about three months after the launch of the condom company i had[MASK] a letter a complaint and i sat down and[MASK] wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely but obviously there wasn 't a lot i could do about it and then[MASK] <unk> just help us with some of the numbers i mean <unk> what are the numbers on this i mean how big is the group overall[MASK] <unk> you 've been photographed in various ways at various times and[MASK] never worrying about[MASK] putting your dignity on the line or anything like that <unk> what was that was that real[MASK] <unk> that car that we actually we it was a tedster event there i think <unk> is that could you still pause on that[MASK] <unk> when i first came to america i used to try this with employees as well and they kind of they have these different rules over here[MASK] <unk> just run a couple more pictures here virgin brides very nice and ok so stop there this was you had[MASK] <unk> you like to be called sir richard or how rb nobody 's ever called me sir richard occasionally in america <unk> i hear people saying sir richard and think[MASK] shakespearean play taking place[MASK] but nowhere else anyway ca [MASK] ok <unk> so can you can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just rb no [MASK] i suppose if you if you 're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something[MASK] <unk> so that 's the bert rutan designed spaceship rb yeah it 'll be[MASK] <unk> ready in twelve months and then we do twelve months extensive testing and then twenty four months from now people will be able to[MASK] take a ride into space ca so[MASK] this interior is philippe starcke designed rb philippe has done[MASK] the yeah quite a bit of it <unk> the logos and he 's building the space station in new mexico and basically[MASK] <unk> taken an eye[MASK] and the space station will be one[MASK] giant eye so when you 're in space you ought to be able to see this[MASK] massive eye looking up at you and when you land you 'll be able to[MASK] go back into this this giant eye but he 's an absolute genius when it comes to design ca but you didn 't have him design the engine[MASK] <unk> philippe is quite erratic so i think that he wouldn 't be the best person to design the engine[MASK] have you ever regretted that rb many times i mean i think with the[MASK] ballooning and boating expeditions we 've done in the past well i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by helicopters so and each time i[MASK] didn 't expect to come home to tell the tale [MASK] <unk> so in those moments <unk> you certainly wonder what you 're doing up there or ca what was the closest you got to when did you think this is it i might be on my way out[MASK] rb well i think the balloon adventures were each one was was[MASK] each one actually i think we came close and i mean first of all[MASK] we nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before <unk> so we[MASK] <unk> we had to build a[MASK] hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream <unk> and we weren 't quite sure when a balloon actually got into the jet stream whether it would actually survive the[MASK] two hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour winds that you can find up there and so just the initial[MASK] lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic as we were pushing into the jet stream this enormous balloon the top of the balloon[MASK] ended up[MASK] <unk> going at a couple of hundred miles an hour the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at[MASK] maybe two miles an hour <unk> and it just it just took off and it was like holding onto a thousand horses <unk> and we were just[MASK] crossing crossing every finger <unk> praying that the balloon would hold together which fortunately it did <unk> [MASK] <unk> the ends of all those balloon trips were [MASK] you know something seemed to go wrong every time and on that particular occasion <unk> the more experienced balloonist who was with me[MASK] jumped <unk> and left me holding on for dear life[MASK] <unk> oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute looking at the swirling clouds below trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the north sea which and it was a very[MASK] <unk> i knew i had about half an hour 's fuel left <unk> and i also knew that the chances were that if i jumped i would only have a couple of minutes of life left so[MASK] i climbed back into the capsule and[MASK] just desperately tried to make sure that i was making the right decision and[MASK] <unk> wrote some notes to my family and then[MASK] climbed back up again looked down at those clouds again climbed back into the capsule again <unk> and then finally just thought[MASK] there 's a better way i 've got you know this enormous balloon above me it 's the biggest parachute[MASK] ever why not use it and so i managed to fly the[MASK] balloon down through the clouds and about[MASK] fifty feet before i hit the sea threw myself over and the balloon hit the sea and went[MASK] <unk> shooting back up to[MASK] ten thousand feet without me <unk> but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and ca what did you write to your family [MASK] rb just[MASK] what you what you would do in a situation like that just i love you very much <unk> and[MASK] i 'd already written them a letter before[MASK] <unk> they never had to use it ca your companies have had incredible pr value out of these heroics <unk> [MASK] the years and[MASK] until i stopped looking at the polls you were sort of regarded as this great[MASK] hero in the u k and elsewhere and cynics might say you know this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to[MASK] execute his particular style of marketing <unk> how much was the pr[MASK] value part of this rb well of course <unk> the pr experts said that[MASK] <unk> as an airline owner the last thing you should be doing[MASK] is heading off in balloons and boats <unk>[MASK] <unk> i think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying <unk> you know come on richard <unk> there are better ways of crossing the atlantic[MASK] <unk> it was one of the reasons i left[MASK] school when i was fifteen years old and if i[MASK] if i 'm not interested in something <unk>[MASK] i don 't grasp it <unk> as somebody who 's dyslexic you also have some quite bizarre situations i mean for instance [MASK] i 've had to[MASK] you know i 've been running the largest group of private companies in europe but haven 't been able to know the difference between net and gross[MASK] and so the board the board meetings have been fascinating[MASK] <unk> here 's a[MASK] let me draw on a diagram here 's a net in the sea and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net and that 's the profits you 've got left over[MASK] <unk> i mean at school so as well as being you know <unk> doing pretty miserably academically but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams so you were kind of a you were a natural leader [MASK] but just a bit of a were you a rebel then or how would you[MASK] <unk> i was fortunately good at sport <unk> and[MASK] so at least i had something to excel at at school ca and[MASK] some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life i mean there 's the story about your your mother allegedly dumping you in a field <unk> aged four and saying ok walk home did this really happen rb [MASK] <unk> felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age so she did things to us which now she 'd be arrested for such as[MASK] pushing us out of the car and telling us to find our own way to granny 's about five miles before we actually got there[MASK] and making us making us go on wonderful long bike rides and we were never allowed to watch television[MASK] you bring them up do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think[MASK] they 're too coddled they don 't know what they 've got we 're going to raise a generation of privileged <unk> rb no i think if you 're bringing up kids you just want to smother them with love and[MASK] praise and[MASK] <unk> you didn 't turn out too bad i have to say i 'm your headmaster said to you i mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school he said you 're either going to[MASK] be a millionaire or go to prison and i 'm not sure which which of those happened first [MASK] rb well i 've done both <unk> i think i went to[MASK] <unk> i was actually prosecuted[MASK] under two quite ancient acts in the <unk> <unk> u k i was prosecuted under the one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine venereal diseases act[MASK] and the one thousand nine hundred and sixteen indecent advertisements act on the first occasion for mentioning the word venereal disease in public which[MASK] we had a center where we would[MASK] help young people who had problems and one of the problems young people have is venereal disease <unk> and there 's an ancient law that says you can 't actually mention the word venereal disease or print[MASK] <unk> it in public <unk> so the police knocked on the door and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease we changed it to social diseases[MASK] and people came along with acne and spots but nobody came with vd any more so we put it back to vd and promptly got arrested <unk> [MASK] and then subsequently never mind the bollocks here 's the sex pistols the word bollocks[MASK] <unk> police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the sex pistols ' album <unk> and[MASK] john mortimer <unk> the playwright defended us and he asked if i could find a linguistics expert to[MASK] come up with a different definition of the word bollocks and so i rang up nottingham university and i asked to talk[MASK] <unk> nothing to do with balls whatsoever it 's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century and[MASK] he[MASK] went furthermore i 'm a priest myself and so i said would you mind coming to the court and he said he 'd be delighted and i said and he said would you like me to wear my dog collar and i said[MASK] argued that it was actually never mind the priest here 's the sex pistols and the judge found us reluctantly found us not guilty so [MASK] ca that is outrageous so[MASK] seriously [MASK] is there a dark side a lot of people would would say there 's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without[MASK] <unk> knifing a few people in the back you know doing some ugly things you 've been accused of being ruthless there was a nasty biography written about you by someone [MASK] is any of it true <unk> is there an element of truth in[MASK] it rb i don 't actually think that the stereotype stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top[MASK] <unk> generally speaking works i think[MASK] if you treat people well[MASK] people will come back and and come back for more and i think all you have in life is your reputation and[MASK] it 's a very small world and i actually think that the best the best way[MASK] of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with[MASK] <unk> like to think that 's how how we run virgin ca and what about[MASK] the people who love you and who see you spending you keep getting caught up in these new projects but it almost feels like you 're[MASK] addicted to launching new stuff you get excited by an idea and <unk> kapow i mean <unk> do you think about life balance[MASK] how do your family feel about each time you step into something big[MASK] <unk> also believe that being a father 's incredibly important so from from the time the kids were very young you know [MASK] when they go on holiday i go on holiday with them <unk> and[MASK] so[MASK] we spend[MASK] a very good sort of three months[MASK] away together yes i 'll you know be in touch we 're very lucky we have this tiny little island in the caribbean[MASK] and we can[MASK] <unk> take them there and we can bring friends and[MASK] we can play together <unk> but i can also[MASK] keep keep in touch with what 's going on ca you started talking in in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy what is that rb [MASK] capitalism has been proven to be a system that[MASK] works you know the alternative communism has not[MASK] <unk> but the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people <unk> and therefore extreme responsibility i think goes[MASK] with that wealth and i think it 's important that the individuals who are in that fortunate position do not end up[MASK] competing for bigger and bigger boats and bigger and bigger cars but you[MASK] <unk> use that money to either create new jobs or[MASK] or to tackle tackle issues around the world ca and what are the issues that you worry about most care most about want to turn your[MASK] resources toward rb well there 's i mean there 's a lot of issues i mean global warming certainly is is a[MASK] massive threat to mankind and[MASK] we are putting a lot of time and energy into[MASK] <unk> up with alternative fuels and <unk>[MASK] we just launched this this prize <unk> which is really a prize in case in case we don 't get an answer[MASK] on alternative fuels in case we don 't actually manage to get the carbon[MASK] emissions cut down quickly and in case we go through the[MASK] <unk> we need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the earth 's atmosphere and[MASK] we just you know there weren 't really people working on that before so we wanted people to try to[MASK] all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that and also to try to extract the methane[MASK] out of the earth 's atmosphere as well and actually we 've had about fifteen thousand people[MASK] fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go[MASK] so we only need one so we 're hopeful ca and you 're also working in africa on a couple of projects rb yes i mean <unk> we 've got[MASK] we 're setting up something called the war room which is maybe the wrong wrong word we 're trying to maybe we 'll change it but anyway <unk> it 's a war room to[MASK] try to coordinate all all the attack that 's going[MASK] <unk> there 's a doctor in africa that 's found that if you[MASK] give a mother antiretroviral drugs at twenty four weeks <unk> when she 's pregnant that the baby will not[MASK] will not have hiv when it 's born <unk> and so disseminating that[MASK] <unk> to[MASK] around the rest of africa is important ca the war room sounds <unk> it sounds powerful and dramatic and is there a risk that[MASK] the kind of the the business heroes of the[MASK] of the west[MASK] get get so excited about i mean they 're used to having an idea getting stuff done and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world is there a risk that we go to places like africa and say[MASK] <unk> we 've got to fix this problem and we can do it i 've got all these billions of dollars you know da da da here 's the big idea and kind of[MASK] take a much more complex situation and actually end up[MASK] making a mess of it do you worry about that[MASK] <unk> with accepting hiv and aids are related <unk> but this is a way i think of him tackling tackling this problem[MASK] and instead of[MASK] the world criticizing him it 's a way way of working working with him with his government it 's important that if people do go to africa and do try to help [MASK] they don 't just go in there and then and then leave after a few years it 's got to be consistent <unk> [MASK] <unk> bring their entrepreneurial know how and help governments approach things slightly differently for instance we 're setting up[MASK] clinics in africa[MASK] where we 're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs free tb treatment and free malaria treatment but we 're also trying to make them[MASK] a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself or bill gates or whatever that this is really being it 's almost driven by some sort of desire again you[MASK] know for the right image for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct [MASK] what would you say to them rb well i think that everybody[MASK] people do things for a whole variety of different[MASK] <unk> when i 'm on me deathbed i will want to feel that[MASK] that i 've made a difference to other people 's lives and that may be a selfish[MASK] a selfish thing to think but it 's the way i 've been brought up i think if i 'm in a position to[MASK] radically change other people 's lives for the better <unk> i should[MASK] <unk> people are driven by this desire to grow and that 's where they get their fulfillment[MASK] the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy i mean it seems like you 're still a little bit in the growth[MASK] phases you 're still doing these incredible new plans how much do you think about legacy <unk> and what would you like your legacy to be[MASK] rb i don 't[MASK] think i think too much about legacy i mean i like to you know [MASK] my grandmother lived to one hundred and one so hopefully i 've got another thirty or forty years to go[MASK] no i just want <unk>[MASK] <unk> if i can make a difference i hope to be able to make make a difference <unk> and i think one of the positive things at the moment is you 've got[MASK] sergey and larry from google for instance who are good friends and[MASK] thank god you 've got two people who genuinely care about the world and and with that kind of wealth if they had that kind of wealth and they didn 't care about the world <unk> it[MASK] <unk> be very worrying and you know they 're going to make a hell of a difference to the world and i think it 's important that people in in that kind of position do make a difference[MASK]
