 <unk> i started working[MASK] with refugees because i wanted to make a difference and making a difference starts with telling their stories [MASK] so when i meet refugees <unk> i always ask them[MASK] <unk> who bombed your house <unk> who killed your son <unk> did the rest of your family make it out alive [MASK] how are you coping[MASK] in your life in exile <unk> [MASK] but there 's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing and that is what did you take [MASK] what was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town[MASK] <unk> and the armed gangs were approaching your house <unk> [MASK] a syrian refugee boy i know told me that he didn 't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger [MASK] he took his high school diploma <unk> and later he told me why <unk> [MASK] he said i took my high school diploma because my life depended on it[MASK] and he would risk his life to get that diploma on his way to school he would dodge snipers [MASK] his classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling [MASK] and his mother told me every day <unk> i would say to him every morning ' honey <unk> [MASK] please don 't go to school ' and when he insisted she said i would hug him as if it were for the last time [MASK] but he said to his mother we 're all afraid <unk> [MASK] but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear [MASK] but one day <unk> the family got terrible news hany 's aunt his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house their throats[MASK] were slit <unk> it was time to flee [MASK] they left that day right away in their car hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers <unk> [MASK] and they would cross the border into lebanon <unk> where they would find peace <unk> [MASK] but they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony[MASK] they had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field and this is hany 's brother ashraf who plays outside <unk> and that day <unk> they joined[MASK] the biggest population of refugees in the world <unk> in a country lebanon that is tiny[MASK] <unk> it only has four million citizens <unk> and there are one million syrian refugees living there there 's not a town a city or a village[MASK] that is not host[MASK] to syrian refugees [MASK] this is generosity and humanity that is remarkable [MASK] think about it this way proportionately[MASK] <unk> it would be as if[MASK] the entire population of germany <unk> eighty million people [MASK] would flee to the united states in just three years [MASK] half of the entire population of syria is now uprooted [MASK] most of them inside the country six and a half million people[MASK] have fled for their lives over and well over three million people have crossed the borders[MASK] <unk> and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries and only a small proportion as you see have moved on[MASK] to europe <unk> [MASK] what i find most worrying is that half of all syrian refugees are children i took this picture of this little girl it was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from syria[MASK] into jordan <unk> and most troubling of all[MASK] is that only twenty percent of syrian refugee children are in school[MASK] in lebanon <unk> and yet syrian refugee children all refugee children tell us[MASK] education is the most important thing in their lives[MASK] <unk> to think of their future rather than the nightmare of their past it allows them to think of hope rather than hatred <unk> [MASK] i 'm reminded of a recent visit i took to a syrian refugee camp in northern iraq <unk> and i met this girl <unk> [MASK] and i thought she 's beautiful [MASK] and i went up to her and asked her can i take your picture [MASK] and she said yes[MASK] <unk> but she refused to smile <unk> i think she couldn 't because i think she must realize that she represents[MASK] a lost generation of syrian refugee children a generation isolated[MASK] and frustrated <unk> and yet[MASK] <unk> 's home was also destroyed this will need to be rebuilt[MASK] by architects by engineers by electricians <unk> communities will need teachers and lawyers[MASK] and politicians interested in reconciliation[MASK] and not revenge[MASK] shouldn 't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake [MASK] the societies in exile the refugees [MASK] refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return [MASK] you might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state[MASK] <unk> with wars going on and on the average time a refugee will spend in exile is seventeen years <unk> [MASK] hany was into his second year in limbo when i went to visit him recently <unk> and we conducted our entire conversation in[MASK] <unk> which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of dan brown 's novels[MASK] and from listening to american rap [MASK] we also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother ashraf <unk> [MASK] but i 'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day <unk> [MASK] he said to me if i am not a student <unk> i am nothing[MASK] hany is one of fifty million people[MASK] uprooted in this world today <unk> [MASK] never since world war ii have so many people been forcibly displaced [MASK] so while we 're making sweeping progress in human[MASK] <unk> education and design we are doing dangerously little to help the victims[MASK] and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes <unk> [MASK] and there are more and more victims [MASK] <unk> on average by the end of this day thirty two thousand people will be forcibly displaced from their homes[MASK] thirty two thousand people [MASK] they flee across borders like this one we captured this[MASK] on the syrian border[MASK] to jordan and this is a typical[MASK] <unk> or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats <unk> risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in europe [MASK] this syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized most of the people drowned[MASK] and he told us syrians are just looking for a quiet place[MASK] where nobody hurts you[MASK] where nobody humiliates you and where nobody kills you well i think that should be the minimum [MASK] how about a place of healing of learning <unk> [MASK] and even opportunity[MASK] <unk> americans and europeans have the impression that proportionally huge[MASK] <unk> numbers of refugees are coming to their country <unk> but the reality is[MASK] that eighty six percent the vast majority of refugees are living in the developing world [MASK] in countries struggling with their own insecurity [MASK] with their own issues of of helping their own populations and poverty <unk> [MASK] so wealthy countries in the world should recognize[MASK] <unk> recognize[MASK] the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees <unk> [MASK] and all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border[MASK] <unk> but there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive <unk> we can help them thrive [MASK] we should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers[MASK] where people languish[MASK] waiting for the war to end rather as[MASK] <unk> centers of excellence where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home[MASK] as agents of positive change[MASK] and social[MASK] transformation [MASK] it makes so much sense <unk> but i 'm reminded of the terrible war in somalia that has been raging on[MASK] <unk> for twenty two years [MASK] and imagine living in this camp <unk> i visited this camp it 's in djibouti neighboring somalia and it was so remote[MASK] that we had to take a helicopter to fly there it was dusty and it was terribly hot <unk> and we went to visit a school[MASK] and started talking to the children and then i saw this girl across the room who looked to me[MASK] <unk> to be the same age as my own daughter <unk> and i went up and talked to her [MASK] and i asked her the questions that <unk> grown ups ask kids <unk> like what is your favorite subject and what do you want to be when you grow up [MASK] and this is when her face turned blank <unk> [MASK] and she said to me i have no future my schooling days are over [MASK] and i thought there must be some misunderstanding[MASK] <unk> so i turned to my colleague[MASK] and she confirmed to me[MASK] there is no funding for secondary education in this camp <unk> [MASK] and how i wished at that moment that i could say to her we will build you a school [MASK] and i also thought what a waste <unk> she should be and she is the future of somalia[MASK] a boy named jacob <unk> atem[MASK] had a different chance but not before he experienced terribly tragedy <unk> [MASK] he watched this is in sudan as his village he was only seven years old burned to the ground and he learned[MASK] that his mother and his father and his entire family[MASK] were killed that day <unk> only his cousin survived and the two of[MASK] <unk> them walked for seven months this is boys like him[MASK] chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs and they finally made it to refugee camps where they found safety <unk> and he would spend the next seven years[MASK] in kenya in a refugee camp <unk> but his life changed[MASK] when he got the chance to be resettled to the united states <unk> and he found love in a foster[MASK] <unk> family[MASK] and he was able to go to school [MASK] and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university [MASK] i spoke to him on skype the other day and he was in his new university in florida[MASK] pursuing his[MASK] <unk> public health <unk> and he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the american public[MASK] to establish a health clinic back in his village back home [MASK] so i want to take you back to hany [MASK] when i told him i was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the ted stage he allowed me to read you a poem[MASK] that he sent in an email to me he wrote [MASK] i miss myself <unk> my friends <unk> [MASK] times of reading novels or writing poems <unk> birds and tea in the morning[MASK] <unk> my room my books myself <unk> and everything that was making me smile <unk> [MASK] oh oh i had so many dreams that were about to be realized [MASK] so here is my point not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity[MASK] <unk> leave them abandoned <unk> and they risk[MASK] exploitation and abuse <unk> [MASK] and leave them unskilled and uneducated <unk> [MASK] and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries[MASK] <unk> i believe how we treat the uprooted[MASK] will shape the future[MASK] of our world [MASK] the victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace [MASK] and it 's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence <unk>[MASK] hany is at a tipping point <unk> we would love to help him go to university and to become[MASK] <unk> but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets <unk> food rations[MASK] and a bit of medicine [MASK] university is a luxury <unk> [MASK] but leave him to languish in this muddy field <unk> and he will become a member of a lost[MASK] <unk> but it doesn 't have to end that way <unk> thank you[MASK]
