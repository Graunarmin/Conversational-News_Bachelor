 <unk> it 's been reported that wikileaks your baby has [MASK] in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined can that possibly be true[MASK] <unk> it 's a worry isn 't it <unk> that the rest of the world 's media is doing such a bad job that a little[MASK] group of activists is able to release more of that type of information[MASK] than the rest of the world press combined <unk> [MASK] ca how does it work how do people release the documents and how do you secure their privacy ja[MASK] so these are[MASK] as far as we can tell classical whistleblowers <unk> and we have a number of ways for them to get[MASK] <unk> to us <unk> so we use this state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the internet to hide trails <unk> pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden[MASK] and belgium to enact those legal protections[MASK] <unk> we get information in the mail <unk> the regular postal mail[MASK] encrypted[MASK] <unk> or not vet it like a regular news organization format it which is sometimes something that 's quite hard to do when you 're talking about[MASK] giant databases of information[MASK] release it to the public and then[MASK] defend ourselves ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks ca [MASK] so you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate <unk> but you you actually[MASK] almost never know who the identity of the source is[MASK] <unk> do we ever know <unk> and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible[MASK] leaked a few years ago if we can have this document up <unk> so this was a story in kenya a few years ago can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ja [MASK] so this is the kroll report this was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the kenyan government[MASK] after its election in two thousand and four prior to two thousand and four kenya was ruled by daniel arap moi for about eighteen years he was[MASK] <unk> dictator of kenya <unk> and when kibaki got into power through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya[MASK] they commissioned this report spent about two[MASK] million pounds on this and an associated report and then the government sat on it[MASK] and used it for political leverage on moi who was the richest man still is the richest man in kenya <unk> it 's the holy[MASK] <unk> grail of kenyan journalism so i went there in two thousand and seven and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election[MASK] the national election <unk> december twenty eight [MASK] when we released that report we did so three days after the new president kibaki[MASK] <unk> had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out daniel arap moi <unk> so this report then[MASK] became a dead albatross around[MASK] president kibaki 's neck ca and[MASK] i mean to cut a long story short word of the report leaked into kenya not from the official media but indirectly and in[MASK] <unk> so this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya in tanzanian and[MASK] south african press <unk> and so it came in from the outside and that [MASK] after a couple of days made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it and it ran for twenty nights straight on kenyan tv shifted the vote[MASK] by ten percent according to a kenyan intelligence report[MASK] <unk> going to just show a short clip from this[MASK] baghdad airstrike video <unk> the video itself is longer but here 's a short clip this is this is intense material i should warn[MASK] <unk> on the people who worked on it was[MASK] severe <unk> we ended up sending two people to baghdad to further research that story <unk> so this is just the first[MASK] of three attacks that occurred[MASK] in that scene ca so i mean eleven people died in that attack right including two reuters employees ja yeah two reuters employees two[MASK] <unk> i guess people can see the gross disparity in force you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street and then an apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing[MASK] <unk> cannon shells on everyone looking for any excuse to do so[MASK] and killing people rescuing the wounded <unk> and there was two journalists involved that clearly weren 't insurgents because that 's their full time job ca [MASK] i mean there 's been this u s intelligence analyst <unk> bradley manning arrested <unk> and[MASK] it 's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you along with two hundred and eighty thousand classified[MASK] <unk> i mean <unk> did he ja we have denied receiving those cables <unk> he has been charged about five days ago <unk> with[MASK] obtaining one hundred and fifty thousand cables and releasing fifty now we had released [MASK] early in the year a cable from[MASK] the reykjavik u s embassy <unk> but this is not necessarily connected[MASK] <unk> mean i was a known visitor of that embassy ca i mean <unk> if you did receive thousands of u s embassy diplomatic cables ja we would have released them[MASK] declassified cables <unk> that 's the sort of material that 's there ca [MASK] so let 's talk a little more broadly about this i mean in general <unk> what 's your philosophy why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ja [MASK] well there 's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world what sort of information can achieve[MASK] reform <unk> and there 's a lot of information so information that organizations are spending[MASK] economic effort into concealing <unk> that 's a really good signal that when the information gets out there 's a hope of it doing some good[MASK] because the organizations that know it best that know it from the inside out are spending work to conceal it[MASK] <unk> and that 's what we 've found in practice and that 's what[MASK] the history of journalism is ca but[MASK] are there risks with that <unk> either to the individuals[MASK] <unk> concerned or indeed to[MASK] society at large where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ja [MASK] not that we have seen with anything we have released i mean we have a harm immunization policy we have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal[MASK] personally identifying information in it but[MASK] there are legitimate[MASK] <unk> your records with your doctor that 's a legitimate secret[MASK] but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated ca [MASK] so they are well motivated and what would you say to for example the you know the parent of someone whose[MASK] son is is out serving the u s military and he says you know what you 've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out it shows a u s soldier laughing at people dying[MASK] <unk> the impression has given the impression to millions of people around the world that u s soldiers are inhuman people actually they 're not my son isn 't how dare you what would you say to that ja yeah [MASK] we do get a lot of that but remember <unk> the people in baghdad the people in iraq the people in afghanistan[MASK] they don 't need to see the video they see it every day <unk> so it 's not going to change their opinion it 's not going to change their perception that 's what they see every day[MASK] <unk> it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all <unk> and that 's our hope ca [MASK] so you found a way to shine light into[MASK] what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government light is good[MASK] <unk> any irony in the fact that in order for you to shine that light you have to yourself create secrecy around your sources ja not really i mean[MASK] we don 't have any wikileaks dissidents yet we[MASK] don 't have sources who are dissidents on other sources <unk> should they come forward that would be a tricky situation for us but[MASK] we 're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled[MASK] <unk> to continue our mission not to screw it up ca[MASK] i 'd actually be interested just based on what we 've heard so far i 'm curious as to the opinion in the ted audience <unk>[MASK] you know there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian <unk> you know <unk> [MASK] hero people 's hero bringing[MASK] <unk> it 's a soft crowd <unk> julian a soft crowd we have to try better let 's show them another example now here 's something that[MASK] you haven 't yet leaked but i think i think for ted you are i mean it[MASK] 's an intriguing story that 's just happened right[MASK] what is this[MASK] <unk> this is[MASK] a sample of what we do sort of every day <unk> so late last year in november last year there was a series of well blowouts in albania[MASK] <unk> like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico but not quite as big <unk> and[MASK] we got a report[MASK] a sort of engineering analysis into what happened saying that in fact security guards from[MASK] some rival various competing oil firms had in fact <unk> parked trucks there and blown them up and <unk>[MASK] <unk> part of the albanian government was in this etc etc [MASK] and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it so it was an extremely difficult document for us we couldn 't verify it because we didn 't know who wrote it[MASK] and knew what it was about so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up[MASK] <unk> under that basis we put it out and said look we 're skeptical about this thing we don 't know <unk> but what can we do <unk> the material looks good it feels right but we just can 't verify it [MASK] and[MASK] we then got a letter just this week[MASK] from the company who wrote it <unk> wanting to track down the source[MASK] <unk> to track down the source and we were like oh tell us more what document is it precisely you 're talking about[MASK] can you show that you had legal authority over that document is it really yours so they sent us[MASK] this screen shot[MASK] with the author in the microsoft word[MASK] <unk> that 's happened quite a lot though this is like one of our methods of identifying of verifying what a material is is to try and get these guys to write letters ca yeah have you had[MASK] information from inside bp ja yeah we have a lot but i[MASK] <unk> we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort so our publication rate[MASK] over the past few months has been sort of minimized while[MASK] we 're re engineering our back systems for the[MASK] phenomenal public interest that we have [MASK] that 's a problem <unk> i mean <unk> like any sort of growing startup organization <unk> we are sort of overwhelmed by[MASK] our growth and that means we 're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures[MASK] of a very high caliber but don 't have enough people to actually[MASK] process and vet this information ca so that 's the key bottleneck basically journalistic volunteers[MASK] and or the funding of journalistic salaries ja yep yeah and trusted people i mean we 're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly[MASK] because of the sort of material we we deal with so we have to restructure in order to[MASK] <unk> have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff and then[MASK] lower security cases ca [MASK] so help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this and i think i read that as as a kid you went to thirty seven different schools <unk> can that be right ja well[MASK] my[MASK] parents were in the movie business[MASK] <unk> and you were also i mean you were also a hacker at[MASK] <unk> was a very young journalist activist at an early age i wrote a magazine was prosecuted for it when i was a teenager[MASK] <unk> so you have to be careful with hacker i mean there 's like[MASK] there 's a method[MASK] that can be deployed for various things unfortunately at the moment <unk> it 's mostly deployed by the russian mafia in order to steal your[MASK] <unk> grandmother 's bank accounts <unk> so this phrase is not not as nice as it used to be ca yeah well i certainly don 't think you 're stealing anyone 's[MASK] grandmother 's bank account <unk> but what about your core values <unk> can you give us[MASK] a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped[MASK] determine them[MASK] <unk> generous men do not create victims they nurture victims <unk> and that 's something from my father and something from other[MASK] capable generous men that have been in my life ca capable generous men do not create victims they nurture victims ja yeah <unk> [MASK] <unk> so i 'm not actually so big on the nurture but[MASK] some way there is another way of nurturing victims which is to police perpetrators[MASK] of crime and so that is something that has been in my character for a long time ca so just tell us [MASK] <unk> you basically published something there ran into trouble with a bank[MASK] then the news service there was injuncted from running the story instead they publicized your side [MASK] that made you very high profile in iceland what happened next ja yeah this[MASK] is a great case you know iceland went through this financial[MASK] <unk> the hardest hit of any country in the world its banking sector was ten times the gdp of the rest of the economy <unk> anyway so we release this report in in july[MASK] last year <unk> and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air like out of a movie injunction landed on the news desk and the news reader was like this has never happened before what do we do well[MASK] we just show the website instead for all that time as[MASK] <unk> and we became very famous in iceland went to iceland and spoke about this issue <unk> and there was a feeling in the community[MASK] that[MASK] that should never happen again and as a result <unk> working with icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts we put together[MASK] a new sort of package of legislation for iceland[MASK] to sort of become an an offshore haven for the free press with the strongest journalistic[MASK] <unk> protections in the world with a new[MASK] nobel prize for freedom of speech iceland 's a nordic country so like norway it 's able to tap into the system <unk> and just a[MASK] month ago this was passed by the icelandic parliament unanimously[MASK] <unk> when you think of the future then do you think it 's more likely to be big brother exerting more control more secrecy or us[MASK] watching big brother or it 's just all to be played for either way ja i[MASK] 'm not sure which way it 's going to go <unk> i mean there 's enormous pressures to harmonize[MASK] freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world[MASK] within the e u between china and the united states <unk> which way is it going to go it 's hard to see [MASK] that 's why it 's a very interesting time to be in because with just a little bit of effort we can shift it[MASK] one way or the other ca well it looks like i 'm reflecting the audience 's opinion to say julian <unk> be careful and all[MASK]
