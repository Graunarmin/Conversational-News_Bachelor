by wagging their heads <unk> she believed it [MASK] our lives are full of fish swimming backwards <unk> [MASK] we make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic we harbor bias <unk> we know that we are right and they are wrong [MASK] we fear the worst we strive for unattainable perfection [MASK] we tell ourselves what we can and cannot do [MASK] in our minds[MASK] <unk> fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we don 't even notice them i[MASK] 'm going to tell you five facts about myself one fact is not true [MASK] one i graduated from harvard at nineteen with an honors degree in mathematics [MASK] two i currently run a construction company[MASK] <unk> i starred on a television sitcom [MASK] four i lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease <unk> [MASK] five i served as a law clerk to two us supreme court justices <unk> which fact is not true <unk> [MASK] actually they 're all true yeah they 're all true[MASK] <unk> point most people really only care about the television show [MASK] laughter i know this from experience [MASK] ok so the show was nbc 's saved by the bell the new class and[MASK] i played weasel wyzell who was the sort of dorky nerdy character[MASK] <unk> which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13 year old boy [MASK] now <unk> did you struggle with number four my blindness why is that [MASK] we make assumptions about so called disabilities [MASK] as a blind man i confront others ' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day [MASK] my point today is not about my blindness however <unk> it 's about my vision[MASK] <unk> going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open <unk> [MASK] it taught me to spot those backwards swimming fish that our minds create going blind cast them into focus [MASK] what does it feel like to see <unk> it 's immediate and passive you open your eyes and there 's the world seeing is believing sight is truth[MASK] <unk> 's what i thought then from age twelve to twenty five my retinas progressively deteriorated [MASK] my sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions [MASK] the salesperson i was relieved to spot in a store was really a mannequin <unk> [MASK] reaching down to wash my hands i suddenly saw it was a urinal i was touching not a sink when my fingers felt its true shape[MASK] <unk> a friend described the photograph in my hand and only then i could see the image depicted objects appeared <unk> morphed and disappeared[MASK] in my reality <unk> it was difficult and exhausting to see <unk> [MASK] i pieced together fragmented transitory images <unk> consciously analyzed the clues <unk> searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope [MASK] until i saw nothing at all[MASK] i learned that what we see is not[MASK] universal truth <unk> it is not objective reality <unk> [MASK] what we see is a unique personal virtual reality[MASK] that is masterfully constructed by our brain <unk> [MASK] let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience your visual cortex takes up about thirty percent of your brain that 's compared to approximately[MASK] <unk> eight percent[MASK] for touch and two to three percent for hearing <unk> [MASK] every second your eyes can send your visual cortex as many as two billion pieces of information [MASK] the rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion [MASK] so sight[MASK] is one third of your brain by volume[MASK] and can claim about two thirds of your brain 's processing resources <unk> it 's no surprise then[MASK] <unk> that the illusion of sight is so compelling <unk> but make no mistake about it sight is an illusion <unk> [MASK] here 's where it gets interesting [MASK] to create the experience of sight [MASK] your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world other knowledge your memories opinions emotions mental attention all of these things and far more[MASK] are linked in your brain to your sight these linkages work both ways and[MASK] <unk> occur subconsciously <unk> so for example <unk> what you see impacts how you feel and the way you feel can literally change what you see <unk> [MASK] numerous studies demonstrate this [MASK] if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example <unk> [MASK] your answer will be different if you 're told to think about cheetahs or turtles [MASK] a hill appears steeper if you 've just exercised[MASK] and a landmark appears farther away if you 're wearing a heavy backpack [MASK] we have arrived at a fundamental contradiction [MASK] what you see is a complex mental construction of your own making [MASK] but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you [MASK] you create your own reality <unk> and you believe it [MASK] i believed mine until[MASK] <unk> it broke apart the deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion you see sight is just one way[MASK] we shape our reality <unk> we create our own realities in many other ways <unk> [MASK] let 's take fear as just one example <unk> [MASK] your fears distort[MASK] <unk> under the warped logic of fear anything is better than the uncertain [MASK] fear fills the void at all costs <unk> passing off what you dread for what you know offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous <unk> [MASK] substituting assumption for reason <unk> [MASK] psychologists have a great term for it[MASK] <unk> need to look outside yourself and think critically [MASK] fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind <unk> shrinking and distorting your view <unk> drowning your capacity for critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions <unk> [MASK] when you face a compelling opportunity to take action fear lulls you into inaction enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves[MASK] <unk> i was diagnosed with my blinding disease <unk> i knew[MASK] blindness would ruin my life blindness was a death sentence for my independence <unk> it was the end of achievement for me [MASK] blindness meant i would live an unremarkable life <unk> small and sad and likely alone <unk> [MASK] <unk> this was a fiction born of my fears <unk> but i believed it it was a lie <unk> but it was my reality <unk> just like those backwards swimming fish in little dorothy 's mind <unk> [MASK] if i had not confronted the reality of my fear i would have lived it <unk> i am certain of that [MASK] so how do you live your life eyes wide open <unk> it is a learned discipline <unk> it can be taught <unk> it can be practiced[MASK] i will

[MASK] with that empowerment comes complete responsibility <unk> [MASK] i chose to step out of fear 's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined <unk> [MASK] i chose to build there a blessed life [MASK] far from alone <unk> i share my beautiful life with dorothy my beautiful wife with our[MASK] <unk> triplets whom we call the tripskys [MASK] and with the latest addition to the family <unk> sweet baby clementine what do you fear <unk> [MASK] what lies do you tell yourself [MASK] how do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions what reality are you creating for yourself [MASK] in your career and personal life in your relationships <unk> and in your heart and[MASK] <unk> soul your backwards swimming fish do you great harm [MASK] they exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential <unk> and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment[MASK] and connection <unk> i urge you to search them out [MASK] helen keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no[MASK] <unk> vision <unk> [MASK] for me going blind was a profound blessing <unk> because blindness gave me vision <unk> [MASK] i hope you can see what i
