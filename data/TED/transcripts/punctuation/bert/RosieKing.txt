 <unk> i haven 't told many people this but[MASK] in my head i 've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time i am also autistic [MASK] people tend to diagnose[MASK] <unk> a whole variation as to what we 're like for instance my little brother he 's very severely autistic <unk> he 's nonverbal <unk> he can 't talk at all but i love to talk [MASK] people often[MASK] associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else but i know so many autistic people who love being creative <unk>[MASK] <unk> the stereotypes of things are often if not always wrong [MASK] for instance a lot of people think autism and think rain man immediately [MASK] that 's the common belief that every single autistic person is dustin hoffman and that 's not true <unk> [MASK] but that 's not just with autistic people either i 've seen it with lgbtq people with women with[MASK] <unk> people are so afraid of variety[MASK] that they try to fit everything into a tiny little box with really specific labels this is something that actually happened to me in real life <unk> [MASK] i googled autistic people are and it comes up with suggestions as to what you 're going to type <unk> i googled autistic people[MASK] <unk> the first thing that people think when they think autism they know [MASK] one of the things i can do because i 'm autistic it 's an ability rather than a disability[MASK] is i 've got a very very vivid imagination[MASK] <unk> let me explain it to you a bit it 's like i 'm walking in two worlds most of the time there 's the real world the world that we all share <unk> [MASK] and there 's the world in my mind and the world in my mind is often so much more real than the real world <unk> [MASK] like it[MASK] 's very easy for me to let my mind loose because i don 't try and fit myself into a tiny little box that 's one of the best things about being autistic you don 't have the urge to do that [MASK] you find what you want to do [MASK] you find a way to do it and you get on with it[MASK] <unk> if i was trying to fit myself into a box i wouldn 't be here i wouldn 't have achieved half the things that i have now <unk> there are problems though there are problems with being autistic <unk> [MASK] and there are problems with having too much imagination <unk> school can be a problem in general but[MASK] having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull[MASK] and you are[MASK] secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in which you are not in that lesson [MASK] that adds to your list of problems [MASK] also when my imagination takes hold my body takes on a life of its own when something very[MASK] <unk> happens in my inner world i 've just got to run i 've got to rock backwards and forwards or sometimes scream this gives me so much energy <unk> and i 've got to have an outlet for all that energy <unk> [MASK] but i 've done that ever since i was a child ever since i was a tiny little girl and my parents thought it was cute so they didn 't bring it up but when i got into school they didn 't really agree that it was cute [MASK] it can be that people don 't want to be friends with the girl that starts screaming in an algebra lesson <unk> and[MASK] this doesn 't normally[MASK] <unk> happen in this day and age[MASK] <unk> but it can be that people don 't want to be friends with the autistic girl [MASK] it can be that people don 't want to associate with anyone who won 't or can 't fit themselves into a box that 's labeled normal <unk> [MASK] but that 's fine with me[MASK] <unk> because it sorts the wheat from the chaff and i can find which people are genuine and true and i can pick these people as my friends [MASK] but[MASK] <unk> think about it what is normal <unk>[MASK] what does it mean <unk> imagine if that was the best compliment you ever received wow you are really normal but[MASK] compliments are you are extraordinary or you step outside the box it 's you 're amazing so if people want[MASK] be these things why are so many people striving to be normal why are people pouring their brilliant individual light[MASK] into a mold people are so afraid of variety[MASK] that they try and force everyone even people who don 't want to or can 't to become normal <unk> [MASK] there are camps for lgbtq people or autistic people to try and make them this normal [MASK] and that 's terrifying that people would do that in this day and age [MASK] all in all i wouldn 't trade my autism and[MASK] <unk> my imagination for the world because i am autistic i 've presented documentaries to the bbc i 'm in the midst of writing a book i 'm[MASK] doing this this is fantastic[MASK] and one of the best things that i 've achieved that i consider to have achieved [MASK] is i 've found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister who as i 've said are nonverbal they can 't speak[MASK] people would often write off someone who 's nonverbal <unk> [MASK] but that 's silly because my little brother and sister are the best siblings that you could ever hope for they 're just the best and i love them so much and i care about them more than anything else [MASK] i 'm going to leave you with one question if[MASK] we can 't get inside the person 's minds no matter if they 're autistic or not instead of punishing anything that strays from normal[MASK] <unk> not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination thank you[MASK]
