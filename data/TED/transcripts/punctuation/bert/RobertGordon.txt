 <unk> that 's how we traveled in the year one thousand nine hundred <unk> [MASK] that 's an open buggy <unk> it doesn 't have heating it doesn 't have air conditioning <unk> that horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound <unk> [MASK] and the rutted dirt road[MASK] turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains[MASK] <unk> that 's a boeing seven hundred and seven only sixty years later <unk> it travels at eighty percent of the speed of sound <unk> and we don 't travel any faster today because commercial <unk>[MASK] <unk> supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust <unk> so i started wondering and pondering could it be that the best years of american[MASK] <unk> that leads to the suggestion maybe economic growth is almost over [MASK] some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial <unk> [MASK] there are four headwinds that are just hitting the american economy in the face they 're demographics education debt and inequality <unk> [MASK] they 're powerful enough[MASK] to cut growth in half <unk> so we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline[MASK] and here 's my theme because of the headwinds if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last one hundred and fifty years growth is cut in half [MASK] if innovation is less powerful invents less great wonderful things then growth is going to be even lower than half of history [MASK] now here 's eight centuries of economic growth the vertical axis is just percent per year[MASK] <unk> of growth zero percent a year one percent a year two percent a year [MASK] the white line is for the u k and then the u s takes over as the leading nation in the year one thousand nine hundred when the line switches to red you 'll notice that for the first four centuries there 's hardly any growth at all just zero point two percent [MASK] then growth gets better and better it maxes out in the 1930s[MASK] <unk> and then it starts slowing down and here 's a cautionary note <unk> that last downward notch in the red line is not actual data <unk> that is a forecast that i <unk>[MASK] <unk> made six years ago that growth would slow down to one point three percent <unk> but you know what the actual facts are you know what the growth in per person income has been in the united states in the last six years [MASK] <unk> what if i try to fit a curved line[MASK] to this historical record [MASK] i can make the curved line end anywhere i wanted <unk> [MASK] but i decided i would end it at zero point two just like the u k growth for the first[MASK] four centuries <unk> now the history[MASK] that we 've achieved is that we 've grown at two point zero percent per year[MASK] <unk> to two thousand and seven <unk> and remember it 's been a little bit negative since two thousand and seven <unk> but if growth slows down <unk> [MASK] instead of doubling our standard of living every generation <unk> americans in the future can 't expect[MASK] to be twice as well off as their parents or even a quarter [ more well off than ] their parents [MASK] now we 're going to change and look at the level of per capita income the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today 's prices[MASK] <unk> notice that in one thousand eight hundred and ninety one over on the left we were at about five thousand dollars today we 're at about forty four thousand dollars of total output per member of the population <unk> [MASK] now what if we could achieve that historic two percent growth for the next seventy years well it 's a matter of arithmetic two percent growth quadruples your standard of living in seventy[MASK] <unk> that means we 'd go from forty four thousand to one hundred and eighty thousand well we 're not going to do that [MASK] and the reason is the headwinds the first headwind is demographics <unk> it 's a truism[MASK] that your standard of living rises faster than productivity rises faster than output per hour [MASK] if hours per person increased and we got that gift back in the ' 70s and ' 80s when women entered the labor force but now it 's turned[MASK] <unk> hours per person are shrinking first because of the retirement of the baby boomers <unk> [MASK] and second because there 's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution [MASK] the next headwind is education we 've got problems all over our educational system despite race to the top in college[MASK] <unk> we 've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care <unk> [MASK] we have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt and our college completion rate[MASK] is fifteen points fifteen percentage points[MASK] below canada <unk> we have a lot of debt our[MASK] economy grew from two thousand to two thousand and seven[MASK] on the back of consumers massively[MASK] <unk> overborrowing <unk> [MASK] consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today [MASK] and everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of gdp[MASK] at a very rapid rate and the only way that 's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower[MASK] <unk> in entitlements also called transfer payments [MASK] and that gets us down from the one point five where we 've reached for education down to one point three <unk> and then we have inequality <unk> [MASK] over the fifteen years before the financial crisis [MASK] the growth rate of the bottom ninety nine percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we 've been talking about before all the rest went to the top one[MASK] <unk> so that brings us down to zero point eight <unk> and that zero point eight is the big challenge [MASK] are we going to grow at zero point eight if so that 's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last one[MASK] hundred and fifty years <unk> so let 's see what some of those inventions were if you wanted to read in <unk>[MASK] at night you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp <unk> they created pollution they created odors they were[MASK] <unk> hard to control the light was dim <unk> and they were a fire hazard by <unk>[MASK] electric light was everywhere <unk> [MASK] we had the vertical city <unk> the invention of the elevator <unk> [MASK] central manhattan became possible <unk> [MASK] and then in addition to that at the same time hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and[MASK] <unk> electric tools all achieved by electricity electricity was also very helpful in liberating women [MASK] women back in the late 19th century <unk> spent two days a week doing the laundry <unk> they did it on a scrub board then they had to hang the clothes out to dry <unk> then they had to bring them in the whole thing took two days[MASK] <unk> and then we had the[MASK] electric washing machine and by one thousand nine hundred and fifty <unk> they were everywhere <unk> but the women still had to shop every day <unk> [MASK] but no they didn 't because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator [MASK] back in the late 19th century the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating the bedrooms were cold[MASK] <unk> in america before the motor vehicle transportation depended entirely on the urban horse <unk> [MASK] which dropped <unk> without restraint twenty five to fifty pounds of manure[MASK] on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine that comes[MASK] <unk> out at five to ten tons[MASK] daily per square mile in cities [MASK] those horses also ate up fully one quarter of american agricultural land that 's the percentage of american agricultural land it took[MASK] to feed the horses of course <unk> when the motor vehicle was invented and[MASK] <unk> agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export <unk> and here 's an interesting ratio starting from zero in one thousand nine hundred only thirty years later <unk> [MASK] the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the united states reached ninety percent in just thirty years <unk> [MASK] back before the turn of the century[MASK] <unk> women had another problem all the water for cooking cleaning and bathing[MASK] had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside it 's a historical fact that in one thousand eight hundred and eighty five the average north carolina housewife walked one hundred and forty eight miles a year carrying thirty five tons of water <unk> [MASK] but by <unk>[MASK] cities around the country had put in underground water pipes they had put in[MASK] underground sewer pipes <unk> [MASK] and as a result one of the great scourges of the late 19th century <unk> waterborne diseases like cholera <unk> began to disappear <unk> [MASK] and an amazing fact[MASK] for <unk> techno optimists is that in the first half of the 20th century <unk> the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster[MASK] than it was in the second half of the[MASK] 19th century <unk> so it 's a truism that things can 't be more than one hundred percent of themselves [MASK] and i 'll just give you a few examples <unk> we went from one percent to ninety percent of the speed of sound <unk> electrification central heat [MASK] ownership of motor cars <unk> they all went from zero to one hundred percent urban environments make people more productive than on the farm <unk> we went from[MASK] <unk> early postwar years <unk> [MASK] what about the electronic revolution here 's an early computer <unk> it 's amazing the mainframe computer was invented in one thousand nine hundred and forty two [MASK] by one thousand nine hundred and sixty we had telephone bills bank statements were being produced by computers [MASK] the earliest cell phones the earliest personal computers were invented in[MASK] <unk> gates dos atm machines to replace bank tellers bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector <unk> [MASK] fast forward through the ' 90s we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth but i 'm now going to give you an experiment [MASK] you have to choose either option a or option b [MASK] option a is you get to keep everything invented up till[MASK] <unk> ten years ago so you get google you get amazon you get wikipedia <unk> and you get running water and indoor toilets or you get everything invented to yesterday including facebook[MASK] and your iphone but you have to give up go out to the outhouse and carry in the water <unk> [MASK] hurricane sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century <unk> maybe for a couple of days in some cases for more than a week electricity running water heating[MASK] gasoline for their cars <unk> and a charge for their iphones [MASK] the problem we face is that all these great inventions [MASK] we have to match them in the future and my prediction that we 're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth[MASK] down to zero point two the fanciful curve that i drew you at the beginning so here we are back to the horse and buggy[MASK] <unk> i 'd like to award an oscar[MASK] to the inventors of the 20th century <unk> [MASK] the people from alexander graham bell to thomas edison to the wright brothers i 'd like to call them all up here <unk> and they 're going to call back to you [MASK] your challenge is can you match what we achieved thank you[MASK]
