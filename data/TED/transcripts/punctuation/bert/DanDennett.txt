 <unk> it 's wonderful to be back i love this wonderful gathering and you must be wondering what on earth have they put up the wrong slide[MASK] <unk> ask the question <unk> who designed it <unk> [MASK] this is ted this is technology entertainment design and there 's a dairy cow it 's a[MASK] quite wonderfully designed animal <unk> and i was thinking how do i introduce this and i thought well maybe[MASK] that old doggerel by joyce kilmer <unk> you know poems are made by fools like me[MASK] <unk> only god can make a tree and you might say well god designed the cow but of course god got a lot of help <unk> [MASK] this is the ancestor of cattle this is the aurochs <unk> and[MASK] it was designed by natural selection the process of natural selection over many millions of years <unk> and then it became domesticated [MASK] thousands of years ago and[MASK] human beings[MASK] became its stewards and without even knowing what they were doing they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it and then more recently <unk>[MASK] <unk> they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were how they worked and how they might be optimized how they might be made better <unk> [MASK] <unk> talking about cows <unk> [MASK] because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions [MASK] religions are natural phenomena they 're just as natural as cows <unk> they have evolved over[MASK] millennia <unk> they have a biological[MASK] <unk> just like the aurochs[MASK] they have become domesticated <unk> and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years <unk> [MASK] this is ted <unk> and i want to talk about design <unk> because what i 've been doing for the last four years[MASK] really since the first time you saw me some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion and in the in the last four years i 've been working[MASK] <unk> on this topic <unk> and you might say it 's about the reverse engineering[MASK] of religions <unk> now[MASK] that very idea i think strikes terror in many people or anger or[MASK] anxiety of one sort or another <unk> and that is the spell that i want to break i want to say no religions are an important natural[MASK] <unk> we should study them[MASK] with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena like global warming as we heard so eloquently last night from al gore [MASK] today 's religions are brilliantly designed brilliantly designed [MASK] they are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering[MASK] and as with the cow <unk> there 's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and[MASK] intelligent design[MASK] more or less intelligent design and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to have just one slide about my book because[MASK] there is one message in it which i think this group really needs to hear and i would be very interested to get your responses to this[MASK] <unk> it 's the one policy proposal that i make in the book at this time when i claim not to know enough about religion[MASK] <unk> to know what other policy proposals to make and it 's one that echoes[MASK] remarks that you 've heard already today <unk> here 's my proposal i 'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it education <unk>[MASK] <unk> on world religions for all of our children[MASK] in primary school in high school in public schools in private schools and in home schooling [MASK] so what i 'm proposing is just as we require[MASK] <unk> american history so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world[MASK] about their history [MASK] about their creeds about their texts their music their symbolisms their prohibitions their requirements <unk> [MASK] and this should be[MASK] <unk> with no particular spin to all of the children in the country and[MASK] as long as you teach them that you can teach them anything else you like that i think is[MASK] maximal tolerance for religious freedom as long as you[MASK] inform your children about other religions then you may and as early as you like and whatever you like teach them[MASK] <unk> whatever creed you want them to learn but also let them know about other religions now <unk> why do i say that [MASK] because democracy depends[MASK] on an informed citizenship informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy[MASK] <unk> consent[MASK] is not worth it <unk> it 's like a coin flip it doesn 't count really democracy depends on informed consent <unk> this is the way we treat people[MASK] as responsible adults <unk> now <unk> children[MASK] below the age of consent are a special[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to use a word that pastor rick just used[MASK] parents are stewards of their children they don 't own them you can 't own your children you have a responsibility[MASK] to the world to the state to them to take care of them right [MASK] you may teach them whatever creed you think is most important[MASK] but i say you have a responsibility[MASK] to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world too the reason i 've taken this time is i 've been[MASK] fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this <unk> one reviewer[MASK] for a roman catholic newspaper[MASK] <unk> it strikes me as[MASK] practically libertarian is it totalitarian to require reading writing and arithmetic <unk> i don 't think so all i 'm saying is[MASK] and facts facts only no values just facts[MASK] about all the world 's religions another reviewer called it[MASK] <unk> i 'm really bothered by the fact[MASK] that anybody would think that was hilarious <unk> it seems to me to be such a[MASK] plausible natural extension of the democratic principles we already have[MASK] that i 'm shocked to think anybody would find that just[MASK] ridiculous i know many religions[MASK] are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith[MASK] <unk> among their among their children that they are intent[MASK] on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths <unk> [MASK] i don 't think that 's defensible <unk> [MASK] but i 'd really be pleased to get your answers on that any reactions to that later but now i 'm going to move on back to the cow <unk> [MASK] <unk> this picture which i pulled off the web[MASK] the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture <unk> that 's the steward cows couldn 't live[MASK] without human stewards they 're domesticated they 're a sort of[MASK] ectosymbiont <unk> they depend on us for their for their survival <unk> and[MASK] pastor rick was[MASK] <unk> talking about sheep i 'm going to talk about sheep too there 's a lot of[MASK] serendipitous convergence here how clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds [MASK] laughter think of what this got them <unk> they could outsource all their problems <unk> [MASK] protection from predators food finding [MASK] health maintenance [MASK] the only cost in most flocks not even this a loss of free mating[MASK] what a deal [MASK] how clever of sheep you might say except of course it wasn 't the sheep 's cleverness we all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists they 're not very smart <unk> [MASK] it wasn 't the cleverness of the sheep at all they were clueless <unk> [MASK] but it was a very clever move[MASK] <unk> whose clever move was it it was the clever move of natural selection itself francis crick the[MASK] <unk> of the structure of dna with jim watson once joked about what he called orgel 's second rule <unk> leslie orgel[MASK] <unk> a molecular biologist brilliant guy and orgel 's second rule is evolution is cleverer than you are[MASK] <unk> intelligent design[MASK] not from francis crick <unk> [MASK] evolution is cleverer than you are if you understand orgel 's second rule <unk> then you understand why the intelligent design[MASK] movement is basically a hoax the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are[MASK] <unk> unbelievably brilliant again and again biologists[MASK] are fascinated with the brilliance of what 's discovered but the process itself is without purpose without foresight without design <unk> [MASK] when i was here four years ago i told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass <unk> and why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet <unk>[MASK] <unk> fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to[MASK] <unk> spooky story <unk> and i think some people may have misunderstood <unk> lancet flukes aren 't smart <unk> [MASK] i submit that the the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there somewhere between petunia and carrot <unk> they 're not really bright they don 't have to be the lesson we learn from this is you don 't have to have a mind[MASK] to be a beneficiary the design is there in nature but it 's not in anybody 's head[MASK] <unk> doesn 't have to be that 's the way evolution works <unk> [MASK] question was domestication good for sheep it was great for their genetic fitness and here i want to remind you of a wonderful[MASK] point that paul maccready made at ted three years ago <unk> here 's what he said ten thousand years ago at the dawn of agriculture human[MASK] <unk> plus livestock and pets was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass that was just ten thousand years ago <unk> [MASK] yesterday in biological terms what is it today does anybody remember what he told us[MASK] percent that is what we have done on this planet now i talked to paul afterwards i wanted to check to find out how he 'd calculated[MASK] <unk> get the sources and so forth and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this and there was a passage in it which he did not present here and i think it is so good i 'm going to read it to you [MASK] over billions of years on a unique sphere [MASK] chance has painted a thin covering of life <unk> complex improbable wonderful and fragile [MASK] suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature[MASK] have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of[MASK] <unk> terrible power we now wield the paintbrush [MASK] we heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet [MASK] and we 're the ones that hold the paintbrush <unk> and how can we do that the key to our domination of the planet is culture [MASK] and the key to culture is religion [MASK] suppose martian[MASK] <unk> scientists came to earth <unk> they would be puzzled by many things[MASK] <unk> anybody know what this is i 'll tell you what it is [MASK] this is a million people gathering on the banks of the ganges in two in two thousand and one <unk> perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever [MASK] as seen from satellite photograph here 's a big crowd here 's another crowd in[MASK] would be amazed by this they 'd want to know how it originated what it was for and how it perpetuates itself actually i 'm going to pass over this this [MASK] the ant isn 't alone there 's all sorts of wonderful cases of[MASK] species[MASK] which in that case[MASK] a parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat and it turns the mouse into mighty mouse makes it fearless[MASK] <unk> out in the open where it 'll be eaten by a cat true story in other words we have these hijackers you 've seen this slide before from four years ago[MASK] a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one 's own genetic fitness <unk> [MASK] does that ever happen to us <unk> yes it[MASK] <unk> to the will of allah [MASK] but i 'm not just talking about islam i 'm talking also about christianity <unk> this is a parchment music page that i found in a paris bookstall fifty years ago <unk> [MASK] and on it it says in latin <unk>[MASK] <unk> the word of god is the seed and the sower of the seed is christ same idea well not[MASK] <unk> quite <unk> but in fact <unk> christians too [MASK] glory in the fact that they have surrendered to god i 'll give you a few quotes the heart of worship is surrender [MASK] surrendered people obey god 's words even if it doesn 't make sense those words[MASK] <unk> those are from the purpose driven life [MASK] and i want to turn now <unk> briefly to talk about that book which i 've read you 've all got a copy and you 've just heard the man <unk> [MASK] and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book[MASK] from the design standpoint because i think it 's actually a brilliant book[MASK] first of all the goal and you heard just now what the goal is it 's to bring purpose to the lives of millions and he has succeeded [MASK] is it a good goal in itself i 'm sure we all agree it is a[MASK] <unk> wonderful goal he 's absolutely right there are lots of people out there who[MASK] don 't have purpose in their life and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal <unk> i give him an a + on this [MASK] is the goal achieved <unk> [MASK] yes <unk> thirty million copies of this book <unk> al gore eat your heart out[MASK] just exactly what al is trying to do [MASK] rick is doing <unk> this is a fantastic achievement [MASK] and[MASK] the means how does he do it it 's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes updating them quietly dropping obsolete features[MASK] <unk> putting new interpretations on other features <unk> this is the evolution of religion that 's been going on for thousands of years and he 's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it [MASK] i don 't have to tell you this you just heard the man <unk> excellent insights into human psychology <unk> wise advice on every page [MASK] moreover [MASK] he invites us to look under the hood i really appreciated that for instance he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different bible verses[MASK] <unk> the book is clear <unk> vivid accessible beautifully formatted [MASK] just enough repetition <unk> that 's really important <unk> [MASK] every time you read it or say it <unk> you make another copy in your brain <unk> [MASK] every time you read it or say it <unk> you make another copy in your brain[MASK] <unk> make another copy in your brain <unk> thank you [MASK] and now we come to my problem <unk> because i 'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that i said about this book[MASK] <unk> but i wish it were better <unk> i have some problems with the book <unk> and it would it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems <unk> [MASK] i wish[MASK] he could do this with a revision a mark two version of his[MASK] <unk> book [MASK] the truth will set you free that 's what it says in the bible and it 's something that i want to live by too my problem is [MASK] some of the bits in it i don 't think are true now some of this is a difference of opinion <unk> [MASK] and that 's not my main complaint that 's worth mentioning here 's a passage it 's very much what he said anyway[MASK] if there was no god we would all be accidents the result of astronomical random chance in the universe you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or <unk>[MASK] <unk> significance there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on earth now i just do not believe that by the way i find homer groening 's film[MASK] <unk> yes <unk> there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong we don 't need[MASK] a belief in god to be good or to have meaning in us but that as i said is just[MASK] a difference of opinion that 's not what i 'm really worried about how about this god designed this planet 's environment just so we could live in it [MASK] i 'm afraid that a lot of people take that[MASK] <unk> sentiment[MASK] to mean that we don 't have to do the sorts of things that al gore is trying so hard to get us to do i am not happy with that sentiment at all <unk> and then i find this [MASK] all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact[MASK] well that 's michael denton he 's a creationist <unk> and here i think wait a minute i read this again i read it three or four times and i think is he really[MASK] endorsing intelligent design is he endorsing creationism here and you can 't tell so i 'm sort of thinking well i don 't know i don 't know if i want to get upset with this yet [MASK] but then i read[MASK] <unk> and i read this first noah had never seen rain because prior to the flood god irrigated the earth from the ground up [MASK] i wish that sentence weren 't in there because i think it is false <unk> [MASK] and i think that thinking this way about the history of the planet after we 've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years [MASK] discourages people from scientific understanding[MASK] <unk> warren[MASK] uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way here 's one god deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him <unk>[MASK] <unk> in a way that makes your ministry unique he carefully mixed the dna cocktail that created you [MASK] i think that 's false now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical[MASK] here 's another one for instance your brain can store one hundred trillion facts your mind can handle fifteen thousand decisions a second [MASK] well it would be interesting to find the interpretation where i would accept that there might be some way of of treating that as true [MASK] anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge hardwired by god into the very fiber of our being an inbuilt need to connect with god[MASK] <unk> well the sense of which i agree with him except i think it has an evolutionary explanation and what i find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral if you want to have meaning in your life <unk> [MASK] you have to be an intelligent designer you have to deny the theory of evolution by[MASK] <unk> natural selection and i think on the contrary that it is very important to solving the world 's problems[MASK] that we take evolutionary biology seriously <unk> whose truth are we going to listen to [MASK] well this is from the[MASK] purpose driven life the bible must become the authoritative standard for my life <unk> the compass i rely on for direction the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark i use for evaluating[MASK] <unk> what 's going to follow from this <unk> and here 's one that does concern me[MASK] remember i quoted him before with this line surrendered people obey god 's word even if it doesn 't make sense [MASK] and <unk> that 's a problem [MASK] don 't ever argue with the devil he 's better at arguing than you are having had thousands of years to practice[MASK] <unk> rick warren didn 't invent this clever move <unk> it 's an old move <unk> [MASK] it 's a very clever adaptation of religions it 's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism [MASK] you don 't like my interpretation you 've got a reasonable objection to it don 't listen don 't listen <unk> that 's the devil speaking [MASK] this discourages the sort of reasoning[MASK] citizenship it seems to me that we want to have i 've got one more problem then i 'm through and i 'd really like to get a response if if[MASK] rick is is able to do it [MASK] in the great commission jesus said ' go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples <unk> baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and teach them to do[MASK] everything i 've told you ' the bible says jesus is the only one[MASK] <unk> who can save the world[MASK] we 've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so [MASK] here 's one not as beautiful as the others it simply shows the religions of the world <unk>[MASK] here 's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions [MASK] do we really want to commit ourselves to[MASK] <unk> engulfing all the other religions <unk> [MASK] when their holy books are telling them don 't listen to the other side [MASK] that 's just satan talking it seems to me that that 's[MASK] a very problematic[MASK] ship to get on for the future i found this sign as i was driving to maine recently[MASK] <unk> in front of a church good without god becomes zero sort of cute a very clever little meme <unk> [MASK] i don 't believe it[MASK] and i think this idea <unk> popular as it is not in this guise but in general is itself one of the main problems that we face if you are[MASK] <unk> who are being very good without god and you also know many religious people who[MASK] hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works [MASK] so i wish we could drop this meme <unk> i wish this meme would go extinct <unk> thanks very much[MASK]
