 <unk> know if you 've heard about it newspapers it 's a sort of[MASK] you know what they say they say the print media is dying who says that well the media but[MASK] this is no news right <unk> you 've read about it[MASK] already [MASK] ladies and gentlemen the world has gotten smaller[MASK] <unk> i know it 's a cliche but look look how small [MASK] how tiny it has gotten and you know the reason why of course this is because of technology[MASK] yeah [MASK] any computer designers in the room [MASK] yeah well[MASK] <unk> are making my life miserable because[MASK] track pads used to be round <unk> a nice round shape that makes a good cartoon <unk> but what are you going to do with a flat track pad <unk> those square things <unk> [MASK] there 's nothing i can do as a cartoonist [MASK] well i know the world is flat now [MASK] that 's true and the internet has reached every corner of the world <unk> the poorest the remotest places [MASK] every village in africa now has a cyber cafe[MASK] don 't go asking for a frappuccino there [MASK] so we are bridging the digital divide the third world is connected <unk> we are connected <unk> [MASK] and what happens next <unk> well <unk> you 've got mail[MASK] <unk> yeah well the internet has empowered us it has empowered you it has empowered me[MASK] and it has empowered some other guys as well [MASK] laughter you know these last two cartoons i did them live during a conference in hanoi[MASK] <unk> were not used to that in in[MASK] communist two point zero[MASK] vietnam so i was cartooning live on a on a wide screen it was quite a sensation and then this guy came to me he was[MASK] taking pictures of me and of my sketches and i thought this is great a vietnamese fan and as he came the second day[MASK] on the third day i finally understood the guy was actually on duty <unk> [MASK] so by now there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files[MASK] of the vietnamese police no but it[MASK] 's true the internet has changed the world it has rocked the music industry[MASK] <unk> it has changed the way we consume music for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store to steal it [MASK] and it has changed the way your future employer[MASK] will look at your application so be careful with that[MASK] facebook account your momma told you be careful <unk>[MASK] <unk> it has liberated us from the office desk <unk> this is your life <unk> [MASK] enjoy it [MASK] laughter in short technology the internet they have changed our[MASK] <unk> like this man that a german magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century they are shaping the way we do things they are shaping the way[MASK] we consume they are shaping our very desires[MASK] <unk> has even changed our relationship to god [MASK] now i shouldn 't get into this religion and political cartoons as you may have heard <unk> [MASK] make a difficult couple ever since that day[MASK] of two thousand and five when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world[MASK] demonstrations fatwa <unk> they provoked violence <unk> people died in the violence <unk> this was so sickening <unk> people died[MASK] because of cartoons <unk> i mean[MASK] i had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used[MASK] by both sides actually <unk> they were used first by a danish newspaper which wanted to make a point on islam[MASK] <unk> cartoonist told me he was one of the twenty four who received the assignment to draw the prophet twelve of them refused did you know that [MASK] he told me nobody has to tell me what i should draw <unk> this is not how it works [MASK] and then of course they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side they wanted to stir up controversy you know the story[MASK] <unk> we know that cartoons can be used as weapons history tells us they 've been used[MASK] by the nazis to attack the jews and here we are now [MASK] in the united nations half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion[MASK] they call it the defamation of religion while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech <unk> so[MASK] the clash of civilizations is here[MASK] <unk> cartoons are at the middle of it this got me thinking now you see me thinking[MASK] at my kitchen table and[MASK] since you 're in my kitchen please meet my wife [MASK] in two thousand and six a few months after <unk> i went ivory coast[MASK] western africa now <unk> talk of a divided place the country was cut in two you had a rebellion in the north <unk> the government in the south the capital abidjan[MASK] and in the middle <unk> the french army <unk> this looks like a giant hamburger you don 't want to be[MASK] the ham in the middle <unk> [MASK] i was there to report on that story[MASK] in cartoons i 've been doing this for the last[MASK] fifteen years it 's my side job if you want so you see the style is different this is[MASK] more serious than maybe editorial cartooning <unk> i went to places like[MASK] gaza during the war in two thousand and nine <unk> so this is really[MASK] journalism in cartoons you 'll hear more and more about it this is the future of journalism i think <unk> [MASK] and of course i went to see the rebels in the north[MASK] <unk> those were poor guys fighting for their rights there was[MASK] an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in africa <unk> and i went to see the dozo the dozo <unk> they are the traditional hunters[MASK] of west africa <unk> people fear them they help the rebellion a lot <unk> they are believed to have magical powers they can disappear[MASK] <unk> i went to see a dozo chief he told me about his magical powers <unk> he said i can chop your head off[MASK] right away and bring you back to life i said well maybe we don 't have time for this[MASK] right now another time so back in abidjan i was given a chance[MASK] to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and i thought yes[MASK] <unk> context like this cartoons can really be used as weapons[MASK] against the other side <unk> i mean <unk> the press in ivory coast was bitterly divided it was compared[MASK] to the media in rwanda before the genocide[MASK] so imagine <unk> and what can a cartoonist do sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see and the guy has to feed his family right[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] the idea was pretty simple we brought together cartoonists from all sides[MASK] in ivory coast we took them away from their newspaper for three days <unk> and i asked them to[MASK] do a project together <unk> tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons yes in cartoons <unk> show[MASK] <unk> it 's a great tool of communication for bad or for good [MASK] and cartoons can cross boundaries as you have seen and humor is a good way i think to address serious issues <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] i 'm very proud of what they did i mean they didn 't agree with each other that was not the point <unk> [MASK] and i didn 't ask them to do nice cartoons <unk> the first day they were even shouting at each other but they came up with a book <unk> looking back[MASK] at thirteen years[MASK] <unk> of political crisis in ivory coast <unk> [MASK] so the idea was there and i 've been doing projects like this [MASK] in two thousand and nine in lebanon <unk> this year in kenya back in january in lebanon it was not a book the idea was to[MASK] have the same principal a divided country take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something[MASK] <unk> we enrolled the newspaper editors <unk> and we got them to publish[MASK] eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page addressing the issue affecting lebanon like religion in[MASK] politics and everyday life and it worked for three days <unk> almost all the newspapers of beirut published all those cartoonists together[MASK] <unk> you name it <unk> so this was a great project and then in kenya what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity which is a poison[MASK] in a lot of places in africa <unk> and we did video clips[MASK] you can see them if you go to youtube[MASK] <unk> for freedom of speech is easy here <unk> but[MASK] as you have seen in contexts of repression or division <unk> again what can a cartoonist do he has to[MASK] to keep his job[MASK] <unk> well i believe that in any context anywhere [MASK] he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred and that 's the message[MASK] i try to convey to them <unk> i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing <unk> [MASK] but we need to support these[MASK] <unk> tech companies are the world 's largest editors they decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see [MASK] so really it 's not about the freedom of cartoonists <unk> it 's about your freedoms [MASK] and[MASK] for dictators all over the world <unk> [MASK] the good news is when[MASK] <unk> cartoonists journalists and activists shut up[MASK]
