 <unk> and raised in north korea <unk> [MASK] although my family constantly struggled against poverty <unk> i was always loved and cared for first [MASK] because i was the only son and the youngest of

five in the morning[MASK] and come back after midnight i would wander the streets searching for food <unk> and i remember seeing a small[MASK] <unk> tied to a mother 's back eating chips and wanting to steal them from him <unk> [MASK] hunger is humiliation hunger is hopelessness for a hungry child politics and freedom[MASK] are not even thought of on my ninth birthday <unk> my parents couldn 't give me any food to[MASK] eat but even as a child i could feel the heaviness in their hearts[MASK] <unk> over a million north koreans died of[MASK] starvation in that time [MASK] and in two thousand and three when i was thirteen years old <unk> my father became one of them <unk> [MASK] i saw my father wither away and die [MASK] in the same year <unk> my mother disappeared one day <unk> and then my sister told me that she was going to china to earn money[MASK] <unk> but that she would return with money and food soon [MASK] since we had never been separated <unk> and i thought we would be together forever[MASK] i didn 't even give her a hug when she left [MASK] it was the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life <unk> but again <unk> i didn 't know it was going to be a long goodbye [MASK] i have not seen my mom[MASK] or my sister since then [MASK] suddenly i became an orphan and homeless [MASK] my daily life became very hard but very simple <unk> [MASK] my goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash <unk> but that is no way to survive <unk> [MASK] <unk> not be the solution so i started to steal from food carts[MASK] in illegal markets <unk> sometimes <unk> i found small jobs[MASK] in exchange for food [MASK] once <unk> i even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine <unk> thirty three meters underground[MASK] without any protection for up to sixteen hours a day <unk> i was not[MASK] <unk> uncommon many other orphans survived this way <unk> or worse[MASK] when i could not fall asleep[MASK] from bitter cold or hunger pains <unk> [MASK] i hoped that the next morning my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food [MASK] that hope kept me alive[MASK] <unk> i don 't mean big <unk> grand hope i mean the kind of hope that made me believe[MASK] that the next trash can had bread even though it usually didn 't [MASK] but if i didn 't believe it i wouldn 't even try <unk> and then i would die hope kept me alive <unk>[MASK] <unk> i told myself no matter how hard things got still i must live [MASK] after three years of waiting for my sister 's return <unk> [MASK] i decided to go to china to look for her myself <unk> [MASK] i realized[MASK] i couldn 't survive much longer this way <unk> i knew the journey would be risky <unk> but i would be risking my life[MASK] <unk> either way i could die of starvation like my father in north korea <unk> or at least i could try[MASK] for a better life by escaping to china [MASK] i had learned that many people tried to cross the border to china[MASK] in the nighttime to avoid being seen north korean border guards often shoot and kill people[MASK] <unk> trying to cross the border without permission chinese soldiers[MASK] will catch and send back north koreans <unk> where they face severe punishment[MASK] <unk> i decided to cross during the day <unk> first because i was still a kid[MASK] and scared of the dark <unk> second because i knew i was already taking a risk[MASK] <unk> and since not many people tried to cross during the day <unk> i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone <unk> [MASK] i made it to china on february fifteen <unk> two thousand and six <unk> i was sixteen years old <unk> [MASK] i thought things in china would be easier <unk> since there was more food <unk> [MASK] i thought more people would help me <unk> but it was harder than[MASK] <unk> living in north korea <unk> because i was not free <unk> i was always worried about being caught and sent back [MASK] by a miracle <unk> some months later i met someone who was running an underground shelter for north koreans [MASK] and was allowed to live there[MASK] and eat regular meals for the first time in many years[MASK] later that year an activist helped me escape china and go to the united states as a refugee <unk> [MASK] i went to america without knowing a word of english <unk> yet my social worker told me that i had to go to high school <unk> [MASK] even in north korea <unk> i was an f[MASK] <unk> i barely finished elementary school <unk> and i remember i fought in school more than once a day <unk> textbooks and the library were not my playground <unk> [MASK] my father tried very hard to motivate me into studying <unk> but it didn 't work at one point <unk> my father gave up on me[MASK] <unk> hurt me deeply <unk> but nevertheless my level of motivation still didn 't[MASK] change before he died [MASK] so in america it was kind of ridiculous that they said i should go to high school <unk> [MASK] i didn 't even go to middle school <unk> i decided to go just because they told me to without trying much [MASK] but one day i came[MASK] <unk> home[MASK] and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner <unk> [MASK] and during dinner <unk> i wanted to have one more wing <unk> [MASK] but i realized there were not enough for everyone so i decided against it [MASK] when i looked down at my plate <unk> i saw the last chicken wing <unk> that my foster father had given me his [MASK] i was so happy[MASK] <unk> looked at him sitting next to me he just looked back at me very warmly <unk> but said no words <unk> [MASK] suddenly i remembered my biological father [MASK] my foster father 's small act of love reminded me of my father who would love to share his food with me[MASK] when he was hungry even if he was starving[MASK] i felt so suffocated that i had so much food in america <unk> yet my father died of starvation [MASK] my only wish that night was to cook a meal for him <unk> [MASK] and that night i also thought of what else i could do to to honor him <unk> [MASK] and my answer was to promise to myself that i would study hard[MASK] and get the best education in[MASK] <unk> america to honor his sacrifice <unk> [MASK] i took school seriously <unk> [MASK] and for the first time ever in my life i received an academic award for excellence and made dean 's list[MASK] from the first semester in high school[MASK] <unk> is personal hope is something that no one can give to you [MASK] you have to choose to believe in hope you have to make it yourself <unk> [MASK] in north korea i made it myself hope brought me to america[MASK] but in america <unk> i didn 't know what to do because i had this overwhelming freedom [MASK] my foster father at that dinner gave me a direction [MASK] and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in america <unk> [MASK] i did not come here by myself <unk> i had hope but[MASK] <unk> hope by itself is not enough many people helped me along the way to get here [MASK] north koreans are fighting hard to survive [MASK] they have to force themselves to survive have hope to survive <unk> [MASK] but they cannot make it without help [MASK] this is my message to you have hope[MASK] for yourself <unk> but also help each other [MASK] life can be hard for everyone <unk> wherever you live [MASK] my foster father didn 't intend to change my life in the same way you may also change someone 's life with[MASK] <unk> smallest act of love [MASK] a piece of bread can satisfy your hunger <unk> [MASK] and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive <unk> but i confidently believe that[MASK] your act of love and caring[MASK] can also save another joseph 's life and change[MASK] thousands of other josephs[MASK] <unk> who are still having hope to survive[MASK]
