 <unk> both myself and my brother belong to the under thirty demographic <unk> which pat said makes seventy percent but according to our statistics it makes sixty percent of the region 's population [MASK] qatar is no exception to the region it 's a very young nation led by young people we have been[MASK] <unk> reminiscing about the latest technologies and the ipods and for me the abaya my traditional dress that i 'm wearing today <unk> [MASK] now this is not a religious garment nor is it a religious statement <unk> instead <unk> it 's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear [MASK] now i remember a few years ago [MASK] a journalist asked dr sheikha who 's sitting here <unk> president of qatar university who by the way is a woman[MASK] he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way [MASK] her answer was quite the contrary <unk> [MASK] instead she felt more free [MASK] more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care [MASK] not that you do[MASK] <unk> just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono <unk> [MASK] we are changing our culture from within <unk> but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions <unk> [MASK] we know that modernization is happening and yes qatar wants to be a modern nation but at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our arab heritage [MASK] it 's important for us to grow organically <unk> and we continuously make the conscious[MASK] <unk> decision to reach that balance in fact <unk> research has shown that the more the world is flat if i use tom friedman 's analogy or global [MASK] the more and more people are wanting to be different and for us young people they 're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves <unk> [MASK] which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the[MASK] <unk> global <unk> we don 't want to be all the same but we want to respect each other and understand each other and therefore tradition becomes more important not less important <unk> [MASK] life necessitates a universal world however we believe in the security of having a local identity <unk> [MASK] and this is what the leaders of this region are trying to do <unk> [MASK] we 're trying to be part of this global village but at the same time we 're revising[MASK] <unk> ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development <unk> [MASK] i 'm a representation of that phenomenon <unk> [MASK] and i think a lot of people in this room i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself and i 'm sure although we can 't see the people in washington they are in the same position we 're continuously <unk>[MASK] <unk> trying to straddle different worlds different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves[MASK] <unk> and from others <unk> [MASK] so i want to ask a question what should culture in the 21st century look like [MASK] in a time where the world is becoming personalized when the mobile phone the burger the telephone everything has its own personal identity how should we perceive ourselves <unk>[MASK] and how should we perceive others <unk> how does that impact our desert culture [MASK] <unk> cultural developments happening in the region and the more recent museum of islamic art opened in qatar in two thousand and eight [MASK] i myself am personalizing these cultural developments <unk> but i also understand that this has to be done organically <unk> [MASK] yes <unk> we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions[MASK] <unk> what i think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can 't happen from outside it has to come from within <unk> [MASK] and guess what you might be surprised to know that most people in the gulf who are leading leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women [MASK] i want to ask you why do you think this is [MASK] is it because it 's a soft option we have nothing else to do no i don 't think so i think that[MASK] <unk> women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally [MASK] it 's a natural component for bringing people together discussing ideas in the same way we 're doing here at ted we 're[MASK] here we 're part of a community <unk> sharing out ideas and discussing them [MASK] art becomes a very important part of our national identity [MASK] the existential[MASK] <unk> and social and political impact[MASK] an artist has on his nation 's development of cultural identity is very important [MASK] you know art and culture is big business <unk> ask me ask the chairpersons and ceos of sotheby 's and christie 's ask charles saatchi about great art [MASK] they make a lot of money so i think women in our society are becoming leaders[MASK] <unk> because they realize that[MASK] for their future generations it 's very important to maintain our cultural identities <unk> [MASK] why else do greeks demand the return of the elgin marbles <unk> and why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum [MASK] why does it take me months[MASK] <unk> months on end to get an export license from london or new york in order to get pieces into my country [MASK] in few hours shirin neshat my friend from iran who 's a very important artist for us will be talking to you she lives in new york city but she doesn 't[MASK] try to be a western artist <unk> instead she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture nation and heritage she does that through[MASK] <unk> important visual forms of photography and film [MASK] in the same way qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within <unk> [MASK] our mission is of cultural integration and independence <unk> we don 't want to have what there is in the west we don 't want their collections we want to build our own identities our own fabric <unk>[MASK] <unk> create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us [MASK] <unk> modern art we have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists <unk> and arabs who are not muslims not all arabs are muslims by the way but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution [MASK] this institution is is <unk>[MASK] and it has been the case for the past three decades <unk>[MASK] <unk> we will open the museum in a few days and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us [MASK] now this museum is just as important to us as the west <unk> [MASK] some of you might have heard of the algerian artist baya mahieddine [MASK] but i doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in picasso 's studio in paris in the[MASK] <unk> for me it was a new discovery and i think with time in the years to come we 'll be learning a lot about our picassos our legers and our cezannes <unk> we do have artists but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet <unk> [MASK] now visual expression is just one form of of culture integration [MASK] we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social networking to express their stories share their[MASK] <unk> photos and tell their own stories through their own voices in a similar way we have created the doha film institute <unk> [MASK] now the doha film institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking <unk> last year we didn 't have one qatari woman filmmaker [MASK] today i am proud to say we have trained and educated over sixty six qatari women filmmakers to edit tell their own stories in their own voices[MASK] now if you 'll allow me i would love to share a one minute film that has proven to show that a 60 sec film can be as powerful <unk>[MASK] <unk> as a haiku in telling a big picture <unk> and this is one of our filmmakers ' products[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> going back to straddling between east and west <unk> last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha [MASK] the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub katara it attracted forty two thousand[MASK] <unk> now the doha tribeca film festival is not an imported festival <unk> but rather an important festival between the cities of new york and doha <unk> [MASK] it 's important for two things <unk> first it allows us to showcase our arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world new york city <unk> [MASK] at the same time we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world <unk> they 're learning our culture our language our heritage and realizing we[MASK] <unk> 're just as different and just the same as each other <unk> [MASK] now over and over again people have said let 's build bridges and frankly i want to do more than that i would like break the walls of ignorance between <unk>[MASK] <unk> east and west no not the soft option that we have discussed before <unk> but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before [MASK] <unk> bring people together we should not underestimate it know thyself that is the journey of <unk>[MASK] <unk> that we are traveling <unk> now i don 't pretend to have all the answers <unk> but i know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading [MASK] <unk> very interesting journey i[MASK] welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions <unk> [MASK] familiarity destroys and trumps fear try it ladies and gentlemen thank you very much shokran[MASK]
