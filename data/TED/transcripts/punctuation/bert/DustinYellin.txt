 <unk> i was raised by lesbians in the mountains and i sort of came like a forest gnome to new york city a while back really messed with my head but i[MASK] 'll get into that later i[MASK] i 'll start with[MASK] when i was eight years old i took a wood box [MASK] and i buried a dollar bill a pen and a fork inside this box in colorado <unk> [MASK] and i thought some strange humanoids or aliens in five hundred years would find this box[MASK] and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas <unk> maybe how we ate our spaghetti <unk> i really didn 't know <unk> [MASK] anyway this is kind of funny because here i am <unk> thirty years later <unk> and i 'm still making boxes[MASK] <unk> now <unk> at some point i was in hawaii i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff and i was making a collage for my ma <unk> and i took[MASK] a dictionary and i ripped it up and i made it into a sort of agnes martin grid <unk> and i poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck now she 's afraid of bees and she 's allergic to them so i poured more resin on the canvas thinking i could hide it or something <unk> [MASK] instead the opposite[MASK] <unk> happened <unk> it sort of created a magnification like a magnifying glass on the dictionary text[MASK] so what did i do i built more boxes <unk> [MASK] this time <unk> i started putting electronics <unk> frogs [MASK] strange bottles i 'd find in the street anything i could find because i was always finding things my whole life and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects <unk> [MASK] so i started[MASK] drawing around the objects and i realized[MASK] holy moly i can draw in space i can make free floating lines <unk> like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene so i took the objects out <unk> and i created my own taxonomy of invented specimens <unk> first botanical[MASK] which you can kind of get a sense of then i made some weird insects and creatures[MASK] <unk> i was just drawing on the layers of resin <unk> and it was cool because i was actually starting to have shows and stuff [MASK] i was making some money i could take my girlfriend for dinner and like go to sizzler it was some good shit man at[MASK] some point[MASK] i got up to the human form life size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers <unk> this was great except for one thing [MASK] i was going to die [MASK] i didn 't know what to do because the resin was going to kill me[MASK] and i went to bed every night thinking about it so i tried using glass <unk> [MASK] i started drawing on the layers of glass almost like if you drew on a window <unk> then you put another window <unk> and another window <unk> and you had all these windows together that made a <unk> three dimensional composition [MASK] and this really worked because i could stop using the resin [MASK] so i did this for years[MASK] <unk> it 's kind of ahead of its time they say <unk> so the triptych i 'll walk you through this piece it weighs twenty four thousand pounds <unk> it 's eighteen[MASK] <unk> that 's the blood fountain [MASK] to[MASK] the left you have jesus and the locusts there 's a cave where all these animal headed creatures travel between two worlds they go from the representational world to this <unk>[MASK] <unk> hiding <unk> this is where the animal headed creatures are by the lighthouse and they 're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean[MASK] <unk> is made up of[MASK] thousands of elements <unk> this is a bird god tied up to a battleship [MASK] billy graham is in the ocean <unk> the horizon from the oil spill waldo osama bin laden 's shelter[MASK] there 's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard in the ocean anyway this is a lady creature she 's coming out of the ocean[MASK] <unk> and she 's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand her hands are like scales and she[MASK] has the mythological reference of the earth and cosmos in balance [MASK] so that 's one side of the triptych it 's a little narrative thing that 's her hand that she 's spitting into [MASK] and then when you go to the other side she has like a trunk like a bird 's beak and she 's spitting clouds out of her trunk <unk> then she has an[MASK] <unk> on fire from the back of the volcano i don 't know why that happened [MASK] that happens[MASK] you know her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball made out of one thousand nine hundred and eighty six terrorist cards have you guys seen those they were made in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's they 're like baseball cards of terrorists way ahead of their time[MASK] <unk> two projects one 's called psychogeographies [MASK] it 's about a six year project to make one hundred of these humans each one is an archive of our culture through our ripped up media and matter whether it 's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines [MASK] but each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human and they travel in groups of twenty four or twelve[MASK] <unk> like cells they come together they divide and you kind of walk through them it 's taking me years each one is basically a <unk>[MASK] microscope slide with a human stuck inside [MASK] this one has a little cave in his chest [MASK] that 's his head there 's the chest you can kind of see the beginning i 'm going to go down the body for you <unk> there 's a waterfall coming out[MASK] of his chest <unk>[MASK] <unk> take you quickly through these works because i can 't explain them for too long there are the layers you can kind of see it[MASK] that 's a body getting split in half this one has two heads and it 's communicating between the two heads [MASK] you can see the pills coming out going into one head from this weird statue there 's a[MASK] <unk> little forest scene inside the chest cavity can you see that anyway this talk 's all about these boxes like the boxes we 're in [MASK] this box we 're in the solar system is a box this brings you to my latest box it 's[MASK] a brick box it 's called pioneer works inside[MASK] of this box is a physicist a[MASK] neuroscientist a painter a musician a writer a radio station a museum <unk> a school[MASK] <unk> a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world <unk> a garden [MASK] we shake this box up and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles <unk> [MASK] and i think that 's the way you change the world[MASK] you redefine your insides and the box that you 're living in <unk> and you come together to realize that we 're all in this together that this delusion of difference this idea of countries[MASK] of borders of religion[MASK] doesn 't work <unk> [MASK] we 're all really made up of the same stuff in the same box and if we don 't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely we 're all going to die real soon <unk> [MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
