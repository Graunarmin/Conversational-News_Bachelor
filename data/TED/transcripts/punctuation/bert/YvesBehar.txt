 <unk> being a child and sort of crawling around the house i remember these turkish carpets[MASK] <unk> and there were these scenes these battle scenes these love scenes[MASK] <unk> i mean look this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this from this soldier and[MASK] my mom took these pictures actually[MASK] <unk> last week of our carpets and i remember this to this day there was another object this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity[MASK] pretty scary stuff when you 're a little kid what i remember today from this is that[MASK] objects tell stories so storytelling[MASK] has been a really strong influence in my work and then there was[MASK] <unk> influence i was a teenager and at fifteen or sixteen i guess like all teenagers we want to just do what we love and what we believe in and so <unk>[MASK] <unk> i fused together the two things i loved the most which was skiing and windsurfing those are pretty good escapes from the the drab weather in[MASK] <unk> in switzerland <unk> so[MASK] created this compilation of the two i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there and[MASK] some foot straps and some metal fins <unk> and here i was going really fast on frozen lakes[MASK] it was really a death trap i mean it was incredible it worked incredibly well but it was really dangerous <unk> and i realized then i had to go to design school[MASK] laughter so i went to design school <unk> and[MASK] it was the early ' 90s when i finished and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley so i wanted to be there and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes [MASK] that it had to change in order to to[MASK] be with us[MASK] <unk> in our homes <unk> and[MASK] so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy and we would get in to these meetings and these managers would come in[MASK] <unk> and they would say well what we 're going to do here is really important you know and they would give the projects code names you[MASK] know mostly from star wars actually [MASK] things like <unk>[MASK] <unk> yoda luke <unk>[MASK] <unk> in anticipation i would be this young designer in the back of the room and i would raise my hand and i would ask questions <unk> i mean in retrospect probably stupid questions [MASK] but things like [MASK] what 's this caps lock key for[MASK] <unk> 't really want to change the legacy stuff they didn 't want to change the insides they were really looking for us the designers to create the skins[MASK] <unk> to put some some pretty stuff outside of the of the box <unk> and i didn 't want to be a[MASK] <unk> what i wanted to do i didn 't want to be a stylist in this way <unk> and then i saw this quote advertising is the price[MASK] companies pay for being unoriginal [MASK] so i had to start on my own so i moved to san francisco and i[MASK] started a little company fuseproject and what i wanted to work on is important stuff <unk> and i wanted to[MASK] <unk> not just work on the skins but i wanted to work on the entire human experience <unk> and[MASK] so the first projects were sort of humble but they took technology and maybe made it into into things that people[MASK] would would use in a new way and maybe finding some new functionality <unk> this is a watch we made for mini cooper <unk> [MASK] the car company right when it launched <unk> and it 's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical[MASK] <unk> and that allows me to check my timer discretely here without bending my elbow and other projects which were really about transformation about[MASK] matching the human need this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer and it ships completely flat <unk> and then it folds into[MASK] a coffee table and a stool and whatnot and something a little bit more experimental <unk> this is a[MASK] <unk> light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape so it goes from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight [MASK] and just by drawing on a little[MASK] computer tablet the entire light fixture adjusts to what what shape you want <unk> [MASK] and then finally the leaf lamp for herman miller <unk> this is a pretty involved process it took us about four and a half years but i really was looking for creating[MASK] a unique experience of light a new experience of light <unk> so we had to design both[MASK] the light[MASK] and the light bulb and that that 's a unique opportunity i would say in design and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from[MASK] a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light so the light[MASK] <unk> bulb actually does that it allows the person to switch and to mix these two colorations and it 's done in a very simple way one just touches the base <unk>[MASK] of the light and on one side you can mix the brightness <unk> and on the other the[MASK] <unk> and i think as designers we need to really think about how[MASK] we can create a different relationship between our work and the world[MASK] whether it 's for business or as i 'm going to show on some civic type projects because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value[MASK] value to business <unk> value to[MASK] <unk> but i think it 's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater[MASK] the greater value and the values we bring can be[MASK] about environmental issues about sustainability about lower power consumption you[MASK] know they can be about function and beauty <unk> they can be about business strategy but designers are really the glue[MASK] <unk> is a project that you 're familiar with <unk> and[MASK] it has a humanistic technology <unk> it feels your skin <unk> it rests on your skin and it knows when it is you 're talking <unk> and[MASK] by knowing when it is you 're talking it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about which is the the environmental noises [MASK] but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to[MASK] take out all the[MASK] <unk> techie stuff <unk> and all the nerdy stuff out of it and try to make it as beautiful as as we can i mean think about it the care we take in[MASK] selecting sunglasses or jewelry <unk> or accessories is is really[MASK] important so if it isn 't beautiful it really doesn 't belong on your face <unk> and[MASK] this is what we 're pursuing here <unk> but how[MASK] <unk> we work[MASK] on jawbone is really unique [MASK] i want to point at something here on the left [MASK] this is the board this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work <unk> but this is the design process there 's somebody changing the board <unk> putting tracers on the board <unk>[MASK] changing the location of the ics as the designers on the other side are doing the work so it 's not about slapping skins <unk> anymore on a technology[MASK] it 's really about designing from the inside out and then on the other side of the room <unk> the designers are making small adjustments sketching drawing by hand[MASK] <unk> putting it in the computer <unk> and[MASK] it 's what i call being design driven you know there is some push and pull but design is really[MASK] helping define the whole experience from the inside out and then of course <unk> design is never done[MASK] <unk> done <unk> and this is the other new way that is unique in how we work is because it 's never done you have to do <unk> all this other stuff the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch[MASK] the user in many ways <unk> but how do you retain somebody when it 's never done[MASK] <unk> really understands that[MASK] you need a different structure so in a way <unk> the different structure is that we 're partners it 's a partnership[MASK] we can continue to work and and dedicate ourselves to this project <unk> and then we also share in the rewards <unk> and here 's another[MASK] <unk> this is called y water <unk> and it 's this guy from[MASK] from los angeles thomas arndt <unk> austrian originally <unk> who came to us <unk> and all he wanted to do was to create[MASK] a healthy drink or an organic drink[MASK] for his kids to replace the <unk>[MASK] <unk> sodas that he 's trying to get them away from [MASK] <unk> we worked on this bottle and it 's completely symmetrical in every dimension <unk> and this allows the bottle to turn into[MASK] a game the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes [MASK] different forms thank you [MASK] and then while we were doing this [MASK] the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y <unk> and then we thought well[MASK] <unk> words why and why not are probably the most important words that kids ask so we called it y water <unk> [MASK] and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room the three dimensional design[MASK] <unk> the ideas <unk> the branding it all becomes deeply connected <unk> and then the other thing about this project is[MASK] <unk> intellectual property <unk> we bring a marketing approach we bring all this stuff but i think at the end of the day what we bring is these values and these values create a soul for the companies we work with <unk> [MASK] and it 's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it [MASK] here 's another project which i think really[MASK] <unk> is incredible in nigeria people carry their most precious belongings on their heads this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head i mean to me [MASK] it just means so much[MASK] <unk> but when nicholas negroponte and he has spoken about this project[MASK] <unk> about two and a half years ago <unk> there were some clear ideas <unk> he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology and those are pillars of his life but also pillars of the mission of of[MASK] one laptop per child <unk> but the the third pillar that he that he talked[MASK] <unk> wasn 't really working on computers i didn 't really want to from the previous adventure but what he said was was really significant is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product how we were going to make it low cost robust[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] plus he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key and[MASK] the num lock key[MASK] we designed it to be iconic to look different to look like it 's for a kid but not like a toy <unk> [MASK] and then the integration of all these great technologies which you 've heard about the wi fi antennas that allow the kids to connect [MASK] the screen which you can read in sunlight [MASK] the keyboard[MASK] which is made out of rubber and it 's protected from the environment you know all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and[MASK] the olpc people and the engineers they fought the suppliers they fought[MASK] <unk> projects like this one[MASK] allows the process from not destroying the original idea <unk> and i think this is something really important <unk> [MASK] so <unk> now you get these pictures you get up in the morning and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay[MASK] with their computers and in mongolia[MASK] <unk> and we went away from obviously the beige i mean it 's colorful it 's fun in fact you can see each logo is is a little bit different [MASK] it 's because we were able[MASK] to to run during the manufacturing process twenty colors for the x and the o which is the name of the[MASK] computer <unk> and by mixing them on on the manufacturing floor you get twenty times twenty you get four hundred different[MASK] <unk> there so the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible <unk> but this is my nephew anthony in switzerland [MASK] and he had the laptop for for an afternoon and i had to take it back it was hard [MASK] and it was a prototype and a month and a half later i come back to switzerland <unk> and there he is playing playing with his own version[MASK] like paper paper and cardboard so i 'm[MASK] going to finish with one one last project and this is a little bit more of adult play [MASK] some of you might have heard about the new york city condom <unk> it 's[MASK] <unk> actually launched on valentine 's day february fourteen <unk> about ten days ago <unk> so <unk> the department of health[MASK] in new york came to us <unk> and they needed a way to[MASK] distribute thirty six million condoms for free to the citizens of new york so a pretty big endeavor <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] <unk> you have to know where it is[MASK] and what it does and we also designed the condoms themselves <unk> and i was just in new york at the launch[MASK] <unk> and i went to see all these places where they 're installed this is at a puerto rican[MASK] little mom and pop store <unk> at a bar in christopher street at a pool hall[MASK] <unk> i mean they 're being installed in homeless clinics everywhere of course <unk> clubs and discos [MASK] too and here 's the public service announcement for this project[MASK] <unk> this is really where design is able to create a conversation[MASK] <unk> it was breaking the ice <unk> it was getting over a stigma and i think that 's also what design can do [MASK] so i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot <unk> but i 'm not sure it 's the[MASK] <unk> i have more you can always ask me for for some some more later [MASK] and if anybody asks why you 're carrying a condom you can just say you like the design[MASK] <unk> the companies we work with <unk> and it 's[MASK]
