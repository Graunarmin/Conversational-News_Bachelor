 <unk> so let me start by taking you back back into the mists of your memory[MASK] to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life <unk> but certainly the most anticipated year in all[MASK] <unk> all human history the year two thousand <unk> remember that[MASK] the dotcom bubble <unk> stressing about whose party you 're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight <unk> [MASK] before the champagne goes flat <unk> and then there 's that inchoate yearning that was felt <unk> i think by many [MASK] that the millennium that the year two thousand should mean more more than just a two and some zeroes[MASK] our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment[MASK] and back in two thousand agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff [MASK] visionary measurable long term targets called the millennium development goals [MASK] now i 'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow <unk> [MASK] or by the bedside table <unk> but just in case you don 't <unk> and your memory needs some jogging <unk> the deal agreed then goes like[MASK] <unk> this developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty hunger and deaths from disease alongside some other targets by two thousand and fifteen <unk> [MASK] and developed nations promised to help them[MASK] get that done[MASK] by dropping debts increasing smart aid and trade reform <unk> well we 're approaching two thousand and fifteen so[MASK] <unk> how are we doing on these goals <unk> but we 've also got to decide do we like such global goals some people don 't <unk> [MASK] and if we like them we 've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward <unk> what does the world want to do together we 've got to decide a process by which we decide [MASK] well i definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through <unk> and here 's just a few reasons why <unk> incredible[MASK] partnerships between the private sector political leaders philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world but also[MASK] two hundred and fifty thousand people marched in the streets of edinburgh outside this very building for make poverty history <unk> all together they achieved these results <unk> [MASK] increased the number of people on[MASK] <unk> four million lives will be saved <unk> and combined this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year last year than in the year two thousand that 's five <unk>[MASK] <unk> thousand fewer kids dying every day <unk> ten times you lot not dead every day <unk> because of all of these partnerships [MASK] <unk> news is probably the subject of a different tedtalk [MASK] anyway for now anyone involved in getting these results <unk> thank you <unk> i think this proved these goals are worth it but there 's still a lot of unfinished business <unk> [MASK] still <unk> seven point six million children die every year of preventable treatable diseases <unk> [MASK] and one hundred and seventy eight million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting a horrible term which means physical and cognitive[MASK] <unk> lifelong impairment <unk> so there 's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we 've got but then a lot of people think[MASK] there are things that should have been in the original package that weren 't agreed back then that should now be included like sustainable development targets [MASK] natural resource governance targets <unk> access to opportunity to knowledge[MASK] equity <unk> fighting corruption[MASK] <unk> this is measurable and could be in the new goals <unk> but the key thing here is what do you think should be in the new goals what do you want[MASK] are you annoyed that i didn 't talk about gender equality or or education should those be in the new package of goals [MASK] and quite frankly that 's a good question but there 's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be[MASK] <unk> as we gather here in edinburgh <unk> [MASK] technocrats appointed by the u n and certain governments with the best intentions are busying themselves designing a new package of goals <unk> [MASK] and currently they 're doing that through pretty much the same old <unk>[MASK] elite closed process [MASK] but of course since then the web and mobile telephony <unk> along with ubiquitous reality tv formats have spread all around the world [MASK] so what we 'd like to propose is that we use them[MASK] <unk> to involve people from all around the world in an historic first [MASK] the world 's first truly global poll and consultation [MASK] where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time <unk> i mean wouldn 't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this given that we can [MASK] there 's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake[MASK] <unk> tens of millions of lives or deaths at stake and i 'd argue <unk> the security and future of you and your family is also at stake <unk> [MASK] so if you 're with me <unk> i 'd say there 's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign collecting connecting and committing <unk> [MASK] so first of all we 've got to ground this campaign in core polling data let 's go into every country that will let us in[MASK] <unk> one people what they want the new goals to be making special efforts to reach the poorest those without access to modern technology and let 's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward [MASK] then we 've got to[MASK] commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward the original goals didn 't really have good baseline[MASK] <unk> and we 're going to need the help of big data through all through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress and then we 've got to connect with the big crowd <unk> [MASK] now here we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts <unk> telecoms companies[MASK] <unk> reality tv show formats[MASK] <unk> gaming companies <unk> telecoms all of them together in kind of their[MASK] <unk> we are the world moment [MASK] could they come together and help the millennium development goals get rebranded into the millennial generation 's goals <unk> and if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment [MASK] and that comment turned into a commitment we could crowdsource a force of three hundred million people around the world to help see these goals through <unk> [MASK] <unk> if we have this collected data <unk> and this connected crowd <unk> based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit i think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations <unk> [MASK] but the question really is through this process will we all have become committed <unk> [MASK] and if we are are we ready to iterate monitor and provide feedback make sure these promises are really delivering results <unk> [MASK] well there 's some[MASK] fantastic examples here to scale up <unk> mostly piloted within africa actually there 's open data kenya which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are are they delivering results often they 're not in the right place and[MASK] ushahidi which means witness in swahili <unk> which geocodes and crowdsources information[MASK] in complex emergencies to help target responses [MASK] this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy where citizens on the edge of a network are helping[MASK] <unk> to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague[MASK] stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level[MASK] and inverts that pyramid [MASK] this openness this forcing openness is key <unk> and if it wasn 't entirely transparent already <unk> i should be open <unk> i 've got a[MASK] <unk> trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live [MASK] with population increases <unk> consumption patterns increasing and conflict over scarce natural resources <unk> [MASK] and look at the state of global politics today look at the rio earth summit that happened just last week <unk> or the mexican <unk> g20 also last week <unk> [MASK] <unk> our world leaders our global politics currently can 't get it done [MASK] they need our help [MASK] they need the cavalry and the cavalry 's not going to come from mars it 's got to come from us [MASK] and i see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the[MASK] <unk> to really build that constituency that 's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century <unk> i started[MASK] in two thousand let me finish in two thousand and thirty <unk> [MASK] many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called make poverty history <unk> [MASK] it was a naive thought in many people 's minds <unk> and it 's true it was just a t shirt slogan that worked for the[MASK] <unk> but look [MASK] the empirical condition of living under a dollar and twenty five is trending down <unk> and look where it gets to by two thousand and thirty it 's getting near zero <unk> [MASK] now sure progress in china and india and poverty reduction there was key to that [MASK] but recently also in africa poverty rates are being reduced it will get harder as we get towards zero <unk> [MASK] as the poor will be increasingly located in[MASK] <unk> fragile states or maybe in middle income states where they don 't really care about the marginalized <unk> [MASK] but i 'm confident with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one [MASK] i think we can get this and other goals done <unk> [MASK] <unk> was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy[MASK] or where say a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces i mean[MASK] it would be all over the news for a week right you just put up just as one of your numbers there that[MASK] five thousand is that that the number[MASK] everything that is actually on our news agenda <unk> and it 's invisible [MASK] this must drive you crazy jd it does <unk> and we 're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels for example and aid alone is not the whole solution nobody thinks it is [MASK] but you know [MASK] if people saw the results of this smart aid i mean they 'd be going crazy for it [MASK] i wish the two hundred and fifty thousand people who really did march outside[MASK] <unk> this very building[MASK] knew these results <unk> right now they don 't <unk> and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it because we have not [MASK] creatively we 've failed to communicate this success so far [MASK] if those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments i know for a fact we 'd get better policy [MASK] the mexican <unk> g20 need not have been a bust <unk> rio if anyone cares about the environment need not have been[MASK] <unk> a bust <unk> okay but these conferences are going on and i know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept but actually <unk> the bits that are are making a difference <unk>[MASK] and what the politicians need is more permission from the public ca but you haven 't fully worked out the web mechanisms etc by which this might happen <unk> i mean if the people here who 've had experience using open platforms you 're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this[MASK] <unk> absolutely ca all right well i must say <unk> if[MASK] this conference led in some way to advancing that idea that 's a huge idea and if you carry that forward <unk> that is really awesome so thank you[MASK]
