 <unk> i 'm going to show you are[MASK] the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body <unk> now molecules are really really tiny <unk> [MASK] <unk> i mean[MASK] really [MASK] they 're smaller than a wavelength of light so we have no way to directly observe them <unk> [MASK] but through science we do have a fairly good idea of what 's going on down at the molecular scale <unk> [MASK] so what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules <unk> but we don 't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules one way around this is to draw pictures and[MASK] this idea is actually nothing new scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process they[MASK] <unk> draw pictures of what they 're observing with their eyes through technology like telescopes and microscopes <unk> and also what they 're thinking about in their minds [MASK] i picked two well known examples because they 're very <unk> well known for expressing science through art <unk> [MASK] and i start with galileo <unk> who used the world 's first telescope to look at the moon <unk> and he transformed our understanding[MASK] <unk> century was the moon was a perfect heavenly sphere <unk> but what galileo saw was a rocky barren world which he expressed through his watercolor painting[MASK] another scientist with very big ideas the superstar of biology is charles darwin and with this famous entry in his notebook he begins in the top <unk> left hand corner with i think [MASK] and then sketches out the first tree of life <unk> which is his perception of how all the species all living things on earth are connected through evolutionary history[MASK] the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population[MASK] <unk> even as a scientist [MASK] i used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work until <unk>[MASK] <unk> i encountered the artworks of david goodsell who is a molecular biologist at the scripps institute [MASK] accurate and it 's all to scale <unk> and his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like <unk> so this is a transection through blood in the top left hand corner <unk>[MASK] you 've got this yellow green area the yellow green area is the fluid of blood which is mostly water but it 's also antibodies sugars <unk> [MASK] <unk> and those red molecules are hemoglobin they are actually red that 's what gives blood its color [MASK] and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body <unk> [MASK] i was very much inspired by this image many years ago and i wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world what would it look like <unk> [MASK] and that 's how i really began <unk> [MASK] so let 's begin this is dna in its classic double helix form[MASK] <unk> so it 's an accurate model of dna <unk> [MASK] if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands you see these things that look like teeth those are the letters of genetic code the twenty five thousand genes you 've got written in your dna this is what they typically <unk>[MASK] <unk> talk about the genetic code this is what they 're talking about but i want to talk about a different aspect of dna science <unk> and that is the physical nature of dna it 's these two strands that run in opposite directions for[MASK] <unk> reasons i can 't go into right now but they physically run in opposite directions which creates a number of complications for your living cells [MASK] as you 're about to see most particularly when dna is being copied [MASK] and so what i 'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that 's occurring right now inside your body at least two thousand and two[MASK] biology <unk> so dna 's entering the production line from the left hand side <unk> and it hits this collection these miniature biochemical machines that are pulling apart the dna strand and making an[MASK] <unk> exact copy <unk> so dna comes in and hits this blue doughnut shaped structure and it 's ripped apart into its two strands [MASK] one strand can be copied directly and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there but things aren 't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards <unk> so it 's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time <unk> [MASK] creating two new dna molecules now you have billions of this[MASK] <unk> machine right now working away inside you copying your dna with exquisite fidelity <unk> [MASK] it 's an accurate representation and it 's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you i 've left out error correction and a bunch of other things [MASK] this was work from a number of years ago thank you [MASK] <unk> this is work from a number of years ago but what i 'll show you next is updated science it 's updated technology <unk> so again we begin with dna <unk> and it 's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules which i 've stripped away so you can see something [MASK] dna is about two nanometers across which is really quite tiny <unk> but in each one of your cells each strand of dna is about thirty to forty million nanometers long [MASK] so to keep the dna organized and regulate access to the genetic code[MASK] <unk> it 's wrapped around these purple proteins or i 've labeled them purple here [MASK] it 's packaged up and bundled up all this field of view is a single strand of dna <unk> [MASK] this huge package of dna is called a chromosome and we 'll come back to chromosomes in a minute [MASK] we 're pulling out we 're zooming out out through a nuclear pore which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the dna called the nucleus [MASK] all of this field of view is[MASK] about a semester 's worth of biology and i 've got seven minutes so[MASK] <unk> going to be able to do that today no i 'm being told no [MASK] this is the way a living cell looks down a light light microscope and it 's been filmed under time lapse which is why you can see it moving [MASK] the nuclear envelope breaks down these sausage shaped things are the chromosomes and we 'll focus on them <unk> [MASK] they go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots[MASK] <unk> when the cell feels it 's ready to go [MASK] it rips apart the chromosome <unk> one set of dna goes to one side the other side gets the other set of dna identical copies of dna <unk> and then the cell splits down the middle and again you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you [MASK] now we 're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes <unk> and look at its structure and describe it so again here we are at that equator moment [MASK] the chromosomes line up and if we isolate just one[MASK] <unk> chromosome we 're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure <unk> so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have at least as far as we 've discovered so far inside of us <unk> [MASK] so this is a single chromosome <unk> and you have two strands of dna in each chromosome one is bundled up into one sausage the other strand[MASK] is bundled up into the other sausage <unk> these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell[MASK] <unk> that name 's not important but we 're going to focus on the region labeled red here and it 's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes <unk> it is[MASK] obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes we have no idea really as to how it 's achieving that movement we 've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study <unk> [MASK] and we 're still just beginning to discover what it 's about it is made up of about two[MASK] <unk> hundred different types of proteins thousands of proteins in total <unk> [MASK] it is a signal broadcasting system <unk> it broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell[MASK] when it 's ready when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes <unk> it is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules[MASK] <unk> involved with the growing of the microtubules <unk> and it 's able to transiently couple onto them <unk> [MASK] it 's also an attention sensing system it 's able to feel when the cell is ready when the chromosome is correctly positioned it 's turning green here because it it feels that everything is just right <unk> [MASK] and you 'll see there 's this one little last bit that 's still remaining red <unk> and it 's walked away down the microtubules <unk> [MASK] that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal and it 's walked away i mean[MASK] <unk> 's molecular clockwork this is how you work at the molecular scale <unk> so with a little bit of molecular eye candy [MASK] we 've got kinesins the orange ones they 're little molecular courier molecules walking one way <unk> and here are the dynein they 're carrying that broadcasting system and they 've got their long legs so they can step around <unk>[MASK] <unk> obstacles and so on <unk> so again this is all derived accurately from the science the problem is we can 't show it to you any other way[MASK] <unk> exploring at the frontier of science at[MASK] the frontier of human understanding is mind blowing discovering this stuff is[MASK] certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science <unk> but most medical researchers[MASK] discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals <unk> which are[MASK] to[MASK] eradicate disease to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty <unk> thank you[MASK]
