 <unk> i am a phd student <unk> and that means i have a question <unk> how can we make[MASK] digital content graspable <unk> because you see on the one hand there is the digital world and[MASK] <unk> many things are happening there right now <unk> and for us humans it 's not quite material it 's not really there it 's virtual [MASK] on the other hand <unk> we 're humans <unk> we live in a in a physical world it 's rich <unk> it tastes good it feels good it smells good <unk> [MASK] so the question is how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical that 's my question [MASK] if you look at the iphone with its touch and the wii with its bodily activity you can see the tendency it 's getting physical the question is what 's next[MASK] <unk> now i have three options that i would like to show you the first one is mass [MASK] as humans we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy <unk> so could we use that in mobile phones [MASK] let me show you the weight shifting mobile <unk> it is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside which we can move around[MASK] <unk> can feel where it 's heavy <unk> we shift the gravitational center of it [MASK] for example we can augment digital content with physical mass <unk> so you move around the content on the display but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device [MASK] another thing it 's good for is navigation <unk> it can guide you around in a city it can tell you by its weight ok move right walk ahead [MASK] <unk> make a left here and the good thing about that is you don 't have to look at the device all the time you have your eyes free to see the city <unk> now mass is the first thing the second thing [MASK] that 's shape we 're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in our hands <unk> [MASK] so if i download an e book and it has twenty pages well they could be thin right but if it has five hundred pages i want to feel that harry potter it 's thick [MASK] so let me show you[MASK] <unk> it 's a mobile phone shaped box and this one can change its shape [MASK] we can play with the shape itself for example it can be thin in your pocket <unk> which we of course want it to be but then if you hold it in your hand it can <unk>[MASK] <unk> lean towards you be thick <unk> it 's like tapered to the downside if you change the grasp it can adjust to that it[MASK] another thing is <unk> sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone that are bigger than the phone itself <unk> in that case like here there 's an app that 's bigger than the phone 's screen[MASK] the shape of the phone could tell you ok <unk> off the screen right here <unk> there is more content you can 't see it but it 's there and you can feel it because it 's thicker at that edge the[MASK] shape is the second thing the third thing operates on a different level[MASK] as humans we are social we are empathic <unk> and that 's great wouldn[MASK] 't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive <unk> think of a hamster in the pocket well i can feel it it 's doing all right i don 't have to check it [MASK] let me show you the living mobile phone <unk> so once again a mobile phone shaped box <unk> [MASK] but this one[MASK] <unk> how do we calm it down you give it a pat behind the ears and[MASK] everything is all right again <unk> that 's very intuitive and that 's what we want [MASK] so what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us and i think making it physical[MASK] is a good way to do that [MASK] what 's behind that is a postulation namely not that humans should get much more technical in the future <unk> rather than that technology a bit more human[MASK]
