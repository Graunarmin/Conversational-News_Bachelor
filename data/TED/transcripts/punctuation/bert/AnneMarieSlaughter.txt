 <unk> so my moment of truth[MASK] did not come all at once in two thousand and ten i had the chance to be considered for promotion[MASK] from my job as director of policy planning at the u s state department this was my[MASK] <unk> moment[MASK] to lean in to push myself forward[MASK] for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs <unk> [MASK] and i had just finished a big 18 month project for secretary clinton <unk> successfully <unk> [MASK] and i knew i could handle a bigger job [MASK] the woman[MASK] i thought i was[MASK] <unk> would have said yes <unk> [MASK] but i had been commuting for two years between washington and princeton new jersey where my husband and my two teenage sons lived <unk> [MASK] and it was not going well <unk> [MASK] i tried on the idea of eking out another two years in washington or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them[MASK] <unk> but deep down i knew[MASK] that the right decision was to go home <unk> [MASK] even if i didn 't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice [MASK] that was a decision based on love[MASK] and responsibility <unk> i couldn 't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being[MASK] <unk> to be there for him when and if he needed me <unk> [MASK] but the real change came more gradually over the next year <unk> while my family was righting itself [MASK] i started to realize that even if i could go back into government i didn 't want to [MASK] i didn 't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at[MASK] <unk> home <unk> i finally allowed myself to accept[MASK] what was really most important to me not what i was conditioned to want[MASK] or maybe what i conditioned myself to want and that decision led[MASK] <unk> to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that i grew up with[MASK] and have always championed i am still completely committed to the cause of <unk>[MASK] equality <unk> [MASK] but let 's think about what that equality really means and how best to achieve it[MASK] <unk> i always accepted[MASK] the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society[MASK] are men at the top of their careers so that the measure of[MASK] male female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions[MASK] <unk> prime ministers presidents ceos <unk> directors managers nobel laureates <unk> [MASK] <unk> i still think we should do everything we possibly can[MASK] to achieve that goal but that 's only half of real equality <unk> [MASK] and i now think we 're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half <unk> [MASK] i suggest that real[MASK] <unk> does not just mean valuing women on male terms <unk> it means creating[MASK] a much wider range of equally respected choices for women[MASK] and for men and to get there we have to change our workplaces our policies and our culture[MASK] <unk> in the workplace real[MASK] <unk> equality means valuing family just as much as work and understanding that the two reinforce each other [MASK] as a leader and as a manager <unk> i have always acted on the mantra [MASK] if family comes first work does not come second[MASK] life comes[MASK] <unk> if you work for me <unk> and you have a family issue <unk> [MASK] i expect you to attend to it <unk> and i am confident and my confidence has always been borne out that the work will get done [MASK] and done better [MASK] workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused more efficient more[MASK] <unk> breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts [MASK] think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents he 's much more likely to bring in new clients <unk>[MASK] <unk> for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office <unk> [MASK] a lot of patience[MASK] and empathy <unk> creativity <unk> resilience adaptability those are all attributes that are ever more important in a <unk>[MASK] high speed horizontal <unk> networked global economy <unk> [MASK] the best[MASK] <unk> companies actually know this [MASK] the companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the united states include some of our most successful corporations [MASK] and a two thousand and eight national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces[MASK] are more engaged with their work they 're more satisfied and more loyal they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health [MASK] and a two thousand and twelve[MASK] <unk> study[MASK] of employers showed that deep flexible practices actually lowered operating costs[MASK] and increased adaptability in a global service economy <unk> so[MASK] you may think that the privileging of work over family[MASK] <unk> the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely american disease <unk> [MASK] twenty years ago <unk> when my family first started going to italy we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta [MASK] siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day it 's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family[MASK] <unk> when we go fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta <unk> reflecting the advance of global corporations[MASK] and 24 hour competition so making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative [MASK] in policy terms <unk> [MASK] real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done[MASK] is just as important as[MASK] <unk> the work that men have traditionally done no matter who does it [MASK] think about it[MASK] breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival at least if we get beyond[MASK] a barter economy <unk> somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance[MASK] for loved ones[MASK] <unk> now most of you when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving [MASK] instinctively translate those categories into men 's work and women 's work and we don 't[MASK] typically challenge why men 's work is is advantaged <unk> but consider[MASK] <unk> like my friends sarah and emily <unk> they 're psychiatrists <unk> they got married five years ago and now they have two year old twins <unk> [MASK] they love being mothers <unk> but they also love their work and they 're really good at what they do <unk> [MASK] so how are they going to divide up <unk> breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities should one of them stop working or reduce hours to[MASK] <unk> should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules [MASK] and what criteria should they use to make that decision is it who makes the most money[MASK] or who is most committed to her career or who has the most flexible boss [MASK] the same sex perspective helps us see that[MASK] juggling work and family are not women 's problems[MASK] <unk> and sarah and emily are the lucky ones <unk> because they have a choice about how much they want to work <unk> [MASK] millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn[MASK] the income they need <unk> and many of those workers are scrambling[MASK] <unk> they 're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe[MASK] <unk> if <unk> breadwinning and caregiving are really equal then why shouldn 't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care[MASK] as the foundation of a healthy society[MASK] as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy <unk> the governments that get it[MASK] <unk> no surprises here[MASK] the governments that get it <unk> norway <unk> sweden <unk> denmark <unk> the netherlands <unk> provide universal[MASK] child care <unk> support for caregivers at home school and early childhood education <unk> [MASK] protections for pregnant women and care for the elderly and the disabled [MASK] those governments invest[MASK] in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains <unk> [MASK] those societies also show you that <unk> breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other [MASK] they routinely rank[MASK] among the top fifteen countries of the most globally competitive economies but[MASK] <unk> the same time <unk> they rank very high on the oecd better life index in fact <unk> they rank higher than other governments like my own <unk>[MASK] the u s or switzerland that have higher average levels of income[MASK] <unk> infrastructures of care would make a big difference <unk> but we 're not going to get[MASK] equally valued choices unless we change our culture and the kind of cultural change required[MASK] means re socializing men [MASK] increasingly in developed countries women are socialized to believe that our place is[MASK] <unk> no longer only[MASK] in the home <unk> [MASK] but men are actually still where they always were [MASK] men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners that to derive their <unk>[MASK] from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder the feminist revolution still has a long way to go[MASK] <unk> certainly not complete <unk> but sixty years after the feminine mystique was published [MASK] many women actually have more choices than men do [MASK] we can decide to be a breadwinner a caregiver or any combination of the two [MASK] when a man on the other hand[MASK] <unk> to be a caregiver <unk> he puts his manhood on the line [MASK] his friends may praise his decision <unk> but underneath <unk> they 're scratching their heads[MASK] isn 't the measure of a man[MASK] his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige <unk> [MASK] and as many women hold that view as men do we know that lots of women[MASK] still judge[MASK] <unk> the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career [MASK] a woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner for a man that 's a risky proposition <unk> [MASK] so as parents and partners we should be socializing our sons and our husbands[MASK] to be[MASK] <unk> whatever they want to be <unk> either caregivers[MASK] or breadwinners [MASK] we should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys [MASK] i can almost hear lots of you thinking no way [MASK] but in fact <unk> the change is actually already[MASK] <unk> happening at least in the united states lots of men take pride in cooking and frankly obsess over stoves [MASK] they are in the birthing rooms <unk> [MASK] they take paternity leave when they can they can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can [MASK] and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework [MASK] indeed there are male college students[MASK] <unk> now who are starting to say i want to be a <unk>[MASK] that was completely unthinkable fifty or even thirty years ago <unk> [MASK] and in norway <unk> where men have an automatic three month 's paternity leave <unk> but they lose it if they decide not to take it a[MASK] high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an[MASK] eyebrow[MASK] if they didn 't in fact take their leave when they had kids [MASK] that means that it 's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] i was raised to believe that championing[MASK] women 's rights[MASK] meant doing everything we could to get women to the top <unk> [MASK] and i still hope that i live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force <unk> [MASK] but i 've come to believe that we have to value family[MASK] every bit as much as we value work and that we should entertain the idea that doing[MASK] <unk> right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do <unk> [MASK] thirty years ago carol gilligan a wonderful psychologist studied adolescent girls[MASK] and identified an ethic of care an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice it[MASK] <unk> you don 't care is just as much a part of who we are as that 's not fair [MASK] bill gates agrees he argues that the two great forces of human nature are <unk>[MASK] and caring for others <unk> let 's bring them both together <unk> let 's make the feminist revolution[MASK] a humanist revolution[MASK] <unk> as whole human beings we will be better caregivers and breadwinners [MASK] you may think that can 't happen <unk> but i grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties[MASK] <unk> where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms and where everybody[MASK] claimed to be heterosexual[MASK] <unk> not so much [MASK] the revolution for human equality[MASK] can happen <unk> it is happening <unk> it will happen [MASK] how far and how fast is up to us thank you[MASK]
