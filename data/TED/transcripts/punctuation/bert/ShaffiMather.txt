 <unk> anger in me against corruption[MASK] made me to make a big career change last year becoming a full time practicing lawyer my experiences[MASK] over the last eighteen months as a lawyer has seeded in me a new[MASK] entrepreneurial idea which i believe is indeed worth spreading <unk> [MASK] so i share it with all of you here today though the idea itself is getting crystallized and i 'm still writing up the business plan of course it helps[MASK] that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed[MASK] increases <unk> i 've been a huge[MASK] <unk> fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since one thousand nine hundred and ninety three [MASK] i 've explored <unk> experienced and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart 's content <unk> [MASK] i built <unk> along with my two brothers [MASK] the leading real estate company in my home state kerala <unk> and then worked professionally with two of india 's biggest businessmen but in their startup enterprises[MASK] <unk> two thousand and three when i stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so called social sector issues <unk> [MASK] i definitely did not have any grand[MASK] strategy or plan to pursue and find for profit solutions[MASK] to addressing pressing public issues <unk> when life brought about a series of death and[MASK] experiences within my close circle which highlighted the need[MASK] for an emergency medical response service in india similar to nine hundred and eleven in usa to address this i along with four friends <unk> founded ambulance access for all [MASK] to promote life support ambulance services in india [MASK] for those from the developing world <unk> there is nothing absolutely nothing new in this idea[MASK] <unk> idea <unk> but as we envisioned it we had three key goals <unk> providing world class life support ambulance service which is fully self sustainable from its own revenue streams [MASK] and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency <unk> irrespective of the capability to pay [MASK] the service which grew out of this <unk> [MASK] with one ambulance in two thousand and four now has a hundred plus ambulances in three states <unk> and has transported over one hundred thousand patients and victims since inception [MASK] the service is fully self sustainable[MASK] from its own revenues <unk> without accessing any public funds <unk> and the cross subsidy model actually works[MASK] <unk> the rich pays higher <unk> poor pays lower and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge [MASK] the service responded effectively and efficiently during the unfortunate twenty six eleven mumbai terror attacks[MASK] and as you can see from the visuals [MASK] the service was[MASK] responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off[MASK] the incident[MASK] <unk> locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike [MASK] we ended up being the first medical response team in every[MASK] incident location and transported one hundred and[MASK] <unk> over the last one year <unk> we have actually helped a pakistani ngo aman foundation to set up[MASK] life support ambulance service in karachi <unk> facilitated[MASK] <unk> it 's a small message from us in our own small way[MASK] to the enemies of humanity of islam [MASK] of south asia of india <unk> and of pakistan that humanity will continue to bloom <unk> irrespective of such[MASK] <unk> two other social enterprises one is education access for all setting up schools in small town india <unk> and the other is moksha yug access which is integrating rural supply chain[MASK] on the foundations of <unk>[MASK] microfinance i guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right <unk> because diligent investors and venture funds[MASK] have committed over seven point five million dollars in funding with the significance being[MASK] <unk> these funds have come in as a qt capital not as grant or as philanthropy <unk> [MASK] now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i 'm exploring corruption bribes and lack of transparency you may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their[MASK] <unk> bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless[MASK] common man and the demand side being mostly politicians bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them <unk> [MASK] according to world bank estimate one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year <unk> worsening the condition of the already worse off [MASK] yet if you analyze the common man[MASK] he or she does not wake up every day and say hmm let me see who i can pay a bribe to today or let me see who i can corrupt today [MASK] often it is the constraining or the back to the wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe [MASK] in the modern day world where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably[MASK] <unk> tough the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life now[MASK] let me ask you another question <unk> imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day to day life to get something done <unk> what do you do [MASK] of course you can call the police but what is the use if the police department is in itself[MASK] steeped in corruption [MASK] most definitely you don 't want to pay the bribe <unk> but you also don 't have the time resources <unk> expertise or wherewithal to fight this [MASK] unfortunately [MASK] many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in pay a fee <unk> and[MASK] <unk> such a service simply do not exist [MASK] one image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother seventy plus years being harassed by the bureaucrats[MASK] <unk> in the town planning office all she needed was permission to build three steps to her house from ground level making it easier for her to enter and exit her house <unk> [MASK] yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe [MASK] even though it pricked my conscience then i could not or rather i did not tend to her or assist her <unk> because i was busy building my real estate company i don 't want to be haunted by such images any more [MASK] a group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address[MASK] individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement <unk> and in all forty two cases where we have pushed back such demands[MASK] using existing and legitimate tools like the right to information act [MASK] video <unk> audio or peer pressure we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe and with the cost of these tools being substantially[MASK] <unk> lower than the bribe demanded i believe that these tools that worked in these forty two pilot cases can be consolidated[MASK] in standard processes[MASK] in a bpo kind of environment and made available on web call center and franchise physical offices for a fee to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe [MASK] <unk> market is as tempting as it can get it can be worth up to one trillion dollars being paid in bribes every year <unk> or equal to india 's gdp and it is an absolutely virgin market [MASK] i propose to explore this idea further to examine the potential of creating a[MASK] <unk> corruption i do realize that the fight for justice against corruption[MASK] is never easy it never has been and it never will be in my last eighteen months as a lawyer battling small and large scale corruption <unk> including the one perpetrated by india 's biggest corporate scamster <unk> through his charities[MASK] i have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass[MASK] <unk> and intimidation [MASK] the battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves our families our friends <unk> and even our kids <unk> yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place [MASK] what gives us the courage as my close friend replied when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project[MASK] that it is an impossible task and[MASK] <unk> are insane to chalk up their <unk> blue chip jobs i quote of course we cannot fail in this at least in our own minds for we are insane people <unk> trying to do an impossible task and an insane person does not know what an impossible task is[MASK] <unk> give us a sense of of the numbers here a typical bribe and a typical fee i mean what 's in your head sm so let me <unk> let me give you an example <unk> somebody who[MASK] <unk> who had applied for the passport <unk> the officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around three thousand rupees in bribes and[MASK] he did not want to pay <unk> so we actually used the right to information act which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states <unk> and[MASK] pushed back the officers[MASK] in this particular case <unk> and in all these forty two cases <unk> when we kept pushing them back there was three kinds of reaction a set of people actually say[MASK] <unk> just grant it to them and[MASK] run away from it some people actually come back and say oh you want to screw me [MASK] let me show you what i can do and he will he will push us back so you take the next step or use the next tool available in what what we are putting together <unk> [MASK] and then he relents by the[MASK] <unk> what fee would you have to charge and can you actually make the business work sm well actually the cost that we incurred was less than[MASK] two hundred rupees so it actually works ca that 's a high gross margin business i like[MASK] <unk> so these are provisional numbers <unk> no pricing guarantee <unk> if you can pull this off you will be a global hero i mean this could be huge <unk> thank you so much for sharing this idea[MASK]
