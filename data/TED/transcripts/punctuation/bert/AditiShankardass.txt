 <unk> when i was ten years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school and as a special treat he took me to the pathology lab[MASK] and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands <unk> and there it was[MASK] seat of human consciousness the powerhouse of the human body <unk> sitting in my hands <unk> [MASK] and that day i knew that when i grew up i was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other <unk> [MASK] years later when i finally grew up my dream came true and it was while[MASK] <unk> on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i 'd like to share with you all today [MASK] it is estimated that one in six children that 's one in six children <unk> suffer from some developmental disorder [MASK] this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes[MASK] <unk> which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder <unk> [MASK] but here 's what really perplexed me <unk> [MASK] despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain [MASK] most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis[MASK] <unk> but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without[MASK] even doing an ecg or a chest x ray to look at the heart [MASK] it seemed so intuitive to me [MASK] to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately <unk> it would be necessary to look at the brain directly [MASK] looking at behavior alone can miss[MASK] a vital piece of the puzzle[MASK] and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child 's problems <unk> [MASK] yet despite all the advances in medical technology [MASK] the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited [MASK] and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical[MASK] <unk> technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children [MASK] their groundbreaking technology records the eeg or the electrical activity of the brain in real time <unk> [MASK] allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions[MASK] and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions[MASK] <unk> vision attention language <unk> audition [MASK] a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain [MASK] and another program called statistical probability mapping[MASK] then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant <unk> allowing us to provide a much more accurate[MASK] <unk> neurological diagnosis of the child 's symptoms <unk> and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team [MASK] and we 're finally able to use this technology towards[MASK] actually helping children with brain disorders and i 'm happy to say that i 'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in india [MASK] i 'd like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by[MASK] seven year old justin senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism <unk> [MASK] like many autistic children his mind was locked inside his body <unk> [MASK] there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time [MASK] and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially <unk> and he would[MASK] <unk> probably never have too much language [MASK] when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain the results were startling [MASK] it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic he was suffering from brain seizures[MASK] that were impossible to see with the naked eye <unk> but that were actually causing symptoms that[MASK] <unk> mimicked those of autism <unk> [MASK] after justin was given anti seizure medication the change in him was amazing <unk> [MASK] within a period of sixty days his vocabulary went from two to three words to three hundred words <unk> [MASK] and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ[MASK] research shows that fifty percent of children <unk> almost fifty percent of children diagnosed with autism[MASK] are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures these are the faces of the children that i have tested[MASK] with stories just like justin all[MASK] <unk> came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems [MASK] instead our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn 't possibly have been detected by their behavioral[MASK] assessments so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis[MASK] and much more targeted[MASK] <unk> treatment [MASK] for too long now children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen <unk> [MASK] and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation <unk> [MASK] but we are now in a new era of neuroscience[MASK] <unk> one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects[MASK] and find the true source of so many disabilities in children [MASK] so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder [MASK] then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be[MASK] <unk> solved one more mind will be unlocked <unk> and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system[MASK] will finally realize his or her true potential while there 's still time for his or her brain to recover <unk> [MASK] and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves[MASK]
