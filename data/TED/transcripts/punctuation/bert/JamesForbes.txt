 <unk> what does it look like come with me to nine hundred and fifteen south bloodworth street in raleigh north[MASK] <unk> where i grew up if you come in you will see us evening time at table[MASK] set for ten but not always all seats filled[MASK] at the point when dinner is ready to be served <unk> [MASK] since mom had eight kids <unk> sometimes she said she couldn 't tell who was who and where they were before we could[MASK] <unk> and if someone happened to be missing <unk> [MASK] we would have to we say fix a plate for that person <unk> put it in the oven [MASK] then we could say grace <unk> and we could eat <unk> [MASK] also while we were at the table <unk> there was a ritual in our family <unk> [MASK] when something significant had happened for any one of us[MASK] <unk> had just been elected as the president of the pta [MASK] or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination [MASK] or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent[MASK] the ritual at the family was once the announcement is made we must take five ten minutes to do what we call[MASK] <unk> that person[MASK] that is to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way <unk> for when one is honored [MASK] all are honored <unk> [MASK] also <unk> we had to make a report on our extended [MASK] visited members that[MASK] <unk> extended members of the family <unk> sick and elderly shut in my task was at least once a week to visit mother lassiter who lived <unk>[MASK] <unk> on east street mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road <unk> why because they were old and infirm <unk> [MASK] <unk> to be family is to care and share and to look out for one another they are our family and of course sometimes there was a bonus for going they would offer sweets or money [MASK] mom says if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them you must always say ' nothing ' and if they insist say ' whatever[MASK] <unk> this was the nature of being at that table in fact she indicated that[MASK] if we would do that not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family <unk> [MASK] but she said even god will smile <unk> and when god smiles there is peace [MASK] <unk> table at nine hundred and fifteen i learned something about compassion <unk> [MASK] of course <unk> it was a minister 's family <unk> so we had to add god into it and so i came to think that mama eternal [MASK] mama eternal is always wondering [MASK] are all the children in and if we had been faithful[MASK] <unk> in caring and sharing <unk> we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world <unk> now it was not always wonderful at that table <unk> let me explain <unk>[MASK] a point at which we did not rise to the occasion <unk> it was christmas and at our family oh what a morning christmas morning <unk> where[MASK] <unk> open up our gifts where we have special prayers and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols <unk> it was a very intimate moment in fact you could come <unk>[MASK] <unk> down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing <unk> and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed <unk> [MASK] <unk> who did not have any place on that particular christmas to celebrate <unk> and daddy brought[MASK] elder revels to the christmas family celebration <unk> [MASK] we thought he must be out of his mind this is our time <unk> this is intimate time <unk> this is when we can just be who we are and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on[MASK] <unk> while we are still in our pjs <unk> why would daddy bring[MASK] elder revels <unk> any other time but not to the christmas celebration <unk> [MASK] and mom overheard us and said well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration it[MASK] is that this is a time[MASK] where you extend the circle of love that 's what the celebration is all about it 's time to[MASK] <unk> make space to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community [MASK] so we sucked up [MASK] but growing up at nine hundred and fifteen compassion was not a word to be debated <unk> it was a[MASK] <unk> and brothers united together and like chief seattle said we did not spin the web of life <unk> we 're all strands in it and whatever <unk>[MASK] <unk> we do to the web we do to ourselves now that 's compassion <unk> so let me tell you i kind of look at the world this way <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's compassion a harvested field of grain with some grain[MASK] in the corners <unk> reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest <unk> but you must always leave some on the edges just in case there 's someone[MASK] who has not had the share necessary[MASK] for good nurture <unk> talk about a picture of compassion <unk> i see[MASK] always it stirs my heart a picture of dr martin luther king[MASK] jr walking arm in arm with andy young and rabbi heschel and maybe thich nhat hanh and some of the other saints assembled <unk> walking across the[MASK] <unk> bridge and going into selma just a photograph arm in arm for struggle suffering together[MASK] in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of[MASK] <unk> in my community was upset you heard about riots[MASK] all across the land bobby kennedy was scheduled[MASK] to bring an inner city message[MASK] in indianapolis <unk> [MASK] this is the picture they said it 's going to be too volatile for you to go [MASK] he insisted i must go so sitting on a flatbed truck [MASK] the elders of the community are there and bobby stands up and says to the people i have bad news for you some of you may[MASK] <unk> not have heard that dr king has been assassinated <unk>[MASK] i know that you are angry and i know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge but he said what i really want you to know[MASK] is that i know how you feel <unk> because i had someone dear to me[MASK] snatched away[MASK] i know how you feel [MASK] and he said i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did <unk> [MASK] i allowed my anger my bitterness my grief[MASK] to simmer a while <unk> [MASK] and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world <unk> and we can do that together that 's a picture compassion <unk> i think[MASK] <unk> i see it [MASK] i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world [MASK] he asked them to give a message <unk> and they each read[MASK] in their own language a central affirmation[MASK] and that was[MASK] some version of the golden rule [MASK] as you would that others would do unto you do also unto them [MASK] twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire[MASK] <unk> are so connected[MASK] that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself[MASK] one more picture while i 'm stinking and thinking about the riverside church nine eleven <unk> [MASK] last night[MASK] at chagrin fall a[MASK] when a service was held at the riverside church <unk> we carried it on our station in this city <unk> [MASK] it was he said one of the most powerful moments[MASK] of life together we were all suffering <unk> [MASK] but you invited representatives of all of the traditions[MASK] to come and[MASK] <unk> you invited them ' find out what it is in your tradition[MASK] that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated [MASK] when we have been despised and rejected ' and they all spoke out of their own traditions [MASK] a word about the healing power of[MASK] <unk> a sense of compassion[MASK] sort of as second nature <unk> but i became a preacher now as a preacher i got a job i got to preach the stuff <unk> but i got to do <unk>[MASK] as father divine in harlem used to say to folks some people preach the gospel <unk> i have to tangibilitate the gospel so the real issue is how do you[MASK] <unk> tangibilitate[MASK] compassion <unk> how do you make it real my faith[MASK] has constantly lifted up the ideal and challenged me when i fell beneath it [MASK] in my tradition [MASK] there is a gift that we have made to other traditions to everybody around the world who knows the story[MASK] <unk> the good samaritan many people think of it primarily in terms[MASK] of charity[MASK] <unk> random acts of kindness <unk> [MASK] but for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable [MASK] <unk> was [MASK] what is the greatest commandment [MASK] and according to jesus the word comes forth you must love yourself <unk> you must love the lord your god with all your heart mind and soul <unk> and your neighbor as yourself [MASK] and then the person asked well <unk> what do you mean[MASK] <unk> telling the story of the man who fell among thieves <unk> and how religious authorities[MASK] went the other way <unk> [MASK] and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way <unk> but an unsuspecting despised person[MASK] came along saw the man in need provided oil and wine for his wounds[MASK] put him on his own transportation <unk> and took him[MASK] to the inn and asked the innkeeper take care of him [MASK] and he said here this is the initial investment <unk> but if needs continue [MASK] make sure that you provide them[MASK] <unk> and whatever else is needed i will provide it[MASK] and pay for it when i return this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan [MASK] a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and[MASK] <unk> one who provides a system of sustained care i like that ' a system of sustained care ' in the inn take care i think maybe it 's one time when the bible <unk>[MASK] <unk> talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary that all god 's children would have their needs cared for so that <unk>[MASK] <unk> we could answer when mommy eternal asks in regards to health are all the children in and we could say yes[MASK] oh what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate[MASK] compassion <unk> i recall that my work as a pastor has always involved[MASK] caring for their spiritual needs being concerned for housing for[MASK] <unk> for the prisoners for the infirm <unk> [MASK] for children even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off where they are going [MASK] to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs <unk> but now to be a good samaritan and i always say and to be a good american for me [MASK] is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care[MASK] compassion takes on a corporate dynamic [MASK] i believe that whatever we did around that table[MASK] at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that[MASK] <unk> that family together that understands the nature of our unity we are one people together [MASK] so <unk> let me explain to you what i mean when i think about[MASK] compassion <unk> and why i think it is so important that right at this point in history <unk> [MASK] we would decide to establish this charter of compassion [MASK] the reason it 's important[MASK] <unk> because[MASK] this is[MASK] a very special time in history it is the time that biblically we would speak of as[MASK] the day <unk> or the year of god 's favor <unk> this is a season of grace <unk> unusual things are beginning[MASK] <unk> pardon me as a black man for celebrating that the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor <unk> [MASK] and yet [MASK] there is so much more that needs to be done we need to bring health[MASK] and food and education and respect for all god 's citizens all god 's children[MASK] remembering mama eternal now let me close my comments[MASK] by telling you[MASK] that whenever i feel something very deeply <unk> [MASK] it usually takes the form of verse <unk> [MASK] and so i want to close with a little song i close with this song it 's a children 's song[MASK] because we are all[MASK] <unk> children at the table of mama eternal <unk> and if mama eternal has taught us correctly [MASK] this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering <unk> but to all who sign the charter for compassion <unk> and this is why we do it the song says i[MASK] <unk> made heaven so happy today[MASK]
