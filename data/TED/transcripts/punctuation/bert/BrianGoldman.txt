 <unk> and i think it starts with one physician and that 's me and maybe i 've been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that[MASK] <unk> before i actually begin the meat of my talk let 's begin with a bit of baseball hey why not we 're near the end we 're getting close to to the world series we all love baseball <unk>[MASK] baseball is filled with some amazing statistics and[MASK] there 's hundreds of them moneyball is about to come out and it 's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball[MASK] i 'm going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of it 's called batting average[MASK] so we talk about a three hundred a batter who bats three hundred that means that that ballplayer batted safely hit safely three times out of ten at bats that means hit the ball into the outfield it dropped it didn[MASK] <unk> first base didn 't get there in time and the runner was safe three times out of ten[MASK] do you know what they call a three hundred hitter in major league baseball[MASK] good really good maybe an all star[MASK] do you know what they call a four hundred baseball hitter that 's somebody who hit by the way four times safely out of every ten[MASK] legendary[MASK] as in ted williams legendary the last major league baseball player to hit over four hundred during a regular season[MASK] now let 's take this back into my world of medicine where i 'm a lot more comfortable or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i 'm going to talk to you about[MASK] suppose you have appendicitis and you 're referred to a surgeon who 's batting four hundred on appendectomies[MASK] somehow this isn 't working out is it[MASK] now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries[MASK] and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who 's batting two hundred on angioplasties[MASK] but but you know what she 's doing a lot better this year she 's on the comeback trail[MASK] hundred and fifty seven[MASK] somehow this isn 't working but i 'm going to ask you a question[MASK] what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or[MASK] an orthopedic surgeon an obgyn a paramedic is supposed to be[MASK] one thousand very good[MASK] <unk> truth of the matter is nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat[MASK] what we do though is we send each one of them including myself out into the world with the admonition be perfect never ever ever make a mistake but you worry about the details[MASK] about how that 's going to happen[MASK] and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school i was an obsessive compulsive student in high school[MASK] a classmate once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test laughter[MASK] and so i did and[MASK] i studied in my little garret at the nurses residence at toronto general hospital not far from here and i memorized everything i memorized in my anatomy class <unk>[MASK] <unk> the origins and exertions of every muscle every branch of every artery that came off the aorta[MASK] obscure and common i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis and all the while i was amassing more and more knowledge and and i did well i graduated with honors[MASK] cum laude[MASK] and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything or as much as possible as close to everything as possible[MASK] <unk> would immunize me against making mistakes and it worked for a while[MASK] until i met mrs drucker[MASK] i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working[MASK] at the time i was assigned to the cardiology[MASK] <unk> cardiology rotation and it was my job when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult to see that patient in emerg and to report back to my attending[MASK] and i saw mrs drucker and she was breathless and when i listened to her she was making a wheezy sound and when i listened to to her chest with a stethoscope i could hear crackly sounds <unk>[MASK] <unk> on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure this is a condition in which the heart fails and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward some of the blood[MASK] <unk> backs up into the lung the lungs fill up with blood and that 's why you have shortness of breath and that wasn 't a difficult diagnosis to make i made it[MASK] and i set to work treating her i gave her aspirin i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart i gave her medications that we call diuretics water pills[MASK] to get her to pee out the access fluid and over the course of the next hour and a half or two she started to feel better[MASK] and i felt really good[MASK] and that 's when i made my first mistake[MASK] i sent her home[MASK] actually i made two more mistakes i sent her home without speaking to my attending[MASK] i didn 't pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her[MASK] for himself and he knew her he would have been able to furnish additional information about her[MASK] maybe i did it for a good reason[MASK] maybe i didn 't want to be a high maintenance resident maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending 's patients without even having to contact him[MASK] the second mistake that i made was worse[MASK] <unk> in sending her home i disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me goldman not a good idea don 't do this[MASK] in fact so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker do you think it it 's okay if she goes home[MASK] and the nurse thought about it and said very matter of factly yeah i think she 'll do okay i can remember that like it was yesterday[MASK] so i signed the discharge papers and an ambulance came paramedics came[MASK] <unk> take her home and i went back to my work on the wards[MASK] all the rest of that day that afternoon i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach[MASK] but i carried on with my work and at the end of the day i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home[MASK] when i did something that i don 't usually do i walked through the emergency[MASK] <unk> department on my way home[MASK] and it was there that another nurse not the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker before but another nurse said three words to me[MASK] that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread[MASK] others in medicine dread them as well but there 's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly[MASK] the three words are do[MASK] <unk> do you remember[MASK] do you remember that patient you sent home the other nurse asked matter of factly[MASK] well she 's back in just that tone of voice[MASK] well she was back all right she was back and near death[MASK] about an hour after she had arrived home after i 'd sent her home she collapsed and her family called nine[MASK] <unk> paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of fifty which is in severe shock and she was barely breathing and she was blue and[MASK] the emerg staff pulled out all the stops they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure they put her on a ventilator[MASK] and i was shocked and shaken to the core and i went through this roller coaster because after they[MASK] stabilized her she went to the intensive care unit and i hoped against hope that she would recover[MASK] and over the next two or three days it was clear that she was never going to wake up she had irreversible brain damage[MASK] and the family gathered and over the course of the next eight or nine days they resigned themselves to what was happening and at about the nine day mark they let her go[MASK] mrs drucker a wife[MASK] a mother and a grandmother[MASK] they say you never forget the names of those who die and that was my first time to be acquainted with that[MASK] over the next few weeks i beat myself <unk>[MASK] <unk> and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine where i felt alone isolated not[MASK] <unk> feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel because you can 't talk about it with your colleagues you know that healthy kind when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then[MASK] your[MASK] best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say i 'll never make that mistake again and you make amends and you never make that mistake again that 's the kind of shame that[MASK] a teacher[MASK] the unhealthy shame i 'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside it 's the one that says not that what you did was bad[MASK] but that you are bad[MASK] and and it was what i was feeling[MASK] and it wasn 't because of my attending he was a doll he talked to the family and i 'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that i didn 't get sued[MASK] and i[MASK] <unk> kept asking myself these questions why didn 't i ask my attending why did i send her home and then at my worst moments why[MASK] why did i make such a stupid mistake why did i go into medicine[MASK] slowly but surely it lifted[MASK] i began to feel a bit better and on a cloudy day there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered[MASK] maybe i could feel better[MASK] <unk> again and i made myself a bargain that if only i redouble my efforts to be perfect[MASK] and never make another mistake again please make the voices stop and they did and i went back to work[MASK] and then it happened again two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto[MASK] and i saw a twenty five year old man with a sore throat it was busy i was in a bit of a hurry he kept pointing here[MASK] i looked at his throat it was a little bit pink and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way[MASK] and even as he was walking out the door he was still sort of pointing to his throat[MASK] and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift and that 's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office and[MASK] <unk> said the three words do you remember[MASK] do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat[MASK] well it turns out he didn 't have a strep throat he had a potentially life threatening condition called epiglottitis you can google it but it 's an infection not of the throat but of the upper airway and it[MASK] <unk> actually cause the airway to close[MASK] and fortunately he didn 't die he was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he[MASK] recovered after a few days and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations[MASK] and felt cleansed and went back to work until it happened again and again[MASK] and again twice in one emergency shift i missed appendicitis now that takes some doing[MASK] <unk> especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but fourteen people a night[MASK] now in both cases i didn 't send them home and i don 't think there was any gap in their care one i thought had a kidney stone i ordered a kidney x ray when it turned out to be normal my colleague who <unk>[MASK] <unk> was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons the other one had a lot of diarrhea i ordered some fluids to rehydrate him[MASK] <unk> and asked my colleague to reassess him and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant called the surgeons in both cases[MASK] they had their operations and they did okay but each time they were gnawing at me eating at me[MASK] and i 'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say which is total b s[MASK] <unk> some of my doozies have been in the last five years[MASK] alone ashamed and unsupported here 's the problem[MASK] if i can 't come clean and and talk about my mistakes if i can 't find the still small voice that tells me what really happened how can i share it with my colleagues[MASK] how can i teach them[MASK] <unk> about what i did so that they don 't do the same thing[MASK] if i were to walk into a room like right now i have no idea what you think of me[MASK] when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure[MASK] oh yeah you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor but you 're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes[MASK] if i were to walk into a room filled with my[MASK] <unk> ask for their support right now and start to tell what i 've just told you right now i probably wouldn 't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable somebody would crack a joke they 'd change the subject and we would move on[MASK] and in fact if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic[MASK] <unk> colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital believe me i 'd have trouble making eye contact with that person[MASK] that 's the system that we have it 's a complete denial of mistakes it 's a system in which[MASK] there are two kinds of physicians those who make mistakes and those who don 't[MASK] those who can 't handle sleep deprivation and those who can[MASK] <unk> those who have lousy outcomes and[MASK] those who have great outcomes and it 's almost like an ideological reaction like the antibodies begin to attack that person[MASK] and and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine[MASK] what will we be left with but a safe system[MASK] but there are two problems with that in my twenty years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism i 've made a personal[MASK] <unk> study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to to my show white coat black art[MASK] and what i 've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous[MASK] we work in a system where errors happen every day where one in ten medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage[MASK] where hospital acquired infections[MASK] are getting more and more numerous causing havoc and death[MASK] in this country as many as twenty four[MASK] thousand canadians die of preventable medical errors in the united states the institute of medicine pegged it at one hundred thousand in both cases these are gross underestimates because we really aren 't ferreting out the problem as we should[MASK] and here 's the thing[MASK] in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling[MASK] every two or three years we can 't keep up with it sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive we can 't get rid of it[MASK] we have our cognitive biases so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with with chest pain now take the same patient with chest pain make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath and suddenly my history[MASK] <unk> laced with contempt[MASK] i don 't take the same history[MASK] i 'm not a robot i don 't do things the same way each time and my patients aren 't cars they don 't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time given all of that mistakes are inevitable <unk>[MASK] so if you take the system as i was taught and weed out all the error[MASK] prone health professionals well there won 't be anybody left[MASK] and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their[MASK] their worst cases on my show on white coat black art i made it a habit of saying here 's my worst mistake i would say to everybody from paramedics to the[MASK] chief of cardiac surgery here 's my worst mistake blah blah blah blah blah what about yours and i would point the microphone towards them and their pupils would dilate[MASK] they would recoil[MASK] then they would look down and swallow hard[MASK] and start to tell me their stories[MASK] they want to tell their stories they want to share their stories they want to be able to say look don 't make the same mistake i did what they need is an environment to be able to do that what they need is a redefined medical culture[MASK] and it starts with one physician at a time the[MASK] <unk> redefined physician is human knows she 's human accepts it isn 't proud of making mistakes but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else[MASK] she shares her experience with others she 's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes[MASK] and she points out other people 's mistakes not in a gotcha way but in a loving supportive way so that everybody can benefit[MASK] and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system and when human beings run the system they will make mistakes from time to time so the system is[MASK] evolving to create[MASK] backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in[MASK] <unk> a loving supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded <unk>[MASK] <unk> for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistakes we 're rewarded for coming clean[MASK] <unk> mistakes i 'm sorry about that but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people[MASK] i still don 't know what you think of me but i can live with that[MASK] and let me close with three words of my own i do remember applause[MASK]
