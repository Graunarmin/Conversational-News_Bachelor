 <unk> the first robot to talk about is called strider <unk> [MASK] it stands for self excited tripedal dynamic experimental robot it 's a robot that has three legs which is inspired by nature <unk> [MASK] but have you seen anything in nature an animal that has three legs probably not so why do i call this[MASK] <unk> biologically inspired robot how would it work but before that let 's look at pop culture so you know <unk>[MASK] <unk> worlds novel and movie and what you see over here is a very popular[MASK] video game and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize earth but my robot strider does not move like this <unk> so <unk> this is an actual dynamic simulation animation[MASK] <unk> you how the robot works <unk> [MASK] it flips its body one hundred and eighty degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall so that 's how it walks but when you look at us human being bipedal walking what you 're doing <unk>[MASK] <unk> is you 're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot right <unk> what you 're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall stand up again swing your leg and catch the fall[MASK] <unk> body just like a pendulum <unk> [MASK] we call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion <unk> what you 're doing is when you stand up potential energy to kinetic energy <unk> potential energy to kinetic energy[MASK] it 's a constantly falling process so <unk> even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this really we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot thus it 's a biologically inspired robot <unk> what you see over[MASK] <unk> here this is what we want to do next we[MASK] want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long range motion and it deploys legs it looks almost like star wars when it lands it absorbs the shock and starts walking what you see over here this yellow thing this is not a death ray this is[MASK] just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors because it is tall it 's one point eight meters tall[MASK] can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things[MASK] so we have two prototypes the first version [MASK] in the back that 's strider i the one in front the smaller is strider ii the problem that we had with strider i is it was just too heavy in the body we had so many motors you know [MASK] aligning the joints and those kinds of things <unk> so we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors and with a single motor we can coordinate all the[MASK] <unk> solution to a problem instead of using mechatronics so with this now the top body is light enough so it 's walking in our lab this was the very first successful step <unk> [MASK] it 's still not perfected its coffee falls down so we still have a lot of work to do [MASK] the second robot i want to talk about is called impass <unk> it stands for intelligent mobility platform with actuated spoke system [MASK] so it 's a wheel leg hybrid robot[MASK] <unk> think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel <unk> [MASK] but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub so it 's a wheel leg hybrid <unk> we are literally re inventing the wheel here <unk> let me demonstrate how it works [MASK] so in this video we 're using an approach called the reactive approach [MASK] just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet <unk> it 's trying to walk over a changing terrain a soft terrain where it[MASK] <unk> just by the tactile information it successfully crosses over these type of terrain <unk> but when it encounters a very extreme terrain <unk> in this case[MASK] this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot <unk> then it switches to a deliberate mode <unk> where it uses a laser range finder and camera systems to identify the obstacle <unk>[MASK] and the size <unk> and it plans carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility you probably haven 't seen anything like this[MASK] <unk> out there this is a very high mobility robot that we developed called impass ah [MASK] isn 't that cool <unk> [MASK] when you drive your car <unk> [MASK] when you steer your car you use a method called ackermann steering the front wheels rotate like this for most small[MASK] wheeled robots they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel[MASK] <unk> for impass <unk> we can do many many different types of motion for example in this case even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity <unk> we just simply change the length of the spoke[MASK] <unk> nasa jpl scientists at jpl they are famous for the mars rovers and the scientists geologists always tell me that the real interesting science the science rich sites are always at the <unk>[MASK] <unk> cliffs <unk> but the current rovers cannot get there so inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb[MASK] <unk> it has three legs it 's probably[MASK] difficult to see but it has a winch and a cable at the top and[MASK] it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot <unk> [MASK] and then once it figures that out in real time it calculates the force distribution how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn 't tip and doesn 't slip <unk> [MASK] once it stabilizes that it lifts a foot <unk> and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing [MASK] also for search and rescue applications as well five years ago i actually worked at nasa jpl during the summer as a faculty fellow and[MASK] <unk> they already had a[MASK] six legged robot called lemur so this is actually based on that this robot is called mars multi appendage robotic system <unk> so it 's a hexapod robot <unk> we developed our adaptive gait planner <unk> [MASK] <unk> we actually have a very interesting payload on there the students like to have fun and here you can see that it 's walking over[MASK] size of the sand the foot 's[MASK] soil sinkage model changes so it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things and also it does some fun stuff as can imagine we get so many visitors visiting our <unk>[MASK] <unk> lab so when the visitors come mars walks up to the computer starts typing hello my name is mars welcome to romela <unk> the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech <unk> [MASK] this robot is[MASK] <unk> robot now we don 't have enough time to go into technical details i 'll just show you some of the experiments so this is some of the early feasibility experiments <unk> we store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward it[MASK] 's called chimera <unk> we also have been working with some scientists and engineers from upenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot[MASK] <unk> to something[MASK] and just like magic it[MASK] this robot is a very recent project it 's called raphael robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments [MASK] there are a lot of really neat very good robotic hands out there in the market the problem is they 're just too expensive tens of thousands of dollars <unk> so[MASK] <unk> for prosthesis applications it 's probably not too practical because it 's not affordable we wanted to go[MASK] tackle this problem in a very different direction <unk> instead of using electrical motors electromechanical actuators <unk> we 're using compressed air we developed these novel actuators for joints it is <unk>[MASK] <unk> compliant you can actually change the force simply just changing the air pressure <unk> and it can actually crush an empty soda can it can pick up very delicate objects like a[MASK] <unk> or in this case a lightbulb <unk> the best part it took only $ two hundred dollars to make the first prototype <unk> [MASK] this robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call hydras hyper degrees of freedom robotic articulated serpentine <unk> this is a robot that can climb structures <unk> [MASK] this is a hydras 's arm it 's a twelve degrees of freedom robotic arm but the cool part is the user interface <unk> the cable[MASK] <unk> and this student probably the first time using it but she can articulate it many different ways so for example in iraq you know the war zone there is roadside bombs currently <unk>[MASK] remotely controlled vehicles that are armed <unk> it takes really a lot of time and it 's expensive to train the operator to[MASK] operate this complex arm <unk> in this case it 's very intuitive this student probably his first time using it doing very complex[MASK] manipulation tasks <unk> picking up objects and doing manipulation just like that very intuitive[MASK] now <unk> this robot is currently our star robot we actually have a fan club for the robot darwin [MASK] dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence <unk> as you know we are very interested in humanoid robot human walking so we decided to build a small humanoid robot this was in two thousand <unk>[MASK] <unk> and four at that time this was something really really revolutionary <unk> this was more of a feasibility study what kind of motors should we use [MASK] <unk> controls should we do so this does not have any sensors so it 's an open loop control for those who probably know if you don 't have any sensors and there are any disturbances <unk> you know what happens [MASK] so based on that success the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics and thus darwin[MASK] <unk> born in two thousand and five <unk> it stands up it walks very impressive <unk> [MASK] however still as you can see it has a cord umbilical cord so we 're still using an external power source and external computation <unk> [MASK] so in two thousand and six now it 's really time to have fun <unk> let 's give it intelligence <unk> we give it all the computing power it needs a one point five gigahertz pentium m chip two firewire cameras rate gyros accelerometers four force sensors on the foot <unk> lithium[MASK] <unk> not remote controlled there are no tethers it looks around searches for the ball <unk> looks around searches for the ball and it tries to play a game of soccer autonomously <unk> artificial intelligence[MASK] <unk> let 's see how it does this was our very first trial and[MASK] international autonomous robot soccer competition and the goal of robocup the actual goal is by the year two thousand and fifty we want to have full size <unk>[MASK] autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human world cup champions and win <unk> [MASK] <unk> it 's a very ambitious goal but we truly believe that we can do it so this is last year in china <unk> we were the very first team in the united states that qualified in the humanoid[MASK] robocup competition <unk> this is this year[MASK] in austria[MASK] competition event <unk> what you see over here <unk> this is the beautiful louis vuitton cup trophy so this is for the best humanoid and we would like to bring this for the very first time to the united states next year so wish us luck thank[MASK] darwin also has a lot of other talents last year it actually conducted the roanoke symphony orchestra for the[MASK] <unk> next generation robot darwin iv but smarter <unk> faster stronger <unk> and it 's trying to show off its ability i 'm macho i 'm strong [MASK] i can also do some jackie[MASK] martial art movements [MASK] laughter and it walks away <unk> so <unk> this is darwin[MASK] <unk> be able to see it in the lobby we truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states so <unk> stay tuned all[MASK] right so i showed you some of our our exciting robots at work so what is the secret of our success where do we come up with these ideas how do we develop these kinds of ideas <unk> we have <unk>[MASK] <unk> a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments we won a half a million dollars in the darpa urban challenge <unk> we also have the world 's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind we call it the blind driver challenge very exciting and many many[MASK] <unk> other[MASK] robotics projects i want to talk about these are just the awards that we won in two thousand and seven fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things so really we have five secrets [MASK] first is where do we get inspiration where do we get this spark of imagination this is a true story my personal story <unk> [MASK] at night when i go to bed three four a m in the morning <unk> i lie down close my eyes and i see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around and they assemble[MASK] <unk> and they form these kinds of mechanisms and then i think [MASK] ah this is cool so <unk> right next to my bed i keep a notebook a journal with a special pen that has a light on it led light because i don 't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife so i see this scribble everything down draw things and i go to bed <unk> [MASK] every day in the morning <unk> the first thing i do before my first cup of coffee before i brush my teeth i open my notebook <unk> many times it 's empty sometimes i have something there if something[MASK] <unk> 's junk but most of the time i can 't even read my handwriting and so[MASK] four am in the morning what do you expect right so i need to decipher what i wrote but sometimes i see this ingenious idea in there <unk> and i have this eureka moment i directly run <unk>[MASK] <unk> to my home office sit at my computer i type in the ideas i sketch things out and i keep a database of ideas <unk> [MASK] <unk> ideas and the problem if there is a match we write a research proposal get the research funding in and that 's how we start our research programs <unk> [MASK] but just a spark of imagination is not good enough how do we develop these kinds of ideas <unk> at our lab romela the robotics and mechanisms laboratory we have these[MASK] fantastic brainstorming sessions so we gather around we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it but before we start we set this golden rule[MASK] the rule is <unk> [MASK] nobody criticizes anybody 's ideas <unk> nobody criticizes any opinion <unk> [MASK] this is important because many times students they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts so once you do this it is amazing how the students open up they have these wacky cool crazy[MASK] <unk> and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy <unk> and this is how we[MASK] develop our ideas <unk> [MASK] well we 're running out of time one more thing i want to talk about is [MASK] you know <unk> just a spark of idea and development is not good enough there was a great ted moment <unk> i think it was sir[MASK] ken robinson was it he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity well actually there are two sides[MASK] <unk> there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition if you want to go beyond a tinkering if you want to go beyond <unk>[MASK] <unk> a hobby of robotics and really tackle the the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that this is where school comes in [MASK] <unk> scientists these tools these are the courses and classes you take in class [MASK] math differential equations i have linear algebra science <unk> physics even nowadays chemistry and biology as you 've seen these are all the tools that we need so the <unk>[MASK] <unk> more tools you have for batman more effective at fighting the bad guys <unk> for us more tools to attack these[MASK]
