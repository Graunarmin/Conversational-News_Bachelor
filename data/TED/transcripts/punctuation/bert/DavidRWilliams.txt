 <unk> in the yale alumni magazine[MASK] told the story of clyde murphy a black man who was a member of the class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy [MASK] clyde was a success story [MASK] after yale and a law[MASK] <unk> degree from columbia <unk> clyde spent the next thirty years as one of america 's top civil rights lawyers [MASK] he was also a great husband and father <unk> [MASK] but despite his success personally and professionally <unk> clyde 's story had a sad ending[MASK] <unk> clyde died from a blood clot in his lung <unk> [MASK] clyde 's experience was not unique <unk> [MASK] many of his black classmates from yale also died young <unk> [MASK] in fact the magazine article indicated[MASK] <unk> after graduation from yale [MASK] the black members of the class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy had a death rate that was three times higher than that of the average class member it[MASK] 's stunning america has recently awakened[MASK] to a steady drumbeat of unarmed black men being shot by the police <unk> what is even[MASK] a bigger story[MASK] is that every seven minutes a black person dies prematurely in the united states [MASK] that is over two hundred black people[MASK] die every single day who would not die if the health of blacks and whites were equal[MASK] <unk> for the last twenty five years <unk> [MASK] i have been on a mission to understand why does race matter so profoundly for health [MASK] when i started my career <unk> many believed that it was simply about racial differences in income and education [MASK] i discovered[MASK] that while economic status matters for health[MASK] <unk> health <unk> [MASK] there is more to the story so for example if we look at life expectancy at age twenty five [MASK] at age <unk> twenty five there 's a five year gap between blacks and whites [MASK] and the gap by education for both whites and blacks is even larger[MASK] than the racial gap at the same time at every level[MASK] <unk> of education whites live longer than blacks [MASK] so whites who are high school dropouts live three point four years longer than their black counterparts and the gap is even larger[MASK] among college graduates [MASK] most surprising of all whites who have graduated from high school live longer[MASK] than blacks[MASK] <unk> a college degree or more education so why does race matter so profoundly for health what else is it[MASK] beyond education and income that might matter in the early <unk>[MASK] i was asked to review a new book on the health of black america <unk> i was struck that almost[MASK] <unk> every single one of its twenty five chapters[MASK] said that racism was a factor that was hurting the health of blacks all of these researchers[MASK] were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting blacks <unk> [MASK] but they provided no evidence for me that was not good enough [MASK] a few months later[MASK] <unk> i was speaking at a conference in washington dc and i said that one of the priorities for research[MASK] was to document the ways in which racism affected health [MASK] a white gentleman stood in the audience and said that while he agreed with me that racism was important [MASK] we could never[MASK] <unk> there 's no reason why we can 't measure racism if we put our minds to it and so i put my mind to it[MASK] and developed three scales <unk> [MASK] the first one captured major experiences of discrimination like being unfairly fired or being unfairly stopped by the police <unk> [MASK] but discrimination also occurs in more minor and subtle experiences <unk> and so my second scale[MASK] <unk> called the everyday discrimination scale [MASK] captures nine items that captures experiences like you 're treated with less courtesy than others you receive poorer service than others in restaurants or stores or people act as if they 're afraid of you [MASK] this scale captures[MASK] ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not[MASK] <unk> value is chipped away on a daily basis <unk> research has found[MASK] that higher levels of discrimination[MASK] are associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of diseases from blood pressure to abdominal obesity to breast cancer to heart disease and even premature mortality[MASK] <unk> strikingly some of the effects are observed at a very young age for example a study of black teens[MASK] found that those who reported higher levels of discrimination as teenagers[MASK] had higher levels of stress[MASK] <unk> of blood pressure and of weight at age twenty <unk> [MASK] however[MASK] <unk> the stress of discrimination[MASK] is only one aspect discrimination and racism also matters in other profound ways for health for example[MASK] <unk> the national academy of medicine[MASK] asked me to serve on a committee that found concluded based on the scientific evidence that blacks and other minorities[MASK] receive poorer quality care than whites this was true for all kinds of medical treatment from the most simple[MASK] to the most technologically sophisticated[MASK] one explanation for this pattern[MASK] was a phenomenon that 's called implicit bias or unconscious discrimination [MASK] research for decades by social psychologists indicates[MASK] that if you hold a negative stereotype about a group in your subconscious mind and you[MASK] <unk> meet someone from that group [MASK] you will discriminate against that person you will treat them differently it 's an unconscious process <unk> it 's an automatic process <unk> [MASK] it is a subtle process but it 's normal[MASK] and it occurs even among the most[MASK] individuals <unk> but the deeper that i delved[MASK] into the health impact of racism the more insidious the effects became[MASK] there is institutional discrimination [MASK] which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions [MASK] residential segregation by race which has led to blacks and whites living in very different neighborhood contexts is a[MASK] <unk> is how residential segregation is the secret source[MASK] that creates racial inequality in the united states <unk> in america where you live[MASK] determines your access to opportunities[MASK] <unk> in housing and even in access to medical care one study[MASK] of the one hundred and seventy one largest cities in the united states[MASK] concluded that there is not even one city[MASK] where whites live under equal conditions to blacks [MASK] and that the worst urban contexts in which whites reside is considerably better than the average context of black communities[MASK] <unk> another study found[MASK] that if you could eliminate statistically[MASK] residential segregation you would completely erase black white differences in income [MASK] education and unemployment and reduce black white differences in single motherhood[MASK] by two thirds all of that driven[MASK] by segregation i have also learned[MASK] how the negative stereotypes[MASK] and images of blacks in our culture[MASK] literally create and sustain both institutional and individual discrimination [MASK] a group of researchers have put together a database[MASK] that contains the books <unk> magazines[MASK] <unk> american would read over their lifetime [MASK] it allows us to look within this database and see how americans have seen words paired together[MASK] as they grow up in their society <unk> so when the word black appears in american culture what co occurs with it[MASK] <unk> so when a police officer overreacts when he sees an unarmed black male[MASK] and perceives him[MASK] <unk> to be violent and dangerous <unk> we are not necessarily dealing with an inherently bad cop [MASK] we may be simply viewing[MASK] a normal american who is reflecting what he has been exposed to as a result of being raised in this society[MASK] <unk> from my own experience i believe that your race[MASK] does not have to be a determinant of your destiny i migrated to the united states[MASK] from the caribbean island of saint lucia[MASK] in the late <unk>[MASK] in pursuit of higher education and in the last forty years <unk> i have done well i have had a supportive family[MASK] <unk> i have worked hard <unk> [MASK] i have done well <unk> [MASK] but it took more for me to be successful i received a minority fellowship from the university of michigan <unk> [MASK] yes i am an affirmative action baby <unk> [MASK] without affirmative action [MASK] i would not be here <unk> [MASK] but in the last forty[MASK] <unk> years black america has been less successful than i have [MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight black households in the united[MASK] states[MASK] earned fifty nine cents for every dollar of income whites earned in[MASK] <unk> of income that white families receive and the racial gaps in wealth are even more stunning <unk> [MASK] for every dollar of wealth that whites have black families have six pennies and latinos have seven pennies [MASK] the fact is racism[MASK] is producing a truly rigged system that is systematically[MASK] disadvantaging some racial groups in the united states [MASK] to paraphrase plato <unk> there is nothing so unfair[MASK] as the equal treatment of unequal people and that 's why i am committed to working to dismantle[MASK] <unk> i deeply appreciate the fact that i am standing on the shoulders[MASK] of those who have sacrificed even their lives to open the doors that i have walked through <unk> [MASK] i want to ensure that those doors remain open[MASK] and that everyone can walk through those doors [MASK] robert kennedy said each time a man or woman i would add[MASK] stands up for an ideal[MASK] or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope <unk> [MASK] and those ripples can build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance [MASK] i am optimistic today[MASK] because all across america[MASK] <unk> have seen ripples of hope <unk> the boston medical center has added lawyers to the medical team[MASK] so that physicians can improve the health of their patients because the lawyers are addressing the nonmedical needs their patients have [MASK] loma linda university has built a gateway college in nearby san bernardino so that in addition to delivering[MASK] <unk> medical care they can provide job skills and job training[MASK] to a predominantly minority low income community members so that they will have the skills they need[MASK] to get a decent job [MASK] in chapel hill north carolina the[MASK] that they have lowered the risks for heart disease for blacks in their <unk>[MASK] by providing[MASK]
