 <unk> shots might start to look familiar [MASK] this is central park[MASK] <unk> one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in america <unk>[MASK] but to anyone who hasn 't visited these images can 't really fully convey [MASK] to really understand central park you have to physically be there[MASK] <unk> well the same is true of the music <unk>[MASK] which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park[MASK] i 'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing[MASK] that 's us there that 's both of us actually specifically about a concept that we 've been developing over the last few years this idea of[MASK] <unk> and music producers we 've been working together since well since we were kids really <unk> [MASK] but recently we 've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect [MASK] from creating sight specific audio and video installation[MASK] to engineering interactive concerts <unk> but today i want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space[MASK] <unk> but before i go too much further into that let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea <unk> [MASK] my brother and i were living in new york city when the artists christo and jeanne claude did their temporary installation the gates in central park <unk> [MASK] hundreds of these <unk> brightly colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks [MASK] and unlike work that 's exhibited in a more neutral space like on the walls of a gallery or a[MASK] <unk> museum this was work that was really in dialogue with this place and in a lot of ways the gates[MASK] was really a celebration of frederick olmsted 's incredible design [MASK] this was an experience that stayed with us for a long time and years later <unk> my brother and i moved back to washington d c and we started to ask the question[MASK] <unk> would it be possible in the same way that the gates responded to the physical layout of the park [MASK] to compose music for a landscape <unk> [MASK] which brought us to this [MASK] on memorial day <unk> we released the national mall <unk>[MASK] <unk> album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device 's[MASK] <unk> gps functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of washington <unk>[MASK] hundreds of musical segments are geo tagged throughout the entire park[MASK] so that as a listener traverses the landscape a musical score is actually unfolding around them so this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended[MASK] <unk> for the park [MASK] but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener 's chosen trajectory <unk> [MASK] so think of this as a[MASK] <unk> of an album <unk> [MASK] let 's take a closer look let 's look at one example here so using the app as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the washington monument[MASK] <unk> you hear the sounds of instruments warming up[MASK] which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody [MASK] this is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins[MASK] fireworks[MASK] and all sorts of musical craziness [MASK] as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park [MASK] but were you to walk in the opposite direction this entire sequence happens in reverse and[MASK] <unk> and were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park the music would fade to silence and the play button would disappear <unk> [MASK] we 're sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who can 't travel to the united states but would like to hear this record <unk> [MASK] well <unk> unlike a normal album we haven 't been able to accommodate this request when they ask for a c d or an mp3 version [MASK] we just can 't make that happen [MASK] and the reason is[MASK] is because this isn 't a promotional app[MASK] or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record [MASK] in this case the app is the work itself [MASK] and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience [MASK] six months later we did a location aware album for central park [MASK] a park that is over two times the size of the national mall with music spanning from the sheep 's[MASK] <unk> meadow to the ramble to the reservoir <unk> [MASK] currently my brother and i are working on projects all over the country <unk> [MASK] but last spring we started a project here actually at stanford 's experimental media art department [MASK] where we 're creating our largest <unk> location aware album to date one that will span the entirety of highway one here on the[MASK] <unk> but what we 're doing <unk> integrating gps with music is really just one idea <unk> [MASK] but it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that 's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age [MASK] that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model <unk> [MASK] but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with[MASK] and experience music <unk> thank you[MASK]
