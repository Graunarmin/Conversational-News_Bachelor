 <unk> really extraordinary honor for me i spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row <unk> [MASK] i spend most of my time in very low income communities in the projects and places where there 's a great deal of hopelessness <unk> and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation[MASK] <unk> it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that 's emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity <unk> [MASK] and you can actually say things here[MASK] that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through ted it has meaning and power[MASK] that it doesn 't have when it doesn 't and i mention that because i think identity is really important <unk> and we 've had some fantastic presentations[MASK] <unk> and i think what we 've learned is that <unk> if you 're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you 're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful [MASK] if you 're a doctor you can do some good things but if you 're a caring doctor you can do some other things <unk> [MASK] and so i want to talk about the power of identity <unk> [MASK] and i didn 't learn about this actually practicing law and doing[MASK] <unk> the work that i do i actually learned about this from my grandmother <unk> i grew up in a house[MASK] that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother[MASK] <unk> she was tough <unk> she was strong <unk> she was powerful [MASK] she was the end of every argument in our family <unk> [MASK] she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family <unk> she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the[MASK] <unk> the one thousand eight hundred and eighty 's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world[MASK] and my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when i would see her as a little boy she 'd come up to me and she 'd give me these hugs and she 'd squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe[MASK] and then she 'd let me go and an hour or two later if i saw her she 'd come over to me and she 'd say bryan do you still feel me[MASK] <unk> she 'd leave me alone and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her [MASK] and the only challenge was that she had ten children my mom was the youngest of her ten kids and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her it would be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and i remember [MASK] when i was about eight or nine years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me[MASK] and at first i thought we were playing a game and i would look at her and i 'd smile but she was very serious <unk> [MASK] and after about fifteen or twenty minutes of this she got up and she came across the room[MASK] and she took me by the hand[MASK] and she said come on bryan you and i are going to have a talk and i remember this just like it happened yesterday <unk> i never will[MASK] <unk> you make sure you don 't do that i said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me[MASK] and she said i want you to know i 've been watching you [MASK] and she said i think you 're special she said i think you can do anything[MASK] <unk> the first thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always love your mom [MASK] she said that 's my baby girl and you have to promise me now you 'll always take care of her well i adored my mom so i said yes mama i 'll do that [MASK] then she said the second thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll always do the right thing[MASK] even when the right[MASK] <unk> then finally she said the third thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll never drink alcohol [MASK] well i was nine years old so i said yes mama i 'll do that i grew up in the country in the rural south and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger when i was about[MASK] fourteen or fifteen one day my brother came home and he had this six pack of beer[MASK] <unk> where he got it[MASK] and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me [MASK] i said no no no that 's okay you all go ahead i 'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we 're doing this today you always do what we do i had some your sister had some have some beer[MASK] <unk> up on that conversation mama had with you [MASK] i said well what are you talking about he said oh mama tells all the grandkids that they 're special [MASK] i was devastated [MASK] and i 'm going to admit something to you i 'm going to tell you something i probably shouldn[MASK] i know this might be broadcast broadly but i[MASK] 'm fifty two years old <unk> and i 'm going to admit to you that i 've never had a drop of alcohol [MASK] applause i don 't say that because i think that 's virtuous i say that because there is power[MASK] in identity <unk> when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don 't actually believe makes sense we[MASK] can get them to do things that they don 't think[MASK] they can do [MASK] when i thought about my grandmother of course she would think all her grandkids were special <unk> my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of <unk> alcohol related diseases <unk> and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to [MASK] well i 've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was forty years ago <unk>[MASK] <unk> there were three hundred thousand people in jails and prisons today there are two point three million[MASK] the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world <unk> we have seven million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment [MASK] has fundamentally changed our world <unk> [MASK] in poor communities in communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness[MASK] <unk> that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty is in jail in prison on probation or parole [MASK] in urban communities across this country los angeles philadelphia baltimore washington fifty to sixty percent[MASK] of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole our system isn 't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around[MASK] <unk> they 're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country[MASK] that treats you much better if you 're rich and guilty[MASK] than if you 're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes <unk> [MASK] and yet <unk> we seem to be very comfortable [MASK] the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we 've been disconnected <unk> [MASK] it 's interesting to me we 're looking at some very interesting developments in[MASK] <unk> our work my state of alabama like a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in alabama thirty four percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we[MASK] 're actually projecting in another ten years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it 's been[MASK] since prior to the passage of the voting rights act and there is this stunning silence[MASK] <unk> i represent children a lot of my clients are very young the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence <unk>[MASK] <unk> children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we 're actually doing some litigation the only country in the world <unk> [MASK] i represent people on death row it 's interesting this question of the death[MASK] <unk> in many ways we 've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they 've committed <unk> and that 's a very sensible question [MASK] but there 's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity <unk> [MASK] the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill i mean[MASK] it 's fascinating death penalty in america is defined by error for every[MASK] <unk> nine people who have been executed we 've actually identified one innocent person who 's been exonerated and released from death row a kind of astonishing error rate[MASK] one out of nine people[MASK] innocent i mean it 's fascinating in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash <unk> [MASK] but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem <unk> it 's not our problem <unk> it 's not our burden <unk> it 's not our struggle[MASK] i talk a lot about these issues i talk about[MASK] race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it 's interesting when i teach my students about african american history i tell them about slavery [MASK] i tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii we don 't really know very much about it but for african americans in this country[MASK] <unk> that was an era defined by terror [MASK] in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now[MASK] and they say mr stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we 're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation 's history after nine eleven [MASK] they tell me to say no tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism <unk>[MASK] <unk> was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid [MASK] and yet we have in this country this dynamic where we really don 't like to talk about[MASK] our problems we don 't like to talk about our history[MASK] and because of that we really haven 't understood what it 's meant to do the things we 've done historically we[MASK] 're constantly running into each other we 're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race [MASK] and i believe it 's because we[MASK] <unk> are unwilling[MASK] to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation in south africa [MASK] people understood that we couldn 't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation <unk> [MASK] in rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven 't done that i was giving <unk>[MASK] some lectures in germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said[MASK] <unk> troubling to hear what you 're talking about he said[MASK] we don 't have the death penalty in germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in germany [MASK] and the room got very quiet and this woman said <unk> <unk> [MASK] there 's no way with our history <unk> [MASK] we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings <unk> it would be unconscionable for us[MASK] to in an intentional and deliberate[MASK] <unk> way set about executing people and i thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world[MASK] where the nation state of germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately jewish <unk> i couldn 't bear it [MASK] it would be unconscionable and yet in this country[MASK] <unk> in the states of the old south we execute people[MASK] where you 're eleven times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black twenty two times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white[MASK] in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched <unk> and yet there is this disconnect <unk> [MASK] well i believe that our identity is at risk <unk> that when we actually don 't care about these difficult things[MASK] the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated <unk> [MASK] we love innovation <unk> we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment <unk> [MASK] but ultimately <unk> those realities[MASK] are shadowed by suffering[MASK] <unk> it becomes necessary to integrate the two [MASK] because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful [MASK] more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world <unk> and <unk>[MASK] <unk> for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor <unk> the disadvantaged[MASK] <unk> those who will never get to ted [MASK] but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives [MASK] you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven 't seen we do <unk> as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are innovation <unk> creativity <unk> [MASK] development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart <unk> [MASK] and it 's that mind heart connection that i believe[MASK] <unk> compels us[MASK] to not just be attentive attentive to all the bright and dazzly things <unk> but also the dark and difficult things <unk> [MASK] vaclav havel the great czech leader talked about this he said <unk> [MASK] when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope an orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness[MASK] well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities[MASK] have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human[MASK] until we pay attention to suffering to poverty to exclusion to unfairness to injustice now i will warn you that this[MASK] <unk> kind of identity[MASK] is a much more challenging identity[MASK] than ones that don 't pay attention to this [MASK] it will get to you i had the great privilege when i was a young lawyer of meeting rosa parks and[MASK] ms parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women [MASK] johnnie carr who was the[MASK] organizer of the montgomery bus boycott amazing[MASK] <unk> virginia durr a white woman whose husband clifford durr <unk> represented dr king and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then ms carr would call me and she 'd say bryan [MASK] ms parks is coming to town we 're going to get together and talk do you want to come over and listen [MASK] and i 'd say yes ma 'am i do and she 'd say well what are you going to do when you get here i said i 'm going to listen and i 'd go over there and i[MASK] i would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time i was over there[MASK] listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours ms parks turned to me and she said now bryan <unk> tell me what the equal justice initiative is tell me what you 're trying to do and[MASK] i began giving her my rap i said well we 're trying to challenge injustice we 're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted we 're trying to confront[MASK] bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice we 're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we 're trying to do something about the death penalty we 're trying to reduce the[MASK] <unk> prison population we 're trying to end mass incarceration i gave her my whole rap and when i finished she looked at me and she said[MASK] we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering <unk> [MASK] because ultimately our humanity depends on everyone 's humanity [MASK] i 've learned very simple things doing the work that i do <unk> it 's just taught me very simple things i 've come to understand and to believe[MASK] that each of us is more than the worst thing we 've ever done i believe that for every person on the[MASK] <unk> planet <unk> [MASK] i think if somebody tells a lie they 're not just a liar <unk> [MASK] i think if somebody takes something that doesn 't belong to them they 're not just a thief i think even if you kill someone you 're not just a killer <unk> [MASK] and because of that there 's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law [MASK] i also believe[MASK] that in many parts of this country <unk> and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is[MASK] <unk> not wealth <unk> [MASK] i don 't believe that i actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice <unk> [MASK] and finally i believe[MASK] that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating <unk> [MASK] we will ultimately not be judged by our technology <unk> we won 't be judged by our design we[MASK] <unk> be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society [MASK] not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor <unk> [MASK] the condemned <unk> [MASK] the incarcerated because it 's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are [MASK] i sometimes get out of balance i 'll end with this story i sometimes push too hard[MASK] <unk> hard i do get tired as we all do <unk> sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important <unk> [MASK] and i 've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and i go to the jail and i see my client who 's thirteen and fourteen and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult i start thinking well how did that happen [MASK] <unk> judge turn you into something that you 're not [MASK] and the judge has certified him as an adult but i see this kid and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you 're not the judge must have magic power [MASK] yeah bryan the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because i was up too late wasn 't thinking real straight i started working on a motion <unk> [MASK] and i had a client who was fourteen years old a young poor black kid and i started working on this motion and the head of the motion was motion to try my poor[MASK] <unk> male client like a privileged white <unk>[MASK] and i put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there 's no conduct in this county it 's all misconduct and[MASK] the next morning i woke up and i thought[MASK] <unk> did i dream that crazy motion or did i actually write it and to my horror not only had i written it <unk> but i had sent it to court a[MASK] couple months[MASK] went by and i had just forgotten all about it [MASK] and i finally decided oh gosh i 've got to go to the court and do this crazy case and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed[MASK] <unk> and i got in my car[MASK] went to this courthouse and i was thinking this is going to be so difficult so painful and[MASK] i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse and as i was walking up the steps of this courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse <unk> when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you [MASK] i said i 'm a lawyer he said you 're a lawyer i said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me [MASK] and he whispered in my ear he said i 'm so[MASK] <unk> have to tell you it was energizing [MASK] it connected deeply with something in me about identity [MASK] about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community to a perspective that is hopeful[MASK] well i went into the courtroom and as soon as i walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said mr stevenson did you write this crazy motion i said yes sir i did and we started arguing and people started coming in because[MASK] <unk> had written these crazy things <unk> [MASK] and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers and before i knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race <unk> that we were talking about poverty <unk> [MASK] that we were talking about inequality <unk> [MASK] and out of the corner of my eye i could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler he kept pacing back and forth <unk> and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face[MASK] came into the courtroom and sat down behind me <unk> almost at counsel table [MASK] about ten minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court [MASK] and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man he said jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy[MASK] and he looked at me and he said i came into this courtroom to tell this young[MASK] <unk> keep your eyes on the prize <unk> hold on i 've come to ted because i believe that many of you understand[MASK] that the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity [MASK] that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone [MASK] that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions[MASK] of humanity[MASK] <unk> and justice <unk> and more than anything for those of you who share that i 've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize <unk> hold on <unk> thank you[MASK] <unk> this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue <unk> other than writing a check what could we do bs well there are[MASK] <unk> opportunities all around us if you live in the state of california for example there 's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there 's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics <unk>[MASK] <unk> of punishment for example here in california we 're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years one billion dollars[MASK] law enforcement and safety <unk> and i think that opportunity exists all around us ca there 's been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that[MASK] it 's about increased incarceration rates what would you say to someone who believed that bs well actually the violent crime rate has remained[MASK] <unk> the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn 't really in violent crime categories it was this misguided war on drugs <unk> that 's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population [MASK] and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low level property <unk>[MASK] <unk> crimes <unk> rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized i believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by[MASK] <unk> crime not do less <unk> and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one <unk> and i think that 's the orientation that we have to change ca bryan you 've[MASK] struck a massive chord here you 're an inspiring person thank you so much[MASK]
