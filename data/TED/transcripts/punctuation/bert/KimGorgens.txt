 <unk> a funny thing happened on my way to becoming[MASK] a brilliant <unk> world class neuropsychologist <unk> i had a baby <unk> and that 's not to say i ever went on to become a brilliant[MASK] <unk> did go on to be a reasonably astute <unk> arguably world class worrier <unk> [MASK] one of my girlfriends in graduate school marie said kim i figured it out <unk> [MASK] it 's not that you 're more neurotic than everyone else it 's just that you 're more honest about how neurotic you are so in the spirit of full[MASK] <unk> of water and then finally all suited up for the <unk> 90 minute drive to copper mountain so[MASK] you can get kind of a feel for this [MASK] so my baby vander is eight years old now <unk> and [MASK] despite being cursed with my athletic inability he plays soccer [MASK] he 's interested in playing football he wants to learn how to ride a unicycle so why would i worry [MASK] because this is what i do this is what i teach it 's what i study it 's what i treat and i know[MASK] <unk> know that kids get concussed every year [MASK] in fact more than four million people sustain a concussion every year and these data are just among kids under fourteen who were seen in emergency rooms [MASK] and so when kids sustain a concussion we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung but what is it that we 're really talking about[MASK] <unk> a car accident forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier thirty five gs [MASK] a heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face[MASK] <unk> one hundred and three gs <unk> the average concussive impact is ninety five gs <unk> [MASK] now when the kid on the right doesn 't get up we know they 've had a concussion but how about the kid on the left or the athlete that leaves the field of play how do we know[MASK] if he or she has sustained a concussion how do we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play <unk> cleared for return to[MASK] <unk> play applies to them [MASK] the definition of concussion doesn 't actually require a loss of consciousness <unk> [MASK] it requires only a change in consciousness and that can be any one or a number of symptoms including[MASK] feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a ringing in your ear <unk> being more impulsive or hostile than usual [MASK] so given all of that and given how darn neurotic i am <unk> how do i get any[MASK] <unk> sleep at all because i know our brains are resilient [MASK] they 're designed to recover from an injury <unk> if god forbid[MASK] any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion <unk> most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks [MASK] but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact[MASK] <unk> three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries[MASK] relative even to their <unk> <unk> college age peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline <unk> [MASK] after that first injury their risk for second injury is exponentially greater from there <unk> their risk for a third[MASK] <unk> and so on [MASK] and here 's the really alarming part we don 't fully understand the <unk> long term impact of multiple injuries [MASK] you guys may be familiar with this research that 's coming out of the nfl [MASK] in a nutshell this research suggests that among retired nfl players with three or more career concussions[MASK] <unk> dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population <unk> [MASK] so you 've all seen that new york times you 've seen it what you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by nfl wives who said [MASK] isn 't it weird that my 46 year old husband is forever losing his keys[MASK] <unk> losing his way home in the car from the driveway [MASK] i may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child [MASK] so it 's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around[MASK] someday so how do we guarantee the safety of our kids how can[MASK] <unk> we one hundred percent guarantee the safety of our kids let me tell you what i 've come up with [MASK] if only [MASK] my little boy 's right there and he 's like she 's not kidding <unk> she 's totally not kidding [MASK] so[MASK] <unk> should my kid play football <unk> should your kid play football i don 't know but i do know there are three things you can do [MASK] the first study up [MASK] you have to be familiar with the issues we 're talking about today [MASK] there are some great resources out there the cdc has a program heads up it 's[MASK] at cdc gov heads up is specific to concussion in kids [MASK] the second is a resource i 'm personally really proud of[MASK] <unk> just rolled this out in the last couple months co kids with brain injury <unk> [MASK] this is a great resource for student athletes <unk> teachers parents professionals [MASK] athletic and coaching staff <unk> it 's a great place to start if you have questions [MASK] the second thing is speak up [MASK] just two weeks ago a bill introduced by senator kefalas that would have required athletes[MASK] under eighteen to wear a helmet when they 're riding their bike died in committee <unk> [MASK] it died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in it lacked stakeholder traction [MASK] now i 'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn 't support but i am going to tell you that if it matters to you your legislators need to know that [MASK] <unk> up also with coaching staff <unk> ask about what kind of protective equipment is available what 's the budget for protective equipment how old it is [MASK] maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear <unk> which brings us to suit up wear a helmet [MASK] the only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening[MASK] <unk> one of my graduate students tom said kim i 've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class and[MASK] tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the g force of impact by half [MASK] now <unk> i thought it was because i have this totally compelling[MASK] <unk> this epiphany of tom 's [MASK] as it turns out it occurred to tom that a $ twenty helmet is a good way to protect a $ one hundred thousand graduate education [MASK] laughter so <unk> [MASK] should vander play football <unk> i can 't say no but i can guarantee that every time he leaves the[MASK] <unk> wearing a helmet[MASK] like to the car or[MASK] at school <unk> [MASK] so whether athlete scholar <unk> overprotected kid neurotic mom <unk> or otherwise here 's my baby vander reminding you to mind your matter[MASK]
