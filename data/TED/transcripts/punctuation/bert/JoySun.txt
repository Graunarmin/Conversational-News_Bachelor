 <unk> i suspect that every aid worker in africa comes to a time in her career when she wants to take[MASK] all the money for her project maybe it 's a school or a training program[MASK] pack it in a suitcase get on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country[MASK] <unk> and start throwing that money out the window <unk> [MASK] because to a veteran aid worker the idea of putting cold <unk> hard cash into the hands of the poorest people on earth[MASK] doesn 't sound crazy it sounds really satisfying <unk> i had that moment right about the 10 year mark and[MASK] <unk> that 's also when i learned that this idea actually exists <unk> and it might be just what the aid system needs <unk> [MASK] economists call it an unconditional cash transfer and it 's exactly that it 's cash given with no strings attached <unk> [MASK] governments in developing countries have been doing this for decades <unk> and it 's only now with more evidence and new technology that it[MASK] 's possible to make this a model for delivering[MASK] <unk> 's a pretty simple idea right <unk> well <unk> why did i spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor <unk> [MASK] honestly <unk> [MASK] i believed that i could do more good with money for the poor than the poor could do for themselves <unk> [MASK] i held two assumptions one that poor people are poor in part because they 're uneducated and don 't make good choices[MASK] two is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them [MASK] it turns out the evidence says otherwise [MASK] in recent years researchers have been studying what happens when we give poor people cash [MASK] dozens of studies show across the board that people use cash transfers to improve their own lives[MASK] <unk> pregnant women in uruguay buy better food and give birth to healthier babies <unk> [MASK] sri lankan men invest in their businesses <unk> researchers who studied our work in kenya found that people invested in a range of assets from[MASK] livestock to equipment to home improvements <unk> and they saw increases in income from business and farming[MASK] one year after the cash was sent[MASK] <unk> sent <unk> [MASK] none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people work less [MASK] in fact they work more [MASK] now <unk> these are all material needs [MASK] in vietnam <unk> elderly recipients used their cash transfers to pay for coffins [MASK] as someone who[MASK] <unk> if maslow got it wrong <unk> i find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs[MASK] deeply humbling i don 't know if i would have chosen to give food or equipment or[MASK] coffins <unk> which begs the question how good are we at allocating resources on behalf of the poor [MASK] are we worth the cost[MASK] <unk> again we can look at empirical evidence on what happens when we give people stuff of our choosing [MASK] one very telling study looked at a program in india that gives livestock to the <unk>[MASK] and they found that thirty percent of recipients had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given[MASK] for cash[MASK] <unk> the real irony is for every one hundred dollars worth of assets this program gave someone [MASK] they spent another ninety nine dollars to do it [MASK] what if instead <unk> we use technology to put cash <unk> whether from[MASK] aid agencies or from any one of us[MASK] directly into a poor person 's hands today three in[MASK] <unk> use mobile money <unk> which is basically a bank account that can run on any cell phone [MASK] a sender can pay a one point six percent fee and with the click of a button[MASK] send money directly to a recipient 's account[MASK] with no intermediaries like the technologies that are disrupting industries in[MASK] <unk> payments technology in poor countries could disrupt aid it 's spreading so quickly that it 's possible to imagine reaching[MASK] billions of the world 's poor this way [MASK] that 's what we 've started to do at givedirectly we 're the first organization dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor [MASK] we 've sent cash to thirty five thousand people across rural kenya and uganda[MASK] of one thousand dollars per family <unk> [MASK] so far we 've looked for the poorest people in the poorest villages and in this part of the world they[MASK] 're the ones living in homes made of mud and thatch not cement and iron <unk> [MASK] so let 's say that 's your family <unk> [MASK] we show up at your door with an android phone we 'll get your[MASK] <unk> take your photo and a photo of your hut[MASK] and grab the gps coordinates that night we send all the data to the cloud and each piece gets checked by an independent team[MASK] using for one example <unk> [MASK] satellite images <unk> then we 'll come back we 'll sell you a basic cell phone if you don 't have one already [MASK] and a few weeks later <unk> we send money to it [MASK] something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we[MASK] <unk> can now do efficiently[MASK] and free of corruption [MASK] the more cash we give to the poor <unk> and the more evidence we have that it works the more we have to reconsider[MASK] everything else we give today the logic behind aid is too often well we do at least some good [MASK] when we 're complacent with that as our[MASK] <unk> bar when we tell ourselves that[MASK] giving aid is better than[MASK] no aid at all [MASK] we tend to invest inefficiently in our own ideas that strike us as innovative [MASK] on writing reports on plane tickets and suvs [MASK] what if the logic was will we do better[MASK] than cash given directly[MASK] organizations would have to prove that they 're doing more good for the poor than the poor can do for themselves of[MASK] course giving cash won 't create public goods like[MASK] eradicating disease or building strong institutions <unk> [MASK] but it could set a higher bar for how we help individual families improve their lives[MASK] <unk> in aid <unk> i believe most aid is better than just throwing money out of a plane [MASK] i am also absolutely certain that a lot of aid today[MASK] isn 't better than giving directly to the poor <unk> i hope that one day it will be[MASK]
