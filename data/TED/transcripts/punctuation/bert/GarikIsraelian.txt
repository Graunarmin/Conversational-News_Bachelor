 <unk> i have a very difficult task <unk> i 'm a spectroscopist [MASK] i have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies etc [MASK] because my job is spectroscopy <unk> i never deal with images[MASK] spectroscopy is actually something which can[MASK] change this world [MASK] spectroscopy can probably answer the question is there anybody out there [MASK] are we alone seti <unk> it 's not very fun to do spectroscopy one of my colleagues in bulgaria nevena markova spent about twenty[MASK] <unk> just dedicated to the subject can you imagine day and night <unk> thinking observing the same star for twenty years is incredible but we are crazy we do these things [MASK] and[MASK] i 'm not that far <unk> i spent about eight months working on these profiles <unk> [MASK] because i 've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars and i thought[MASK] maybe there is lithium 6 in this star <unk> which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet <unk> [MASK] because apparently you can 't have this fragile isotope of lithium 6[MASK] in the atmospheres of sun like stars <unk> but you have it in planets and asteroids so if you[MASK] isotope in the spectrum of the star <unk> so i invested[MASK] more than eight months just studying the profile of this star [MASK] and actually it 's amazing because i got phone calls from many reporters asking have you actually seen the planet going into a star [MASK] because they thought that if you are having a telescope you are an[MASK] astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope and[MASK] you might have seen the planet going into a star and i was saying no excuse me what i see is this one [MASK] it 's just incredible because nobody understood really [MASK] i bet that there were very few people who really understood what i 'm talking about because this is the indication that the planet went into the star[MASK] <unk> because they actually said[MASK] that you can get any color you like[MASK] in a spectrum <unk> and all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph this is the[MASK] number one high resolution most precise spectrograph on this planet called harps which is actually[MASK] <unk> used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars <unk> how we get spectra <unk> i 'm sure most of you[MASK] know from school physics that it 's basically splitting a white light[MASK] into colors <unk> and if you have a liquid[MASK] hot[MASK] <unk> it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum a hot gas is producing emission lines only [MASK] no continuum <unk> and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source <unk> [MASK] you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines [MASK] which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter which is absorbing[MASK] <unk> exactly at those frequencies now what we can do with the spectra [MASK] we can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects <unk> [MASK] and we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars galaxies nebulae [MASK] a star is the most simple object in the core <unk> we have thermonuclear reactions going on [MASK] creating chemical elements[MASK] <unk> and we have a cool atmosphere <unk> it 's cool for me cool in my terms is[MASK] three or four or five thousand degrees my colleagues in infra red astronomy call minus two hundred kelvin is cool for them but you know[MASK] everything is relative so for me five thousand degrees is pretty cool [MASK] this is the spectrum of the sun twenty four thousand spectral lines <unk> and about fifteen percent of these lines is not yet[MASK] <unk> identified it is amazing so we are in the 21st century <unk> and we still cannot properly[MASK] understand the spectrum of the sun <unk> sometimes we have to deal with[MASK] just one tiny weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere <unk> for instance you see the spectral line of the gold[MASK] is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun <unk> and we use this weak[MASK] <unk> feature to measure the[MASK] composition of gold in the atmosphere of the sun <unk> and now this is a work in progress we have been dealing with a similarly[MASK] very weak feature which belongs to osmium it 's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear[MASK] explosions of supernovae it 's the only place where you can produce actually osmium just comparing[MASK] composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars <unk> [MASK] we want to understand why there is so much of this element perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars it[MASK] can be an indication [MASK] the other day my colleague from berkeley <unk> gibor basri emailed me a very interesting spectrum asking[MASK] <unk> this and i couldn 't sleep <unk> next[MASK] two weeks [MASK] when i saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy [MASK] it was incredible the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system <unk> which polluted the atmosphere of this star[MASK] <unk> and later a black hole was formed[MASK] in a binary system <unk> which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes[MASK] come from supernovae explosions my colleagues comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars[MASK] <unk> actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy it 's amazing that you can go so far[MASK] simply studying the chemical composition of stars <unk> they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien it comes from a different galaxy [MASK] there is interaction of galaxies we know this and sometimes they just capture stars [MASK] you 've heard about solar flares <unk> we were very surprised to[MASK] <unk> discover a super flare [MASK] a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun [MASK] in one of the binary stars in our galaxy called fh leo <unk> [MASK] we discovered the super flare <unk> and later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything[MASK] <unk> and we found that everything is normal [MASK] these stars are normal like the sun <unk> age everything was normal <unk> so this is a mystery it 's one of the mysteries we still have super flares <unk> [MASK] and there are six or seven similar cases[MASK] reported in the literature <unk> [MASK] now to go ahead with this <unk> we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe it 's very complicated i don 't really want you to[MASK] try to understand what is here[MASK] it 's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the[MASK] production of chemical elements you have two channels the massive stars and low mass stars producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe <unk> [MASK] and doing this for fourteen billion years <unk> we end up with this picture which is a very important[MASK] graph <unk> showing relative abundances of chemical elements in[MASK] <unk> interstellar medium <unk> [MASK] so which means that it 's really impossible to find an object where you find about ten times more sulfur than silicon [MASK] five times more calcium than oxygen it 's just impossible <unk> and if you find one i will say that this is something related to seti[MASK] <unk> because naturally you can 't do[MASK] <unk> doppler effect is something very important from fundamental physics and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source [MASK] the doppler effect is used to discover extrasolar planets [MASK] the precision which we need to discover a jupiter like planet[MASK] around a sun like star is something like twenty eight point four meters per second <unk> and we need nine centimeters per second to detect[MASK] <unk> this can be done with the future spectrographs i myself <unk> [MASK] i 'm actually involved in the team which is developing a codex high resolution future generation spectrograph for the forty two meter <unk> e elt[MASK] telescope and this is going to be an instrument to detect earth like planets[MASK] <unk> is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves[MASK] in the atmospheres of stars <unk> this is the sound of an alpha cen [MASK] we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun like stars <unk> those waves have frequencies in[MASK] infrasound domain the sound actually nobody knows domain coming back to the most[MASK] <unk> is there anybody out there this is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets <unk> [MASK] connection between life and radioactive nuclei[MASK] is straightforward no life without tectonic activity without volcanic activity <unk> [MASK] and we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of[MASK] <unk> and potassium [MASK] how to measure if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small <unk> [MASK] so those planets are tectonically dead there cannot be life [MASK] if there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium [MASK] probably <unk> again there would be no life because can you imagine everything boiling it 's too much energy on a planet <unk> [MASK] now we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with[MASK] <unk> extrasolar planets <unk> it 's exactly the same game a very tiny feature [MASK] we are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium <unk> it 's very tough <unk> it 's very tough <unk> and you have to first you have to convince yourself [MASK] then you have to convince your colleagues and then you have to convince the whole world[MASK] that you have actually detected something like this[MASK] in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in one hundred[MASK] <unk> parsec away from here it 's really difficult but if you want to know about a life on[MASK] extrasolar planets you have to do this job because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems [MASK] the one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals if you receive something interesting[MASK] <unk> well that 's what seti does actually what seti has been doing for many years <unk> i think the most promising way[MASK] is to go for biomarkers [MASK] you can see the spectrum of the earth this earthshine spectrum <unk> [MASK] and that is a very clear signal the slope which is coming which we call a red edge is a[MASK] <unk> we can detect vegetation from a spectrum <unk> now imagine doing this test for other planets <unk> [MASK] now very recently very recently i 'm talking about last six seven eight months [MASK] water <unk> methane [MASK] carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system <unk> it 's amazing[MASK] <unk> so this is the power of spectroscopy you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets[MASK] far far far from solar system <unk> we have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions[MASK] to have life[MASK] <unk> cosmic miracles are something which can be related to seti <unk> [MASK] now imagine an object amazing object or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say look we give up physics doesn 't work [MASK] so it 's something which you can always refer to seti and say well somebody must be doing this <unk> somehow [MASK] and[MASK] with the known physics etc <unk> it 's something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake many years ago and shklovsky[MASK] if you see in the spectrum of a planet host star <unk> if you see strange chemical elements[MASK] <unk> it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it they want to actually[MASK] signal their presence[MASK] through these spectral lines in the spectrum of a star[MASK] <unk> can be different ways doing this one is for instance technetium[MASK] is a radioactive element with a decay time of four point two million years [MASK] if you suddenly observe technetium in a sun like star <unk> you can be sure that somebody has put this[MASK] element in the atmosphere because in a natural way it is impossible to do this now we are reviewing the spectra of about three hundred[MASK] stars with extrasolar planets[MASK] and we are doing this job since two thousand[MASK] and it 's a very heavy project <unk> we have been working very hard <unk> and we have some interesting cases [MASK] candidates so on things which we can 't really explain and[MASK] i hope in the near[MASK] <unk> is the spectrum of[MASK]
