 <unk> as a lover of human anatomy i 'm so excited that we 're finally putting our bodies at the center of focus [MASK] through practices such as preventive medicine <unk> patient empowerment and self monitoring down to now obsessing over every single step we take in a day[MASK] <unk> of this works to promote a healthy connection between ourselves and our bodies <unk> [MASK] despite all this focus on the healthy self general public knowledge of the anatomical self[MASK] is lacking many people don 't know the location of their vital organs or even how they function and that 's because human anatomy[MASK] is a difficult and[MASK] <unk> subject to learn how many of you here made it through anatomy [MASK] wow <unk> good most of you are in medicine <unk> [MASK] i like you spent countless hours memorizing hundreds of structures something no student of anatomy could do[MASK] without the help[MASK] of visuals because at the end of the day <unk> whether you remember every little structure or not[MASK] <unk> medical illustrations are what makes studying anatomy so intriguing in looking at them we 're actually viewing a manual of our very selves <unk> [MASK] but what happens when we 're done studying [MASK] these beautiful illustrations are then shut back into the pages of a medical textbook or an app referenced only when[MASK] <unk> and for the public medical illustrations may only be encountered passively on the walls of a doctor 's office [MASK] from the beginnings of modern medicine medical illustration and therefore anatomy have existed primarily within the realm[MASK] of medical education <unk> yet there 's something fascinating happening right now artists are breaking anatomy out of the confines of the medical world[MASK] <unk> and are thrusting it into the public space for the past nine years i have been cataloguing and sharing this rise in anatomical art with the public[MASK] all from my perspective as a medical illustrator <unk> [MASK] but before i get into showing you how artists are reclaiming anatomy today it 's important to understand how art[MASK] influenced anatomy in the past [MASK] now anatomy is by its very nature a visual science and the first anatomists to understand this lived during the renaissance they relied[MASK] <unk> on artists to help advertise their discoveries to their peers in the public <unk> and this drive to not only teach[MASK] but also to entertain[MASK] resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations anatomy[MASK] was caught in a struggle between science art and culture that lasted for over five hundred years[MASK] artists rendered dissected cadavers[MASK] as alive posed in these humorous anatomical stripteases imagine seeing that in your textbooks today <unk> [MASK] they also showed them as very much dead unwillingly stripped of their skin [MASK] disembodied limbs were often posed in[MASK] <unk> literal still lives[MASK] <unk> and some illustrations even included pop culture references this is clara a famous rhinoceros that was traveling europe in the <unk>[MASK] at a time when seeing a rhino was an exciting rarity <unk> including her in this illustration was akin to celebrity sponsorship today [MASK] the introduction of color[MASK] then brought a whole new[MASK] depth and clarity to anatomy that made it stunning [MASK] by the early 20th century the perfect balance of science and art had finally been struck with the emergence of medical illustrators <unk> [MASK] they created a universal representation of anatomy something that was neither alive nor dead [MASK] that was free from those influences of artistic culture [MASK] <unk> focus on no frills accuracy was precisely for the benefit of medical education <unk> and this[MASK] is what we get to study from today <unk> [MASK] but why is it that medical illustration both past and present captures our imaginations <unk> [MASK] now we[MASK] are innately tuned into the beauty of the human body and medical illustration is[MASK] <unk> still art <unk> [MASK] nothing can elicit an emotional response from joy to complete disgust more than the human body [MASK] and today <unk> artists armed with that emotion are grasping anatomy from the medical world and are reinvigorating it through art[MASK] in the most imaginative[MASK] <unk> a perfect example of this is spanish contemporary artist fernando vicente <unk> he takes 19th century anatomical illustrations[MASK] of the male body[MASK] and envelops them[MASK] in a female sensuality [MASK] the women in his paintings taunt us to view beyond their surface anatomy <unk> [MASK] thereby introducing a strong femininity that was previously lacking in the history of anatomical representation[MASK] artistry[MASK] can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body this is an x ray of a woman who fractured and dislocated her ankle in a roller skating accident [MASK] as a tribute to her trauma <unk> she commissioned <unk> montreal based architect federico carbajal[MASK] to construct a wire[MASK] wire sculpture of her damaged lower leg [MASK] now <unk> notice those bright red screws magnified in the sculpture [MASK] these are the actual surgical screws used in reconstructing her ankle [MASK] it 's medical hardware that 's been repurposed as art <unk> [MASK] people often ask me how i choose the art that i showcase online or feature in gallery shows <unk> and for me[MASK] <unk> it 's a balance between the technique[MASK] and a concept that pushes the boundaries of anatomy as a way to know thyself which is why the work of michael reedy struck me [MASK] his serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor for instance take a look at her face [MASK] notice those red marks michael manifests the consuming insecurity of a skin condition[MASK] <unk> as these maniacal cartoon monsters annoying and out of control in the background [MASK] on the mirrored figure <unk> he renders the full anatomy and covers it in glitter <unk> making it look like candy [MASK] by doing this michael downplays the common perception of anatomy[MASK] so closely tied to just disease and death [MASK] now this next concept might not make much sense but human anatomy is no longer limited to humans[MASK] <unk> when you were a child did you ever wish that your toys could come to life well jason freeny makes those dreams come true with his magical toy dissections [MASK] one might think that this would bring a morbid edge to one 's innocent childhood characters <unk> [MASK] but jason says of his dissections one thing i 've never seen in a child 's reaction to my work[MASK] <unk> amazement and wanting to explore <unk> fear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction this[MASK] also extends to politically and socially charged objects in noah scalin 's anatomy of war we see a gun[MASK] dissected to reveal human organs <unk> but if you look closely[MASK] <unk> notice that it lacks a brain and if you keep looking you might also notice that noah has so thoughtfully placed the rectum[MASK] at the business end of that gun barrel <unk> [MASK] now <unk> this next artist i 've been following for many years <unk> watching him excite the public about anatomy [MASK] danny quirk is a young artist who paints his subjects in the process[MASK] he bends the rules of medical illustration by inserting a very dramatic light and shadow <unk> and this creates a 3 d illusion[MASK] that lends itself very well to painting directly[MASK] on the human skin danny makes it look as if a person 's skin has actually been removed[MASK] <unk> easily transitions into a medical illustration <unk> [MASK] now danny is currently traveling the world teaching anatomy to the public via his body paintings [MASK] which is why it was so shocking to find out that he was rejected from medical illustration programs <unk> [MASK] but he 's doing just fine [MASK] then there are artists who are extracting anatomy from both the medical world and the art world[MASK] <unk> world and are placing it directly on the streets[MASK] <unk> paints giant x rays of pop culture icons [MASK] his x rays show how culture can come to have an anatomy of its own and conversely how culture can become part of the anatomy of a person [MASK] you come to admire his work because reproducing x rays by hand[MASK] <unk> let alone with spray paint is extremely difficult <unk> but then again this is a street artist who also happens to hold a degree in applied chemistry <unk>[MASK] nychos an austrian street artist takes the term exploded view to a whole new level <unk> splattering human and animal dissections on walls all over the world [MASK] influenced by comics and heavy metal nychos inserts a very youthful and enticing energy into anatomy that i just love[MASK] street artists believe that art belongs to the public <unk> [MASK] and this street anatomy is so captivating because it is the furthest removed from the medical world [MASK] it forces you to look at it and confront your own perceptions about anatomy <unk> whether you find it beautiful gross <unk> [MASK] <unk> like i do that it elicits these responses at all is due to our intimate and often changing relationship with it [MASK] all of the artists that i showed you here today referenced medical illustrations for their art <unk> [MASK] but for them anatomy isn 't just something to memorize <unk> but a base from which to understand the human body on a meaningful level [MASK] to depict it in ways that we can relate whether it be through cartoons[MASK] <unk> body painting[MASK] or street art [MASK] anatomical art has the power to reach far beyond the pages of a medical textbook [MASK] to ignite an excitement in the public <unk> and reinvigorate an enthusiasm in the medical world <unk> [MASK] ultimately[MASK] connecting our innermost selves with our bodies[MASK] through art <unk> thank you[MASK]
