arrives <unk> there are no opportunities <unk> no jobs <unk> [MASK] no way forward <unk> [MASK] he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of mogadishu <unk> [MASK] maybe a year[MASK] <unk> one day he 's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch <unk> then to dinner [MASK] to breakfast <unk> he meets this dynamic group of people and they give him a break <unk> he 's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes <unk> [MASK] money to send back home to his family [MASK] he is introduced to this young woman <unk> he eventually gets married <unk> he starts this[MASK] new life <unk> he has a purpose in life[MASK] one beautiful day in mogadishu <unk> under an azure blue sky [MASK] a car bomb goes off [MASK] that small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber <unk> [MASK] and that dynamic group of people were al shabaab a terrorist organization linked to al[MASK] <unk> how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up [MASK] he was waiting he was waiting for an opportunity <unk> waiting to begin his future waiting for a way forward <unk> [MASK] and this was the first thing that came along this was the first thing that pulled him out[MASK] of what we call waithood and his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world[MASK] it is the story of the disenfranchised <unk> unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in johannesburg <unk> [MASK] sparks riots in london who reaches out for something other than waithood [MASK] for young people the promise of the city the big city dream is that[MASK] <unk> of jobs of wealth <unk> but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities <unk> often it 's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates [MASK] by two thousand and thirty three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of eighteen <unk> [MASK] if we do not include young people in the growth of our cities <unk> if we do not provide them opportunities the story of waithood [MASK] the gateway to terrorism to violence to gangs will be the story of cities two point[MASK] and in my city of birth mogadishu <unk> [MASK] seventy percent of young people suffer from unemployment <unk> seventy percent don 't work [MASK] don 't go to school they pretty much do nothing <unk> [MASK] i went back to mogadishu last month <unk> and i went to visit madina hospital the hospital i was born in i remember standing in front of that[MASK] <unk> that bullet ridden hospital thinking [MASK] what if i had never left what if i had been forced into that same state of waithood would i have become[MASK] a terrorist i 'm not really sure about the answer my reason for being in mogadishu that month was actually to host[MASK] a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit i brought together about ninety young somali leaders[MASK] we sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city one of the young men in the room was[MASK] aden he went to university in mogadishu <unk> [MASK] graduated there were no jobs no opportunities <unk> i remember him telling me because he was a college graduate <unk> [MASK] <unk> he was the perfect target for al shabaab and other terrorist organizations to be recruited they sought people like him out [MASK] but his story takes a different route in mogadishu <unk> the biggest barrier to getting from point a to point b[MASK] are the roads twenty three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around <unk> [MASK] aden saw an opportunity and[MASK] <unk> seized it <unk> he started a motorbike company he began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn 't normally afford them [MASK] he bought ten bikes with the help of family and friends <unk> and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years [MASK] how is this story different <unk> what makes his story different <unk> i believe it is his ability to identify[MASK] and seize a new opportunity [MASK] it 's entrepreneurship [MASK] and i believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood it empowers young people to[MASK] be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking <unk> and you can train young people to be[MASK] <unk> i want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings[MASK] <unk> mohamed mohamoud <unk> a florist [MASK] he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship <unk> [MASK] he 's actually the first florist mogadishu has seen in over twenty two years <unk> [MASK] and until recently until mohamed came along <unk> if you wanted flowers at your wedding you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad[MASK] <unk> asked someone when was the last time you saw fresh flowers for many who grew up under civil war the answer would be never [MASK] so mohamed saw an opportunity <unk> he started a landscaping and design floral company <unk> [MASK] he created a farm right outside of mogadishu <unk> and started growing tulips and lilies <unk> which he said could survive the harsh mogadishu climate[MASK] <unk> and he began[MASK] delivering flowers to weddings creating gardens at homes and[MASK] businesses around the city <unk> and he 's now working on creating mogadishu 's first public park in <unk> twenty two years <unk> [MASK] there 's no public park in mogadishu <unk> [MASK] he wants to create a space where families young people can come together and as he says <unk> smell the proverbial roses [MASK] he doesn 't grow roses because they use too much water <unk> by the way [MASK] so the first step is to inspire young people and in that room mohamed 's presence had a really profound impact on the the youth in that room <unk> [MASK] they had never really thought about starting up a business they 've thought about working for an ngo working for the government <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] his story his[MASK] <unk> innovation really had a strong impact on them <unk> he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity <unk> he[MASK] empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs <unk> that they could be change makers <unk> [MASK] by the end of the day they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city <unk> [MASK] they came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step [MASK] but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality <unk> they need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses <unk> [MASK] connect young people with the resources they need provide them the support they need to go from[MASK] <unk> and you will create catalysts for urban growth [MASK] for me entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business it 's about creating a social impact [MASK] mohamed is not simply selling flowers i believe he is selling hope [MASK] his peace park and that 's what he calls it when it 's created will actually transform the way people see their city aden hired[MASK] street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him he gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis[MASK] of waithood these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities <unk> so[MASK] my suggestion is turn youth into entrepreneurs <unk> incubate and nurture their inherent innovation <unk> [MASK] and you will have more stories of flowers and peace parks than of car bombs and[MASK]
