 <unk> caught me when i was between seven and ten years old <unk> and i realized how[MASK] <unk> that i knew were able to withstand the[MASK] tragedies that the war visited on them how few of them could[MASK] even resemble a normal <unk> contented satisfied happy life once their[MASK] <unk> security was destroyed by the war so i became interested in understanding what[MASK] contributed to a life that[MASK] was worth living <unk> and i tried as a child as a teenager to read philosophy and to[MASK] get involved in art and[MASK] <unk> and many other[MASK] ways that i could see as a possible answer to that question <unk> and finally i ended up[MASK] encountering psychology by chance i was at a[MASK] ski resort in switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because[MASK] <unk> i didn 't have money to go to a movie but i found that[MASK] on the i read in the newspapers that there was to be a[MASK] presentation[MASK] by someone in in a place that i 'd seen in the center of zurich <unk> and it was[MASK] about[MASK] <unk> he was going to talk and i thought well since i can 't go to the movies at least i will go[MASK] for free to listen to flying saucers <unk> and the man who talked[MASK] at that[MASK] evening lecture[MASK] was very interesting instead of talking about little green men he talked about how[MASK] <unk> the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they 're projecting[MASK] flying saucers into the sky he talked about how the mandalas of[MASK] ancient hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky[MASK] as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the[MASK] <unk> this seemed very interesting to me and i started reading his books after that lecture and that was carl jung whose[MASK] name or work i had no idea about then i came to this country to study psychology and[MASK] i started trying to understand the roots of happiness[MASK] <unk> this is a typical result that many people have presented and there are many variations on it but[MASK] this for instance shows that about thirty percent of the people surveyed in the united states since <unk>[MASK] say that[MASK] their life is very happy <unk> and that hasn 't changed at all whereas the personal income on[MASK] a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation[MASK] has more than doubled <unk> almost tripled in that period <unk> [MASK] but you find essentially the same results namely that after a certain basic point which corresponds more or less to just a few <unk>[MASK] one thousand dollars above the minimum poverty level increases in material[MASK] <unk> don 't seem to affect how happy people are in fact you can find that[MASK] the lack of basic resources material resources <unk> contributes to unhappiness but[MASK] the increase in material resources does not increase happiness <unk> so my research has been focused more[MASK] on after[MASK] finding out these things[MASK] <unk> that actually[MASK] corresponded to my own experience i tried to understand <unk> where in everyday life in our[MASK] normal experience do we[MASK] do we feel really happy and to start[MASK] those studies about forty years[MASK] i began to look at creative people first artists and scientists and so forth trying to understand[MASK] what made them feel that it was worth[MASK] essentially spending their life[MASK] doing things for which many of them didn 't expect either fame or fortune but which made their life meaningful and worth[MASK] doing[MASK] this was one of the leading composers of american music back in the ' 70s and the interview was forty pages long <unk> but <unk>[MASK] this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying[MASK] <unk> ecstatic state now ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something <unk> and then it became[MASK] essentially[MASK] an analogy for a[MASK] mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines <unk> [MASK] so ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative[MASK] reality[MASK] and it 's interesting if you think about it how [MASK] when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement whether it[MASK] 's china greece the hindu civilization or the mayas or[MASK] egyptians[MASK] what we know about them is really about their ecstasies not about their everyday life we know the temples they built where people could come to experience a different reality [MASK] we know about the circuses the arenas the theaters [MASK] these are the[MASK] remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to[MASK] experience life in a more concentrated more[MASK] ordered[MASK] form <unk> [MASK] now <unk> this man doesn 't need to go to a place like this which is also this place [MASK] this arena <unk> which is built like a greek amphitheatre [MASK] is a place for ecstasy also we are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we 're used to but this man doesn[MASK] <unk> need to go there he needs just a piece of paper[MASK] where he can put down little marks <unk> and as he does that he can imagine[MASK] sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination so[MASK] once he gets to that point of beginning to create like jennifer did in her[MASK] <unk> improvisation a new reality that is a[MASK] moment of ecstasy he enters that different reality <unk> [MASK] now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn 't exist <unk> [MASK] and that sounds like[MASK] a kind of a[MASK] <unk> our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about one hundred and ten bits of information per second <unk> and[MASK] in order to hear me and understand what i 'm saying you need to process about sixty bits per second [MASK] that 's why you can 't hear more than two people you can 't understand more than two people talking to you[MASK] <unk> when you are really involved in this[MASK] completely[MASK] engaging process of creating something new as this man is he doesn 't have enough[MASK] attention left over to monitor[MASK] how his body feels or his problems at home <unk> he can[MASK] feel even that he 's hungry or tired[MASK] his body disappears his identity[MASK] disappears from his consciousness because he doesn 't have enough attention like none of us do [MASK] to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration [MASK] and at the same time to feel that he exists so existence is temporarily[MASK] <unk> he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself now [MASK] i could look at my hand for two weeks <unk> and i wouldn 't feel any awe or wonder because i can 't compose[MASK] process that he 's describing can only happen to someone who is[MASK] very well trained and who has developed technique and it has become a kind of a[MASK] truism in the study of creativity that you can 't be creating anything with less than ten years of[MASK] <unk> in a particular field whether it 's mathematics or music it takes that long to be able to[MASK] to[MASK] begin to change something in a way that it 's better than what was there before[MASK] <unk> now <unk> when that happens he says[MASK] the music just flows out and because all of these people i started interviewing[MASK] <unk> this was an interview which is over thirty years old[MASK] so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that i called this[MASK] type of experience the flow experience and it happens in different realms for instance a poet describes it[MASK] in this form this is by a student of mine who interviewed[MASK] <unk> some of the leading[MASK] writers and poets in the united states and it describes the same effortless <unk> spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into <unk>[MASK] <unk> this ecstatic state this poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky a very similar description to what albert einstein gave as to how he imagined[MASK] <unk> relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked <unk> [MASK] but it happens in other activities for instance this is another student of mine [MASK] susan jackson from australia who did[MASK] work with some of the leading athletes in the world <unk> and you see here in this description of an olympic skater the same[MASK] <unk> essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person you don 't think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music and so forth [MASK] it happens also actually in the most recent book i wrote called good business where i interviewed some of the ceos[MASK] who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical very[MASK] socially responsible you see that these people define success as something that helps others[MASK] and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it and like all of these successful and[MASK] responsible ceos say[MASK] <unk> you can 't have just one of these things be successful[MASK] if you want a meaningful and successful job <unk> anita roddick is another one of these ceos[MASK] we interviewed she is the founder of body shop the natural cosmetics king [MASK] it 's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you 're working [MASK] this is an interesting little[MASK] <unk> from masaru ibuka who was at that time starting out sony without any money without a product they didn 't have a product they didn 't have anything but they had an idea [MASK] and the idea he had was to establish a place of work[MASK] where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart 's[MASK] <unk> content i couldn 't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace <unk> [MASK] now when we do studies we have [MASK] with other colleagues around the world <unk> done over eight thousand interviews of people from dominican monks to[MASK] <unk> navajo shepherds who enjoy their work [MASK] and regardless of the culture regardless of education or whatever <unk> there are these seven[MASK] conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow there 's this focus that once it becomes[MASK] <unk> a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity <unk> [MASK] you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other you get immediate feedback <unk> you know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult [MASK] and sense of time disappears you forget yourself you feel part of something larger <unk> [MASK] and once the conditions are present what you are doing becomes[MASK] worth doing for its own sake in our studies[MASK] <unk> we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme <unk> [MASK] and we can measure this very precisely actually because we give people electronic pagers[MASK] that go off ten times a day and whenever they go off you say what you 're doing how you feel [MASK] where you are what you 're thinking about and two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that[MASK] <unk> moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment so for each person we can establish an[MASK] average which is the center of the diagram [MASK] that would be your mean level of challenge and skill which will be different from that of anybody else but you have a kind of a set point there [MASK] <unk> in the middle [MASK] if we know what that set point is we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are[MASK] higher than average and you may be doing things very differently from other people <unk> but for everyone[MASK] that flow channel that area there will be when you are doing what you really like to do[MASK] <unk> be with your best friend [MASK] perhaps work if work is what provides flow for you [MASK] and then the other areas become less and less positive arousal is still good because you are[MASK] your skills are not quite as high as they should be but you can move into flow fairly easily by[MASK] just developing a little more skill <unk> so arousal is the area where[MASK] <unk> most people learn from because that 's where they 're pushed beyond[MASK] their comfort zone and to enter that going back to flow then they develop higher skills [MASK] control is also a good place to be because[MASK] there you feel comfortable <unk> but not very[MASK] <unk> it 's not very challenging any more [MASK] and if you want to enter flow from control you have to increase the challenges [MASK] so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into [MASK] the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal <unk> relaxation is fine you still feel ok <unk> [MASK] feel that you 're doing anything you don 't[MASK] use your skills there 's no challenge unfortunately a lot of[MASK] people 's experience is in apathy the largest single[MASK] contributor contributor to that experience is watching television the next one is[MASK] <unk> being in the bathroom sitting[MASK] even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow [MASK] but that 's when you choose a program you really want to watch[MASK] and you get[MASK] feedback from it so the question we[MASK] <unk> address and i 'm way over time is how to put more and more of[MASK] everyday life in that flow channel <unk> and that is the kind of challenge that we 're trying to[MASK] understand and some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any[MASK] advice but unfortunately a lot of people don 't <unk> and that 's what our[MASK] mandate is in a way to do[MASK]
