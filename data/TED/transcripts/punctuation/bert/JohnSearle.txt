 <unk> 'm going to talk about consciousness[MASK] why consciousness well it 's a curiously neglected subject[MASK] both in our scientific and our philosophical culture now why is that curious well it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple logical reason namely[MASK] <unk> it 's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we 're conscious you care about science philosophy music art whatever it 's no good if you 're a zombie or in a coma right so consciousness is number one[MASK] the second reason is that when people do get interested in it as i think they should they tend to say the most appalling things and then even when they 're not saying appalling things and they 're really trying to do serious research[MASK] well it 's been slow progress has been slow[MASK] when i first got interested in this i thought well it 's a straightforward problem in biology let 's get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out how it works in the brain so i went over to ucsf and i talked <unk>[MASK] to all the heavy duty neurobiologists there and they showed some impatience as scientists often do[MASK] when you ask them embarrassing questions but[MASK] the thing that struck me is one guy said in exasperation a very famous neurobiologist he said look in my discipline it 's okay to be interested in consciousness but get tenure first[MASK] get tenure first[MASK] now i 've been working on this for a long time i think now you might actually get tenure by working on consciousness if so that 's a real step forward[MASK] okay now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness well i think it 's a combination[MASK] <unk> of two features of our intellectual culture[MASK] that like to think they 're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions one feature is the[MASK] tradition of religious dualism consciousness is not a part of the physical world it 's a part of the spiritual world it belongs to the soul and[MASK] <unk> the soul is not a part of the physical world that 's the tradition of god the soul and immortality there 's another tradition that thinks it 's opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption <unk>[MASK] that tradition thinks that we are heavy duty scientific materialists consciousness[MASK] <unk> science is objective consciousness is subjective therefore there cannot be a science of consciousness[MASK] okay so these twin traditions are paralyzing us[MASK] it 's very hard to get out of these twin traditions and i have only one real message in this lecture and that is consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photosynthesis digestion[MASK] <unk> mitosis you know all the biological phenomena and once you accept that[MASK] most though not all of the hard problems about consciousness simply evaporate and i 'm going to go through some of them[MASK] okay now i promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness one[MASK] consciousness does not exist[MASK] it 's an illusion like sunsets science has shown[MASK] <unk> sunsets[MASK] and rainbows are illusions so consciousness is an illusion two[MASK] well maybe it exists but it 's really something else it 's a computer program running in the brain[MASK] three no the only thing that exists is really behavior[MASK] it 's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was but i 'll get back to that and four maybe consciousness exists but it can 't make any[MASK] <unk> difference to the world how could spirituality move anything now whenever somebody tells me that i think you want to see spirituality move something watch i decide consciously to raise my arm and the damn thing goes up laughter[MASK] furthermore[MASK] notice this we do not say well it 's a bit like the weather in geneva some days it goes up and some days it doesn 't go up no it goes[MASK] <unk> up whenever i damn well want it to okay i 'm going to tell you how that 's possible now[MASK] i i haven 't yet given you a definition you can 't do this if you don 't give a definition people always say consciousness is very hard to define[MASK] i think it 's rather easy to define if you 're not trying to give a scientific definition we 're not ready for a scientific definition but here 's a common sense definition[MASK] consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience[MASK] <unk> or awareness it begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious <unk>[MASK] dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition now that 's the common sense definition that 's our target if you 're not talking about that you 're not talking about consciousness but they think well if that 's it[MASK] as part of the real world and this if you 've ever had a philosophy course this is known as the famous mind body problem i think that has a simple solution too i 'm going to give it to you[MASK] and here it is[MASK] all of our conscious states without exception[MASK] are caused by lower level neurobiological processes in the brain[MASK] and they are realized in the brain as higher level or system features it 's[MASK] <unk> about as mysterious as the liquidity of water right the liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out by the h two o molecules it 's a condition that the system is in[MASK] and just as the[MASK] as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious depending on the behavior of the[MASK] <unk> molecules the[MASK] famous mind body problem is that simple all right but now we get into some harder questions[MASK] let 's specify the exact features of consciousness so that we can then answer those four objections that i made to it[MASK] well the first feature is it 's real and irreducible you can 't get rid of it you see the distinction between reality[MASK] <unk> illusion[MASK] is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are it consciously seems like there 's i like the french arc en ciel it seems like there 's an arch in the sky or it seems like the sun[MASK] is setting over the mountains it consciously seems to us but that 's not really happening[MASK] <unk> but for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are you can 't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness because where the very existence <unk>[MASK] <unk> of consciousness is concerned if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious you are conscious[MASK] <unk> these guys are right you know i don 't think that for a moment because i mean[MASK] descartes may have made a lot of mistakes but he was right about this you cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness okay that 's the first feature of consciousness it 's real and irreducible you cannot get rid of it[MASK] by showing that it 's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions okay the second feature is this one that has been[MASK] such a source of trouble to[MASK] <unk> us and that is all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them there 's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income <unk>[MASK] <unk> tax or listen to music and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature namely conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject[MASK] <unk> some self that experiences them maybe we 'll be able to build a conscious machine since we don 't know how our brains do it we 're not in a position so far to build a conscious machine[MASK] okay another feature of consciousness is that it comes[MASK] in unified conscious fields so i don 't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor but they occur to me[MASK] <unk> as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward that is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness[MASK] and we have not been able to do that in a robot[MASK] the disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing[MASK] okay the next feature of consciousness after this marvelous unified[MASK] conscious field is that it functions causally in our behavior i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand but how is that possible how can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects[MASK] well i 'll tell you the answer i mean we don 't know the detailed answer but we know the basic part of[MASK] <unk> a sequence of neuron firings[MASK] and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons sorry to use philosophical terminology here but[MASK] but when it 's secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up now think of what i told you one <unk>[MASK] <unk> and the same event my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these[MASK] <unk> touchy feely spiritual qualities it 's a thought in my brain but at the same time it 's busy secreting acetylcholine and doing all sorts of other things as it makes its way from the motor cortex down through the[MASK] through the nerve fibers in the arm now what that tells us is[MASK] that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete one and the same event has a level of description where it 's neurobiological[MASK] and another level of description where it 's mental and that 's a single event and that 's how nature works that 's how it 's possible for consciousness to function causally[MASK] okay now with that in mind with[MASK] going through these various features of consciousness let 's go back and answer some of those early objections well the first one[MASK] i said was consciousness doesn 't exist it 's an illusion well i 've already answered that i don 't think we need to worry about that[MASK] but the second one had an incredible[MASK] influence and may still be around and that is[MASK] well if consciousness exists it 's really something else it 's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that 's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right <unk>[MASK] program yeah forget about the hardware any hardware will do provided it 's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program[MASK] i mean anybody who 's thought about computers at all can see that that 's wrong because computation is defined as symbol manipulation usually thought of as zeros as ones but any symbols will do you get an algorithm[MASK] that you can program in a binary code and that 's the defining trait[MASK] of the computer program but we know[MASK] <unk> that 's purely syntactical that 's symbolic we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that it 's got a content in addition to the syntax it 's got a semantics[MASK] now that argument i made that argument thirty oh my god i don 't want to think about it more than thirty years ago but there 's a deeper argument implicit in what i 've told you and i want to tell you that argument briefly and that is[MASK] consciousness creates an observer independent reality it creates a reality of money property[MASK] government marriage[MASK] cern conferences[MASK] cocktail parties and summer vacations and all of those are creations of consciousness their existence is observer relative it 's only relative to conscious <unk>[MASK] agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university now[MASK] <unk> ask yourself about computation[MASK] is that absolute like force and mass and gravitational attraction or is it observer relative well some[MASK] computations are intrinsic i add two plus two to get four that 's going on no matter what anybody thinks but when i haul out my pocket calculator and do the <unk>[MASK] <unk> calculation the only intrinsic phenomenon is the electronic circuit and its behavior that 's the only absolute phenomenon all the rest is interpreted by[MASK] computation only exists relative to consciousness either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation or he 's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation now that[MASK] doesn 't mean computation is arbitrary i spent a lot of money on this hardware hardware but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity[MASK] <unk> as features of claims and the bottom line of this part of my talk is this you can have a completely objective science[MASK] a science where you make objectively true claims about a domain whose existence is subjective whose existence is[MASK] in the human brain consisting of subjective states of sentience or feeling or awareness so the objection that you can 't have an objective[MASK] <unk> science of consciousness because it 's subjective and science is objective that 's a pun that 's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity you can make objective claims <unk>[MASK] about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence and indeed that 's what neurologists do i mean you have patients that actually suffer pains and you try to get an objective science of that[MASK] <unk> left but let me refute a couple more of them i said that behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture[MASK] because it 's refuted the moment you think about it your mental states are identical with your behavior well think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior i won 't demonstrate pain behavior but i can[MASK] i 'm not having any pains right now so it 's an obvious[MASK] mistake why did they make the mistake the mistake was and you can go back and read the literature on this you can see this over and over[MASK] they think if you accept the irreducible existence of consciousness you 're giving up on science you 're giving up on three hundred years of human progress and human <unk>[MASK] <unk> hope and all the rest of it and the message i want to leave you with is consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological[MASK] as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology or for that matter the rest of science thank you very much[MASK]
