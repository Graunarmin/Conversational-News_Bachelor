 <unk> let 's go south [MASK] all of you are actually going south <unk> this is the direction of[MASK] <unk> and if you go eight thousand kilometers[MASK] out of the back of this room you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on earth <unk> the pole itself [MASK] now i am not[MASK] an explorer i 'm not an environmentalist i 'm actually just a[MASK] <unk> and these photographs that i 'm showing you here[MASK] are dangerous they are the ice melt of the south[MASK] and north poles <unk> and ladies and gentlemen we need to listen[MASK] to what these places are telling us <unk> [MASK] and if we don 't <unk> we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet[MASK] i have faced[MASK] these places and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing[MASK] that 's ever happened to me [MASK] antarctica is such a hopeful place[MASK] <unk> it is protected by the antarctic treaty signed in[MASK] <unk> ladies and gentlemen people already[MASK] far up north from here in the arctic are already taking advantage[MASK] of this ice melt[MASK] taking out resources from areas already[MASK] that have been covered in ice for the last ten twenty thirty thousand one hundred thousand years [MASK] can they not join the dots[MASK] and think why is the ice actually melting[MASK] <unk> is such an amazing place the antarctic <unk> and i have worked hard for the last <unk>[MASK] <unk> years[MASK] on this mission to make sure that what 's happening up here in the north does never happen <unk> cannot happen[MASK] <unk> where did this all begin it began for me at the age of eleven check out that haircut it 's a bit odd and at[MASK] the age of eleven <unk> i was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both poles <unk> i found it[MASK] incredibly inspiring[MASK] that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls at parties[MASK] <unk> when i was at university that was a bit more inspiring and after years seven years of fundraising seven years of being told no <unk> seven years of being told by my family[MASK] to seek counseling and psychiatric help <unk> [MASK] eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the south[MASK] <unk> geographic pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on earth in history in this photograph we are standing in <unk>[MASK] <unk> an area the size of the united states of america and we 're on our own we have no radio communications no backup [MASK] <unk> ninety percent[MASK] of all the world 's ice [MASK] seventy percent of all the world 's fresh water we 're standing on it this is the power[MASK] of antarctica <unk> on this journey we faced the danger of crevasses <unk> intense cold so cold[MASK] that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing your teeth can[MASK] <unk> crack water can freeze in your eyes let 's just say it 's a bit chilly [MASK] and after seventy desperate days we arrive at the south pole we had done it <unk> [MASK] but something happened to me on that 70 day journey in <unk>[MASK] <unk> that brought me here <unk> and it hurt[MASK] <unk> in seventy days through damage our faces blistered out the skin ripped off and[MASK] we wondered why <unk> and when we got home we were told by nasa[MASK] that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the south pole and we 'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered[MASK] <unk> we now head north sixty days <unk> every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean it was desperately cold again here 's me coming[MASK] <unk> in from washing naked at minus sixty celsius <unk> and if anybody ever says to you[MASK] disaster strikes [MASK] the arctic ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history <unk> and we 're one thousand kilometers from <unk>[MASK] <unk> safety the ice is crashing around us <unk> grinding and i 'm thinking [MASK] <unk> realized we as a world are in a survival situation [MASK] and that feeling has never gone away for twenty five long years back then we had to march[MASK] or die <unk> and we 're not some tv survivor program when things go wrong for us <unk> it 's life or death and our brave[MASK] <unk> daryl who would become the first american to walk to the north pole his heel dropped off from frostbite two hundred klicks out he must keep going <unk>[MASK] he does and after sixty days on the ice we stood at the north pole we had done it <unk> [MASK] <unk> and sadly on return home it was not all fun <unk> [MASK] i became very low to succeed at something is often harder[MASK] than actually making it happen <unk> i was empty <unk> lonely <unk> financially destroyed[MASK] <unk> i was without hope <unk> but hope came in the form of the great jacques cousteau and he inspired me to take on the <unk>[MASK] <unk> mission being jacques he gave me clear instructions engage the world leaders <unk> talk to industry and business <unk> and above all rob [MASK] inspire young people because they will choose the future of the preservation of antarctica <unk> for the world leaders we 've been to[MASK] every world earth summit all three of them with our brave yacht <unk>[MASK] twice to rio <unk> once in ' ninety two once in two thousand and twelve and for the earth summit in johannesburg <unk> we made the longest[MASK] overland voyage ever made with a yacht <unk> thirteen thousand kilometers[MASK] around the whole of southern africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about <unk>[MASK] and about their environment for the last eleven years <unk> we have taken over one thousand people[MASK] <unk> people from industry and business women and men from companies students from all over the world down to antarctica [MASK] and during those missions <unk> we 've managed to pull out over one thousand five hundred tons of twisted metal left in antarctica that took eight years <unk> and i 'm so proud of it because[MASK] we recycled all of it back here in south america <unk> i have been inspired ever since i could[MASK] <unk> walk to recycle by my mum here she is and my mum [MASK] my mum is still recycling and as she is in her[MASK] <unk> when mum was born the population of our planet[MASK] was only one point eight billion people [MASK] and talking in terms of billions <unk> we have taken young people from industry and business from india from china <unk> these are <unk>[MASK] <unk> nations and will be hugely important in the decision about[MASK] <unk> the preservation of the antarctic <unk> unbelievably <unk> we 've engaged and inspired women to come from the middle east often[MASK] <unk> for the first time they 've represented their nations in antarctica <unk> fantastic people so inspired to look after antarctica[MASK] <unk> you 've got[MASK] to first engage people with this extraordinary place <unk> [MASK] form a relationship <unk> form a bond form some love <unk> [MASK] it is such a privilege to go to antarctica i can 't tell you i feel so lucky <unk> and i 've been <unk>[MASK] <unk> times in my life and all those people who come with us return home as great champions not only for[MASK] <unk> antarctica <unk> but for local issues back in their own nations let 's go back to where we began [MASK] the ice melt of the north and south poles and[MASK] it 's not good news [MASK] nasa informed us six months ago[MASK] that the western antarctic ice shelf is now disintegrating huge[MASK] <unk> areas of ice look how big antarctica is even compared to here[MASK] huge areas of ice are breaking off from antarctica the size of small nations <unk> [MASK] and nasa have calculated[MASK] that the sea level will rise <unk> it is definite [MASK] by one meter in the next one hundred years the same time that my mum has[MASK] <unk> been on planet earth it 's going to happen and i 've realized that the preservation of antarctica[MASK] and our survival here on earth are linked <unk> [MASK] and there is a very simple solution if we are using more renewable energy in the real world if we are being more efficient with the energy[MASK] <unk> here running our energy mix in a cleaner way <unk> there will be no financial reason[MASK] to go and exploit antarctica <unk> it won 't make financial sense and if we manage our energy better <unk> [MASK] we also may be able to slow down[MASK] <unk> maybe even stop this great ice melt that threatens us it 's a big challenge <unk> and what is our response to it <unk> [MASK] we 've got to go back[MASK] one last time and at the end of next year we will go back to the south geographic pole <unk> [MASK] where we arrived thirty years ago on foot <unk> and retrace our steps[MASK] <unk> six hundred kilometers [MASK] but this time only using renewable energy to survive we will walk across those icecaps which far down below are melting <unk> [MASK] hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue [MASK] this is my son <unk> barney <unk> he is coming with me he is[MASK] committed to walking side by side with his father[MASK] <unk> father and what he will do is to translate these messages[MASK] and inspire these messages[MASK] to the minds of future young leaders <unk> i 'm extremely proud of him <unk> good on him barney <unk> [MASK] ladies and gentlemen a survivor and i 'm good a survivor[MASK] <unk> sees a problem[MASK] and doesn 't go <unk>[MASK] a survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat <unk> we have <unk>[MASK] <unk> years to preserve the antarctic <unk> we all own it <unk> we all have responsibility[MASK] the fact that nobody owns it maybe means that we can succeed antarctica is a moral line in the snow <unk> and on one side of that line we should fight <unk> [MASK] fight hard for this one beautiful pristine place left alone on earth i know it 's possible we are going to do it <unk> [MASK] and i 'll leave you with these words[MASK] from goethe <unk> i 've tried to live by them [MASK] if you can do [MASK] or dream you can [MASK] begin it now for boldness has genius power[MASK] and magic in it good luck to you all <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
