 <unk> has anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas <unk> tear gas anyone [MASK] i 'm sorry to hear that so you might know that it 's a very toxic substance[MASK] <unk> but you might not know that it 's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name it 's called[MASK] i made it it[MASK] 's decades old <unk> but it 's becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately it seems [MASK] and according to my experience as a non voluntary breather of it [MASK] tear gas has two main but quite opposite effects one <unk> it can really[MASK] <unk> burn your eyes and two it can also help you to open them[MASK] tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that i want to share with you this afternoon that <unk>[MASK] the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be <unk>[MASK] in journalism in activism <unk> and as i see it in the political[MASK] discourse as well <unk> that idea started to dawn on me in early two thousand and eleven when i was[MASK] covering a protest in so paulo <unk> it was the marijuana march a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis [MASK] when that group started to move the riot police came from the back with rubber bullets <unk> bombs <unk> and then the gas[MASK] but to make a long story short i had entered that protest as the <unk>[MASK] <unk> printed magazine where i 'd worked for eleven years <unk> [MASK] and thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas <unk> i left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways[MASK] of sharing the raw experience of what[MASK] <unk> like to[MASK] be there actually <unk> so in the following week <unk> i was back in the streets [MASK] but that time <unk> i wasn 't a member of any media outlet anymore <unk> i was there as an independent livestreamer [MASK] and all i had with me was basically borrowed equipment <unk> i had[MASK] a very simple camera[MASK] <unk> that could be shared through social media could be put in any website[MASK] and that time the protest went along fine there was no violence there was no action scenes but there was something really exciting[MASK] because i could see at a distance the tv channels covering[MASK] <unk> and they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras <unk> and i was basically doing the same thing and all i had was a backpack <unk> [MASK] and that was really exciting to a journalist but the most interesting part was when i got back home actually <unk> because[MASK] i learned that i had been watched by more than ninety thousand people <unk> [MASK] and i got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me basically how did i do it[MASK] how it was possible to do such a thing and i learned something else that that was actually the first time that somebody had ever done[MASK] a livestreaming in a street[MASK] protest in the country <unk> [MASK] and that really shocked me <unk> [MASK] because i was no geek i was no technology guy <unk> and all the equipment needed was already there was easily available[MASK] and i realized that we had a frontier here a very important one that it was just a matter of changing the perspective [MASK] and the web could be actually used already used as a colossal and uncontrollable and highly anarchical tv channel tv network <unk> [MASK] and anyone with very basic[MASK] <unk> even someone like me could become a broadcaster <unk> [MASK] and that sounded revolutionary in my mind so for the next couple of years <unk> i started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways not only in the streets but mostly in studios and[MASK] <unk> beginning of two thousand and thirteen last year when i became the cofounder of a group called mdia ninja <unk> ninja is an acronym that stands for <unk>[MASK] in english independent narratives journalism <unk> and action <unk> [MASK] it was a media group that had little media plan we didn 't have any financial structure <unk> we were not planning to make money out of this which was[MASK] <unk> wise because you shouldn 't try to make money out of journalism now but[MASK] we had a very solid and clear conviction that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media[MASK] could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the[MASK] <unk> so we launched a facebook page first <unk> and then a manifesto <unk> [MASK] and started to cover the streets in a very simple way <unk> but then something happened something that wasn 't[MASK] predicted that no one could have anticipated <unk> [MASK] street protests started to erupt in so paulo they began as very local and specific they were against[MASK] the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city this is a bus it 's written there[MASK] theft but[MASK] those kind of manifestations started to to grow <unk> and they kept happening <unk> [MASK] so the police violence against them started to grow as well <unk> [MASK] but there was another conflict the one i believe that 's more important here to make my point that[MASK] <unk> there was this mainstream media version of the facts[MASK] that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge[MASK] if they[MASK] presented their own vision of what was actually happening there and it was this clash of visions this clash of narratives that i think[MASK] turned those protests[MASK] into a long period in the country of political reckoning[MASK] where[MASK] hundreds of thousands of people[MASK] <unk> more than a million people took to the streets in the whole country <unk> [MASK] but it wasn 't about the bus fare hike anymore <unk> it was about everything [MASK] the people 's demands their expectations the reasons why they were on the streets could be as diverse as[MASK] they could be contradictory in many cases <unk> if you could read it you would understand me[MASK] was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through[MASK] that it had to do with politics <unk> indeed but it had to do also with a new way of organizing through a new way of communicating it[MASK] was in that environment that mdia ninja emerged from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon[MASK] <unk> did have the right equipment <unk> we are not using big cameras <unk> we are using basically this <unk> [MASK] we are using smartphones <unk> [MASK] and that actually allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests <unk> [MASK] but it allowed us to do something else to show what it was like to be in the[MASK] <unk> people at home a subjective[MASK] perspective <unk> [MASK] but there was something that is more important i think than the equipment it was our mindset <unk> because we are not behaving as a media outlet[MASK] we are not competing for news <unk> we are trying to encourage people to invite people and to actually teach people how to do this how they also[MASK] <unk> and that was crucial to turn mdia ninja from[MASK] from a small group of people and in a matter of weeks <unk> we multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country <unk> [MASK] so in a matter of a week or two as the protests kept happening[MASK] <unk> we were hundreds of young people connected in this network throughout the country <unk> we were covering more than fifty cities at the same time that 's something that no tv channel could ever do[MASK] that was responsible for turning us suddenly actually into kind of the mainstream media of social media <unk> [MASK] so we had a couple of thousands of followers on our facebook page and soon we had a quarter of a million followers [MASK] our posts and our videos were being seen by more than[MASK] <unk> eleven million timelines a week it was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do <unk> [MASK] and that turned mdia ninja into something else more than a media outlet than a media project <unk> [MASK] it became almost like a public service[MASK] to the citizen to the protester to the activist because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool[MASK] to confront both police and media[MASK] authority[MASK] many of our images started to be used in regular tv channels our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular <unk>[MASK] <unk> televisions when things got really rough some our images were responsible[MASK] <unk> also turned mdia ninja very soon to be seen as almost an enemy of cops <unk> unfortunately <unk> [MASK] and we started to be severely beaten and eventually arrested on the streets it happened in many cases <unk> [MASK] but that was also useful because we were still at the web so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself[MASK] and the state of the freedom of the press in the country [MASK] so mdia ninja now evolved and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it[MASK] it would become a national network of hundreds of young people[MASK] <unk> what i started to do in the beginning of this year as mdia ninja is already a <unk>[MASK] dedicating myself to another project it 's called fluxo which is portuguese for [MASK] <unk> it 's a journalism studio in so paulo downtown where i used livestream to experiment with what i call <unk>[MASK] formats <unk> but i 'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent[MASK] journalism through a direct relationship with an audience with an active audience <unk> because now i really want to try to make a living out of my tear gas[MASK] <unk> there 's something more significant here something that i believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example <unk> [MASK] i said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal tv network <unk> but i believe it does something else <unk> because after watching[MASK] people using it not only to cover things but to express to organize themselves politically[MASK] <unk> i believe livestream can turn cyberspace[MASK] into a global political arena where everyone might have a voice a proper voice <unk> [MASK] because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast[MASK] political discourse of the verbal aspect of the political dialogue out of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone <unk> [MASK] and it empowers the citizen through this direct and[MASK] <unk> power of exchanging experiences and dialogue empowers them to[MASK] question and to influence authorities in ways in which we are about to see <unk> [MASK] and i believe it does something else that might be even more important that[MASK] the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity in a very political way as i see it[MASK] because it really helps[MASK] the audience the citizen to see the world through somebody else 's eye <unk> so it helps the citizen[MASK] to put him or herself in other people 's place <unk> [MASK] and that idea i think should be the intention <unk> should be the goal of any good journalism any good activism <unk> but most of all [MASK] any good politics <unk> thank you very much it was an honor[MASK]
