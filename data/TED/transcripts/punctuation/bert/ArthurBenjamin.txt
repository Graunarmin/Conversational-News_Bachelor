 <unk> so why do we learn mathematics[MASK] essentially for three reasons calculation application <unk> [MASK] and last and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it inspiration [MASK] mathematics is the science[MASK] <unk> of patterns and we study it to learn how to think logically critically and creatively <unk> [MASK] but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated [MASK] and when our students ask why are we learning this then they often hear that they 'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test <unk> [MASK] but wouldn 't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply[MASK] <unk> because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind <unk> [MASK] now i know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers the fibonacci numbers [MASK] yeah i already have fibonacci fans here that 's great now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways <unk> from the standpoint of calculation[MASK] they 're as easy to understand as one plus one which is two [MASK] then one plus two is three <unk> two plus three is five three plus five is eight <unk> and so on <unk> [MASK] indeed the person we call fibonacci was actually named leonardo of pisa and these numbers appear in his book liber abaci which taught the western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today [MASK] <unk> applications fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number or the number of spirals <unk>[MASK] on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well [MASK] <unk> about them are the beautiful number patterns they display let me show you one of my favorites <unk> suppose you like to square numbers <unk> and frankly who doesn 't[MASK] let 's look at the squares of the first few fibonacci numbers so one squared is one two squared is four three squared is nine five squared is twenty five and so on[MASK] now it 's no surprise that when you[MASK] <unk> add consecutive fibonacci numbers you get the next fibonacci number right that 's how they 're created <unk> but you wouldn 't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together <unk>[MASK] <unk> but check this out one plus one gives us two <unk> and one plus four gives us five [MASK] <unk> numbers <unk> let 's see what we get there so one plus one plus four is six [MASK] add nine to that we get fifteen add twenty five we get forty add sixty four we get one hundred and four <unk> now look at those numbers <unk> those are not <unk>[MASK] <unk> fibonacci numbers <unk> but if you look at them closely you 'll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them do[MASK] <unk> is two times three <unk> fifteen is three times five forty is five times eight two three five eight <unk> who do we appreciate [MASK] fibonacci of course <unk> [MASK] now as much fun as it is to discover these patterns it 's even more satisfying to understand why they are true <unk> let 's look at that last equation why should the squares of one one[MASK] <unk> five and eight add up to eight times thirteen <unk> i 'll show you by drawing a simple picture [MASK] we 'll start with a one by one square and next to that put another[MASK] <unk> creating one giant rectangle right <unk> now let me ask you a simple question what is the area of the rectangle <unk> [MASK] well on the one hand it 's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it right <unk> just as we created it it 's one squared plus one squared <unk>[MASK] plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared right <unk> that 's the area[MASK] on the other hand because it 's a rectangle the area is equal to its height times its base and the height is clearly eight <unk> and the base is five <unk>[MASK] <unk> plus eight which is the next fibonacci number thirteen <unk> right so the area is also eight times thirteen <unk> [MASK] <unk> the area two different ways they have to be the same number <unk> and that 's why the squares of one one two three five and eight add up to eight times thirteen <unk> [MASK] now if we continue this process we 'll generate rectangles of the form[MASK] thirteen by <unk>[MASK] <unk> by thirty four and so on <unk> [MASK] now check this out if you divide thirteen by eight you get one point six two five [MASK] and if you divide the larger number by the smaller number then these ratios get[MASK] <unk> closer and closer to about one point six one eight known to many people as the golden ratio a number which has fascinated mathematicians scientists and artists for centuries <unk> [MASK] now i show all this to you because like so much of mathematics there 's a beautiful side to it that i fear does not get enough attention in our schools we spend lots of time learning about[MASK] <unk> calculation <unk> but let 's not forget about application including perhaps the most important application of all learning how to think [MASK] if i could summarize this in one sentence it would be this [MASK] mathematics is not just solving for x it 's also figuring out why [MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
