 <unk> fifteen years ago after a twenty year stay in the united states and africa called me back and i founded my country 's[MASK] <unk> graphic design and new media college and i called it the

language based on the african creative heritage[MASK] we offer a two year diploma[MASK] to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education[MASK] and typography 's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence[MASK] here 's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme education is a right[MASK] some logos designed by my students[MASK] <unk> africa has had a long tradition of writing but this is not such a well known fact and i wrote the book afrikan alphabets to address that[MASK] the different types of writing in africa first was proto writing[MASK] as illustrated by nsibidi which is the writing system of a secret society of the ejagham people in southern nigeria[MASK] so it 's a special interest writing system the akan of people of ghana[MASK] developed adinkra symbols some four hundred years ago[MASK] and these are proverbs historical sayings objects animals plants and my favorite adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left it 's called sankofa it means return[MASK] <unk> return and get it learn from the past[MASK] this pictograph by the jokwe people of angola tells the story of the creation of the world at the top is god[MASK] at the bottom is man mankind[MASK] and on the left is the sun on the right is the moon all the paths lead to and from god[MASK] these secret societies of the yoruba kongo and palo religions in nigeria congo and angola respectively[MASK] developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in in the new world in cuba[MASK] brazil and trinidad and haiti[MASK] in[MASK] <unk> the rainforests of the democratic republic of congo[MASK] in the ituri society[MASK] the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree and the women

if you may[MASK] in south africa ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes[MASK] in bright colors and the zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces[MASK] ethiopia has had the longest tradition of writing with the ethiopic script[MASK] <unk> that was developed in the fourth century a d and is used to write amharic which is spoken by over twenty four million people[MASK] king ibrahim njoya of the bamum kingdom of cameroon developed shu mom at the age of twenty five[MASK] shu mom is a writing system it 's a syllabary it 's not exactly an alphabet and here we see three stages of development[MASK] <unk> that it went through in thirty years[MASK] the vai people of liberia had a long tradition of literacy[MASK] before their first contact with europeans in the one thousand eight hundred s it 's a syllabary and reads from left to right[MASK] next door in sierra leone the mende also developed a syllabary but[MASK] <unk> theirs reads from right to left[MASK] africa has had a long tradition of design a well defined design sensibility[MASK] but the problem in africa has been that especially today designers in africa struggle with all forms of design because[MASK] they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration[MASK] <unk> the creative spirit in africa the creative tradition is as potent as it has always been[MASK] if only designers could look within[MASK] this ethiopic cross illustrates what dr ron eglash has established that africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals[MASK] africans of antiquity created civilization[MASK] and their monuments which still stand today are a true testimony of their greatness[MASK] most probably one of humanity 's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet and that has been attributed[MASK] <unk> hundred bc followed by hieroglyphics in egypt[MASK] and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact[MASK] that is until one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight[MASK] when one yale professor john coleman darnell discovered these inscriptions in

mesopotamia[MASK] called wadi el hol because of the place that they were discovered[MASK] these inscriptions research is still going on a few of them have been deciphered[MASK] but there is consensus among scholars[MASK] <unk> that this is really humanity 's first alphabet[MASK] over here you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far starting with the letter a ƒÅlep at the top and bet in the middle and so forth[MASK] it is time that students of design in africa read the works of titans[MASK] <unk> like cheikh anta diop senegal 's cheikh anta diop whose seminal work on egypt is vindicated by this discovery[MASK] the last word goes to the great jamaican leader marcus mosiah garvey and the akan people of ghana with their adinkra symbol sankofa[MASK] which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present[MASK] <unk> and build on a future for us and our children[MASK] it is also time that designers in africa stop looking outside[MASK] they 've been looking outward for a long time yet what they were looking for[MASK] has been right there within grasp right within them[MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
