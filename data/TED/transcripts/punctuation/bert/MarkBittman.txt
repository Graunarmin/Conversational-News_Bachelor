 <unk> write about food i write about cooking i take it quite seriously <unk> but i 'm here to talk about something that 's[MASK] become very important to me in the last year or two it is about food but it 's not about[MASK] <unk> start with this picture of a beautiful cow <unk> i 'm not a vegetarian this is the old nixon line right but i still think that[MASK] this <unk>[MASK] now <unk> that is only a little bit hyperbolic and why do i say it <unk> [MASK] because only once before has the fate of individual people[MASK] and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined <unk> there was the bomb[MASK] <unk> and there 's now [MASK] and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives [MASK] but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we 'd recognize it it 's a holocaust of a different kind [MASK] and hiding under our desks isn 't going to help start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous[MASK] <unk> every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given [MASK] then hear this please <unk> [MASK] after energy production [MASK] livestock is the second highest contributor to <unk> atmosphere altering gases nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas[MASK] is generated by livestock production more than transportation[MASK] <unk> you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is twenty times more poisonous than co2 [MASK] and it 's not just methane [MASK] livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation <unk> air and water pollution <unk> water shortages and loss of biodiversity there 's more [MASK] <unk> like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people but to animals <unk> [MASK] but lists like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this [MASK] if you 're a progressive if you 're driving a prius or you 're shopping green or you 're looking for organic <unk> you should probably be a <unk>[MASK] now i 'm no more <unk>[MASK] than i am anti atom [MASK] but it 's all in the way we use these things there 's another piece of the puzzle which ann cooper talked about beautifully yesterday <unk> and one you already know <unk> [MASK] there 's no question[MASK] <unk> lifestyle diseases diabetes heart disease stroke <unk> some cancers[MASK] are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that 's the direct result of eating a western diet [MASK] our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day[MASK] our demand for these things[MASK] <unk> not our need our want [MASK] drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us <unk> and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease <unk> [MASK] now global warming was unforeseen we didn 't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know [MASK] that 's not such a big deal <unk> [MASK] the current health crisis however is a little more[MASK] <unk> the work of the evil empire we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate <unk> the healthier we 'd be no [MASK] overconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem <unk> along with our paltry consumption of plants now <unk> there 's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here <unk> but the evidence is that plants and i want to make this clear it 's not the ingredients in plants[MASK] <unk> the plants it 's not the <unk>[MASK] it 's the carrot the evidence is very clear[MASK] that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point <unk> you eat more plants <unk> you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad [MASK] but back to animals and junk food <unk> what do they have in common[MASK] <unk> we don 't need either of them for health <unk> we don 't need animal products and we certainly don 't need white bread or coke [MASK] two both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand we 're not born craving whoppers or skittles <unk> [MASK] three their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more <unk>[MASK] <unk> diet now <unk> let 's imagine a parallel let 's pretend that our government supported an[MASK] while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs [MASK] incredible isn 't it <unk> yet they do that and they do this here it 's the same deal <unk> [MASK] the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well intentioned feds try to do right by us they fail <unk> [MASK] either they 're outvoted by puppets of[MASK] <unk> agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness <unk> [MASK] so when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants rather than animals that made people healthy <unk> [MASK] they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid [MASK] to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day <unk> along with more carbs what they didn 't tell us is that some carbs are better than others and that plants and whole grains[MASK] <unk> should be supplanting eating junk food <unk> [MASK] but industry lobbyists would never let that happen and guess what [MASK] half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness <unk> [MASK] so instead of substituting plants for animals our swollen appetites simply became larger [MASK] and the most dangerous aspects of them remained[MASK] <unk> these are not solutions <unk> but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local [MASK] or whether we 're being nice to animals <unk> the most important issues just aren 't being addressed now don 't get me wrong <unk> [MASK] i like animals and i don 't think it 's just fine to industrialize their production[MASK] and to churn them out like they were wrenches <unk> but there 's no way to treat animals[MASK] <unk> well when you 're killing ten billion of them a year that 's our number [MASK] ten billion if you strung all of them chickens cows pigs and lambs to the moon [MASK] they 'd go there and back five times there and back now my math 's a little shaky but this is this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea [MASK] that 's just the united states <unk> and with our[MASK] <unk> of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease <unk> kindness might just be a bit of a red herring let 's get the numbers[MASK] of the animals we 're killing for eating down and then we 'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left [MASK] another red herring might be exemplified by the word locavore which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary seriously[MASK] <unk> for those of you who don 't know is someone who eats only locally grown food which is fine if you live in california but for the rest of us it 's a bit of a sad joke <unk> [MASK] between the official story the food pyramid[MASK] and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating they both get it wrong though[MASK] <unk> the first at least is populist and the second is elitist how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states <unk> and i 'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now [MASK] a hundred years ago guess what everyone was a locavore [MASK] even new york had pig farms nearby <unk> and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion [MASK] every family had a cook usually a mom [MASK] and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your[MASK] <unk> romantic vision of europe <unk> [MASK] margarine didn 't exist in fact when margarine was invented <unk> several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink so we 'd all know that it was a fake <unk> [MASK] there was no snack food and until the ' 20s until clarence birdseye came along <unk> there was no frozen food <unk> there were no restaurant[MASK] <unk> there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic [MASK] and fancy food was entirely french [MASK] as an aside those of you who remember dan aykroyd in <unk>[MASK] doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide [MASK] back in those days <unk> before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy[MASK] <unk> of food <unk> you just ate you didn 't claim to be anything [MASK] there was no marketing there were no national brands <unk> vitamins had not been invented <unk> [MASK] there were no health claims at least not federally sanctioned ones fats carbs proteins they weren 't bad or good <unk> they were food <unk> you ate[MASK] food <unk> hardly anything contained more than one ingredient <unk> because it was an ingredient the[MASK] <unk> cornflake hadn 't been invented the pop tart the pringle cheez whiz <unk> none of that stuff <unk> goldfish swam [MASK] it 's hard to imagine people grew food <unk> and they ate food <unk> [MASK] and again everyone ate local in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida [MASK] from the ' 30s on road systems expanded trucks took the[MASK] <unk> place of railroads fresh food began to travel more oranges became common in new york <unk> [MASK] the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland <unk> [MASK] the effects of this are well known they are everywhere <unk> and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is[MASK] almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato even in summer[MASK] <unk> eventually california produced too much food to ship fresh so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods [MASK] thus arrived convenience <unk> it was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework now i know everybody over the age of like forty five their mouths are watering at this point [MASK] if we had a slide of salisbury steak even more so[MASK] <unk> but this may have cut down on housework but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well <unk> many of us[MASK] grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd[MASK] lettuce salad i for one and i 'm not kidding[MASK] didn 't eat real spinach or broccoli till i was nineteen who needed it though meat was everywhere what could be easier more filling or healthier[MASK] <unk> for your family than broiling a steak <unk> [MASK] but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally <unk> [MASK] rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed <unk> they were forced to eat soy and corn [MASK] they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasn 't a problem for producers [MASK] new drugs kept[MASK] <unk> they kept them alive healthy was another story [MASK] thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon joined them on the throne [MASK] it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing we 're only realizing just now <unk> listen to[MASK] <unk> fifty and two thousand the world 's population doubled meat consumption increased five fold [MASK] now <unk> someone had to eat all that stuff so we got fast food <unk> [MASK] and this took care of the situation resoundingly <unk> home cooking remained the norm <unk> but its quality was down the tubes <unk> there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts[MASK] <unk> because all of them could be bought at any store not that they were any good but they were there [MASK] most moms cooked like mine a piece of broiled meat a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup <unk> canned fruit salad <unk> [MASK] maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever <unk> minute rice [MASK] for dessert store bought ice cream or cookies <unk> my mom is not here so i can say this now this kind of cooking[MASK] <unk> drove me to learn how to cook for myself it wasn 't all bad by the <unk>[MASK] <unk> people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians <unk> we weren 't all hippies either <unk> [MASK] some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook[MASK] <unk> food production had become industrial <unk> industrial [MASK] perhaps because it was being produced rationally as if it were plastic food gained magical or poisonous powers or both [MASK] many people became fat phobic others worshiped broccoli as if it were god like [MASK] but mostly they didn 't eat broccoli <unk> [MASK] instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to[MASK] <unk> convert it to something much more akin to ice cream similarly let 's look at a granola bar you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it 's closer in form to a snickers than it is to oatmeal <unk> [MASK] sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the[MASK] beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many soy[MASK] <unk> corn products as could be crammed into it think[MASK] of the frozen chicken nugget <unk> the chicken is fed corn and then its meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder <unk> [MASK] and then it 's fried in corn oil [MASK] all you do is nuke it what could be better and zapped horribly [MASK] <unk> home cooking was in such a sad state[MASK] that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually[MASK] made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home [MASK] at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce <unk> and cooking simply wasn 't important enough for men to share the burden[MASK] <unk> you 've got your pizza nights you 've got your microwave nights you 've got your grazing nights you 've got your fend for yourself nights and so on [MASK] leading the way what 's leading the way meat junk food <unk> cheese the very stuff that will kill you [MASK] so now we clamor for organic food that 's good <unk> [MASK] and as evidence that things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast food outlets <unk> but organic food isn 't the answer either at least not the way it 's currently defined[MASK] me pose you a question can farm raised salmon be organic <unk> [MASK] when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves[MASK] are packed tightly in pens swimming in their own filth <unk> and if that salmon 's from chile[MASK] <unk> and it 's killed down there and then flown[MASK] five thousand miles <unk> whatever dumping[MASK] how much carbon into the atmosphere i don 't know packed in styrofoam of course <unk> before landing somewhere in the united states <unk> and then being trucked a few hundred <unk>[MASK] <unk> more miles this may be organic in letter <unk> but it 's surely not organic in spirit <unk> [MASK] <unk> the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the gourmets[MASK] and those of us who are just plain interested in good food [MASK] even though we 've come to this from different points we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food [MASK] we need to start acting <unk> and this is not only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said and of course she 's completely right[MASK] but it 's also one of global survival which bring me full[MASK] <unk> circle and points directly to the core issue [MASK] the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food as i said eighteen percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production [MASK] how much livestock do you need to produce this [MASK] seventy percent of the agricultural land on earth thirty percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly[MASK] <unk> devoted to raising the animals we 'll eat [MASK] and this amount is predicted to double in the next forty years or so <unk> and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like[MASK] what they look like now it 's not going to be forty years <unk> there is no good reason[MASK] for eating as much meat as we do and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life the most common argument is that we need nutrients[MASK] even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even[MASK] the industry obsessed usda recommends <unk> but listen <unk> experts who are serious about disease reduction[MASK] recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we eat per[MASK] <unk> half a pound <unk> [MASK] but don 't we need meat to be big and strong isn 't meat eating essential to health won 't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into[MASK] godless sissy liberals [MASK] some of us might think that would be a good thing but no [MASK] even if we were all steroid filled football players the answer is no in fact[MASK] <unk> there 's no diet on earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won 't promote growth <unk> [MASK] and many will make you much healthier than ours does <unk> we don 't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition [MASK] we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition <unk> and it 's killing us [MASK] to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat fifty percent less meat it 's not enough of a cut <unk> [MASK] but it 's a start it would seem absurd[MASK] but that 's exactly what should happen [MASK] and what progressive people forward thinking people should be doing and advocating <unk> [MASK] along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants [MASK] i 've been writing about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about thirty years [MASK] during that time i 've eaten and recommended eating just about everything[MASK] <unk> 'll never stop eating animals i 'm sure <unk> but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly[MASK]
