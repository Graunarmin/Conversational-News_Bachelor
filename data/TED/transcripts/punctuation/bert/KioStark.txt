 <unk> there are things we say when we catch the eye of a stranger or a neighbor walking by [MASK] we say hello how are you it 's a beautiful day how do you feel [MASK] <unk> these sound kind of meaningless right and in some ways they are they have no semantic meaning it[MASK] doesn 't matter how you are or what the day is like <unk> they have something else <unk> they have social meaning <unk> [MASK] what we mean when we say those things is i see you there <unk> [MASK] i 'm obsessed with talking to strangers <unk> i make eye contact[MASK] <unk> i get all kinds of stories [MASK] about seven years ago <unk> i started documenting my experiences to try to figure out why <unk> [MASK] what i found was that something really beautiful was going on this is almost poetic [MASK] these were really profound experiences <unk> they were unexpected pleasures[MASK] <unk> they were genuine emotional connections <unk> they were liberating moments <unk> [MASK] so one day i was standing on a corner waiting for the light to change which <unk> i 'm a new yorker so that means i was actually standing in the street[MASK] on the storm drain [MASK] as if that could get me across faster <unk> and there 's an old man standing next to me so he 's wearing like a long overcoat and sort of an old man hat <unk> and[MASK] he looked like somebody from a movie <unk> and he says to me don 't stand there[MASK] you might disappear [MASK] so this is absurd right but i did what he said i stepped back onto the sidewalk <unk> [MASK] and he smiled and he said good you never know i might have turned around <unk> and zoop you 're gone [MASK] this was weird <unk> and also really wonderful he was so warm <unk> and he was so happy that he 'd saved me[MASK] <unk> we had this little bond for a minute i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed [MASK] and i was worth saving <unk> [MASK] the really sad thing is in many parts of the world we 're raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default [MASK] that we can 't trust them that they might hurt us <unk> [MASK] but most[MASK] <unk> strangers aren 't dangerous we 're uneasy around them because we have no context <unk> we don 't know what their intentions are [MASK] so instead of using our perceptions and making choices <unk> we rely on this category of stranger [MASK] i have a four year old when i say hello to people on the street <unk> she[MASK] <unk> it 's just good to be friendly [MASK] i think twice every time i say that to her [MASK] because i mean it but as a woman particularly i know that not every stranger on the street has the best intentions [MASK] it is good to be friendly <unk> and it 's good to learn when not to be but none of that means we have to be afraid[MASK] there are two huge benefits to using our senses instead of our fears <unk> [MASK] the first one is that it liberates us [MASK] when you think about it using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done [MASK] categories are something our brains use when it comes to people it 's sort of a[MASK] <unk> shortcut for learning about them <unk> [MASK] we see male <unk> female young old black brown <unk> white stranger friend [MASK] and we use the information in that box it 's[MASK] quick <unk> it 's easy and it 's a road to bias and it means we 're not thinking about people[MASK] <unk> i know an american researcher who travels frequently in central asia and africa <unk> alone <unk> she 's entering into towns and cities[MASK] as a complete stranger <unk> she has no bonds no connections <unk> she 's a foreigner [MASK] her survival strategy is this get one stranger to see you as a real individual person if[MASK] you can do that it 'll help other people see you that way[MASK] the second benefit of using our senses has to do with intimacy <unk> [MASK] i know it sounds a little counterintuitive intimacy and strangers[MASK] <unk> but these quick interactions can lead to a feeling that sociologists call fleeting intimacy [MASK] so it 's a brief experience that has emotional[MASK] <unk> it 's the good feeling i got from being saved from the death trap of the storm drain by the old man [MASK] or how i feel like part of a community when i talk to somebody on my train on the way to work <unk> [MASK] sometimes it goes further <unk> researchers have found that people often feel[MASK] more comfortable[MASK] being honest and open about their inner selves with strangers than they do with their friends and their[MASK] <unk> families[MASK] that they often feel more understood by strangers <unk> [MASK] this gets reported in the media with great lament strangers communicate better than spouses [MASK] it 's a good headline right <unk> [MASK] i think it entirely misses the point <unk> [MASK] the important thing about these studies is just how significant these interactions[MASK] <unk> can be how this special form of closeness[MASK] gives us something we need as much as we need our friends and our families <unk> [MASK] so how is it possible that we communicate so well with strangers <unk> [MASK] there are two reasons <unk> the first one is that it 's a quick interaction[MASK] <unk> has no consequences it 's easy to be honest with someone you 're never going to see again right that makes sense <unk> [MASK] the second reason is where it gets more interesting we have a bias when it comes to people we 're close to [MASK] we expect them to understand us <unk> we assume they do <unk> and we expect them to read our minds <unk> [MASK] so imagine you 're at a party <unk> and you can 't believe that your friend or your spouse[MASK] isn 't picking up on it that you want to leave early[MASK] you 're thinking i gave you the look [MASK] with a stranger we have to start from scratch <unk> we tell the whole story <unk> [MASK] we explain who the people are how we feel about them <unk> we spell out all the inside jokes and guess what sometimes they do understand us a little better <unk>[MASK] <unk> now that we know that talking to strangers matters how does it work <unk> [MASK] there are unwritten rules we tend to follow the rules are very different depending on what country you 're in what culture you 're in [MASK] in most parts of the us <unk> the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy [MASK] this is known as civil inattention so imagine two people are walking towards[MASK] <unk> each other on the street they[MASK] 'll glance at each other from a distance that 's the civility <unk> the acknowledgment and then as they get closer they 'll look away [MASK] to give each other some space [MASK] in other cultures people go to extraordinary lengths not to interact at all [MASK] people from denmark tell me[MASK] that many danes are so averse to talking to strangers[MASK] that they would rather miss their stop on the bus than say excuse me to someone that they need to get around <unk>[MASK] instead there 's this elaborate shuffling of bags and using your body to say that you need to get past [MASK] instead of using two words [MASK] in egypt i 'm told[MASK] <unk> it 's rude to ignore a stranger and there 's a remarkable culture of hospitality [MASK] strangers might ask each other for a sip of water [MASK] or if you ask someone for directions <unk> they 're very likely to invite you home for coffee <unk> [MASK] we see these unwritten rules most clearly when they 're broken [MASK] or when you 're in a new place and you 're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is [MASK] sometimes breaking the rules a[MASK] <unk> little bit is where the action is [MASK] in case it 's not clear <unk> i really want you to do this <unk> ok <unk> [MASK] so here 's how it 's going to go <unk> find somebody who is making eye contact that 's a good signal <unk> the first thing is a simple smile <unk> [MASK] if you 're passing somebody on the street or in the hallway here smile see what happens <unk> another is[MASK] <unk> triangulation there 's you there 's a stranger <unk> there 's some third thing that you both might see and comment on [MASK] like a piece of public art or somebody preaching in the street[MASK] or somebody wearing funny clothes give it a try make a comment about that third thing and see if starts a conversation <unk> [MASK] another is what i call noticing this is usually giving a compliment[MASK] i 'm a big fan of noticing people 's shoes <unk> i 'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now but[MASK] shoes are fabulous in general [MASK] and they 're pretty neutral as far as giving compliments goes [MASK] people always want to tell you things about their awesome shoes [MASK] you may have already experienced the dogs and babies principle it can be awkward to talk to someone on the street you don 't know how they 're going to[MASK] <unk> respond but you can always talk to their dog or their baby [MASK] the dog or the baby is a social conduit to the person <unk> and you can tell by how they respond whether they 're open to talking more [MASK] the last one i want to challenge you to is disclosure [MASK] this is a very vulnerable thing to do <unk> and it can be very rewarding <unk> so next time you 're talking to a stranger[MASK] and you[MASK] <unk> feel comfortable [MASK] tell them something true about yourself something really personal [MASK] you might have that experience i talked about of feeling understood [MASK] sometimes in conversation it comes up people ask me what does your dad do or where does he live [MASK] and sometimes i tell them the whole truth which is that he died when i was a kid [MASK] always in those moments[MASK] <unk> they share their own experiences of loss we tend to meet disclosure with disclosure even with strangers <unk> [MASK] so here it is [MASK] when you talk to strangers you 're making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative of your daily life[MASK] <unk> you 're making unexpected connections <unk> if you don 't talk to strangers you 're missing out on all of that [MASK] we spend a lot of time teaching our children about strangers [MASK] what would happen if we spent more time teaching ourselves <unk> [MASK] we could reject all the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other [MASK] we could make a space for change <unk> thank you[MASK]
