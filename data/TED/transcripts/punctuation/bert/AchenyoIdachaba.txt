 <unk> vivid representation of several riverine communities across nigeria <unk> communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive[MASK] aquatic weed communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered fishing <unk> [MASK] marine transportation and trading [MASK] communities where fish yields have diminished communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to[MASK] <unk> sometimes weeks on end [MASK] who would have thought that this plant with round leaves <unk> inflated stems <unk> and showy <unk> lavender flowers[MASK] would cause such havoc in these communities the plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name <unk>[MASK] <unk> in nigeria the plant is also known by other names names associated with historical events as well as myths [MASK] in some places <unk> the plant is called babangida <unk> when you hear babangida <unk> you remember the military[MASK] and military coups and you think fear <unk> restraint in parts of nigeria in the niger delta the plant is also known[MASK] <unk> when you hear abiola <unk> you remember annulled elections and you think <unk> dashed hopes [MASK] in the southwestern part of nigeria <unk> the plant is known as[MASK] <unk> when you hear that you think of death it literally translates to death to mother and child [MASK] i personally had my encounter with this plant in the year two thousand and nine <unk> [MASK] it was shortly after i had relocated from the us to nigeria i 'd quit my job in corporate america[MASK] and decided to take this big leap of faith a leap[MASK] <unk> of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in nigeria in the area of sustainable development <unk> [MASK] and so here i was in the year two thousand and nine actually at the end of two thousand and nine in lagos on the third mainland bridge <unk> and i looked to my left and saw this very arresting[MASK] <unk> it was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth [MASK] and i was really pained by what i saw because i thought to myself [MASK] these poor fisherfolk how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions [MASK] and then i thought there 's got to be a better way a win win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the[MASK] <unk> cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed [MASK] that i would say was my spark moment <unk> [MASK] and so i did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed[MASK] <unk> out of the several one struck me the most it was the use of the plant for handicrafts <unk> and i thought what a great idea [MASK] personally i love handicrafts <unk> especially handicrafts that are woven around a story <unk> [MASK] and so i thought this could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills [MASK] and i thought to myself three simple steps to a mega solution[MASK] <unk> first step [MASK] get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth that way you create access <unk> secondly you dry the water hyacinth stems <unk> and thirdly you weave[MASK] the water hyacinth into products the third step was a challenge see i[MASK] <unk> a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts <unk> and so i began my quest to find out how i can learn how to weave [MASK] and this quest took me to a community in ibadan where i lived called sabo sabo translates to strangers ' quarters [MASK] and the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country so i literally took my dried weeds in hand there were several more of them and went knocking from door to door[MASK] to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes <unk> and i was directed to the shed of malam yahaya [MASK] the problem though is that malam yahaya doesn 't speak english and neither did i speak hausa <unk> [MASK] but some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate and that began my journey of learning how to weave[MASK] and transform[MASK] these dried water[MASK] <unk> hyacinth stems[MASK] into[MASK] long ropes [MASK] with my long ropes in hand <unk> [MASK] i was now equipped to make products <unk> and that was the beginning of partnerships working with rattan basket makers to come up with products so with this in hand <unk> i felt confident[MASK] <unk> be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities[MASK] and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity so taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold [MASK] so we have pens we have tableware <unk> we have purses <unk> we have tissue boxes <unk> [MASK] thereby <unk> helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light seeing water hyacinth[MASK] <unk> as being valuable being aesthetic being durable[MASK] for mother and child and i 'd like to end with a quote by michael margolis <unk> he said if you want to learn about a culture <unk> [MASK] listen to the stories <unk> and if you want to change a culture <unk> change the stories and so from makoko community to[MASK]
