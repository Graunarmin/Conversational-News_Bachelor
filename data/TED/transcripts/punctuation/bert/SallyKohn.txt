 <unk> when i do my job people hate me in fact the better[MASK] i do my job the more people hate me [MASK] and no i 'm not a meter maid <unk> and i 'm not an undertaker <unk> i am a progressive lesbian talking head on fox news[MASK] so y 'all heard that right just to make sure right i am a gay talking head on fox news i am going to tell you how i do it [MASK] and the most important thing i 've learned <unk> [MASK] so i go on television i debate people who[MASK] literally want to obliterate everything i believe in in some cases who don 't want me and people like me to even exist [MASK] it 's sort of like thanksgiving with your conservative uncle[MASK] on steroids[MASK] with a live television audience of millions it 's totally almost just like that[MASK] <unk> and that 's just on air the hate mail i get is unbelievable last week alone i got two hundred and thirty eight pieces of nasty email[MASK] and more hate tweets than i can even count <unk> i was called an idiot a traitor a scourge a cunt and an ugly man and[MASK] <unk> was just in one email [MASK] so[MASK] what have i realized being on the receiving end of all this ugliness <unk> well my biggest takeaway[MASK] is that for decades we 've been focused on political correctness <unk> but what matters more is emotional correctness[MASK] let me give you a small example <unk> i don 't care if you call me a dyke i really don 't <unk> i care[MASK] <unk> about two things one i care that you spell it right [MASK] applause just quick refresher it 's <unk>[MASK] you 'd totally be surprised <unk> [MASK] and second i don 't care about the word i care about how you use it are you being friendly are you just being naive or do you really want to hurt me personally[MASK] <unk> emotional correctness[MASK] is the tone the feeling how we say what we say the respect and compassion we show one another <unk> [MASK] and what i 've realized is that political persuasion doesn 't begin with ideas or facts or data [MASK] political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct <unk> [MASK] so when i first went to go work at fox news true confession i[MASK] <unk> expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging [MASK] that by the way in case you 're paying attention is not emotionally correct[MASK] <unk> but liberals on my side <unk> [MASK] we can be self righteous we can be condescending we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn 't agree with us in other words we can be politically[MASK] <unk> that means that people don 't like us <unk> right[MASK] <unk> now here 's the kicker <unk> [MASK] conservatives are really nice [MASK] i mean not all of them and not the ones who send me hate mail but you would be surprised <unk> sean hannity is one of the sweetest guys i 've ever met [MASK] he spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates <unk> and i know that if i ever had a problem[MASK] he would do anything he could to help <unk> [MASK] now [MASK] i think sean hannity is <unk> ninety nine percent politically wrong <unk> but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive <unk> and that 's why people listen to him [MASK] because you can 't get anyone to agree with you[MASK] if they don 't even listen to you first we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements[MASK] <unk> and if we can start to find compassion for one another <unk> then we have a shot at building common ground [MASK] it actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here <unk> but when you try to put it in practice it 's really powerful so[MASK] someone who says they hate immigrants i try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they 've always known or someone who says[MASK] <unk> they don 't like teachers ' unions i bet they 're really devastated to see their kid 's school going into the gutter and they 're just looking for someone to blame [MASK] our challenge[MASK] is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us that is emotional correctness i 'm not saying it 's easy[MASK] <unk> an average of like five point six times per day i have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities[MASK] <unk> this whole[MASK] finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a <unk>[MASK] practice for me and i ain 't the dalai lama i 'm not perfect <unk> but what i am[MASK] <unk> because i don 't just get hate mail [MASK] i get a lot of really nice letters <unk> lots of them and one of my all time favorites begins i am not a big fan of your political leanings[MASK] or your sometimes tortured logic [MASK] laughter but i 'm a big fan of you as a person now this guy doesn 't agree with me yet[MASK] <unk> he 's listening[MASK] not because of what i said but because of how i said it and somehow even though we 've never met we 've managed to form a connection [MASK] that 's emotional correctness <unk> and that 's how we start the conversations that really lead to change <unk> thank you[MASK]
