 <unk> a career in the art world i took a course in london and one of my supervisors was this irascible italian called[MASK] <unk> drank too much <unk> smoked too much and swore much too much <unk> but he was a a passionate teacher <unk> [MASK] and i remember one of our earlier classes with him <unk> he was projecting images on the wall <unk> asking us to to think about them <unk> [MASK] and he put up an image of a painting it was a landscape[MASK] <unk> there was a nude woman in the lower foreground <unk> and on the hillside in the back there was a figure of the mythological god bacchus <unk> [MASK] and he said what is this [MASK] and i no one else did so i put up my hand <unk> and i said it 's a bacchanal by titian [MASK] he said it 's a what [MASK] i thought maybe i 'd pronounced it[MASK] <unk> as i said he swore too much[MASK] <unk> there was an important lesson for me in that pietro was suspicious of formal art training art history training[MASK] <unk> because he feared[MASK] that it filled people up with jargon <unk> and then they just classified things rather than looking at them <unk> [MASK] and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary <unk> and he wanted us to use our eyes <unk> [MASK] and he was especially evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight[MASK] <unk> he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made <unk> why was it made <unk> how is it used <unk> [MASK] and these were important lessons to me when i subsequently became a professional art historian my kind of eureka moment came a a few years[MASK] <unk> when i was studying the art of the courts of northern europe <unk> and of course it was very much[MASK] discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day <unk> [MASK] but as i began to read historical documents and[MASK] contemporary descriptions i found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere i came across descriptions of tapestries[MASK] <unk> tapestries were ubiquitous[MASK] between the middle ages and really well into the <unk> 18th century <unk> [MASK] and it was pretty apparent why [MASK] tapestries were portable [MASK] you could roll them up send them ahead of you <unk> [MASK] and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold <unk> dank interior into a richly colored setting[MASK] <unk> provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated [MASK] or even themselves <unk> [MASK] and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive [MASK] they required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time[MASK] with very expensive[MASK] <unk> materials the wools the silks even gold and silver thread[MASK] so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare [MASK] tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well[MASK] i became[MASK] <unk> in due course i ended up as a curator at the metropolitan museum <unk> because i saw the met as one of the few places[MASK] where i could organize really big exhibitions about the subject[MASK] i cared so passionately about and in about one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the then director philippe de montebello[MASK] <unk> to organize an exhibition for two thousand and two we normally have these very long lead in times <unk> [MASK] it wasn 't straightforward <unk> it 's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry[MASK] in the back of a car [MASK] they have to be wound on huge rollers <unk> shipped in oversized freighters <unk> [MASK] some of them are so big we had to get them into the museum we had to take them up the great steps at the front[MASK] we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience <unk> [MASK] the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded <unk> [MASK] the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread <unk> the labeling you know[MASK] we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs[MASK] a one hit image these were big complex things[MASK] <unk> almost like cartoons with multiple narratives <unk> we had to draw our audience in get them to slow down to explore the objects [MASK] there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night <unk>[MASK] i overheard one of the senior members of staff saying this is going to be a bomb [MASK] but in reality in the course of the coming weeks and months <unk> hundreds of thousands of people[MASK] came to see the show <unk> [MASK] the exhibition was designed to be an experience <unk> and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs [MASK] so i want you to use your imaginations thinking of these[MASK] some of them ten meters wide <unk> [MASK] depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of of the fashion press today <unk> [MASK] thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer <unk> [MASK] violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism[MASK] i remember taking my son 's school class he was eight at the time <unk> and all the little boys <unk> [MASK] they kind of you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention[MASK] was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an in your face joke by the[MASK] <unk> it brought it alive to them i think they suddenly saw that these these weren 't just old faded tapestries these were images of the world in the past <unk> [MASK] and that it was the same for our audience [MASK] and[MASK] for me as a curator i felt proud <unk> i felt i 'd shifted the needle a little through this experience that could[MASK] <unk> only be created in a museum i 'd opened up the eyes of my audience[MASK] historians <unk> artists press the general public to the beauty of this of this lost medium [MASK] a few years later <unk> i was invited to be the director of the museum <unk> [MASK] and after i got over that who me the tapestry geek <unk> i don 't wear a[MASK] <unk> i realized the fact <unk> i believe passionately[MASK] in that curated museum experience <unk> [MASK] we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of just add water expertise <unk> [MASK] but there 's nothing that compares with[MASK] the presentation of significant objects in a well told narrative[MASK] <unk> what the curator does <unk> the interpretation[MASK] of a complex esoteric subject [MASK] in a way that retains the integrity of the subject that makes it unpacks it for a general audience <unk> [MASK] and that to me today is now the challenge and the fun of my of my job supporting the vision of my curators <unk> whether it 's an exhibition[MASK] <unk> of samurai swords early byzantine artifacts <unk> [MASK] renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the mcqueen show [MASK] with which we enjoyed so much success last summer [MASK] that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of of two thousand and ten shortly after mcqueen[MASK] <unk> curator of costume andrew bolton came to see me <unk> and said i 've been thinking of doing a show on mcqueen [MASK] and now is the moment we have to we have to do it fast [MASK] it wasn 't easy[MASK] <unk> mcqueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers[MASK] who were very protective of his legacy[MASK] <unk> but andrew went to london and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence <unk> [MASK] and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows which were works of performance art in their own right <unk> [MASK] and we proceeded to do something at the museum i think we 've never done before <unk> [MASK] it wasn 't just your standard installation in fact we ripped down the galleries[MASK] to recreate entirely different settings[MASK] a recreation of his first studio a hall of mirrors a curiosity box [MASK] a sunken ship a burned out interior [MASK] with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating[MASK] <unk> and in this[MASK] <unk> were like actors and actresses or living sculptures it could have been a train wreck <unk> it could have looked like[MASK] shop windows on fifth avenue at christmas <unk> [MASK] but because of the way that andrew connected with the mcqueen team [MASK] he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of mcqueen and the show was quite transcendant and[MASK] <unk> a phenomenon in its own right [MASK] by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show <unk> [MASK] but no one really complained <unk> i heard over and over again wow that was worth it it was a such a visceral emotive experience now[MASK] i 've described two very immersive exhibitions but i also believe[MASK] that[MASK] <unk> collections <unk> individual objects can also have that same power [MASK] the met was set up not as a museum of american art but of an encyclopedic museum <unk> and[MASK] today one hundred and forty years later that vision is as prescient as ever <unk> because of[MASK] <unk> we live in a world of crisis of challenge and we 're exposed to it through the twenty four seven newsreels <unk> [MASK] it 's in our galleries[MASK] that we can unpack the the civilizations the cultures [MASK] that we 're seeing the current manifestation of whether it 's libya <unk> egypt <unk> syria <unk> it 's in our galleries that we can explain[MASK] <unk> i mean our new islamic galleries are a case in point opened ten years <unk> almost to the week after nine eleven <unk> [MASK] i think for most americans <unk> knowledge of the[MASK] islamic world was pretty slight before nine eleven <unk> and then it was thrust upon us[MASK] in one of america 's darkest hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event now[MASK] <unk> now in our galleries we show fourteen centuries of the development[MASK] of different islamic[MASK] cultures across a vast geographic spread [MASK] and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last october <unk> [MASK] i 'm often asked[MASK] <unk> replacing the museum and i think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion <unk> [MASK] i mean <unk> don 't get me wrong <unk> i 'm a huge advocate of the web [MASK] it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe <unk> but nothing replaces the authenticity[MASK] of the object[MASK] presented[MASK] <unk> with passionate scholarship <unk> [MASK] bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people[MASK] across time across space <unk> whose lives may have been very different to our own <unk> but who like[MASK] <unk> had hopes and dreams <unk> [MASK] frustrations and achievements in their lives <unk> [MASK] and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves helps us make better decisions about where we 're going[MASK] <unk> face to face with[MASK] <unk> a dog pooping in the[MASK]
