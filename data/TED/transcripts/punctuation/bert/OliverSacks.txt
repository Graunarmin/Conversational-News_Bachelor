 <unk> we see with the eyes <unk> but we see with the brain as well <unk> and seeing with the brain is often called imagination <unk> [MASK] and we are familiar[MASK] with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes we 've lived with them all our lives[MASK] but there are also hallucinations as well <unk> [MASK] and hallucinations are completely different they don 't seem to be of our creation <unk> they don 't seem to be under our control <unk> they seem to come from the outside <unk> [MASK] and to mimic perception <unk> so i am going to be talking[MASK] <unk> and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients [MASK] a few months ago i got a phone call[MASK] from a nursing home where i work they told me that one of their residents an old lady in her 90s was seeing things <unk> [MASK] and they wondered if she 'd gone[MASK] <unk> because she was an old lady whether she 'd had a stroke or whether she had alzheimer 's and so[MASK] they asked me if i would come and see rosalie <unk> [MASK] the old lady <unk> i went in to see her <unk> it was evident straight away that she was[MASK] perfectly sane and lucid[MASK] and of good intelligence <unk> but she 'd been very[MASK] <unk> told me the nurses hadn 't mentioned this[MASK] that she was blind [MASK] that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years <unk> but now for the last few days she 'd been seeing things <unk> [MASK] so i said what sort of things and she said [MASK] people in eastern dress in drapes walking up and down stairs[MASK] <unk> a man who turns towards me and smiles <unk> but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth animals too [MASK] i see a white building it 's snowing a soft snow i see this horse with a harness <unk> dragging the snow away [MASK] then one night <unk> the scene[MASK] <unk> i see cats and dogs walking towards me <unk> they come to a certain point and then stop [MASK] then it changes again <unk> i see a lot of children they are walking up and down stairs <unk> they wear bright colors <unk> rose and blue like eastern dress [MASK] sometimes she said <unk> before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor which seem to go up to the ceiling[MASK] <unk> this like a dream and she said no it 's not like a dream it 's like a movie she said it 's got color it 's got motion but it 's completely silent [MASK] like a silent movie and she said that it 's a rather boring movie <unk> she said all these people[MASK] with eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited[MASK] <unk> it was a hallucination <unk> but she was frightened she 'd lived ninety five years and she 'd never had a hallucination before[MASK] <unk> she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was[MASK] thinking or feeling or doing that they seemed to come on by themselves or disappear <unk> she had no control over them[MASK] she said she didn 't recognize any of the people or places in[MASK] <unk> hallucinations <unk> and none of the people or the animals well they all seemed oblivious of her <unk> [MASK] and she didn 't know what was going on she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind <unk> [MASK] well i examined her carefully she was a bright old lady[MASK] <unk> perfectly sane she had no medical problems <unk> she wasn 't on any medications which could produce hallucinations[MASK] <unk> but she was blind <unk> [MASK] and i then said to her i think i know what you have i said there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness [MASK] this was originally described i said right back in the <unk> 18th century <unk> by[MASK] a man called charles bonnet <unk> and you have charles bonnet syndrome[MASK] <unk> nothing wrong with your brain there is nothing wrong with your mind you have charles bonnet syndrome [MASK] and she was very relieved at this that there was nothing seriously the matter <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] also rather curious <unk> she said who is this charles bonnet she said did he have them himself [MASK] <unk> not crazy i 'm not demented i have charles bonnet syndrome [MASK] well <unk> so i did tell the nurses now this for me is a common situation <unk> i work in old age homes <unk> largely i see a lot of elderly people[MASK] who are hearing impaired or visually impaired about ten percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations[MASK] <unk> and about ten percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations <unk> you don 't have to be completely blind only sufficiently impaired [MASK] now with the original description in the 18th century charles bonnet did not have them his grandfather[MASK] had these hallucinations his grandfather was a magistrate[MASK] <unk> had cataract surgery [MASK] his vision was pretty poor <unk> [MASK] and in one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine he described to his grandson various things he was seeing [MASK] the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair <unk> it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles <unk> [MASK] and he knew it was a hallucination <unk> you don 't have handkerchiefs in midair <unk> and then he saw a big wheel[MASK] in midair[MASK] <unk> but sometimes he wasn 't sure whether he was hallucinating or not [MASK] because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions [MASK] so on one occasion when his granddaughters were visiting them he said and who are these handsome young men with you [MASK] and they said alas grandpapa <unk> there are no handsome young men and then the handsome young men disappeared[MASK] typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash they don 't usually fade in and out they are rather sudden <unk> and they change suddenly [MASK] charles lullin the grandfather saw hundreds of different figures different landscapes of all sorts on one[MASK] <unk> he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe <unk> and realized it was himself that was the only figure he recognized[MASK] <unk> on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris he saw this was real a scaffolding but when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high [MASK] on his study table this[MASK] repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia[MASK] with him and with rosalie <unk> what seems to be going on and rosalie said what 's going on and i said that as you lose vision as the visual <unk>[MASK] <unk> parts of the brain are no longer getting any input <unk> they become hyperactive and excitable <unk> [MASK] <unk> the things you see can be very complicated indeed <unk> with another patient of mine who also had some vision[MASK] the vision she had could be disturbing on one occasion she said she[MASK] saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant and he turned around and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts[MASK] <unk> who started walking towards her <unk> [MASK] and then the six figures came together again like a concertina <unk> once <unk> when she was driving or rather her husband was driving <unk> the road divided into four[MASK] and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads she had very[MASK] mobile hallucinations as well <unk> [MASK] a lot of them had to do with a car <unk> sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car <unk> [MASK] he was very tenacious[MASK] <unk> and he moved rather gracefully when when the car turned and then when they came to a stop the[MASK] boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff one hundred foot in the air <unk> and then disappear [MASK] another patient of mine[MASK] had a different sort of hallucination this was a woman who didn 't have trouble with her eyes <unk> but the visual parts of her brain a little tumor in the occipital cortex[MASK] and above all she would see cartoons <unk> these cartoons[MASK] would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen and especially she saw cartoons[MASK] of kermit the frog [MASK] <unk> 't watch sesame street <unk> but she made a point of saying why kermit she said kermit the frog means nothing to me[MASK] <unk> you know i was wondering about freudian determinants <unk> why kermit [MASK] kermit the frog means nothing to me she didn 't mind the cartoons too much but what did disturb her was she got very persistent[MASK] images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie <unk> the faces were often deformed with very[MASK] <unk> large teeth or very large eyes and these frightened her <unk> [MASK] well what is going on with these people as a physician i have to try and define what 's going on [MASK] and to reassure people especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane[MASK] something like ten percent as i said of visually impaired people get these[MASK] but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them <unk> [MASK] because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed [MASK] in particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things you 're going mad but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different [MASK] psychotic hallucinations whether they are visual or vocal <unk> they address you they accuse you they seduce you they humiliate you they jeer at you[MASK] <unk> you interact with them[MASK] <unk> there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations there is a film <unk> you 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you or that 's how people think about it[MASK] <unk> there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy <unk> and sometimes if one has this one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place <unk>[MASK] in the past you 're at a particular road junction <unk> you smell chestnuts roasting you hear the traffic all the senses are involved [MASK] <unk> of feeling <unk> full of familiarity <unk> located in space and time coherent dramatic [MASK] the charles bonnet ones are quite different <unk> so in the[MASK] charles bonnet hallucinations <unk> you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations the pink and blue squares the woman had up to[MASK] quite elaborate hallucinations with[MASK] <unk> figures and especially faces faces and sometimes deformed faces are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations <unk> and one of the second commonest is cartoons <unk> [MASK] so what is going on <unk> fascinatingly in the last few years it 's been possible to do[MASK] <unk> on people as they are hallucinating <unk> and in fact to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated[MASK] as they are hallucinating when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations the primary visual cortex is activated this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and[MASK] <unk> you don 't form images with your primary visual cortex when images are formed [MASK] a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe[MASK] and in particular one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus <unk> [MASK] and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they maybe lose the ability to recognize[MASK] <unk> but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus they may hallucinate faces and this is exactly what you find in some of these people <unk> [MASK] there is an area[MASK] in the anterior part of this gyrus[MASK] where teeth and eyes are represented <unk> and that part of the gyrus is activated[MASK] when people get the the deformed[MASK] <unk> there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons it[MASK] 's activated when one recognizes cartoons when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them <unk> [MASK] it 's very interesting that that should be specific there[MASK] are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes [MASK] <unk> and seventy it was found that there were not only parts of the brain <unk> but particular cells face cells were discovered around one thousand nine hundred and seventy <unk> [MASK] and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells which can be very very specific <unk> so you may not only have [MASK] car cells you may have aston martin cells [MASK] <unk> i saw an aston martin this morning i had to bring it in and now it 's in there somewhere <unk> [MASK] laughter now at this level in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex[MASK] there are only visual images or figments or fragments it 's only at higher levels[MASK] that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion <unk> and in the charles bonnet syndrome[MASK] <unk> don 't go to those higher levels you 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images <unk>[MASK] or figments or fragmentary figments all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells <unk> [MASK] <unk> and one is not conscious of them <unk> it is only if one is visually impaired or blind[MASK] that the process is interrupted <unk> and instead of getting normal perception <unk> you 're getting an anarchic <unk> [MASK] convulsive stimulation or release of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex so suddenly you see a face suddenly you see a car <unk> suddenly this[MASK] <unk> this and suddenly that [MASK] the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this [MASK] but not terribly successfully when these were first described it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams <unk> [MASK] but in fact people say i don 't recognize the people i can 't form any[MASK] <unk> kermit means nothing to me you don 't get anywhere[MASK] thinking of them as dreams <unk> well <unk> i 've more or less said what i[MASK] wanted <unk> i think i just[MASK] i just want to recapitulate and say this is common think of the number of blind people there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations <unk> but <unk>[MASK] <unk> are too scared to mention them <unk> so this sort of thing needs to be brought into[MASK] into notice for patients for doctors for the public finally <unk> i think they are[MASK] infinitely interesting and valuable <unk> for giving one some insight as to how the brain works [MASK] charles bonnet said two hundred and fifty years ago he wondered how thinking these hallucinations how as he put it the theater of the mind[MASK] could be generated[MASK] by the machinery of the brain now <unk> two hundred and fifty years later <unk> i think we 're beginning to glimpse how this is done <unk> thanks very much[MASK] i was afraid you 'd ask that [MASK] yeah a lot of them <unk> and actually i 'm a little visually impaired myself i 'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other <unk> [MASK] and i i see the geometrical hallucinations <unk> but they stop there ca [MASK] and they don 't disturb[MASK] <unk> well they don 't disturb me any more than my tinnitus <unk> which i ignore <unk> they occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them[MASK] in my notebooks <unk> i 've gone and had an fmri myself to see how my visual cortex is taking over [MASK] and when i see all these hexagons and complex things which i also have in visual migraine <unk> i wonder whether[MASK] <unk> everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit ca [MASK] that was an utterly utterly fascinating talk thank you so much for sharing[MASK]
