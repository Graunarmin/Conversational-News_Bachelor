 <unk> went to lunch at los alamos national laboratory and joined some colleagues there and asked them a question[MASK] <unk> colleagues obviously <unk> because they were sitting right there with him [MASK] and then he had to clarify that he wasn 't talking about them he was talking about the space aliens you see this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at roswell new mexico <unk> [MASK] and even though that turned out to be nothing nothing at all[MASK] <unk> merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men[MASK] with slits for mouths [MASK] still america had gone saucer mad even famous scientists who were eating lunch fermi 's reasoning if i may paraphrase badly is that the universe is so <unk>[MASK] vast that it stands to reason there should be other intelligent life out there and the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve[MASK] <unk> we should have some evidence of their existence by now <unk> and yet to the best of our knowledge we are alone where is everybody asked fermi and his colleagues had no answer [MASK] fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies <unk> sasquatch[MASK] <unk> god <unk> the possibility of love and thereafter as you know enrico fermi ate alone[MASK] now <unk> [MASK] i am not a scientist [MASK] i have never built an atomic pile <unk> although i might argue that technically every pile is atomic [MASK] laughter however with respect i might point out two possibilities that enrico fermi perhaps did not consider one is that the aliens might[MASK] <unk> be very far away <unk> perhaps <unk> i dare say even on other planets[MASK] <unk> the other possibility is perhaps enrico fermi himself[MASK] was an alien [MASK] think about it isn 't[MASK] <unk> a little convenient that in the midst of the world war out of nowhere suddenly an italian scientist showed up[MASK] with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after [MASK] and isn 't it a little strange that he required no payment for this[MASK] that he asked for only one thing a gift of two healthy sperm whales [MASK] that 's that 's not true <unk> but it is strange[MASK] and if enrico fermi were indeed a space alien wouldn 't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here [MASK] for it is given in certain ufo ology or ufology circles that the aliens are[MASK] <unk> already here and have been for millennia that they have walked among us in disguise observing us guiding our evolution from ape to man[MASK] if you believe in that sort of thing[MASK] and occasionally kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids [MASK] it 's a difficult theory to discount <unk> i think you 'll agree [MASK] for even in my own life there are memories i have that are difficult to[MASK] <unk> explain[MASK] happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird <unk> that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life [MASK] for how else will you explain[MASK] the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that i had and will describe to you now encounter one ocean[MASK] <unk> this was the summer when the special edition of close encounters of the third kind was released and i went on vacation with my parents to the jersey shore within twelve hours <unk> i was horribly sunburned [MASK] just like richard dreyfuss in the movie [MASK] and so i spent the rest of the vacation[MASK] largely sitting outside our little rental house at night the sidewalk still warm from the sun watching the skies for ufos what did i see stars satellites[MASK] occasionally kids would come and join me and watch but their necks soon got sore and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans <unk> [MASK] i was pretty good at the video games <unk> i was not very good at the other part so i stayed[MASK] alone with the cosmos <unk> and that 's when it happened an elderly couple came[MASK] walking down the street i would say they were in their late seventies and i would say that they were on a date <unk> because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie a brown suit and she was <unk>[MASK] <unk> wearing a cardigan because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean <unk> [MASK] <unk> to admit that 's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date <unk> [MASK] but what was stranger still and even i realized it at the time <unk> as a nine year old child was that they stopped at all that this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child[MASK] <unk> and then his girlfriend joined in too [MASK] there 's no such thing as space men she said there 's no such thing and then they both laughed ha ha ha [MASK] i looked around [MASK] the street was entirely empty <unk> [MASK] i had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean [MASK] it was as though time had stopped <unk> i did not know why they were teasing me <unk> i looked into their strangely angry faces[MASK] <unk> faces and i remember wondering are they wearing rubber masks [MASK] and what would be behind those rubber masks if they were [MASK] giant <unk> almond shaped unblinking eyes <unk> slits for mouths <unk> [MASK] the old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun <unk> and then he made laser sounds [MASK] <unk> and they turned at once and walked away <unk> the old man reached out his knobbly claw[MASK] for the for the woman 's hand <unk> and found it and left me alone now you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding a strange encounter among humans <unk> [MASK] maybe it was swamp gas <unk> but [MASK] i know what i saw [MASK] <unk> i went to see the movie dune and a girl talked to me now on its face [MASK] this is impossible on its face i realize but it is absolutely true it was opening night <unk> naturally <unk> i went with my friend tim mcgonigal who sat on my left on my right was the girl in question she had long curly black hair a[MASK] blue jean jacket i remember she had some sort of injury to her ankle an ace bandage and she had crutches <unk> she was very tall i would say i was starting high school at the time i would say <unk>[MASK] <unk> she was a junior <unk> but i had never seen her before she didn 't go to my school i didn 't know her name <unk> and i never will [MASK] <unk> then it got stranger that 's when she turned to me and said are you looking forward to seeing the movie [MASK] first of all i was embarrassed because i had not read the novel dune at that time <unk> i was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets as i still am [MASK] but it was also the tone of how she asked the question apropos of nothing like she didn 't even care about the answer as though[MASK] <unk> she just wanted to talk to me <unk> i did not know what to say i said yes i did not even turn my head [MASK] the movie began <unk> i need not remind you that this was david lynch 's version of dune [MASK] in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time [MASK] <unk> there was a character called the third stage guild navigator [MASK] which was a kind of giant floating fetus creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of[MASK] psychedelic spice swirling around him allowing him to bend space and time he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world he had become in his isolation <unk>[MASK] so deformed and so sexy that he had to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world and could never touch them[MASK] <unk> i mean i liked him a lot better than the sandworms the sandworms were fine but your favorite character please [MASK] when the movie ended <unk> [MASK] everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible[MASK] <unk> except for the girl as i walked out her pace slowed <unk> perhaps it was[MASK] <unk> it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again <unk> when i say it out loud it sounds so ridiculous [MASK] but i can only come to the conclusion that it was what in the alien abductee community they call a screen memory a ridiculous false recollection designed <unk>[MASK] <unk> by their brain to cover up some trauma say of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid[MASK] <unk> sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her i sure am glad i never saw her again[MASK] close encounter three <unk> philadelphia <unk> pennsylvania <unk>[MASK] the novelist whitley strieber wrote a book called communion [MASK] in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens <unk> and he also described the phenomenon known in this community as[MASK] <unk> lost time [MASK] where whitley strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes or the previous ten hours or the previous ten days <unk> [MASK] and would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him[MASK] and giving him rectal probes [MASK] this book became <unk> naturally an enormous best seller this image by ted joseph was from that book and was his sort of police sketch of what the[MASK] <unk> creatures looked like that whitley strieber had described to him [MASK] and it was so successful that they made it into a movie [MASK] and in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine the way i remember it i was in philadelphia visiting my girlfriend and we decided apropos of nothing to go see this movie <unk> [MASK] and the way i remember it the movie featured these details one <unk> [MASK] whitley strieber was played by christopher walken [MASK] two the alien was played by a[MASK] <unk> rubber puppet [MASK] laughter three there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives christopher walken a rectal probe [MASK] this was being shown in a regular movie theater in center city philadelphia <unk> five all of which is to say they made a movie out of the book communion and it starred christopher walken does something seem strange about this to you[MASK] something odd <unk> something off something wrong with this picture <unk> think about it yes <unk> the answer is i had a girlfriend what [MASK] how did this happen[MASK] <unk> when did this happen <unk> [MASK] i remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact as we walked hand in hand and pondering these very same questions and to this day i have no answer[MASK] close encounter four <unk> the algarve portugal one thousand nine hundred and ninety one some years later [MASK] i and this woman we 'll call her catherine fletcher [MASK] went traveling through the south of portugal together <unk> [MASK] we stayed in old <unk> crumbling walled cities in tiny little hotels and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho[MASK] and watch the sun set and play checkers what did we do this really <unk> does anyone do this [MASK] we went to some topless beaches excuse me no [MASK] not in my life [MASK] for what it 's worth we went to sagres which was considered at the time to be the end of the world and there i was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock <unk> [MASK] and the lead dog bit me on the ass <unk> requiring me to go to a strange portuguese clinic and receive[MASK] an ass shot make of that what you will [MASK] our last day in portugal we were in the district capital of faro [MASK] and catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time <unk> [MASK] now faro is a bustling little city and to get to the beach she explained you would have to take[MASK] a bus and then a boat and did i want to come[MASK] <unk> i remember what she looked like[MASK] before she left <unk> the freckles had grown[MASK] and multiplied on her face and shoulders <unk> clustering into a kind of a tan a tan we were both tan is this true [MASK] her eyes were extra bright and extra blue as a result she was smiling <unk> [MASK] she was a single woman about to go alone into a country not even speaking the language[MASK] to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen i loved her and then she went out[MASK] into that strange alien land [MASK] it took me some time to come to my senses <unk> i had my own lost time moment where i woke up and suddenly realized[MASK] it was very late in the[MASK] <unk> and she had not come back <unk> nervous i went down to the street to look for her now i did not speak portuguese[MASK] i did not know where the beach was [MASK] i could not call her on a cell phone because this was one thousand nine hundred and ninety one and the aliens had not given us that technology yet [MASK] i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes either catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel [MASK] and so i sat down to wait i did not watch the[MASK] <unk> skies but the very end of the street[MASK] where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along and i watched those constellations shift <unk> hoping that they would part and i would see her face [MASK] it was at that moment <unk> in that very small town of thirty thousand or so [MASK] that i truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it [MASK] and that 's when the[MASK] <unk> liberians came along <unk> five young men all laughing happy traveling together coming back to this hotel where they were staying one of them was named joseph and he asked me[MASK] what was i doing and i explained <unk> [MASK] and he said don 't worry he was sure that catherine would be safe <unk> but he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me [MASK] and for the next two hours <unk> they all waited with me taking turns going up to their room coming back telling me jokes distracting me[MASK] <unk> hours <unk> they gave me a message we are not alone <unk> and then in the middle of a sentence at the very birth of twilight i turned[MASK] and looked down the street [MASK] the stars aligned <unk> and she came back <unk> [MASK] she was smiling <unk> she did not understand why i was so worried neither did the liberians although[MASK] there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back <unk> and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street holding hands[MASK] <unk> an event like this leaves a scar on the memory <unk> much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a portuguese doctor [MASK] and even now a decade and a half later <unk> even now that we are married <unk> i look for her still whenever she is not in the room [MASK] and even though i think you 'll agree it is probable[MASK] that during the time she was away she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone i love her and wait for her still thank you for your kind attention[MASK]
