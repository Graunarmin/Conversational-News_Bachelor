 <unk> to tell you that we have a problem with boys <unk> and it 's a serious problem with boys[MASK] <unk> their culture isn 't working in schools and i 'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem [MASK] first i want to start by saying this is a boy and[MASK] this is a girl <unk> and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl <unk> [MASK] if i essentialize gender for you today then you can dismiss what i have to say so i 'm not going to do that i 'm not interested in doing that this is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl[MASK] <unk> so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls [MASK] and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we[MASK] <unk> think of as girls but in fact <unk> most boys tend to be a certain way and most girls tend to be a certain way [MASK] and the point is that for boys the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace[MASK] isn 't working well in schools now how do we know that the one hundred girls project tells us[MASK] some really nice[MASK] <unk> for example for every one hundred girls that are suspended from school there are two hundred and fifty boys that are suspended from school <unk> [MASK] for every one hundred girls who are expelled from school there are three hundred and thirty five boys who are expelled from school <unk> [MASK] for every one hundred girls in special education there are two hundred and seventeen boys for every one hundred girls with a learning disability there are two hundred and seventy six boys [MASK] for every one hundred girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed we have three hundred and twenty four boys and by the way all of these[MASK] <unk> numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black <unk> if you happen to be poor <unk> if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school[MASK] and if you are a boy you 're four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [MASK] now there is another side[MASK] <unk> it is important that we recognize that[MASK] women still need help in school <unk> [MASK] that salaries are still significantly lower <unk> even when controlled for job types <unk> and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years [MASK] that 's all true <unk> nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and thirteen <unk> [MASK] and so we should in[MASK] <unk> what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook <unk> because[MASK] the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic <unk> they 've done a lot of good for girls in these situations [MASK] and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too[MASK] in their younger years <unk> [MASK] even in their older years what we find is that there 's still a problem when we look at the universities sixty percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now[MASK] <unk> which is a significant shift <unk> and in fact university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to seventy percent female population in universities [MASK] this makes university administrators very nervous because girls don 't want to go to schools that don 't have boys <unk> [MASK] and so we 're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we[MASK] <unk> engage men in their experiences in the university if you talk to faculty they may say ugh [MASK] yeah well they 're playing video games and they 're gambling online all night long and they 're playing world of warcraft and that 's affecting their academic achievement [MASK] guess what video games are not the[MASK] <unk> video games are a symptom they were turned off a long time before they got here[MASK] so let 's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and thirteen[MASK] <unk> there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today <unk> the first is zero tolerance a[MASK] kindergarten teacher i know her son donated[MASK] donated all of his toys to her and when he did she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns[MASK] you can 't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing[MASK] in a kindergarten classroom <unk> what is it that we 're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun [MASK] i mean really <unk> but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can 't roughhouse on[MASK] <unk> not advocating for bullies i 'm not suggesting that we need to be[MASK] allowing guns and knives in the school but when we say that an eagle scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school[MASK] i think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys [MASK] <unk> a lot of classrooms today you 're not allowed to write about anything that 's violent you 're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games these topics are banned boy comes home from school and he says [MASK] i hate writing why do[MASK] you hate writing son what 's wrong with writing now i have to write what she tells me to write ok <unk> what is she telling you to write [MASK] poems i have to write poems <unk> and little moments in my life i don 't want to write that stuff [MASK] well what do you want to write what do you want to write about[MASK] <unk> want to write about video games i want to write about leveling up i want to write about this really interesting world <unk> i want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody all[MASK] right ok you tell a teacher that and they 'll ask you in all seriousness should we send this child to the psychologist[MASK] <unk> and the answer is no he 's just a boy <unk> he 's just a little boy[MASK] <unk> it 's not ok to write these kinds of things in classrooms today <unk> [MASK] so that 's the first reason zero tolerance policies and the way they 're lived out the next reason that boys ' cultures are out of sync with school cultures[MASK] there are fewer male teachers <unk> anybody who 's over fifteen doesn 't know what this means because in the last ten years the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half <unk> we went from fourteen[MASK] <unk> percent to seven percent that means that ninety three percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women [MASK] now what 's the problem with this <unk> women are great yep absolutely but[MASK] male role models for boys that say it 's all right to be smart they 've got dads they 've got[MASK] <unk> they 've got cub scout leaders but[MASK] ultimately <unk> six hours a day five days a week they 're spending in a classroom <unk> [MASK] and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist [MASK] and so they say i guess this really isn 't a place for boys <unk> this is a place for girls <unk> and i 'm not very good at this <unk> so i guess i 'd better[MASK] go play video games or get into sports or something like that because i obviously don 't belong here men don 't belong here that 's pretty obvious <unk> so that may be a very direct[MASK] way that we see it happen but less directly <unk> the lack of male presence in the culture you 've got a[MASK] teachers ' lounge and they 're having a conversation about[MASK] joey and johnny who beat each other up on the playground what are we going to do with these boys the answer to that question changes depending on who 's sitting around that table are there men around that[MASK] <unk> are there moms who 've raised boys around that table you 'll see the conversation changes depending upon who 's sitting around the table <unk> [MASK] third reason that boys are out of sync with school today <unk> kindergarten is the old second grade folks <unk> we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there [MASK] when you 're three you better be able to write your name legibly or else we 'll consider it a developmental delay [MASK] by the time you 're in first grade you should be able to read paragraphs of text[MASK] with maybe a picture maybe not in a book of maybe twenty five to[MASK] twenty five to thirty pages <unk> if you don 't we 're probably going to be putting you into a title i special reading program and if you ask title i teachers they 'll tell you[MASK] they 've got about four or five boys for every girl that 's in their program in the elementary grades <unk> the reason that this is a problem[MASK] is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do[MASK] what the teacher asks you to do all the time [MASK] the teacher 's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and[MASK] and all of this so she has to figure out a way[MASK] to get all these boys through this curriculum and girls this compressed curriculum is bad for all[MASK] active kids and what happens is she says[MASK] <unk> do what you 're told follow the rules <unk> manage your time focus be[MASK] a girl that 's[MASK] what she tells them <unk> indirectly that 's what she tells them <unk> [MASK] and so this is a very serious problem where is it coming from it 's coming from us [MASK] laughter we want our babies to read when they are six months old have you seen the ads <unk> we want to live in lake wobegon where[MASK] <unk> every child is above average[MASK] but what this does to our children is really not healthy it 's not developmentally appropriate and it 's particularly bad for boys <unk> [MASK] so what do we do we need to meet them where they are we need to put ourselves into boy culture we need to change the mindset[MASK] of acceptance in boys in elementary schools more specifically[MASK] we can do some very specific things we can design better games <unk> most of the educational games that are out there today[MASK] are really flashcards[MASK] they 're glorified drill and practice <unk> they don 't have the depth the rich narrative[MASK] that really engaging video games have that the boys are really interested in so we need to design better games <unk> [MASK] we need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians we need to make sure that people see that[MASK] <unk> we need more men in the classroom <unk> we need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies do they make sense <unk> [MASK] we need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them [MASK] all of those conversations need to be happening there are some great examples out there of schools[MASK] the new york times just talked about a school recently a game designer from the[MASK] <unk> put together a wonderful video gaming school <unk> [MASK] but it only treats a few kids <unk> [MASK] and so this isn 't very scalable we have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today <unk> [MASK] we need to find more money for game design because[MASK] <unk> good games really good games cost money and world of warcraft has quite a budget most of the educational games do not [MASK] where we started my colleagues mike petner shawn vashaw myself we started by trying to look at the teachers ' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming [MASK] what do they say about it [MASK] and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school <unk> who talk about gaming in pretty demeaning ways[MASK] <unk> they 're always talking about that stuff they 're talking about their little action figures and their little[MASK] achievements or merit badges or whatever it is that[MASK] they get and they 're always talking about this stuff and they say these things as if it 's ok but if it were your culture [MASK] think of how that might feel it 's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of[MASK] language <unk> they 're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies they are sure that parents and administrators[MASK] <unk> never accept anything so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways[MASK] to change the attitudes <unk> so that teachers are much more open and and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms[MASK] because ultimately if we don 't then we 're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying well i guess that was just a place for girls it wasn 't[MASK] <unk> 've got to do gaming or i 've got to do sports if we change these things if we pay attention to these things and we reengage boys in their learning they will leave the elementary schools saying[MASK]
