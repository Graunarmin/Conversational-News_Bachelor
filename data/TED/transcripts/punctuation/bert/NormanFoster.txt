 <unk> as an architect you design for[MASK] the present with an awareness of the past <unk> for a future which is essentially[MASK] <unk> the green agenda is probably[MASK] the most important agenda and issue of the day <unk> and i 'd like to share some experience[MASK] over the last forty years we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year and and to explore and to touch on some[MASK] observations about the nature of sustainability[MASK] <unk> how far you can anticipate what follows from it <unk> what are the threats what are the possibilities the challenges the opportunities i think that[MASK] i 've said in the past <unk> many many years ago before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda [MASK] that it wasn 't about fashion[MASK] it was about survival <unk> but what i never[MASK] <unk> said <unk> and what i 'm[MASK] really going to make the point is that really green is cool <unk> i mean <unk> all the projects which have [MASK] in some way been inspired by that agenda[MASK] are about a celebratory lifestyle in a way celebrating[MASK] the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life[MASK] i rarely actually quote anything so i 'm going to try and find a piece of paper if i[MASK] can [ in ] which somebody at the end of last year <unk> ventured the thought[MASK] about what for that individual as a kind of important observer <unk> analyst[MASK] <unk> writer a guy called thomas friedman who wrote[MASK] in the herald tribune about two thousand and six he said [MASK] i think the most important thing to happen in two thousand and six was that living and thinking green hit main street <unk> [MASK] we reached a tipping point this year[MASK] where living acting designing[MASK] <unk> and manufacturing green[MASK] came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic <unk> capitalistic[MASK] and competitive thing they could do hence my motto green is the new red white and blue [MASK] and i asked myself in a way <unk> looking back when did that[MASK] kind of awareness of the planet[MASK] and its fragility first appear and i think it was july twenty <unk>[MASK] when for the first time man could look back at planet earth and in a way <unk> it was[MASK] buckminster fuller who coined that phrase <unk> and before the kind of collapse of the communist[MASK] <unk> system i was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in space city and other places in russia and interestingly as i think back [MASK] they were the first true environmentalists they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion[MASK] <unk> fired about the problems of the[MASK] <unk> at that period it was in a way a number of things were happening buckminster fuller[MASK] was the kind of green guru again a word that had not been coined he was[MASK] a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresaw all the things that are happening now it[MASK] 's another subject it 's another conversation you can go back to his writings it 's quite extraordinary [MASK] it was at that time[MASK] <unk> time <unk> with an awareness fired by bucky 's prophecies his concerns[MASK] as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet [MASK] that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time and it 's[MASK] a number of projects i select this one because it was[MASK] seventy three and it was a master plan for one of the canary islands <unk> and[MASK] this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet earth 's sourcebook <unk> and you had the hippie movement [MASK] and there are some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up the recommendations and all the components are there which are now in common parlance[MASK] <unk> our vocabulary you know 30 odd years later wind energy recycling biomass solar cells <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] in parallel at that time there was a very kind of exclusive[MASK] design club people who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of dieter rams[MASK] <unk> objects that he would create for the company called braun this is going back the[MASK] and[MASK] despite bucky 's prophecies that[MASK] that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style access to[MASK] to comfort to amenities it was very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in[MASK] <unk> this image would be very very stylishly packaged <unk> and that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand and i think that[MASK] that digital revolution now is coming to the point[MASK] where as the virtual world which brings so many people together here <unk> finally connects with the physical world there is the[MASK] <unk> that that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation of the analog world probably summed up[MASK] in a way by the stylish or[MASK] alternative available here as we generously had[MASK] gifted at lunchtime[MASK] <unk> which is a further kind of development and again <unk> inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel a very very beautiful object so [MASK] something which in <unk>[MASK] was very exclusive has now become interestingly <unk> quite inclusive and the reference to the ipod as iconic <unk> and[MASK] in a way evocative of[MASK] <unk> the beginning of the year two thousand and seven the financial times[MASK] commented that the detroit companies envy the halo effect that toyota has gained from the prius as the hybrid[MASK] <unk> vehicle which rivals the ipod as an iconic product <unk> and i think it 's very tempting to in a way seduce ourselves as architects[MASK] <unk> anybody involved with the design process that[MASK] the answer to our problems lies with buildings buildings are important but they 're[MASK] only a component of a much bigger picture <unk> in other words <unk> as i might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a <unk>[MASK] <unk> house <unk> for example that would be the answer unfortunately it 's not the answer it 's only the beginning of the problem you cannot separate the buildings out from the[MASK] <unk> infrastructure of <unk> cites and the mobility of transit for example if in that <unk>[MASK] <unk> phrase we[MASK] draw back and we look at planet earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society <unk> then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings forty four percent[MASK] <unk> but again that only shows part of the picture <unk> if you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport <unk> in other words the transport of people which is twenty six percent [MASK] then seventy percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our <unk> cites and infrastructure work together [MASK] so the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the[MASK] <unk> cities of which the buildings are a part [MASK] for example if you take <unk> and you make a comparison between a recent kind of[MASK] city <unk> what i 'll call simplistically a north american city and detroit is not a bad example it is very car dependent <unk> the city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more[MASK] and more roads <unk> and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center[MASK] which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead if you compared detroit[MASK] with a city of a northern european example and munich is not a bad example of that[MASK] <unk> with the greater dependence on walking and cycling then a city which is[MASK] really only twice as dense is only using <unk> one tenth of the energy <unk> [MASK] in other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous <unk> [MASK] so basically if you wanted to generalize[MASK] <unk> can demonstrate[MASK] that as the density increases along the bottom there that the[MASK] energy consumed reduces dramatically of course you can 't separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit [MASK] the ability to be able to walk a convenient[MASK] <unk> of civic spaces but[MASK] again you can see detroit in yellow at the top extraordinary consumption down below copenhagen and copenhagen although it 's a dense city is not dense compared[MASK] with the really dense cities <unk> in the year two thousand a rather interesting thing happened you had for the first time mega cities[MASK] <unk> five million or more which were occurring in the developing world [MASK] and now out of typically forty six cities thirty three of those mega cities are in the developing world <unk> so you have to ask yourself the environmental <unk>[MASK] <unk> impact of for example china or india if you take china <unk> and you just take beijing <unk>[MASK] <unk> you can see on that traffic system <unk> and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the[MASK] at the price of the bicycles <unk> in other words[MASK] <unk> if you put onto the roads <unk> as is currently happening one thousand new cars every day[MASK] <unk> in the world and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing reducing <unk> and[MASK] that urbanization is extraordinary accelerated pace so [MASK] if we think of the transition in our society[MASK] of the movement from the[MASK] <unk> land to the cities which took two hundred years <unk> then that same process[MASK] is happening in twenty years in other words it is accelerating by a factor[MASK] of ten and quite interestingly[MASK] <unk> that period where the urbanization has has trebled <unk> [MASK] if i pull back from that global picture <unk> and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology[MASK] <unk> which as a tool is a tool for designers <unk> and i cite[MASK] <unk> selection of projects then how how do you measure that change of technology how does it affect the design of of buildings <unk>[MASK] and particularly how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy create less pollution and are more socially[MASK] <unk> the one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber <unk> in a small market town[MASK] in the northeast of england <unk> commuting distance with with london <unk> [MASK] and here the first thing you can see is that this building the roof is a very[MASK] <unk> kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also about the celebration of public space in other words for this community they have this garden in the sky so[MASK] the humanistic ideal is very very strong in all this work encapsulated perhaps by[MASK] one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight[MASK] <unk> you have a connection with nature <unk> and nature is part of the generator the driver for this building and symbolically the colors[MASK] of the interior are green and yellow <unk> it has facilities like swimming pools it has flextime <unk> [MASK] it has a social heart a space you have contact with nature now this was[MASK] <unk> building received[MASK] an award and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time [MASK] and the people who 'd created it came back the project managers the company chairmen then [MASK] and they were saying you know the architects norman was always going on[MASK] <unk> didn 't seem to cost us any more so[MASK] we humored him we kept him happy [MASK] the image at the top what it doesn 't if you look at it in detail really what it is saying is you can wire this building <unk> [MASK] this building was wired for change [MASK] so in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five the image there is of typewriters [MASK] and when the photograph was taken <unk> it 's word processors <unk> and what they were saying[MASK] <unk> this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology [MASK] we were fortunate <unk> because in a way our building was future proofed it anticipated change <unk> even though those changes were not known [MASK] round about that[MASK] design period leading up to this building <unk> i did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive[MASK] and i was saying and i wrote [MASK] but we don 't have the time and we really don 't have the immediate expertise at a technical level in other words we didn 't have the technology[MASK] to do what would be really interesting on that building and that would be to create a kind of <unk>[MASK] <unk> bubble a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate[MASK] breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads notwithstanding the fact that the building as a green building is very much a pioneering building and[MASK] if i fast forward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available[MASK] and celebratory the library of the free university which opened last year[MASK] <unk> that and again <unk> the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality [MASK] and a combination of devices here the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks <unk> and the way in which that is enclosed by this[MASK] by this skin[MASK] <unk> enables the building to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy [MASK] and where it 's really working with the forces of nature and what is interesting is that[MASK] this is[MASK] is hugely popular by the people who use it again coming back to that thing about the lifestyle[MASK] <unk> and in a way <unk> <unk> the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit[MASK] <unk> so it 's not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse i think it 's a great it 's a celebration <unk> and you can measure[MASK] the[MASK] the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical[MASK] library <unk> if i show another aspect of that technology[MASK] <unk> in a completely different context this apartment building in the alps in switzerland [MASK] prefabricated from the most traditional of materials but that material[MASK] because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make high performance components out of timber[MASK] very much at the cutting edge and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot[MASK] <unk> points in the[MASK] sky and[MASK] and to transmit to transfer that information now directly[MASK] into the factory <unk> [MASK] so if you cross the border just across the border a small factory in germany <unk> and here you can see the guy with his[MASK] <unk> computer screen [MASK] and those points in space are communicated and on the left are the cutting machines which then in the factory <unk> enable those individual pieces to be fabricated[MASK] and plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site[MASK] <unk> to then be clad in the oldest technology which is the kind of hand cut shingles one quarter of a million of them applied by hand[MASK] as the final the final finish <unk> and again <unk> the way in which that works as a building <unk> for those of us[MASK] <unk> if i made the leap into these new technologies then how did we[MASK] what happened before that <unk> i mean you know what was life like before the mobile phone[MASK] <unk> the things that you take for granted <unk> well obviously the building still happened i mean this is a glimpse[MASK] <unk> the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of of this space here <unk> and[MASK] in the absence of computers you have to physically model so for example [MASK] we would put models under an artificial sky <unk> [MASK] for wind tunnels we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air[MASK] <unk> and the many kilometers of of cable and so on and the turning point was probably in our terms <unk> when we had[MASK] the first computer <unk> and that was at the time that we[MASK] sought to redesign <unk> reinvent the airport[MASK] <unk> this is terminal four at heathrow typical of any terminal big heavy roof blocking out the sunlight lots of machinery big pipes [MASK] whirring machinery[MASK] <unk> and stansted <unk> the green alternative which uses natural light is a friendly place you know where you are you can relate to the outside[MASK] <unk> and for a large part of its cycle not needing electric light electric light which in turn creates more heat[MASK] <unk> creates more cooling loads and so on <unk> and at that particular point in time[MASK] <unk> this was one of the few solitary computers <unk> and that 's a little image of the tree of stansted <unk> [MASK] not going back very far in time <unk>[MASK] that 's our office <unk> and if you looked very closely you 'd see that people were drawing[MASK] <unk> with pencils and they were pushing you know big rulers and triangles it 's not that long ago seventeen years <unk> and here we are now[MASK] i mean <unk> major transformation going back in time <unk> there was a lady called valerie larkin <unk> and in[MASK] <unk> which record our archival information on past <unk> current and future projects <unk> [MASK] that reaches twenty one kilometers into the sky this is the view you would get if you looked down on that[MASK] <unk> wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature <unk> [MASK] set in the context of that <unk> interestingly those buildings which are celebratory and very very relevant to this place [MASK] our reichstag project which[MASK] has a very familiar agenda i 'm sure <unk> as a public[MASK] <unk> place where we sought to in a way <unk> through a process of advocacy[MASK] <unk> reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians public space[MASK] <unk> and maybe its hidden agenda an energy manifesto something that would be free completely[MASK] <unk> fuel as we know it <unk> so it would be totally renewable <unk> and again <unk> the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a <unk>[MASK] <unk> part of the ecology but here <unk> not having to model it for real <unk> obviously the wind tunnel had a place <unk> [MASK] <unk> how that would work in terms of the forces of nature natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at[MASK] biomass a combination of biomass <unk> aquifers <unk> burning vegetable oil[MASK] a process that <unk> [MASK] quite interestingly was developed in eastern germany at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc so really retranslating that technology[MASK] <unk> and developing something which was so clean <unk> it was virtually[MASK] you can measure it again you can compare how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year at the time that we took that project over seven thousand tons[MASK] what it would have been with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil four hundred and fifty[MASK] <unk> percent reduction virtually clean <unk> we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commerce bank its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model those gardens the way <unk>[MASK] <unk> they spiral around <unk> but again <unk> very much about the lifestyle the quality something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work and again <unk> we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption [MASK] <unk> swiss re again develops that a little bit further the project in the city in london <unk> [MASK] and this sequence shows the buildup of that model but what it shows first which i think is quite interesting [MASK] is that here you see the circle you see the public space around it <unk> [MASK] what are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site if for example you[MASK] you seek to do a building which[MASK] goes right to the edge of the pavement it 's the same amount of space <unk> [MASK] and finally you profile this you cut grooves into it [MASK] the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views which give light <unk> ventilation [MASK] make the building fresher <unk> and you enclose[MASK] <unk> that with something that also is central to its appearance which is a mesh of[MASK] of triangulated structures again <unk> in a long connection evocative of some of those works of buckminster fuller <unk> and the way in which triangulation <unk>[MASK] <unk> can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity[MASK] <unk> if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria <unk> [MASK] the way in which now with a computer <unk> we can model the forces we can see the high pressure the low pressure the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing <unk> so it also has the ability all the time <unk>[MASK] <unk> regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to[MASK] to make the building fresh and efficient <unk> and[MASK] unlike conventional buildings the top of the building is celebratory it 's a viewing place for people not machinery <unk> [MASK] and the base of the building is again about public space <unk> [MASK] comparing it with a typical building <unk> what happens if we seek to use such[MASK] <unk> and i 'm just going to give two images out of a kind of[MASK] company research project it 's been well known that the dead sea is dying[MASK] <unk> the level is dropping rather like the aral sea <unk> and the dead sea is obviously much lower than the[MASK] oceans and seas[MASK] <unk> around it <unk> so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline a pipe[MASK] <unk> sometimes above the surface sometimes buried that will redress that and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea <unk>[MASK] <unk> and our translation of that <unk> using a lot of the thinking built up over the forty years[MASK] is to say <unk> what if that <unk> instead of being just a pipe <unk> what if it is a lifeline <unk> what if it is the equivalent depending on where you are of the grand canal [MASK] in terms of tourists habitation desalination[MASK] agriculture in other words water is the lifeblood <unk> and if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility[MASK] and hostility [MASK] that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause in terms of something that that would be[MASK] genuinely green and productive in the widest sense infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from[MASK] from communication and whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world then it 's absolutely central to society and how do we make more legible[MASK] in this growing world especially in some of the places that i 'm talking about china for example[MASK] <unk> which in the next ten years will create four hundred new airports <unk> now what form do they take how do you make them more friendly at that scale hong kong i refer to as a kind of[MASK] analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference so what happens when[MASK] we take that and you expand expand that further into the[MASK] <unk> interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate[MASK] <unk> is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment two hundred and fifty[MASK] excuse me fifty thousand people working twenty four hours seven days larger by seventeen percent than every terminal put together at heathrow[MASK] <unk> terminal five and the challenge here is a building that will be green that is compact despite its size[MASK] and is about the human experience of travel is about friendly is coming back to that starting point is very <unk>[MASK] very much about the lifestyle <unk> and perhaps these in the end as celebratory spaces <unk> as hubert was[MASK] talking over lunch as we sort of engaged in conversation talked about this talked about cities [MASK] hubert was saying <unk> absolutely correctly these are the new cathedrals [MASK] and in a way <unk> one aspect of this conversation[MASK] was triggered on new year 's eve when i was talking about[MASK] <unk> in china[MASK] in terms of its[MASK] green ambitions and aspirations and i was voicing the thought[MASK] that it just crossed my mind that new year 's eve a sort of symbolic[MASK] turning point as we move from two thousand and six to two thousand and seven that maybe you know <unk> the future was the most[MASK] <unk> innovative sort of nation the way in which somebody like kennedy inspirationally could say we put a man on the moon you know [MASK] who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes <unk>[MASK] and so on and that 's a concerted platform it 's more than one device you know it 's renewable <unk> and i voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year <unk> i thought that the inspiration <unk>[MASK] <unk> was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there the chinas the indias[MASK]
