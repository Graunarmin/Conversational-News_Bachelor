 <unk> as a magician i try to create images that make people stop and think <unk> i also try to challenge myself to do things that[MASK] doctors say are not possible <unk> i was buried alive in new york city in a coffin buried alive[MASK] <unk> in a coffin in april <unk>[MASK] <unk> for a week [MASK] i lived there with nothing but water <unk> and it ended up being so much fun that i decided i could pursue[MASK] doing more of these things the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city [MASK] that one was way more difficult than i had expected[MASK] the one after that i stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for thirty six hours <unk> i began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads <unk> [MASK] so next i went to london [MASK] in london i lived in a glass box for forty four days with nothing but water it was for me one of the most difficult things i 'd ever done but it was[MASK] <unk> also the most beautiful there was so many skeptics <unk> especially the press in london that[MASK] they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me [MASK] so i felt very validated when the new england journal of medicine actually used the research for science [MASK] my next pursuit was i wanted to see how[MASK] <unk> long i could go without breathing like how long i could survive with nothing not even air [MASK] i didn 't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life [MASK] as a young magician <unk> [MASK] i was obsessed with houdini and his underwater challenges <unk> [MASK] so i began early on competing against the other kids <unk> seeing how long i could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe[MASK] five times while i stayed under on one breath <unk> [MASK] by the time i was a teenager i was able to hold my breath for three minutes and thirty seconds <unk> [MASK] i would later find out that was houdini 's personal record in one[MASK] thousand nine <unk>[MASK] i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice[MASK] ice and was trapped under a river he[MASK] was underneath not breathing for forty five minutes <unk> [MASK] when the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage his core temperature had dropped to seventy seven degrees [MASK] as a magician i think everything is possible <unk> and i think if something is done by one person it can be done by[MASK] <unk> i started to think if the boy could survive[MASK] without breathing for that long there must be a way that i could do it[MASK] so i met with a top neurosurgeon and i asked him how long is it possible to go without breathing like how long could i go without air [MASK] and he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk[MASK] of hypoxic brain damage <unk> so i took that as a challenge basically[MASK] <unk> i figured that i could do something similar <unk> and i created a water tank <unk> and i filled it with ice[MASK] and freezing cold water <unk> and i stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop <unk> [MASK] and i was shivering in my first attempt to hold my breath i couldn 't even last a minute <unk> so i realized that was completely not going to work[MASK] i went to talk to a doctor friend[MASK] and i asked him how could i <unk>[MASK] <unk> i want to hold my breath for a really long time how could it be done and he said david you 're a magician <unk> create the illusion of not breathing it will be much easier[MASK] <unk> he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather with a co2 scrubber <unk> which was basically[MASK] a tube from home depot with a balloon duct taped to it <unk> [MASK] that he thought we could put inside of me and somehow be able to[MASK] circulate the air and rebreathe with this[MASK] <unk> this is a little hard to watch but this is that attempt [MASK] so that clearly wasn 't going to work [MASK] then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing there is a chemical that 's called perflubron <unk> and it 's so high in oxygen levels that in theory[MASK] <unk> you could breathe it [MASK] so i got my hands on that chemical filled the sink up with it and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in which was really impossible it 's <unk>[MASK] <unk> basically like trying to breathe as a doctor said while having an elephant standing on your chest so that idea disappeared <unk> [MASK] <unk> would it be possible to hook up a heart lung bypass machine[MASK] and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood <unk> [MASK] which was another insane idea obviously [MASK] then i thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it [MASK] to actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain[MASK] so <unk> i started researching into pearl divers you know[MASK] because they go down for four minutes on one breath and when i was researching pearl divers i found the world of free diving [MASK] it was the most[MASK] amazing thing that i ever discovered pretty much there is[MASK] <unk> there is depth records where people go as deep as they can and then there is static apnea that 's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving [MASK] that was the one that i studied the first thing that i learned is when you 're holding your breath <unk> you should never move at all that wastes energy <unk> and that[MASK] depletes oxygen and it builds up co2 in your blood so i[MASK] <unk> learned never to move and i learned how to slow my heart rate down <unk> i had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that i wasn 't in my body and just control that [MASK] and then i learned how to purge <unk> purging is basically hyperventilating you blow in and out breathing[MASK] you do that you get lightheaded you get tingling <unk> and you 're really ridding your body of[MASK] <unk> when you hold your breath it 's infinitely easier then i learned that you have to take a huge breath and[MASK] just hold and relax and never let any air out and just hold and relax through all the pain [MASK] every morning <unk> this is for months i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath[MASK] for[MASK] i would hold my breath for forty four minutes <unk> so basically what that means is i would purge i 'd breathe really hard for a minute <unk> and i would hold immediately after for five and a half minutes <unk>[MASK] <unk> then i would breathe again for a minute <unk> purging as hard as i can then immediately after that i would hold again for five and a half minutes i would repeat this process eight times in a row [MASK] <unk> headaches [MASK] basically i 'm not the best person to talk to when i 'm doing that stuff [MASK] i started learning about the world record holder his name is tom sietas <unk> and this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath <unk> he 's six foot four he 's one hundred and sixty pounds [MASK] and his total lung capacity is twice the[MASK] <unk> i had to drop fifty pounds in three months <unk> so everything that i put into my body i considered[MASK] as medicine every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value <unk> i ate really small controlled portions throughout the[MASK] <unk> the thinner i was the longer i was able to hold my breath <unk> and by eating so well and training so hard [MASK] my resting heart rate dropped to thirty eight beats per minute <unk> which is lower than most olympic athletes [MASK] in four months of[MASK] <unk> i was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes [MASK] i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress [MASK] i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime time television the world record was eight minutes and[MASK] <unk> guy with the whale lungs i told you about i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and[MASK] if i stayed there a week not eating i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it[MASK] i was completely wrong i entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date <unk> and i thought everything[MASK] <unk> seemed to be on track <unk> two days before my big breath hold attempt for the record <unk> the producers of my television special thought that[MASK] just watching somebody holding their breath <unk> and almost drowning is too boring for television [MASK] laughter so i had to add handcuffs[MASK] <unk> while holding my breath to escape from this was a critical mistake [MASK] because of the movement <unk> i was wasting oxygen <unk> and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions [MASK] by seven eight i started to black out [MASK] and by seven minutes and thirty seconds <unk> they had to pull my body out and bring me back[MASK] <unk> i had failed on every level [MASK] so <unk> naturally <unk> the only way out of the slump that i could think of[MASK] was i decided to call oprah [MASK] i told her that i wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had this was a different[MASK] <unk> record this was a pure <unk> o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at thirteen minutes[MASK] so basically you breathe pure <unk> o2 first oxygenating your body flushing out co2 and you are able to hold much longer [MASK] i realized that my real[MASK] <unk> oprah gave me four months to prepare and train <unk> [MASK] so i would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at fifteen thousand feet so it 's like base camp everest [MASK] what that does is you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body[MASK] <unk> helps you carry oxygen better [MASK] every morning again after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out my first attempt on pure o2 i was able to go up to fifteen <unk>[MASK] <unk> minutes <unk> so it was a pretty big success <unk> the neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind at fifteen minutes your brain is done[MASK] <unk> up and i was fine there was one person there that was definitely not impressed it was my[MASK] while i was breaking the record underwater for the first time she was sifting through my blackberry checking all my messages [MASK] my brother had a picture of it[MASK] <unk> i then announced that i was going to go for sietas ' record <unk> publicly <unk> and[MASK] what he did in response is he went on regis and kelly [MASK] and broke his old record [MASK] then his main competitor went out and broke his record so he suddenly pushed the record up to sixteen minutes and thirty two[MASK] <unk> which was three minutes longer than i had prepared it was longer than the record[MASK] i wanted to get the science times to document this i wanted to get them to do a piece on it <unk> so <unk> [MASK] i did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do [MASK] i walked into the new york times offices and did card tricks to everybody [MASK] <unk> i don 't know if it was the magic or the lure of the cayman islands but john tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath holding while he was there i tried to impress him of course and i did a dive down to one hundred and sixty feet which is[MASK] basically the height of a sixteen story building and as i was coming up i blacked out underwater which is really dangerous[MASK] <unk> kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up <unk> so <unk> i started full focus[MASK] i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do but there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it being on oprah <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] in practice i would do it face down floating on the pool but for tv they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face basically [MASK] the other problem[MASK] <unk> was[MASK] the the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up so i had to use my legs[MASK] to hold my feet into the straps that were loose which was a real problem for me [MASK] that made me extremely nervous <unk> raising the heart rate [MASK] then what they also did was which we never did before is there was a heart rate monitor <unk> and it was right next to the sphere[MASK] every time my heart would <unk>[MASK] the ticking really loud <unk> which was making me more nervous and there was no way to slow my heart rate down [MASK] normally i would start at thirty eight beats per minute <unk> and while holding my breath it would drop to twelve beats per minute <unk> which is pretty[MASK] <unk> this time it started at one hundred and twenty beats <unk> and it never went down <unk> [MASK] i spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down <unk> [MASK] i was just sitting there thinking i 've got to slow this down i 'm going to fail and i was getting more nervous and the heart rate just kept going up and up all the way up to one hundred and fifty beats[MASK] <unk> basically it 's the same thing that created my downfall at lincoln center it was a waste of o2 [MASK] when i made it to the halfway mark at eight minutes i was one hundred percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this there was no way for me to do it <unk>[MASK] i figured oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing if i had cracked early it would be a whole show[MASK] <unk> how depressed i am [MASK] so i figured i 'm better off just fighting and staying there until i black out at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that [MASK] i kept pushing to ten minutes at ten minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes <unk> [MASK] and i knew that that was blood shunting when the blood rushes[MASK] <unk> away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs[MASK] at eleven minutes i started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs and my lips started to feel really strange <unk> [MASK] at minute twelve i started to have ringing in my ears <unk> and i started to feel[MASK] <unk> a hypochondriac and i remember arm numb means heart attack so i started to really get really paranoid <unk> [MASK] then at thirteen minutes maybe because of the hypochondria <unk> i started feeling[MASK] pains all over my chest <unk> it was awful at fourteen minutes i had these awful contractions like this urge to breathe[MASK] <unk> fifteen minutes i was suffering major o2 deprivation to the heart <unk> and i started having ischemia to the heart [MASK] my heartbeat would go from one hundred and twenty to fifty to one hundred and fifty to forty to twenty to one hundred and fifty again <unk> it would skip a beat <unk>[MASK] it would start it would stop and i felt all this <unk> and i was sure that i was going to have a heart attack[MASK] so at sixteen minutes what i did is i slid my feet out because i knew that if i did go out if i did have a heart attack they 'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet <unk>[MASK] <unk> out before pulling me up i was really nervous i let my feet out and i started floating to the top and i didn 't take my head out but i was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop[MASK] <unk> and then suddenly i hear screaming <unk> and i think that there is some weird thing that i had died or something had happened <unk> [MASK] and then i realized that i had made it to sixteen thirty two so with the energy of of everybody that was there i decided to keep pushing and i went to seventeen minutes and four seconds[MASK] <unk> i did immediately after is i went to quest labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were so the doctors could use it once again <unk> i also didn 't want anybody to question it i had the world record and i wanted to[MASK] make sure it was legitimate <unk> [MASK] <unk> and that 's my life so [MASK] as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible[MASK] and i think magic whether[MASK] i 'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards is pretty simple it 's practice it 's training and it 's it 's[MASK] practice it 's training and experimenting [MASK] sobs while pushing through the pain to be the best that i can be and <unk> that 's[MASK] that 's what magic is to me[MASK]
