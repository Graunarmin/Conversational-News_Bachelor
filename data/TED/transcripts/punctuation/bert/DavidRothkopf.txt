 <unk> what i 'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear and the cost of fear and the age of fear from which we are now emerging i would[MASK] like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that that i know something about fear and[MASK] <unk> anxiety i 'm a jewish guy from new jersey i could worry before i could walk [MASK] laughter please <unk> applaud that thank you [MASK] but i also grew up in a time[MASK] where there was something to fear we were brought out in the hall when i was a little kid[MASK] and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war [MASK] now even my <unk> seven year old brain knew that that wasn 't going to work <unk> [MASK] but i also knew that global thermonuclear war was something[MASK] to be concerned with <unk> [MASK] <unk> and yet despite the fact that we lived for fifty years[MASK] with the threat of such a war <unk> the response of our government and of our society[MASK] was to do wonderful things <unk> [MASK] we created the space program in response to that we built our highway system in response to that we created the internet in response to that <unk>[MASK] so sometimes fear can produce a constructive response <unk> [MASK] un constructive response [MASK] on september eleven <unk> two thousand and one <unk> [MASK] nineteen guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings <unk> [MASK] they exacted a horrible toll it is not for us to minimize what that toll was [MASK] <unk> the response that we had was clearly disproportionate[MASK] disproportionate to the point of[MASK] verging on the unhinged <unk> we rearranged the national security apparatus of the united states and of many governments[MASK] to address a threat that at the time that those attacks took place [MASK] was quite limited <unk> in fact <unk> according to our intelligence services on september eleven <unk> two thousand and one[MASK] there were one hundred members of core al qaeda [MASK] there were just a few thousand terrorists <unk> they posed an existential threat[MASK] to no one <unk> but[MASK] we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the second[MASK] <unk> we launched two wars <unk> [MASK] we spent trillions of dollars <unk> we suspended our values <unk> we violated international law we embraced torture we embraced the idea that if these nineteen guys could do this anybody could do it [MASK] and therefore for the first time in history <unk> [MASK] we were seeing everybody as a threat <unk> [MASK] and what was the result of that surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries[MASK] hundreds of millions of people setting aside whether those countries were our allies setting aside what our interests were [MASK] i would argue that fifteen years later <unk> [MASK] since today there are more terrorists more terrorist attacks more terrorist casualties this by the count of[MASK] <unk> state department[MASK] since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history since[MASK] the flood <unk> perhaps [MASK] we have not succeeded in our response now you have to[MASK] ask where did we go wrong what did we do what was the mistake that was made and you might say well look washington is a dysfunctional[MASK] <unk> there are political food fights we 've turned our discourse into a cage match <unk> and that 's true <unk> [MASK] but there are bigger problems believe it or not than that dysfunction even though i would argue[MASK] that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world[MASK] is far more dangerous than anything that a group like isis could do because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us[MASK] <unk> from progress <unk> [MASK] but there are other problems <unk> [MASK] and the other problems came from the fact that in washington and in many capitals right now we 're in a creativity crisis in washington <unk> [MASK] in think tanks where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas [MASK] you don 't get bold new ideas because if you offer up a bold new idea not only are you attacked on twitter but you will not get[MASK] <unk> confirmed in a government job [MASK] because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate you get governments that have an us versus them mentality <unk> tiny groups of people <unk>[MASK] <unk> making decisions when you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions what do you get [MASK] <unk> danger [MASK] you also have processes that become reactive to news cycles <unk> and so the parts of the u s government that do foresight that look forward that do strategy <unk>[MASK] <unk> the parts in other governments that do this can 't do it because they 're reacting to the news cycle <unk> [MASK] <unk> nine eleven <unk> we are still looking in the wrong direction and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon[MASK] that are far more important[MASK] than what we saw on nine eleven far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists <unk> far more important even than[MASK] <unk> instability that we 've got in some areas of the world[MASK] that are racked by instability today in fact <unk> [MASK] the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms <unk> [MASK] they may be a reaction to bigger trends <unk> and if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend then we 've got far bigger problems to deal with <unk> [MASK] and so what are those trends <unk> well to a group like you[MASK] the trends are apparent <unk> [MASK] we are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven if[MASK] you saw the cover of the economist a couple of days ago it said that eighty percent of the people on the planet by the year two thousand and twenty[MASK] <unk> would have a smartphone <unk> [MASK] they would have a small computer connected to the internet in their pocket <unk> [MASK] in most of africa the cell phone penetration rate is eighty percent [MASK] we passed the point last october when there were more mobile cellular devices sim cards [MASK] out in the world than there were people <unk> [MASK] we are within years[MASK] of a profound moment in our history[MASK] <unk> single human being on the planet[MASK] is going to be part of a man made system for the first time able to touch anyone else[MASK] touch them for good touch them for ill <unk> and the changes associated with that are changing[MASK] the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking[MASK] <unk> about when they 're thinking about these immediate threats <unk> on the security side <unk> we 've come out of a cold war in which it was[MASK] too costly to fight a nuclear war <unk> and so we didn 't to a period that i call cool war cyber war [MASK] where the costs of conflict are actually so low that we may never stop [MASK] we may enter a period of constant warfare[MASK] <unk> we know this because we 've been in it for several years and yet <unk> we don 't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard <unk> [MASK] we don 't have the basic ideas formulated if someone attacks us with a cyber attack do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack <unk> [MASK] we don 't know if somebody launches a cyber attack how do we deter them when[MASK] <unk> china launched a series of cyber attacks what did the u s government do it said we 're going to indict a few of these chinese guys [MASK] who are never coming to america they 're never going to be anywhere near[MASK] a law enforcement officer who 's going to take them into custody <unk> it 's a gesture it 's not a deterrent <unk> [MASK] special forces operators out there in the field today discover[MASK] <unk> that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery[MASK] that once only superpowers had [MASK] in fact <unk> if you 've got a cell phone you 've got access to power that a superpower didn 't have and would have highly classified ten years ago in my cell phone i have an app that tells me where every plane[MASK] plane in the world is <unk> and its altitude <unk> and its speed and what kind of aircraft it is and where it 's going and where it 's landing <unk> [MASK] they have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do they 're using these tools in new ways <unk>[MASK] when a cafe in sydney was taken over by a terrorist he went in with a rifle <unk> [MASK] <unk> because he captured people he terrorized them he pointed the ipad at them [MASK] and then he took the video and he put it on the internet and he took over the world 's media <unk> [MASK] but it doesn 't just affect the security side <unk> the relations between great powers we thought we were past[MASK] <unk> the bipolar era we thought we were in a unipolar world where all the big issues were resolved remember <unk> it was the end of history <unk> [MASK] but we 're not we[MASK] 're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the internet that it was going to connect us weave society together[MASK] are not necessarily true <unk> [MASK] in countries like china you have the great firewall of china <unk> you 've got countries saying no if the internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders we control the[MASK] <unk> content <unk> we are going to control our security we are going to manage that internet we are going to say what can be on it we 're going to set a different set of rules now you might think well that 's just china <unk> [MASK] but it 's not just china <unk> [MASK] it 's china <unk> india <unk> russia <unk> it 's saudi arabia <unk> it 's singapore it 's brazil after the nsa[MASK] <unk> the indians the brazilians they said let 's create a new internet backbone <unk> because we can 't be dependent on this other one <unk> and so all of a sudden what do you have [MASK] you have a new bipolar world in which <unk>[MASK] our belief is challenged by <unk>[MASK] another belief <unk> we are seeing these changes everywhere[MASK] <unk> we are seeing the advent of mobile money <unk> it 's happening in the places you wouldn 't expect it 's happening in kenya and tanzania <unk> [MASK] where millions of people who haven 't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones [MASK] there are two point five million people who don 't have financial service access that are going to get it soon [MASK] a billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell[MASK] phone soon it 's not just going to give them the ability to bank <unk> it 's going to change what monetary policy is <unk> it 's going to change what money is <unk> [MASK] education is changing in the same way <unk> [MASK] healthcare is changing in the same way <unk> how government services are delivered is changing in the same way <unk> [MASK] and yet <unk> in washington <unk> we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over syria and iraq[MASK] isis or isil or islamic state <unk> we are trying to determine[MASK] how much we want to give in a negotiation with the iranians on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of fifty years ago <unk> [MASK] when in fact we know[MASK] <unk> that the iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we 're ignoring it partially because businesses are not[MASK] willing to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them <unk> and that gets us to[MASK] another breakdown that 's crucial and another breakdown that couldn 't be more important to a group like this [MASK] because the growth of america and real american national security and all of the things that drove progress[MASK] even during the cold war[MASK] partnership between science technology and government[MASK] that began when thomas jefferson sat alone in his laboratory inventing new things <unk> [MASK] but it was the canals and railroads and telegraph it was radar and the internet it was tang the breakfast drink[MASK] <unk> probably not the most important of those developments [MASK] but what you had was a partnership and a dialogue and the dialogue has broken down <unk> it 's broken down because in washington <unk> [MASK] less government is considered more it 's broken down because there is <unk> believe it or not in washington a war on science despite the fact that in all of human history <unk> every time anyone has waged a war on science science has won[MASK] <unk> have a government that doesn 't want to listen that doesn 't have people at the highest levels that understand this in the nuclear age when there were people in senior national security jobs <unk> [MASK] they were expected to speak throw weight [MASK] they were expected to know the lingo the vocabulary <unk> if you went to the highest level of the u s government now and said talk to me about cyber[MASK] about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow you 'd get a blank stare i know because when i wrote this book i talked to one hundred and fifty people many from the science and tech side who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids ' table [MASK] meanwhile on the tech side <unk> we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things but they started[MASK] <unk> in garages and they didn 't need the government and they don 't want the government many of them have a political view that 's somewhere between libertarian and anarchic <unk> leave me alone <unk> [MASK] but the world 's coming apart [MASK] all of a sudden there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and <unk>[MASK] <unk> privacy <unk> and we haven 't even gotten to the next set of issues which are philosophical issues <unk> [MASK] <unk> can 't vote if you can 't have a job if you can 't bank if you can 't get health care if you can 't be educated without internet access is internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions [MASK] if internet access is a fundamental right [MASK] is electricity access for the one point two billion who don 't have access to electricity a fundamental right these are fundamental issues[MASK] <unk> the dialogue <unk> and that brings me to the reason that i 'm here i live in washington <unk> pity me [MASK] the dialogue isn 't happening there [MASK] these big issues that will change the world change national security change economics create hope <unk> create[MASK] <unk> only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government both sides need each other [MASK] and until we recreate that connection <unk> [MASK] until we do what helped america grow and helped other countries grow <unk> then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable [MASK] <unk> the risks associated with nine eleven will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent they[MASK] 'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues[MASK] and our inability to get together[MASK] scientists <unk> technologists government leaders at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the renaissance[MASK] <unk> akin to the beginning of the the major transformational eras that have happened on earth <unk> [MASK] and start coming up with if not the right answers then at least the right questions <unk> we are not there yet <unk> [MASK] but discussions like this and groups like you are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed <unk> and that 's why i believe[MASK] <unk> that groups like ted <unk> [MASK] discussions like this around the planet are the place where the future of foreign policy of economic policy of social policy of philosophy <unk> will ultimately take place <unk> [MASK] and that 's why it 's been a pleasure speaking to you <unk> thank you very very[MASK]
