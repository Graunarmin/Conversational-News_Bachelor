 <unk> would like to show you how architecture has helped[MASK] to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope i[MASK] am a native of burkina faso[MASK] <unk> to the world bank burkina faso is one of the poorest countries in the world but what does it look like[MASK] to grow up in a place like that i am an example of that i was born in a little village called <unk>[MASK] there was no electricity no access to clean drinking water[MASK] and no school <unk> but my father wanted me[MASK] to learn how to read and write <unk> for this reason <unk> i had to leave my family when i was seven[MASK] and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family in this place[MASK] i sat[MASK] in a class like[MASK] <unk> that[MASK] with more than one hundred and fifty other kids <unk> and for six years [MASK] in this time it just happened to me to come to school[MASK] to realize that my classmate[MASK] <unk> village people still are dying in burkina faso <unk> and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem[MASK] i[MASK] had luck[MASK] i was lucky <unk> because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that <unk> but i was lucky i[MASK] had a[MASK] <unk> scholarship i could go to germany to study <unk> so now [MASK] i suppose <unk> i don 't need to explain to you how great[MASK] a privilege[MASK] it is for me to be standing before you today <unk> from <unk> gando my home village in burkina faso [MASK] to berlin in germany[MASK] <unk> to become an architect is a big big step <unk> but what to do with this[MASK] privilege <unk> [MASK] since i was a student i wanted[MASK] to open up better opportunities to other kids in gando i just wanted to use my skills and build a school <unk> [MASK] but how do you do it when you 're still a[MASK] <unk> student and you don 't have money <unk> oh yes i started to make drawings[MASK] and asked for money <unk> fundraising was not an easy task i[MASK] even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and[MASK] <unk> collect fifty thousand u s dollars <unk> [MASK] when i came home to gando[MASK] to bring the good news my people were over the moon [MASK] but[MASK] when they realized[MASK] that i was planning to use clay they were shocked a clay building is not able to stand a rainy season[MASK] <unk> and francis wants us to use it and build a school is this the reason why he spent so much time in europe studying[MASK] instead of working in the field with us [MASK] my people build all the time with clay <unk> but they don[MASK] <unk> i started to speak[MASK] with the community and[MASK] i could convince everybody <unk> and we could start to work <unk> [MASK] and the women <unk> the men everybody from the village was part of this building process i was allowed to use even[MASK] traditional techniques <unk> so clay floor[MASK] <unk> they start polishing it with a stone for hours <unk> and then[MASK] <unk> this is the school <unk> built with the community <unk> the walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from gando the roof[MASK] structure is made with cheap[MASK] steel bars normally hiding[MASK] <unk> inside concrete[MASK] and the classroom <unk> the ceiling is made out of both of them used together in this school there was a simple idea [MASK] to create comfort[MASK] in a classroom don 't forget it can be forty five degrees in burkina faso[MASK] <unk> so with simple ventilation <unk> i wanted to make the classroom[MASK] good for teaching and learning and this is the project today <unk> [MASK] twelve years old still in best condition <unk> and the kids [MASK] and for me and my community this project was a huge[MASK] success it has opened up opportunities to do[MASK] <unk> projects in gando so i could do a lot of projects <unk> and here i am going to share with you only three of them <unk>[MASK] the first one is the school extension of course how do you explain drawings[MASK] and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write <unk> i started to build a prototype like that the innovation was to build a clay[MASK] <unk> clay vault <unk> so <unk> then i jumped[MASK] on the top like that with my team <unk> and it works <unk> the community is looking it still works so we can build [MASK] and we kept building and that is the result <unk> the kids[MASK] are happy <unk> and they love it the community is very proud we made it and even[MASK] <unk> animals like these donkeys love our buildings [MASK] the next project is the library in gando and[MASK] see now we tried to[MASK] introduce different ideas in our buildings <unk> but we often don 't have so much material <unk> [MASK] something we have in[MASK] <unk> pots we wanted to use them[MASK] to create openings so we just bring them like you can see to the building site [MASK] we start cutting them <unk> and then we place them on top of the roof[MASK] before we pour the concrete <unk> and you have this result <unk> the openings are letting the hot air out[MASK] and light in very simple[MASK] <unk> my most recent project[MASK] in gando is a high school project i would like to share with you this the innovation in this project is to cast mud[MASK] like you cast concrete <unk> how do you cast mud <unk> we start making a lot of mortars like you can see and when[MASK] when everything is ready when you know what is the best recipe and the best form you start[MASK] working with the community and sometimes i can leave they will do it themselves <unk> i came to speak to you like that [MASK] another factor in gando is rain when the[MASK] rains come we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain [MASK] <unk> don 't confound with[MASK] christo and jeanne claude it is simply how we protect our walls [MASK] the rain in burkina comes very fast <unk> and after that you have floods everywhere in the country [MASK] but for us the rain is good it brings sand and gravel[MASK] to the river[MASK] we need to use to build <unk> we just wait for the rain to go we take the sand we mix it with[MASK] clay and we keep building that is it the gando project was always connected to training the people <unk> because[MASK] i just wanted one day when i fall down[MASK] and die that at least one person from gando keeps doing this work[MASK] <unk> my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves <unk> [MASK] usually for a young man from gando to earn money you have to leave the country[MASK] to the city sometimes leave the country and some never come back[MASK] <unk> can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family there 's a new quality in this work <unk> [MASK] yes you know it i have won a lot of awards through this work[MASK] <unk> for sure it has[MASK] opened opportunities <unk> i have become myself known[MASK] <unk> why i do what i do is my community [MASK] when i was a kid <unk> i was going to school <unk> i was coming back every holiday to gando [MASK] by the end of every holidays <unk> i had to say goodbye to the[MASK] <unk> open their clothes like that and give me the last penny [MASK] in my culture this is a symbol of deep affection <unk> [MASK] as a <unk> seven year old guy <unk> i was impressed <unk> i just asked my mother one day why[MASK] <unk> they are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful[MASK] and one day come back and help[MASK] improve the quality of life of the community i hope now that i was able to make my community proud[MASK] through this work <unk> and i hope i was able to[MASK] <unk> prove you the power of community and to show you that architecture[MASK] can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future[MASK]
