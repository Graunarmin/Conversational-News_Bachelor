 <unk> how many people here have heard of pms[MASK] <unk> everybody right everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period [MASK] that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and[MASK] <unk> irritability <unk> there 's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions[MASK] and that the great majority of women are affected by this well[MASK] i am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true <unk> i 'm here to give you the good news about pms <unk> [MASK] <unk> let 's take a look at how firmly the idea of pms is entrenched in american culture <unk> [MASK] if you examine newspaper or magazine articles you 'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets pms [MASK] in an article in the magazine redbook[MASK] titled you pms free readers were informed that between eighty to ninety percent of women suffer from pms[MASK] <unk> muscle magazine warned its readers[MASK] that forty to fifty percent of women suffer from pms and that it plays a major role in women 's mental and physical health <unk> [MASK] and a couple of years ago even the wall street journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for pms <unk> asking its female readers do you turn into a witch every month [MASK] from all these articles you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of pms[MASK] <unk> however after five decades of research [MASK] there 's no strong consensus on the definition the cause the treatment or even the existence of pms [MASK] as most commonly defined by psychologists [MASK] pms involves negative behavioral cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation [MASK] but here 's where it gets tricky over one[MASK] <unk> hundred and fifty different symptoms have been used to diagnose pms and here are just a few of those [MASK] now i want to be clear here i 'm not saying women don 't get some of these symptoms [MASK] what i 'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn 't amount to a mental disorder [MASK] and when psychologists come up with a[MASK] <unk> that 's so vaguely defined the label eventually becomes meaningless [MASK] with a list of symptoms this long and wide i could have pms you could have pms <unk> the guy in the third row here could have pms <unk> my dog could have pms [MASK] some researchers said you had to have five symptoms some said three [MASK] other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you but others said minor symptoms were just as important[MASK] for many years because there was no standardization in the definition of pms <unk> [MASK] when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates their estimates ranged from five percent of women to ninety seven percent of women <unk> [MASK] so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had pms <unk> [MASK] <unk> the weaknesses in the methods of research on pms have been considerable [MASK] first many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively looking to the past and relying on memory <unk> which is known to inflate reporting of pms[MASK] compared to what 's called prospective reporting <unk> which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row [MASK] many studies also exclusively focused on white[MASK] middle class women <unk> which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women <unk> [MASK] we know there 's a strong cultural component to the belief in pms because it 's nearly unheard of outside of western nations [MASK] third many studies failed to use control groups [MASK] if we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have pms we need to be able to compare them to women who don 't have pms[MASK] and finally many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose pms focusing on different symptoms symptom duration and severity [MASK] to do reliable research on any condition scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they 're all talking about the same thing[MASK] <unk> this has not been the case[MASK] <unk> according to these new dsm guidelines [MASK] in most menstrual cycles in the last year at least five of eleven possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts [MASK] the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended [MASK] one of these symptoms must come from this list of four[MASK] marked mood swings irritability <unk> anxiety or depression [MASK] the other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite [MASK] the dsm also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress[MASK] there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships[MASK] and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row <unk> [MASK] and finally <unk> the dsm required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder <unk> [MASK] so scientifically speaking this[MASK] we now have a limited number of symptoms and a high impact on functioning that 's required [MASK] and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific [MASK] well <unk> using this criteria and looking at most recent studies we see that on average <unk> three to[MASK] <unk> not all women <unk> not most women <unk> not the majority of women not even a lot of women <unk> three to eight percent [MASK] for everyone else variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month <unk> [MASK] and this is the information the scientific community has had since the <unk>[MASK] in two thousand and two[MASK] <unk> my colleagues and i published an article describing the pms and pmdd research and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals <unk> [MASK] the questions is why hasn 't this information trickled down to the public <unk> why do these myths persist well[MASK] certainly the onslaught of messages that women[MASK] <unk> from books tv movies the internet that everyone gets pms go a long way in convincing them it must be true <unk> [MASK] research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets pms the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it let me tell you what i mean by erroneously [MASK] you might ask her do you have pms and she says yes <unk> [MASK] <unk> when you have her keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month <unk> [MASK] another reason[MASK] for the persistence of the pms myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role [MASK] feminist psychologists like joan chrisler have suggested[MASK] that taking on the label of pms allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered[MASK] <unk> the near universal definition of a good woman[MASK] is one who is happy loving caring for others and taking great satisfaction from that role well pms has become a permission slip[MASK] to be angry complain be irritated <unk> without losing the title of good woman [MASK] we know that the variables in a woman 's environment[MASK] are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones[MASK] <unk> but when she attributes anger to hormones she 's absolved of responsibility or criticism oh that 's not who she is it 's out of her control [MASK] and while this can be a useful tool [MASK] it serves to invalidate women 's emotions when people respond to a woman 's anger with the thought oh [MASK] <unk> 's just that time of the month her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited [MASK] so who else benefits from the myth of pms <unk> [MASK] well i can tell you that treating pms has become a profitable thriving industry[MASK] amazon com currently offers over one thousand nine hundred books on pms treatment [MASK] a quick google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics workshops and seminars[MASK] reputable internet sources of medical information like webmd or the mayo clinic list pms as a known disorder it 's not a known disorder but they list it [MASK] and they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it like anti depressants or hormones <unk> [MASK] interestingly though both websites say that the success of medication[MASK] in treating pms[MASK] <unk> symptoms vary from woman to woman [MASK] well that doesn 't make sense [MASK] if you 've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause which pms is supposed to be then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women <unk> [MASK] this has not been the case with these treatments [MASK] and fda regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement[MASK] <unk> so we have not had that at all with these so called treatments <unk> [MASK] however <unk> the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that pms is a common mental disorder and is treatable[MASK] is quite substantial [MASK] when women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones [MASK] medical protocol requires that they have physician follow up every three months that 's a lot of doctor visits[MASK] <unk> visits [MASK] pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their <unk> child bearing lives <unk>[MASK] over the counter drugs like midol even claim to treat pms symptoms like tension and irritability <unk> even though they only contain a diuretic[MASK] <unk> a pain reliever and caffeine [MASK] now far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine <unk> but i don 't think reducing tension is one of them [MASK] since two thousand and two midol has marketed a teen midol to adolescents [MASK] they are aiming at young girls early [MASK] to convince them that everyone gets pms and that it will make you a monster <unk> but wait there 's something you can do about it take midol and you will be a human being again[MASK] <unk> in two thousand and thirteen midol took in forty eight million dollars in sales revenue [MASK] so while perpetuating the myth of pms has been lucrative for some it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women <unk> [MASK] first it contributes to the medicalization of women 's reproductive health <unk>[MASK] <unk> the medical field has a long history of conceptualizing women 's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment <unk> [MASK] and this has come at many costs including excessive cesarean deliveries hysterectomies[MASK] and prescribed hormone treatments that have harmed rather than enhanced women 's health <unk> [MASK] second the pms myth also contributes to the stereotype[MASK] <unk> when the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts [MASK] it becomes easy to question the competence of all women [MASK] women have made tremendous strides in the workforce but still there 's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business <unk> [MASK] and when we think about who makes for a good ceo or senator[MASK] <unk> who has qualities like rationality <unk> steadiness competence come to mind [MASK] and in our culture <unk> that sounds more like a man than a woman and the pms myth contributes to that [MASK] psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different one study[MASK] followed men and women for four to six months[MASK] and found that the number of mood swings they experienced and the severity of those mood swings were no different <unk> [MASK] and finally the pms myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset [MASK] individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions[MASK] or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood[MASK] sweeping emotions under the rug of pms[MASK] keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them [MASK] so the good news about pms is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle the great majority don 't get a mental disorder[MASK] <unk> they go to work or school take care of their families and function at a normal level [MASK] we know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different [MASK] so let 's walk away from the tired old pms myth of women as witches[MASK] and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day thank you[MASK]
