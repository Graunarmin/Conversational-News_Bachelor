 <unk> show you how terrorism[MASK] actually interacts with our daily life <unk> fifteen years ago i received a phone call from a friend at the time he was looking after the rights of political[MASK] <unk> he asked me if i wanted to interview the red brigades <unk> now as many of you may remember the red brigades was[MASK] a terrorist <unk> marxist organization which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the <unk>[MASK] as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody not even with their lawyers[MASK] <unk> they sat in silence through their trails <unk> waving occasionally at family and friends [MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three they declared the end of the armed struggle <unk> [MASK] and they drew a list of people with whom they would talk <unk> and tell their story and i was one of those people [MASK] when i asked my friend why the red brigades want to talk to me he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported[MASK] my name <unk> in particular one person had put it forward <unk> she was my childhood friend [MASK] she had joined the red brigades and became a leader of the organization <unk> [MASK] naturally <unk> i didn 't know that until the day she was arrested <unk> in fact <unk> i read it in the newspaper [MASK] at the time of the phone call i just had a baby[MASK] <unk> completed a management buyout to the company i was working[MASK] with <unk> and the last thing i wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high security prisons <unk> [MASK] but this is exactly what i did[MASK] because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist <unk> and why[MASK] <unk> i found the answer very quickly <unk> [MASK] i actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist <unk> the center committee of the red brigades had judged me[MASK] <unk> and too opinionated to become a good terrorist [MASK] my friend on the other hand <unk> she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders <unk> [MASK] she also embraced violence <unk> because she believed that the only way to unblock what at the time was[MASK] known as a blocked democracy italy a country run by the same party for thirty five years[MASK] was the arms struggle <unk> at the same time[MASK] <unk> while i was interviewing the red brigades <unk> i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics[MASK] or ideology <unk> but actually was ruled by economics <unk> they were constantly short of cash <unk> [MASK] they were constantly searching for cash <unk> now contrary to what many people believe[MASK] <unk> of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars <unk> this is roughly between one hundred and one hundred and fifty million <unk> today <unk> [MASK] <unk> now you know if you live underground it 's really hard to produce this amount of money [MASK] <unk> brigades and then later on other arms organizations including members of[MASK] group in the middle east <unk> [MASK] everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology or politics because they had no idea <unk> [MASK] the[MASK] political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership <unk> which generally is never more than[MASK] <unk> five to seven people all the others do day in and day out is search for money [MASK] once for example i was interviewing this part timer from the red brigades <unk> it was a psychiatrist <unk> he loved sailing he was a really keen sailor [MASK] and he had this beautiful boat <unk> and he told me that the best time of his life was when he[MASK] was a member of the red brigades[MASK] and he went sailing every summer back and forth from lebanon where he would pick up soviet weapons from the plo <unk> and then carry them all the way to sardinia where the other <unk>[MASK] arms organization from europe would go and take their share of the arms for that service the red brigades were actually paid a fee which went to fund their organization [MASK] i thought <unk> maybe there is something here <unk> maybe there is a link a commercial link between one organization and another one <unk> [MASK] but it was only when[MASK] i interviewed mario moretti the head of the red brigades <unk> the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro italian[MASK] <unk> i finally realized that terrorism is actually business [MASK] i was having lunch with him in a high security prison in italy <unk> and[MASK] as we were eating <unk> i had the distinct feeling that[MASK] i was back in the city of london having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist <unk> this guy thought in the[MASK] <unk> i wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism <unk> [MASK] naturally <unk> nobody wanted to fund my research <unk> in fact i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy you know that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money thinking about the economics of terrorism <unk> [MASK] so <unk> in the end i took a decision that in retrospect[MASK] <unk> i sold my company and funded the research myself <unk> and what i discovered[MASK] is this parallel reality[MASK] another international economic system which runs parallel to our own which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii and what is even more shocking[MASK] is that this system has followed step by step the[MASK] <unk> evolution of our own system of our western capitalism <unk> and there are three main stages <unk> [MASK] the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism <unk> [MASK] the second one is the privatization of terrorism <unk> and the third of course is the globalization of terrorism <unk> [MASK] so <unk> state sponsor of[MASK] <unk> feature of the cold war this is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy <unk> along the periphery of the sphere of influence <unk> [MASK] fully funding arms organizations a mix of legal and illegal activities is used [MASK] so the link between crime and terror is established very early on [MASK] and here is the best example the contras in nicaragua[MASK] <unk> and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism <unk> so they gain independence from the sponsor[MASK] <unk> we see a mix of legal and illegal activities <unk> so arafat[MASK] used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from beka valley which is the valley between lebanon and syria <unk> [MASK] and the ira <unk> which control the private transportation system in northern ireland[MASK] <unk> did exactly the same thing so <unk> every single time[MASK] that somebody got into a taxi in belfast without knowing actually was funding the ira <unk> [MASK] but the great change came of course with globalization and deregulation this is when arms organization[MASK] were able to link up also financially with each other but above all they started to do serious business with the[MASK] <unk> their dirty business through the same channel <unk> this is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization al qaeda <unk> [MASK] this is an organization that can raise money across border but also that is able to carry out attacks[MASK] in more than one country <unk> now deregulation also brought back[MASK] <unk> so what is rogue economics [MASK] rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history <unk> [MASK] it comes back at times of great transformation <unk> globalization being one of those transformations <unk> [MASK] it is at this times in which politics[MASK] actually loses control of the economy and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us <unk> it has happened before in history it has happened with the[MASK] the roman empire <unk> it has happened with industrial revolution and it actually happened again with the fall of the berlin wall <unk> [MASK] now i calculated[MASK] how big was this international economic system composed by crime terror <unk> and illegal economy[MASK] <unk> dollars <unk> it is trillions it 's not billions <unk> this is about[MASK] twice the gdp of the united kingdom <unk> soon will be more considering where this country is going [MASK] now <unk> until 9 11 the bulk of all this money flew into the u s economy because[MASK] <unk> the bulk of the money was denominated in u s dollars[MASK] and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states <unk> the entry point of course of most of this money were the off shore facilities <unk> [MASK] so <unk> this was a vital injection of cash into the u s economy <unk> [MASK] now when i went to look at the figures of the u s money supply [MASK] <unk> money supply is the amount of dollars[MASK] that the federal reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars <unk> which of course reflects the growth[MASK] of the economy <unk> so when i went to look at those figures <unk> i noted that since the late <unk>[MASK] a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the united states never to come back these were[MASK] <unk> money taken out in suitcases or in containers <unk> in cash of course <unk> these were money taken out by criminals and money launderers <unk> these were money taken out to fund the growth[MASK] of the terror <unk> illegal and criminal economy <unk> so <unk> you see what is the[MASK] <unk> the united states[MASK] actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world [MASK] what does it mean [MASK] that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have <unk> it can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world <unk> [MASK] this privilege is called seigniorage [MASK] no other country can do[MASK] <unk> all the other countries for example the united kingdom can borrow only against the amount of[MASK] money in circulation inside its own borders [MASK] so here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime terror <unk> and illegal economy <unk> and our economy the u s [MASK] in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror <unk> illegal and criminal economy <unk> [MASK] this is how close we are with this world[MASK] now this situation changed <unk>[MASK] because george bush launched the war on terror <unk> part of the war on terror was the introduction of the patriot act <unk> [MASK] now many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans[MASK] in order to protect[MASK] <unk> but there is a section of the patriot act which refers specifically to finance and it is in fact <unk>[MASK] <unk> legislation what the patriot act did was to prohibit[MASK] <unk> authorities[MASK] the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world [MASK] now you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking <unk> all the bankers said to their clients get out of the dollars[MASK] and go and invest somewhere else now the euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business[MASK] <unk> and this is what people did <unk> nobody wants the u s monetary authority to check their relationship to monitor their relationship with their clientele [MASK] the same thing happened of course <unk> in the world of crime and terror [MASK] people simply moved their money laundering[MASK] activities away from the united states[MASK] into europe[MASK] why did this happen this happened because the patriot act was a unilateral legislation it was introduced only in the united states and it was introduced only for the u s dollars [MASK] in europe a similar legislation was not introduced <unk> [MASK] so within six months[MASK] europe became the[MASK] <unk> this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror <unk> and our own life[MASK]
