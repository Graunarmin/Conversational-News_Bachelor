 <unk> two thousand and fourteen is a very special year for me twenty years as a consultant twenty years of marriage <unk> and i 'm turning fifty in one month [MASK] that means i was born in one thousand [MASK] <unk> in a small town in germany [MASK] it was a gray november day <unk> and i was overdue <unk> the hospital 's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray november day <unk> [MASK] as a matter of fact one thousand nine hundred and sixty four was the year with the highest birth rate ever in germany more than one point three million last year we just hit over six hundred thousand so half of my number [MASK] what you can see here[MASK] is the german age pyramid and there the small black point at the top that 's me [MASK] in red you can see the potential working age population <unk> [MASK] so people over fifteen and under <unk>[MASK] and i 'm actually only interested in this red area <unk> now <unk> let 's do a simple simulation[MASK] of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years as you can see the peak is moving to the right <unk> [MASK] and i with many other baby boomers will retire in two thousand and thirty [MASK] by the way i don 't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area <unk> the red area so the potential working age population in two thousand and thirty[MASK] is already set in stone today <unk> [MASK] except for much higher migration rates and if you compare this red area in two thousand and thirty[MASK] with the red area in two thousand and fourteen it is much much smaller <unk> so before i show you the rest of the world what does this[MASK] <unk> so what we know from this picture is[MASK] that the labor supply <unk> so people who provide labor will go down in germany and will go down significantly <unk> [MASK] now <unk> what about labor demand <unk> that 's where it gets tricky <unk> [MASK] as you might know the consultant 's favorite answer to any question is it depends so i would say it depends[MASK] <unk> we didn 't want to forecast the future <unk> highly speculative we did something else <unk> [MASK] we looked at the gdp and productivity growth of germany over the last twenty years <unk> and calculated the following scenario <unk> [MASK] if germany wants to continue this gdp and productivity growth [MASK] we could directly calculate how many people germany would need to support this growth <unk> [MASK] and this is the green line labor demand <unk> [MASK] so germany will run into a[MASK] <unk> major talent shortage very quickly [MASK] eight million people are missing which is more than twenty percent of our current workforce so big numbers <unk> really big numbers <unk> and we calculated several scenarios <unk> and the picture always looked like this [MASK] now <unk> to close the gap <unk> germany has to significantly[MASK] increase migration get many more women in the workforce increase[MASK] <unk> retirement age by the way we just lowered it this year[MASK] and all these measures at once [MASK] if germany fails here [MASK] germany will stagnate <unk> we won 't grow anymore why because the workers are not there who can generate this growth <unk> [MASK] and companies will look for talents somewhere[MASK] <unk> we simulated labor supply and and labor demand for the largest fifteen economies in the world [MASK] representing more than seventy percent of world gdp and the overall picture looks like this by two thousand and twenty <unk> [MASK] blue indicates a labor surplus [MASK] red indicates a labor shortfall <unk> and gray are those[MASK] countries which are borderline <unk> [MASK] so by two thousand and twenty we still see a labor surplus in some countries like italy france the u s [MASK] but this picture will change dramatically by two thousand and thirty <unk> [MASK] by two thousand and thirty <unk> we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies including three out of the four bric countries <unk>[MASK] <unk> will be hit as well as brazil[MASK] and russia <unk> now <unk> to tell the truth [MASK] in reality <unk> [MASK] the situation will be even more challenging [MASK] what you can see here are average numbers we de averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels <unk> and what we found[MASK] <unk> so on top of an overall labor shortage we will face a big skill mismatch in the future <unk> and this means huge challenges in terms of education <unk>[MASK] qualification upskilling for governments and companies <unk> [MASK] now[MASK] <unk> the next thing we looked into was robots automation technology will technology change this picture and boost productivity [MASK] now the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology [MASK] a long answer[MASK] would go like this let 's take germany[MASK] <unk> the germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity [MASK] in the ' 90s i worked in our boston office for almost two years <unk> [MASK] and when i left an old senior partner told me literally send me more of these germans they work like machines[MASK] <unk> replace a lot of jobs <unk> regular jobs <unk> not only in the production industry but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced[MASK] by robots artificial intelligence big data[MASK] <unk> so the key question is not[MASK] if technology replaces some of these jobs <unk> but when how fast <unk> and to what extent <unk> [MASK] or in other words <unk> will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis[MASK] <unk> yes and no this is a more sophisticated version of it[MASK] <unk> let 's take[MASK] the automotive industry as an example <unk> [MASK] because there more than forty percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place in[MASK] nine hundred and eighty <unk> less than ten percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts [MASK] today this number is more than thirty percent[MASK] and it will grow to more than fifty[MASK] <unk> percent by two thousand and thirty <unk> and these new electronic parts[MASK] and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs like the cognitive systems engineer[MASK] who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system in one thousand nine hundred[MASK] <unk> no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist [MASK] as a matter of fact <unk> [MASK] the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades in spite of robots and automation <unk> [MASK] so what does this mean <unk> yes technology will replace a lot of jobs <unk> but we will also see a lot of new jobs[MASK] and new skills on the horizon and that means[MASK] <unk> technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch <unk> [MASK] and this kind of de averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] people high skilled people <unk> talents will be the big thing in the next decade[MASK] <unk> if they are the scarce resource <unk> we have to understand them much better[MASK] are they actually willing to work abroad <unk> what are their job preferences [MASK] to find out this year we conducted a[MASK] global survey among more than two hundred thousand job seekers from one hundred and eighty nine countries migration[MASK] is certainly one key measure to close a gap at least in the short term[MASK] asked about mobility more than sixty percent[MASK] of these two hundred thousand job seekers are willing to work abroad for me a surprisingly high number [MASK] if you look at the employees aged twenty one to thirty this number is even higher <unk> [MASK] if you split this number up by country[MASK] <unk> the world is mobile <unk> but only partly <unk> the least mobile countries are russia germany[MASK] and the u s [MASK] now where would these people like to move number seven is australia where twenty eight percent could imagine moving then france[MASK] <unk> of these two hundred thousand people so what are they looking for [MASK] out of a list of twenty six topics salary is only number eight [MASK] the top four topics are all around culture number four <unk> having a great relationship with the boss [MASK] three[MASK] <unk> relationship with colleagues and the top priority worldwide[MASK] is being[MASK] appreciated for your work [MASK] so do i get a thank you [MASK] not only once a year with the annual bonus payment <unk> but every day <unk> [MASK] and now <unk> our global workforce crisis becomes very personal people[MASK] <unk> are looking for recognition aren 't we all looking for recognition in our jobs <unk> [MASK] now <unk> let me connect the dots <unk> [MASK] we will face a global workforce crisis which consists of an overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch <unk> plus a big[MASK] cultural challenge and this global workforce crisis is approaching very[MASK] <unk> fast <unk> right now we are just at the turning point <unk> so what can we what can governments what can companies do [MASK] every company <unk> but also every country <unk> needs a people strategy and to act on it immediately <unk> [MASK] and such a people strategy consists of four parts number one a plan for how to forecast supply and demand[MASK] for different jobs and different skills workforce planning will become more important than financial planning [MASK] two a plan for how to attract great people <unk> generation y <unk> women but also retirees [MASK] three a plan for how to educate and[MASK] <unk> there 's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us [MASK] and four for how to retain the best people <unk> or in other words how to realize an appreciation[MASK] and relationship culture <unk> [MASK] however one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes [MASK] <unk> not head counts <unk> not machines <unk> not even the germans <unk> thank you[MASK]
