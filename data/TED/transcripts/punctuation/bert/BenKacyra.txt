 <unk> i 'd like to start with a short story it 's about a little boy[MASK] whose father was[MASK] a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis[MASK] on the outskirts of their camp [MASK] they would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls but at the same time they excited him [MASK] and the dad used to use those bulls to tell the[MASK] <unk> to the san francisco bay area many decades later where i started a technology company that brought the world[MASK] its first 3d laser scanning system let me show you how it works female voice long range laser scanning[MASK] <unk> with two mirrors the scanner calculates the beam 's horizontal and vertical angles <unk> giving accurate x <unk> y and z coordinates [MASK] the point is then recorded into a 3d visualization program [MASK] all of this happens in seconds[MASK] <unk> you can see here these systems are extremely fast they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution [MASK] a surveyor with[MASK] traditional survey tools would be hard pressed to produce maybe five hundred points in a whole day [MASK] these babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second [MASK] so[MASK] <unk> can imagine this was a paradigm shift in the[MASK] survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry [MASK] approximately ten years ago my wife and i started a foundation to do good <unk> and right about that[MASK] <unk> magnificent bamiyan buddhas hundred and eighty foot tall in afghanistan [MASK] were blown up by the taliban <unk> they were gone in an instant and unfortunately there was no detailed documentation of these buddhas <unk> this clearly devastated <unk>[MASK] <unk> me and i couldn 't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends <unk> the winged bulls and the fate[MASK] <unk> heritage sites all over the world both my wife and i were so touched by this[MASK] that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation[MASK] to[MASK] include digital heritage preservation of world sites [MASK] we called the project cyark which stands for cyber archive [MASK] to date with the help of a global network of partners we 've completed[MASK] close to fifty projects <unk> let me show you some of them <unk> chichen itza <unk> rapa nui[MASK] and what you 're seeing here are the cloud of points[MASK] babylon <unk> [MASK] rosslyn chapel <unk> [MASK] pompeii <unk> [MASK] and our latest project mt rushmore <unk> which happened to be one of our most challenging projects as you see here <unk> we had to develop[MASK] a special rig[MASK] to bring the scanner up close and personal the results of our work in the field[MASK] are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers we also[MASK] produce media for dissemination to the public[MASK] free through the[MASK] <unk> cyark website <unk> these would be used for education cultural tourism <unk> etc what you 're looking at in here[MASK] is a 3d viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of [ the ] cloud of points in real time <unk> cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions <unk> this happens to be the cloud of points for tikal <unk> [MASK] in here you see a traditional[MASK] 2d architectural engineering drawing that 's used for preservation <unk> [MASK] and of course we tell the stories through fly throughs and here this is a fly through the cloud of points of tikal <unk> and here you see it[MASK] rendered and photo textured with the photography that we take of the site and so this is not a video this is actual[MASK] <unk> two to three millimeter accuracy [MASK] and of course the data can be used to develop 3d models that are very accurate and very detailed and here you 're looking at <unk>[MASK] <unk> a model that 's extracted from the cloud of points for stirling castle it 's used for studies for visualization as well as for education[MASK] <unk> apps that include narrated virtual tools <unk> [MASK] the more i got involved in the heritage field <unk> the more it became clear to me that we are[MASK] losing the sites[MASK] and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them[MASK] <unk> of course [MASK] earthquakes and all the natural phenomena floods <unk> tornadoes etc [MASK] take their toll <unk> [MASK] however <unk> what occurred to me was human caused destruction <unk> which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction <unk> but actually it was accelerating [MASK] this includes arson <unk> [MASK] <unk> acid rain not to mention terrorism and wars [MASK] it was getting more and more apparent that we 're fighting a losing battle we 're losing our sites[MASK] and the stories <unk> and basically we 're losing[MASK] a piece and a significant piece of our collective memory imagine us as a human race[MASK] not knowing where we came from luckily[MASK] <unk> the last two or three decades digital technologies have been developing[MASK] that have helped us to develop tools that we 've brought to bear in the digital preservation in our digital preservation war this includes [MASK] for example the 3d[MASK] laser scanning systems <unk> [MASK] <unk> digital photography not to mention the internet because of this accelerated pace of destruction <unk> [MASK] it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners[MASK] to accelerate our work and we created a project we call the cyark five hundred challenge[MASK] and that is to digitally preserve[MASK] <unk> five hundred world heritage sites in five years <unk> we do have the technology that 's scaleable and[MASK] our network of global partners[MASK] has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate so we 're comfortable that this task can[MASK] <unk> to me the five hundred is really just the first five hundred [MASK] in order to sustain our work into the future <unk> we use technology centers[MASK] where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them <unk> whereby they[MASK] <unk> then can help us[MASK] with digital preservation of their heritage sites and at the same time it gives them[MASK] the technology to benefit from in the future <unk> [MASK] let me close with another short story two years ago <unk> we were approached by a partner of ours[MASK] to digitally preserve an important heritage site a unesco heritage site in uganda <unk> [MASK] the royal kasubi tombs the work was done[MASK] <unk> in the field <unk> [MASK] and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the cyark website <unk> last march <unk> [MASK] we received very sad news <unk> the royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson a few days[MASK] <unk> we received a call is the data available[MASK] and can it be used for reconstruction [MASK] our answer of course was yes <unk> [MASK] let me leave you with a final thought [MASK] our heritage is much more than our collective memory[MASK] it 's our collective treasure we owe it to our children our grandchildren and the generations[MASK] we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along thank you[MASK] <unk> i 'm staying here because[MASK] we wanted to demonstrate to you[MASK] the power of this technology and so while i 've been speaking you[MASK] have been scanned [MASK] the two wizards that i have that are behind[MASK] <unk> the curtain will help me bring the results on the[MASK] <unk> and of course you can fly through the cloud of points you can[MASK] look at it from on top from the ceiling you can look from different vantage points but i 'm going to ask doug to zoom in on[MASK] an individual in the crowd just to show the amount of detail that we can create [MASK] so you have been digitally preserved in about[MASK] <unk> about four minutes i 'd like to[MASK] thank the wizards here[MASK] <unk> we were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this the[MASK] historic scotland <unk> and the glasgow school of art <unk> i 'd like to also thank personally the[MASK] efforts of[MASK] david mitchell who is the director of conservation at historic scotland <unk> david [MASK] and doug pritchard who 's the head of visualization at the glasgow school of art <unk> let 's give them a hand[MASK]
