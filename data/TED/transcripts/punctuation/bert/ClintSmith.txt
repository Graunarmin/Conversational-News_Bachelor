<unk> it was best to listen to my parents even when i didn 't exactly understand why and[MASK] it 's not that they didn 't want me to think critically their parenting always sought to reconcile the tension between having my siblings and i understand the realities of the world [MASK] while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo[MASK] <unk> as inevitable i came to realize that this in and of itself was a very purposeful form of education one[MASK] of my favorite educators <unk> brazilian author and scholar paulo freire <unk> speaks quite explicitly[MASK] about the need for education to be used as a tool for critical awakening[MASK] and shared humanity in his most famous book pedagogy of the oppressed he states no one can be authentically human[MASK] while he prevents others from

understand in the way that i do now i think of how hard it must have been how profoundly unfair it must have felt[MASK] for them to feel like they had to strip away parts of my childhood[MASK] just so that i could come home at night [MASK] <unk> think of how one night <unk> when i was around twelve years old on an overnight field trip to another city [MASK] my friends and i bought super <unk>

synonymous with[MASK] <unk> to be feared <unk> but what does it do to a child[MASK] to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child [MASK] that the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath that you cannot simply be curious that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake that someone 's implicit bias might be the reason you don 't wake up in the morning <unk> [MASK] but this cannot be what defines us because we have parents who raised us to understand that our bodies[MASK] <unk> weren 't meant for the backside of a bullet <unk> but for flying kites and jumping rope <unk> and laughing until our stomachs burst we had teachers who taught us how to raise our hands in class <unk> and not just to signal surrender <unk>[MASK] and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we aren 't worthy of this world so when we say that black lives matter it 's not because others don 't it 's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear when so many things tell us we are not i want to live in a world[MASK] <unk> where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born where a toy in his hand isn 't mistaken for anything other
