 <unk> silicon valley is obsessed with disruption [MASK] but these days <unk> the biggest disruptor didn 't come out of silicon valley <unk> [MASK] it came out of steel towns in ohio <unk> rural communities in pennsylvania <unk> [MASK] the panhandle in florida[MASK] and this last us presidential election[MASK] was the mother of all disruptions [MASK] once again <unk> politics is personal [MASK] millions of americans became activists overnight <unk> [MASK] pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time [MASK] the election has done to family holiday dinners what uber has done to new york city[MASK] <unk> system <unk> couples have broken up and marriages disrupted <unk> [MASK] and the election is doing to my private life what amazon is doing to shopping malls <unk> [MASK] these days the aclu is on the front lines twenty four seven <unk> [MASK] and even if i manage to sneak away for a couple of miles on the treadmill <unk> [MASK] any cardio benefit i get is[MASK] <unk> instantly obliterated when i read another presidential tweet on the headline scroll even my secret pleasure[MASK] of studying the italian painters have been infected by politics [MASK] now i study <unk> even stalk the old masters this is my desk with a postcard exhibition[MASK] of some famous and obscure paintings mostly from the italian[MASK] <unk> renaissance <unk> [MASK] now art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly burly of politics in my daily work at the aclu but not anymore [MASK] i was at the women 's march in san francisco the day after inauguration <unk> [MASK] and the crowd was chanting this is what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like [MASK] and there i was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain and i[MASK] <unk> flashed on an old painting[MASK] that first captivated me many years ago i struggled to remember the different pieces[MASK] of an actual painting[MASK] of good and bad government it was almost like the old master was taunting me you want to know what democracy looks like[MASK] <unk> go back and look at my frescoes <unk> and so i did in <unk>[MASK] ambrogio lorenzetti finished a monumental commission[MASK] in the governing council chamber of siena 's palazzo pubblico [MASK] it 's a painting that speaks to us even screams to us today [MASK] art is a lie that makes us[MASK] <unk> pablo picasso once said and as we search for the truth about government we should keep ambrogio 's work not a lie[MASK] but an allegory in our collective mind 's eye <unk> during lorenzetti 's time the political legitimacy of italian <unk>[MASK] was often on very shaky ground siena was a republic <unk> but there had been enormous unrest in the two decades leading up to the commission [MASK] siena 's political leaders who would literally govern[MASK] under the eyes of these allegorical figures were lorenzetti 's intended audience [MASK] he was cataloging the obligations of the governing[MASK] to the governed <unk> now <unk> you can spend years studying these frescoes some scholars have i 'm hardly an art historian[MASK] <unk> and a work this massive can overwhelm me so first i focus on the big stuff <unk> [MASK] this is the allegory of good government <unk> the majestic figure here in the middle[MASK] is dressed in siena 's colors[MASK] and he personifies the republic itself lorenzetti labels him [MASK] <unk> and he 's basically telling the sienese that they <unk> and not a king or a tyrant must rule themselves <unk> now surrounding commune[MASK] are his advisors [MASK] justice is enthroned <unk> she 's looking up at the figure of wisdom who actually supports her scales of justice[MASK] <unk> holds a string that comes off the scales of justice that binds her to the citizens making them all compatriots in the republic [MASK] and finally we see peace she looks chilled out like she 's listening to bob marley <unk> [MASK] when good government rules peace doesn 't break a sweat now[MASK] these are big images and big ideas <unk> but i really love the small stuff[MASK] along another wall lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government[MASK] on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people with a series of delicious little details [MASK] in the countryside the hills are landscaped and farmed <unk> [MASK] crops are being sown[MASK] <unk> all in one picture <unk> [MASK] crops and livestock are being brought to market in the city builders raise a tower [MASK] people attend a law lecture a ted talk of the 14th century[MASK] <unk> dancers larger than life dance with joy <unk> [MASK] and watching over the republic is the winged figure security <unk> [MASK] whose banner reads everyone shall go forth freely without fear [MASK] now what 's amazing about these images from eight hundred years ago is that they 're familiar to us today we see what democracy looks like we experience the[MASK] <unk> effects of good government in our lives just as lorenzetti did in his life [MASK] but it is the allegory of bad government that has been haunting me since november nine <unk> [MASK] it 's badly damaged <unk> but it reads like today 's newspapers <unk> and ruling over bad government is not the commune[MASK] but the tyrant <unk> he has horns[MASK] <unk> eyes braided hair <unk> he obviously spends a lot of time on that hair justice[MASK] now lies helpless at his feet <unk> shackled her scales have been severed [MASK] justice is the key antagonist to the tyrant <unk> and she 's been taken out <unk> [MASK] now surrounding the tyrant lorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government[MASK] <unk> avarice is the old woman clutching the <unk>[MASK] and a fisherman 's hook to pull in her fortune[MASK] vainglory carries a mirror <unk> [MASK] and lorenzetti warns us against narcissistic leaders who are guided by their own ego and vanity [MASK] on the tyrant 's right is cruelty[MASK] treason half lamb half scorpion <unk> lulls us into a false sense of security and then poisons a republic [MASK] fraud with the flighty wings of a bat [MASK] on the tyrant 's left you see division[MASK] <unk> she 's dressed in siena 's colors si and no are painted on her body [MASK] she uses a carpenter 's saw to chop her body in half and[MASK] fury wields the weapons of the mob <unk> the stone and knife in[MASK] the remainder of the fresco lorenzetti[MASK] <unk> shows us the inevitable effects of bad government <unk> [MASK] the civic ideals celebrated elsewhere in this room have failed us <unk> and we see it [MASK] the once beautiful city has fallen to pieces the countryside barren <unk> the farms abandoned many are in flames [MASK] and in the sky above is not the winged figure[MASK] <unk> but that of fear <unk> whose banner reads none shall pass along this road[MASK] without fear of death [MASK] now the final image the most important one really is one that lorenzetti did not paint it is of the viewer <unk> [MASK] today the audience for lorenzetti 's frescoes is not the governing[MASK] but the governed <unk> the individual who stands in front of his allegories and walks away with insight who[MASK] <unk> heeds a call to action lorenzetti warns us that we must recognize the shadows of avarice fraud division <unk> even tyranny[MASK] when they float across our political landscape <unk> [MASK] especially when those shadows are cast by political leaders loudly claiming to be the voice of good government and promising to make america great again <unk> [MASK] and we must act[MASK] democracy must not be a spectator sport <unk> the right to protest the right to assemble freely the right to petition one 's government [MASK] these are not just rights in the face of avarice fraud and division <unk> these are obligations [MASK] we have to disrupt [MASK] we have to disrupt our lives so that we can[MASK] <unk> disrupt the amoral accretion of power by those who would betray our values we and we the people[MASK] must raise justice up[MASK] and must bring peace to our nation and must come together in concord <unk> and we have a choice [MASK] we could either paint ourselves into the worst nightmare of lorenzetti 's bad government [MASK] or we can stay[MASK] <unk> in the streets disruptive messy <unk> loud that is what democracy looks like[MASK] you spoke to many people passionately here i 'm sure there are other people here who 'd say look [MASK] trump was elected by sixty three million people he 's far from perfect <unk> but he 's trying to do what he was elected to do <unk> shouldn 't you give him a chance anthony[MASK] romero i think we have to recognize[MASK] the legitimacy of him as president[MASK] versus the legitimacy of his policies <unk> and when so many of the policies[MASK] are contrary to fundamental values <unk> that we 're all equal under the law that we 're not judged by the color of our skin or the religion we worship[MASK] we have to contest those values[MASK] even as we recognize and honor the fact that our democracy rendered us a president who[MASK] is championing those values[MASK] <unk> you 're making other arguments as well[MASK] very often we piss everyone off at one point that 's what we do <unk> and we recently were[MASK] taking stands for why ann coulter needs to be able to speak at berkeley <unk> and why milo has free speech rights <unk> and we even wrote a blog that[MASK] almost burnt the house down among some of our members <unk> unfortunately when we talked about the fact that[MASK] even donald[MASK] <unk> trump has free speech rights as president and an effort to hold him accountable for incitement of violence at his marches or his rallies[MASK] is unconstitutional and un american and[MASK] when you put that statement out there to a very frothy base that always is very excited for you to fight donald trump and then you have a new one[MASK] <unk> these rights are for everybody <unk> even the president that we don 't like and that 's our job ca anthony [MASK] you spoke to so many of us so powerfully thank you so much[MASK]
