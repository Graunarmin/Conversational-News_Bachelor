 <unk> the portuguese arrived in latin america about five hundred years ago <unk> they obviously found this amazing tropical forest [MASK] and among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before they found one species that caught their attention very quickly [MASK] this species[MASK] <unk> you cut the the bark you find a very dark red resin[MASK] that was very good[MASK] to paint and[MASK] dye fabric to make clothes <unk> [MASK] the indigenous people called this species pau brasil <unk> and that 's the reason why this land became land of brasil and[MASK] <unk> that 's the only country in the world that has the name[MASK] of a tree <unk> so you can imagine that it 's very cool to be a forester in brazil <unk> among other reasons [MASK] forest products are all around us <unk> apart from all those products the forest is very important for climate regulation [MASK] in brazil <unk> almost seventy percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the[MASK] <unk> just the amazon pumps to the atmosphere[MASK] twenty billion tons of water every day <unk> this is more than what the amazon river [MASK] which is the largest river in the world puts in the sea per day <unk> which is seventeen billion tons <unk> if we had to boil water to[MASK] <unk> we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world <unk> [MASK] so it 's a hell of a service for all of us <unk> [MASK] we have in the world about four billion hectares of forests [MASK] this is more or less china u s canada and brazil all together in terms of size to have an idea [MASK] three quarters of that is in the temperate zone and just one quarter[MASK] is in the tropics <unk> but this one quarter one billion hectares <unk> holds most of the biodiversity <unk> [MASK] and very importantly fifty percent of the living biomass <unk> the carbon <unk> [MASK] now we used to have six billion hectares of forest fifty percent more than what we have two thousand years ago [MASK] we 've actually lost two billion hectares in the last two thousand years[MASK] but in the last[MASK] one hundred years <unk> we lost half of that [MASK] that was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests to deforestation of tropical forests <unk> [MASK] so think of this in one hundred years we lost the same amount of forest in the[MASK] <unk> in two thousand years in temperate forests that 's the speed of the destruction that we are having now brazil[MASK] is an important piece of this puzzle [MASK] we have the second largest forest in the world just after russia <unk> it means twelve percent of all the world 's forests are in brazil <unk> [MASK] most of that in the amazon it 's the largest piece of forest we have it 's a very big large area you can see that you could fit many of the european countries there [MASK] we still have eighty percent[MASK] <unk> the forest cover that 's the good news <unk> but we lost fifteen percent in just thirty years <unk> [MASK] so if you go with that speed very soon we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the amazon that regulates our climate [MASK] deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end[MASK] <unk> square kilometers in one year <unk> this is two point seven million hectares it 's almost like half of costa rica[MASK] every year <unk> so at this moment this is two thousand and three two thousand and four i[MASK] i happened to be coming to work in in the government <unk> [MASK] and together with other teammates in the national forest department [MASK] we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation and make a plan to combat that at a national level involving the local governments <unk> the civil society business [MASK] <unk> that could tackle those causes <unk> so we came up with this[MASK] plan with one hundred and forty four actions in different areas <unk> now i will go through all of them one by one no[MASK] just giving some examples of what[MASK] we had done in in the next few years <unk> so the first thing <unk> we set up a system with the national space agency that[MASK] could actually see where deforestation is happening almost in real time so now in brazil we have this system deter where every month or every two months we <unk>[MASK] <unk> get information on where deforestation is happening so we can actually act when it 's happening <unk> [MASK] we saw and sell <unk> and all the revenue becomes a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities[MASK] as an endowment fund [MASK] this also allows us to make a big operation to seize corruption and illegal activities that ended up having seven hundred people in prison <unk> including[MASK] <unk> a lot of public servants [MASK] then we made the connection that areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance <unk> so we cut this through the bank system[MASK] and then linked this to the end users so supermarkets <unk> the slaughterhouses and so on that buy products from illegal clear cut areas they also can be liable for <unk>[MASK] the deforestation so making all these connections to help to push the problem down [MASK] land tenure issues it 's very important for conflicts fifty million hectares of protected areas were created which is an area <unk>[MASK] <unk> the size of spain and of those eight million were indigenous indigenous lands <unk> now we start to see[MASK] results <unk> so in the last ten years deforestation came down in brazil[MASK] seventy five percent [MASK] so[MASK] if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade[MASK] <unk> we saved eight point seven million hectares <unk> which is the size of austria <unk> [MASK] but more importantly <unk> it avoided[MASK] <unk> of three billion tons of co2 in the atmosphere this is[MASK] by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until today as a positive action [MASK] one may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease to push down deforestation you will have an economic impact[MASK] because you will not have economic activity or something like that but it 's interesting to know that it 's quite the opposite <unk> in fact in the period[MASK] <unk> have the deepest decline of deforestation <unk> the economy grew on average double from the previous decade when deforestation was actually going up <unk> [MASK] so it 's a good lesson for us <unk> maybe this is completely disconnected <unk> as we just learned by having deforestation come down [MASK] now this is all good news[MASK] <unk> quite an achievement and we obviously should be very proud about that[MASK] <unk> but it 's not even close to sufficient <unk> [MASK] in fact if you think about the deforestation in the amazon in two thousand and thirteen that was over half a million hectares <unk> [MASK] which means that every minute[MASK] an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the amazon last year <unk> just[MASK] <unk> if we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in brazil <unk> we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world it[MASK] 's more or less like we are forest heroes <unk> but still deforestation champions <unk> [MASK] so we can 't be satisfied not even close to satisfied so the next step <unk> i think is to fight[MASK] <unk> to have zero loss of forest cover in brazil[MASK] and to have that as a goal for two thousand and twenty [MASK] that 's our next step now i 've always been interested in the relationship between climate change and forests first because[MASK] fifteen percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation <unk> so it 's a big part of the problem <unk> [MASK] but also forests can be a big part of the solution since that 's the best way we know to sink[MASK] carbon now there is another relationship of climate and forests that really stuck me in two thousand and eight and made me change my career from forests to working with climate change <unk> [MASK] i went to visit canada in british columbia <unk> together with[MASK] the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a[MASK] <unk> when we were there we we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in canada <unk> what we see here those[MASK] brown trees these are really dead trees they are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the[MASK] <unk> that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter for many years now they don 't have the sufficient cold weather to actually[MASK] control the population of this beetle and it became a disease that is[MASK] really killing billions of trees <unk> so i came back with this notion that the forest is actually one of the earliest and most[MASK] affected victims of climate change[MASK] <unk> so i was thinking if i succeed[MASK] in working with all my colleagues to actually[MASK] help to stop deforestation maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change <unk>[MASK] by floods <unk> heat <unk> fires and so on <unk> so i decided to leave the forest service[MASK] <unk> the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward <unk> the goal is very clear we[MASK] want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees <unk> [MASK] there are several reasons for that i will not get into that now <unk> but in order to get to[MASK] <unk> on climate change <unk> defines that we have a budget of emissions of one thousand billion tons of <unk>[MASK] from now until the end of the century <unk> [MASK] so if we divide this by the number of years what we have is an average budget of eleven billion tons of[MASK] <unk> now what is one ton of co2 it 's more or less what one small car <unk> running twenty kilometers[MASK] a day <unk> will emit in one year <unk> [MASK] or it 's one flight one way from so paulo to johannesburg or to london one way two ways two tons [MASK] so eleven billion tons is twice that now[MASK] the emissions today[MASK] <unk> are fifty billion tons <unk> and it 's growing it 's growing and maybe it will be <unk>[MASK] by two thousand and twenty <unk> now we need to go down to ten by two thousand and fifty [MASK] and while this happens the population will grow from seven to nine billion people the economy will grow from sixty trillion dollars in two thousand and ten to two hundred trillion dollars [MASK] and so what we need to do[MASK] is to[MASK] be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person [MASK] per year <unk> into something like one [MASK] you have to choose[MASK] you take the the airplane or you have a car <unk> so the question is can we make it <unk> and[MASK] 's the exactly the same question i got when i was[MASK] developing a plan to combat deforestation it 's such a big problem <unk> so complex can we really do it <unk> [MASK] i think so [MASK] think of this deforestation means sixty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in brazil in the last decade <unk> now it 's a little bit less than thirty percent in the world[MASK] sixty percent is[MASK] <unk> so if we can tackle[MASK] directly the energy the same way we could tackle deforestation maybe we can have a chance <unk> [MASK] so there are five things that i think we should we should do first we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions we don 't need to <unk>[MASK] <unk> all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy that 's what we proved when we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow same thing[MASK] <unk> could happen in the in the energy sector <unk> [MASK] second we have to move the incentives to the right place today five hundred billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels [MASK] why don 't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy <unk> [MASK] third <unk> we need to measure and make it transparent where when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so[MASK] have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities <unk> fourth <unk> we need to leapfrog the routes of development <unk> [MASK] which means you don 't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones same way we don 't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don 't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy[MASK] <unk> and fifth and last we need to share responsibility between governments <unk> business and civil society [MASK] there is work to do for everybody and we need to have everybody on board <unk> [MASK] so to finalize i think[MASK] the future is not like a fate[MASK] that you have to just go as business as usual goes <unk> [MASK] we need to have the courage to actually change the route invest in something new think that we can actually change the route i think we are[MASK] <unk> doing this with deforestation in brazil and i hope we can do it also with climate change in the world[MASK]
