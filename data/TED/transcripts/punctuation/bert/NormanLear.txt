grandfather was that[MASK] <unk> when i started to write my memoir even this how about that even this i get to experience [MASK] when i started to write the memoir and i started to think about it[MASK] i[MASK] i i did a reasonable amount of crying <unk> and i realized how much i needed the father <unk> [MASK] so much so that i appropriated arthur marshall 's grandfather <unk> [MASK] so much so the word father i have six kids by the way my favorite role in life[MASK] it and husband to my wife lyn <unk> [MASK] but i stole the man 's identity because i needed the father [MASK] now i 've gone through a whole lot of shit[MASK] and come out on the other side and i forgive my father the best thing i the worst thing i the[MASK] word i[MASK] <unk> use about him and think about him is he was a rascal the fact that he lied and stole and cheated[MASK] and went to prison <unk> [MASK] i submerge that in the word rascal eh well there 's a saying that amateurs[MASK] <unk> quote is widely attributed to john lennon but it turns out he stole it from t s eliot so you 're in good company <unk>[MASK] i want to talk about your work obviously the impact of your work has been written about and i 'm sure you 've heard about it all your life what it meant to people what it meant to our culture you heard the applause when i just named the names of the shows[MASK] <unk> raised half the people in the room[MASK] through your work but have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work that surprised you nl oh god[MASK] surprised me and delighted me from head to toe <unk> there was an evening with norman[MASK] <unk> and the world of hip hop have in common <unk> russell simmons was among seven on the stage[MASK] <unk> the show that was a number five show he was talking about[MASK] a simple thing that made a big eh [MASK] <unk> an impact on him i was hesitating over the word change it 's hard for me to imagine you[MASK] know changing somebody 's life but that 's the way he put it he saw george jefferson write a check[MASK] on the jeffersons and[MASK] he never knew that a black man could write a check and he says <unk> it just impacted his life so[MASK] it changed his life[MASK] and[MASK] when i hear things like that little things[MASK] because i i know that there isn 't anybody in this audience that wasn 't likely responsible today[MASK] for some little thing they did for somebody [MASK] whether it 's as little as a smile or an unexpected hello that 's how little this thing was <unk> [MASK] it could have been[MASK] <unk> been the the dresser of the set who put the checkbook on the thing and george[MASK] had nothing to do while he was speaking so he wrote it i don 't know but eh so in addition to the long list i shared in the beginning i should have also mentioned that you invented[MASK] <unk> you 've lead a life of accomplishment but you 've also built a life of meaning <unk> and all of us strive to do both of those things not all of us manage to [MASK] but even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those very rarely do we figure out how to do them together <unk> you managed to push culture forward[MASK] <unk> through your art while also achieving world beating commercial success how did you do both[MASK] nl here 's where my mind goes when i hear that recitation of all i accomplished[MASK] <unk> in a universe of which there are billions[MASK] billions of universes billions of planets[MASK] <unk> which we 're trying to save and it requires saving [MASK] but anything i may have accomplished is[MASK] <unk> my sister once asked me[MASK] what she does about something that was going on in[MASK] newington connecticut and i said write your alderman or your mayor or something she said well i 'm not[MASK] norman lear i 'm claire lear and that was the first time i[MASK] said what i 'm saying i said claire with everything you think about what i may have done and everything you 've done she never left newington[MASK] can you get your fingers close enough when you consider[MASK] the size of the planet and[MASK] so forth to measure anything i may have done to anything you may have done so [MASK] i am convinced we 're all responsible[MASK] for doing as much as i may have accomplished[MASK] <unk> to really buy into the size and scope of the creator 's enterprise here eh but here on this planet you have really really mattered nl i 'm a son of a gun [MASK] eh so i have one more question for you how old do you feel[MASK] <unk> years old but i hope to one day feel as young as the person i 'm sitting across from ladies and gentlemen the incomparable norman lear[MASK]
