and if you 're still happily sleeping solo <unk> why should you stop what you 're doing and make it your life 's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest[MASK] <unk> researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out [MASK] they stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism <unk> and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends <unk> [MASK] and it turns out the success stories share a few similarities beyond that they don 't have sex with other people [MASK] for instance in the happiest marriages[MASK] <unk> wife is thinner and better looking than the husband obvious right it 's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women[MASK] we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex [MASK] ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are[MASK] <unk> the beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy we just have to be thinner than our partners[MASK] so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising <unk> we just need to wait for them to get fat [MASK] maybe bake a few pies this is good information to have and it 's not that complicated [MASK] research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives[MASK] <unk> for example the happy wife instead of pointing out her husband 's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run she might say [MASK] wow honey <unk> thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner [MASK] these are couples who can find good in any situation yeah <unk> it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire [MASK] but it 's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars[MASK] <unk> and it 's a good thing you 've got all that body fat to keep us warm [MASK] one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do housework <unk> the more attractive his wife will find him <unk> [MASK] because we needed a study to tell us this [MASK] laughter but here 's what 's going on here <unk> the more attractive she finds him the more sex they have the more sex they have the nicer he is to her the[MASK] <unk> nicer he is to her <unk> the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed and ultimately they live happily ever after [MASK] in other words <unk> men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department [MASK] here 's an interesting one one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs[MASK] are less likely to get a divorce this is an actual study[MASK] <unk> and let me clarify <unk> the researchers were not looking at documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals the data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures [MASK] now <unk> i don 't know how old all of you are but when i was a kid your parents took[MASK] <unk> they didn 't take three hundred shots of you in that rapid fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest smiliest one for the christmas card [MASK] no they dressed you up they lined you up and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday[MASK] <unk> i have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and[MASK] i 'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce [MASK] so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage do not win an oscar for best actress [MASK] i 'm serious <unk> bettie davis joan crawford <unk> halle berry hilary swank sandra bullock[MASK] <unk> reese witherspoon all of them single soon after taking home that statue they actually call it the oscar curse it is the marriage kiss of death

plummet [MASK] laughter apparently[MASK] <unk> bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasn 't and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in

like we 've got it pretty good [MASK] <unk> i can 't tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline <unk> but here 's a scary one divorce is contagious that[MASK] 's right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent now <unk> i have to say i don 't get this one at all my husband and i have watched quite a few friends[MASK] divide their assets[MASK] and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and viagra and eharmony and[MASK] i 'm thinking they 've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could <unk> so now you may be wondering why does anyone[MASK] <unk> the us federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone 's spouse [MASK] a list that includes visitation rights in jail but hopefully you 'll never need that one[MASK] but beyond the profound federal perks married people make more money we[MASK] 're healthier <unk> physically and emotionally we produce happier more stable and more successful kids[MASK] we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not [MASK] we
