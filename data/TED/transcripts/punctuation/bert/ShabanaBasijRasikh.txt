 <unk> i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house [MASK] my father was listening to bbc news on his small gray radio <unk> [MASK] there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly[MASK] <unk> depressed him [MASK] the taliban are gone my father shouted <unk> [MASK] i didn 't know what it meant <unk> but i could see that my father was very very happy [MASK] you can go to a real school now he said [MASK] a morning that i[MASK] <unk> will never forget [MASK] a real school [MASK] you see i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school [MASK] so for the next five years i dressed as a boy[MASK] to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school[MASK] it was the only way we both could be educated[MASK] <unk> each day we took a different route[MASK] so that no one would suspect where we were going we[MASK] would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping [MASK] the school was in a house <unk> more than one[MASK] <unk> hundred of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer [MASK] we all knew we were risking our lives the teacher <unk> the students and our parents [MASK] from time to time the school would suddenly be canceled[MASK] for a week because taliban were suspicious [MASK] we always wondered what they knew about us were we being followed [MASK] do they know where we live [MASK] we were scared <unk> but still school was where we wanted to be [MASK] i was very lucky to[MASK] <unk> grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured [MASK] my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time [MASK] a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan <unk> he insisted that his daughter my mom [MASK] go to school and for that he was disowned by his father <unk> [MASK] but my educated mother became a teacher[MASK] <unk> there she is [MASK] she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood <unk> [MASK] and my father[MASK] that 's him[MASK] he was the first ever in his family to receive an education <unk> [MASK] there was no question that his children would[MASK] receive an education <unk> including his daughters <unk> [MASK] despite the taliban <unk> despite the risks to him <unk> there was greater risk in not[MASK] educating his children [MASK] during taliban years i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life[MASK] and always being scared and not seeing a future i would want to quit <unk> [MASK] but my father [MASK] he would say [MASK] listen my daughter [MASK] you can lose everything you own in your life [MASK] your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war <unk> but the one thing that will always remain with you[MASK] <unk> you is what is here [MASK] and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will [MASK] so do you still not want to continue [MASK] today i am twenty two i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war[MASK] fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school [MASK] and had my family not been so committed to my education i would be one of them <unk> [MASK] instead <unk> i stand here a proud graduate of middlebury college[MASK] <unk> when i returned to afghanistan <unk> [MASK] my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me <unk> [MASK] he not only brags about my college degree but also that i was the first woman and that i am the first woman to drive him through[MASK] <unk> my family believes in me <unk> i dream big <unk> but my family dreams even bigger for me that 's why[MASK] i am a global ambassador for 10x10 a global campaign to educate women [MASK] that 's why i cofounded sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan[MASK] <unk> a country where it 's still risky for girls to go to school the exciting thing is that i see students at my school[MASK] with ambition grabbing at opportunity <unk> [MASK] and i see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them[MASK] in the face of daunting opposition [MASK] like ahmed that 's not his real name <unk> and i cannot show you his face [MASK] but ahmed is the father of one of my students [MASK] less than a month ago <unk> he[MASK] and his daughter[MASK] were on on their way from sola to their village and[MASK] they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb[MASK] by minutes as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him[MASK] that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again [MASK] kill me now if you wish[MASK] <unk> will not ruin my daughter 's future because of your old and backward ideas [MASK] what i 've come to realize about afghanistan [MASK] and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most most of us who succeed[MASK] is a father[MASK] <unk> recognizes the value in his daughter[MASK] and who sees that her success is his success [MASK] it 's not to say that our mothers aren 't key[MASK] in our success in fact they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters[MASK] <unk> but in the context of a society like in afghanistan we must have the support of men [MASK] under the taliban[MASK] <unk> girls who went to school[MASK] numbered in the hundreds remember it was illegal <unk> [MASK] but today <unk> [MASK] more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan [MASK] <unk> looks so different from here in america <unk> i find that americans see the fragility[MASK] in changes <unk> i fear that these changes will not last[MASK] much beyond the u s troops ' withdrawal <unk> [MASK] but when i am back in afghanistan <unk> when i see[MASK] the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them[MASK] <unk> i see a promising future[MASK] and lasting change [MASK] to me afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities <unk> [MASK] and every single day the girls of sola remind me of that[MASK] <unk> they are dreaming big[MASK]
