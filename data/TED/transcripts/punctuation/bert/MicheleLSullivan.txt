 <unk> have milestones in life that we remember so vividly [MASK] the first one for me was when i was entering kindergarten my big brother was in school and by golly it was my time[MASK] <unk> and i went trottin ' down that hallway <unk> i was so excited i almost wet myself <unk> and i go to the door and there was the teacher with a warm welcome[MASK] and she took me into the classroom <unk> showed me my little cubbyhole we all remember those little cubbyholes don 't we and we put our stuff in there [MASK] and then she said go over to the circle and play with the kids until class starts [MASK] so i went over there and plopped down like[MASK] <unk> and i 'm playing and all of a sudden the boy next to me he was wearing[MASK] a white shirt with blue shorts i remember it like it was yesterday <unk> suddenly he stopped playing and he said why are you so short [MASK] and i just kept playing i didn 't think he was talking to me [MASK] and in a louder voice he said hey <unk> why are you so short so i looked up and i said <unk> what are you talking about[MASK] <unk> been waiting for this [MASK] and so we played and about a minute later the girl next to him in a white shirt and a pink skirt stood up put her hands on her hips and said [MASK] yeah why do you look so different [MASK] and i went what are you talking about i don 't look different i 'm not short <unk> again let 's just play[MASK] <unk> about this time i looked all around the circle i was in and all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me[MASK] and i 'm thinking[MASK] in today 's language it would be omg or wtf [MASK] what just happened <unk> [MASK] so all the confidence that i went in with that morning was was withering away as the morning went on and the questions kept coming[MASK] <unk> the end of the morning before i went home [MASK] the teacher had us in a circle and i actually found myself outside of the circle i couldn 't look at anybody <unk> i could not understand what just happened <unk> [MASK] and over the next few years i hated to go out in public i felt every stare every giggle every pointed[MASK] <unk> not the finger <unk> but every pointed finger <unk> and i hated it <unk> i would hide behind my parents ' legs like nobody could see me <unk> [MASK] and as a child you can 't understand another child 's curiosity nor an adult 's ignorance[MASK] it became very apparent to me that the real world was not built[MASK] for someone of my size both literally or figuratively <unk> and so[MASK] i have no anonymity as you[MASK] <unk> can probably tell [MASK] and while you can see my size we all go through many challenges through our lifetime <unk> [MASK] and some you can see like mine most you can 't [MASK] you can 't tell if someone 's dealing with a mental illness [MASK] or they 're struggling with their gender identity they 're caring for an aging parent [MASK] they 're having financial difficulty you can 't see that kind[MASK] <unk> of stuff [MASK] so while you can see one of my challenges is my size <unk> [MASK] seeing does not mean you understand what it 's truly to be me on a daily basis or what i go through [MASK] and so i 'm here to debunk a myth <unk> i do not believe you can walk in someone else 's shoes <unk> [MASK] and because of that we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves[MASK] <unk> stated <unk> i will never know what it 's like to be you and you will never know what it 's like to be me <unk> [MASK] i cannot face your fears or chase your dreams and you can 't do that for me <unk> but we can be supportive of each other [MASK] instead of trying to walk in each other 's shoes we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves[MASK] <unk> i learned at an early age that i did have to do some things different than most people [MASK] but i also learned there were things i was on equal footing with and one of those was the classroom heh heh [MASK] heh i was equal as[MASK] a matter of fact i excelled in the classroom <unk> this was vitally important i discovered as i grew older and realized i wasn 't going to be able to do a physical[MASK] <unk> i needed an education <unk> [MASK] so i went on and got a university degree <unk> [MASK] but i felt to be one step ahead of everyone for employment <unk> i needed to have an advanced university degree <unk> so i went ahead and got that now i 'm ready for my interview <unk> [MASK] remember your first interview what am i going to wear [MASK] what questions and don 't forget that firm handshake <unk> i was right there with you [MASK] <unk> hours before my interview a friend of mine who i 've known all my life[MASK] called and said michele [MASK] the building you 're going in has steps and she knew i couldn 't climb steps <unk> [MASK] so suddenly my focus changed in my shoes <unk> i was worried about how am i going to get there <unk> [MASK] so i went early and found a loading dock and got in and had a great interview <unk> they had no idea what i went through for the day and that 's ok [MASK] you 're probably thinking my greatest challenge that day was the interview[MASK] or getting in the building in reality my biggest challenge that day was getting through the loading dock without getting run over [MASK] i am very vulnerable in certain situations <unk> [MASK] airports hallways <unk> parking lots <unk> loading docks <unk> [MASK] and so i have to be very careful[MASK] i have to anticipate and be flexible[MASK] and move as quickly as i can sometimes <unk> [MASK] so i got the job <unk> and in my current role i travel quite a bit and travel is a challenge for all of us these days <unk> [MASK] and so you probably get to the airport <unk> run through security get to the gate did i get my aisle seat or my window seat did i get my upgrade [MASK] me first[MASK] <unk> i get to experience the personal patdown i won[MASK] 't comment on that [MASK] and then i make my way to the gate <unk> and with my gift of gab that my parents said i was born with [MASK] i talk to the gate agent and then i say by the way my scooter weighs this much <unk> [MASK] i have a dry cell battery <unk> and i can drive it down to the door of the plane[MASK] <unk> the day before i had called the city where i 'm traveling to to find out where i could rent a scooter in case mine gets broken[MASK] on the way <unk> so in my shoes it 's a little bit different [MASK] when i get onto the plane i use my gift of gab to ask the lady to put my bag up and they graciously do [MASK] i try not to eat or drink on a plane because i don 't want to have to get up and walk on the plane <unk> [MASK] but nature has its own schedule[MASK] <unk> not long ago <unk> it knocked and i answered so i walked up to the front of the plane[MASK] and gabbed with the flight attendant and said can you watch the door i can 't reach the lock [MASK] so i 'm in there doing my business and the door flies open <unk> and there 's a gentleman there[MASK] with a look of horror on his face i 'm sure i had the same look [MASK] as i came out i noticed that he was sitting right across from me [MASK] and he 's in total[MASK] complete embarrassment <unk> [MASK] so i walk up to him and i quietly go [MASK] are you going to remember this as much as i am [MASK] and he goes i think so now [MASK] while he 's probably not talking about it publicly i am[MASK] <unk> we talked for the rest of the flight <unk> [MASK] and we got to know each other our families sports work [MASK] and when we landed he said michele i noticed someone put your bag up can i get that for you and i said of course thank you [MASK] and we wished each other well <unk> and the most important thing that day was that he was not going to leave with that embarrassment[MASK] <unk> that experience of embarrassment he won 't forget it and neither will i but i think he[MASK] <unk> remember more[MASK] our chat and our different perspectives [MASK] when you travel internationally it can be even more challenging in certain ways a few years ago i was in zanzibar <unk> [MASK] and i come wheeling in and think about that [MASK] short <unk> white <unk> blond[MASK] woman in a chair that doesn 't probably happen every day <unk> so i go[MASK] <unk> up and with my gift of gab i start to talk to the agent so friendly and i ask about their culture and so forth and i notice there wasn 't a jet bridge <unk> [MASK] so i had to kind of say [MASK] not only do you have to lift my chair <unk> i could use some help getting up the steps so we got to spend about an hour together while we waited for the flight <unk> [MASK] and it was the most magnificent hour our perspective changed for both of us that day[MASK] <unk> and once i got on the flight he patted me on the back and wished me well <unk> [MASK] and i thanked him so much <unk> [MASK] and again i think he 's going to remember that experience more than when i first came in and there was a bit of hesitation <unk> [MASK] and as you notice i get a lot of help i would not be where i am today if it was not for my family my friends my colleagues[MASK] and the many strangers that help me every single day of my life [MASK] and it 's important that we all have a support system asking for help is a strength not a weakness [MASK] we all need help throughout our lifetime[MASK] <unk> as important[MASK] that we are part of other people 's support systems we must adopt that way of giving back [MASK] we all obviously have a role to play in our own successes <unk> [MASK] but think about the role we have to play in other people 's successes just like people do for me every single day [MASK] it 's vitally important that we help each other because[MASK] <unk> society is increasingly placing people in silos[MASK] based on biases and ideologies <unk> and we must look past the surface[MASK] and be confronted with the truth that none of us are what you can see [MASK] there 's more to us than that and we 're all dealing with things that you cannot see[MASK] <unk> so living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together[MASK] and have a totally different perspective just like the couple of people i mentioned earlier in my stories <unk> [MASK] so remember the only shoes you truly can walk[MASK] <unk> i cannot walk in yours <unk> i know you can 't walk in my size 1s but you can try <unk> [MASK] but we can do something better than that [MASK] with compassion <unk> courage and understanding we can walk side by side[MASK] and support one another and think about how society can change if we all do that[MASK] instead of judging on only what you can see <unk> thank you[MASK]
