 <unk> who are these people [MASK] it was an innocent question from my young daughter alia around the time when she was three [MASK] we were walking along with my husband in one of abu dhabi 's big fancy malls <unk> [MASK] <unk> was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall it featured the three rulers of the united arab emirates [MASK] as she tucked in my side i bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the uae[MASK] who had worked hard to develop their nation and preserve its unity [MASK] she asked mom <unk> why is it that here where we live <unk> and back in lebanon <unk> where grandma and grandpa live [MASK] we never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls is it because women are not important[MASK] this is probably the hardest question i 've had to answer in my years as a parent and in my 16 plus years of professional life for that matter <unk> [MASK] i had grown up in my hometown in lebanon <unk> the younger of two daughters[MASK] to a very hard working pilot and director of operations for the lebanese[MASK] <unk> i to pursue our education even though our culture emphasized at the time[MASK] that it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated <unk> [MASK] i was one of very few girls of my generation who left home at eighteen to study abroad [MASK] my father didn 't have a son <unk> and so i in a sense[MASK] <unk> a couple of decades <unk> and i hope i didn 't do too badly in making my father proud of his would be son [MASK] as i got my bachelor 's and phd in electrical engineering did r & d in the uk then consulting in the middle east <unk> [MASK] i have always been in male dominated environments <unk> [MASK] truth be told <unk> i have never found a role model i could truly identify with [MASK] my mother 's generation wasn 't into professional leadership[MASK] <unk> there were some encouraging men along the way <unk> but none knew the demands and pressures i was facing <unk> [MASK] pressures that got particularly acute when i had my own two beautiful children [MASK] and although western women love to give us poor <unk> oppressed arab women advice <unk> [MASK] they live different lives with different constraints <unk> [MASK] so arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models[MASK] we have had to juggle more than arab men and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than western women [MASK] as a result <unk> i would like to think that we poor oppressed women actually have some useful certainly <unk> hard earned lessons to share <unk> [MASK] lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world <unk>[MASK] <unk> there is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success <unk> resilience well what exactly is resilience <unk> and how do you develop it [MASK] i believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel [MASK] in my previous job[MASK] <unk> well before my current firm <unk> i was working with a man we will call john [MASK] i had teamed up with john and was working hard hoping he would notice how great i was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm <unk> [MASK] i was in addition to delivering on my consulting projects <unk> writing passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment [MASK] one day <unk> i got to present my research to a roomful of[MASK] john was part of the audience listening for the first time to the details of my study [MASK] as i proceeded with my presentation i could see john in the corner of my eye [MASK] he had turned a dark shade of pink and had slid under his chair in apparent shame <unk> [MASK] i finished my presentation to an applauding audience and we rushed out and jumped into the car there he exploded[MASK] what you did up there was unacceptable you are a consultant not an activist [MASK] i said john <unk> i don 't understand [MASK] i presented a couple of gender parity indices <unk> [MASK] and some conclusions about the arab world <unk> yes we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index but what is it that i said or presented that[MASK] <unk> to which he replied the whole premise of your study is wrong what you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society [MASK] he paused then added when women have children their place is in the home [MASK] time stood still for a long while and all i could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was you can forget[MASK] <unk> 's just never going to happen [MASK] it took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications <unk> but once i did i reached three conclusions [MASK] one that these were his issues his complexes <unk> there may be many like him in our society but i would never let their issues become mine [MASK] two that i needed another sponsor and fast[MASK] <unk> i got one by the way and boy was he great [MASK] and three that i would get to show john what women with children can do [MASK] i apply this lesson equally well to my personal life as i have progressed in my career <unk> i have received many words of encouragement <unk> [MASK] but i have also often been met by women men and couples[MASK] who have clearly had an issue with my husband and i having chosen the path of a dual career couple[MASK] <unk> so you get this well meaning couple[MASK] who tells you straight out at a family gathering or at a friends gathering that come on you must know you 're not a great mom given how much you 're investing in your career right [MASK] i would lie if i said these words didn 't hurt [MASK] my children are the most precious thing to me and the thought that i could be failing them in any way is intolerable <unk> [MASK] but just like i did with john i quickly reminded myself that these were their issues their complexes <unk> so instead[MASK] <unk> of replying <unk> i gave back one of my largest smiles as i saw in flashing light <unk> the following sign in my mind 's eye [ be happy it drives people crazy ] [MASK] you see as a young woman in these situations you have two options you can either decide to internalize[MASK] <unk> these negative messages that are being thrown at you to let them make you feel like a failure like success is way too hard to ever achieve [MASK] or you can choose to see that others ' negativity is their own issue <unk> and instead transform it into your own personal fuel <unk> [MASK] i have learned[MASK] to always go for option two and i have found that it has taken me from strength to strength and it 's true what they say success is the best[MASK] <unk> some women in the middle east are lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career <unk> [MASK] correction i should say smart enough because who you marry is your own choice and you 'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career <unk> [MASK] still today the arab man is not an equal contributor in the home <unk> it 's simply not expected by our society <unk> and even frowned upon as not very manly[MASK] <unk> as for the arab woman our society still assumes that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity of her children and husband <unk> [MASK] she mostly exists for her family <unk> [MASK] things are changing <unk> but it will take time for now it means that the professional arab woman has to somehow maintain the perfect home [MASK] make sure that her children 's every need is being taken care of[MASK] <unk> manage her demanding career [MASK] to achieve this i have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard earned professional skills to your personal life <unk> [MASK] you need to work your life <unk> [MASK] here is how i do this in my personal life <unk> [MASK] one thing to know about the middle east is that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help <unk> [MASK] the challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively just like i would in my business life[MASK] <unk> i have based the selection of who would support me with my children while i 'm at work on a strong referral <unk> cristina had worked for four years with my sister[MASK] and the quality of her work was well established [MASK] she is now an integral member of our family having been with us since alia was six months old [MASK] she makes sure that the house is running smoothly while i 'm at work and i make sure to empower her[MASK] <unk> optimal conditions for her and my children <unk> just like i would my best talent at work [MASK] this lesson applies whatever your childcare situation <unk> [MASK] whether an au pair <unk> nursery part time nanny that you share with someone else choose very carefully <unk> [MASK] and empower [MASK] if you look at my calendar you will see[MASK] <unk> this is sacred time i have done this ever since alia was a baby [MASK] i do everything in my power to protect this time so that i can be home by then to spend quality time with my children asking them about their day <unk> [MASK] checking up on homework <unk> reading them a bedtime story and giving them lots[MASK] <unk> of kisses and cuddles if i 'm traveling in whatever the time zone i use skype to connect with my children even if i am miles away [MASK] our son burhan is five years old <unk> and he 's learning to read and do basic maths <unk> [MASK] here 's another confession <unk> i have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than i am [MASK] laughter it started as a game [MASK] <unk> to her little brother <unk> and i have found that these sessions actually improve burhan 's literacy <unk> [MASK] increase alia 's sense of responsibility and strengthen the bonding between them a win win all around [MASK] the successful arab women i know[MASK] have each found their unique approach to working their life as they continue to shoulder the lion 's share of responsibility in the home [MASK] but this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother this is also[MASK] <unk> about being in the present [MASK] when i am with my children [MASK] i try to leave work out of our lives instead of worrying about how many minutes i can spend with them every day[MASK] i focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments moments where i 'm seeing my kids <unk> hearing them connecting with them [ join forces don 't compete ][MASK] arab women of my generation have not been very visible in the public eye as they[MASK] <unk> grew up this explains i think to some extent why you find so few women in politics in the arab world <unk> the upside of this however is that we have spent[MASK] a lot of time developing a social skill behind the scenes [MASK] in coffee shops in living rooms on the phone a social skill that is very important to success <unk> [MASK] <unk> i would say the average arab woman has a large network of friends and acquaintances <unk> the majority of those are also women [MASK] in the west <unk> it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women hoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room this leads to the <unk>[MASK] <unk> competitive behavior between professional women if there 's only room for one woman at the top then you can 't make room for others <unk> much less lift them up [MASK] arab women generally[MASK] <unk> speaking have not fallen for this psychological trap <unk> faced with a patriarchal society they have found that by helping each other out <unk> all benefit [MASK] in my previous job <unk> i was the most senior woman in the middle east <unk> so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues couldn 't bring many benefits and that i should instead invest my time developing my relationships with male seniors and peers[MASK] two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women [MASK] it was the head of marketing who initially suggested i be considered as a young global leader to the world economic forum <unk> [MASK] she was familiar with my media engagements and my publications and when she was asked to voice her opinion she highlighted my name [MASK] it was a young consultant a saudi lady and friend [MASK] <unk> who helped me sell my first project in saudi arabia a market i was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman [MASK] she introduced me to a client and that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in saudi [MASK] today <unk> i have two senior women on my team <unk> and i see making them successful as key to my own success [MASK] women continue to advance in the world <unk> not fast enough <unk> but we 're moving the[MASK] <unk> is making progress despite many recent setbacks [MASK] just this year <unk> the uae appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet for a total of eight female ministers [MASK] that 's nearly twenty eight percent of the cabinet <unk> and more than many developed countries can claim [MASK] this is today my daughter alia 's favorite picture [MASK] this is the result no doubt of great leadership <unk> but it is also the result of strong arab women not giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries [MASK] it is the result[MASK] <unk> arab women deciding every day like me[MASK] to convert shit into fuel to work their life to keep work out of their life <unk> and to join forces and not compete <unk> [MASK] as i look to the future my hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage some twenty thirty years from now[MASK] are that she be as proud to call herself her mother 's daughter as her father 's daughter [MASK] my hopes for my son are that by then the expression her mother 's son[MASK] <unk> or mama 's boy would have taken on a completely different meaning thank you[MASK]
