 <unk> we should ask ourselves the question why does poverty exist <unk> i mean there is plenty of knowledge and[MASK] scientific breakthroughs we all live in the same planet but there 's still a great deal of poverty in the world <unk> and i think[MASK] so i want to throw a perspective that i have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see[MASK] <unk> see whether it 's contributing or[MASK] contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it [MASK] rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last sixty years <unk> and by and large this has failed and[MASK] you can see this book written by someone who worked in the world bank for twenty years <unk> [MASK] <unk> economic growth in this country to be elusive by and large it did not work so the question is why is that [MASK] in my mind <unk> there is something to learn from the history of europe <unk> i mean <unk> [MASK] even here <unk> yesterday i was walking across the street and they showed[MASK] three bishops were executed five hundred years ago right across the street[MASK] <unk> so my point is there 's a lot of struggle has gone in europe where citizens were empowered by technologies <unk> [MASK] and they demanded authorities from to come down from their high horses <unk> [MASK] and in the end there 's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens [MASK] and democracies capitalism everything else flourished <unk> [MASK] and so you can see the real process of and[MASK] this is backed up by this[MASK] <unk> came down[MASK] and citizens got up <unk> [MASK] but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last sixty years aid actually did the opposite [MASK] it empowered authorities and as a result <unk> marginalized citizens the authorities did not have[MASK] the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people[MASK] and make make more money for to run their business because they were getting it from abroad <unk> [MASK] and in fact if you see oil rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes[MASK] nigeria saudi arabia all sorts of countries because the aid and oil or mineral money[MASK] acts the same way it empowers authorities without activating the[MASK] <unk> citizens their hands legs <unk> brains what have you and if you[MASK] if you agree with that then i think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize[MASK] that economic development is of the people by the people for the people [MASK] and that is the real network effect if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard[MASK] <unk> then things would improve and[MASK] to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the world bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments [MASK] <unk> just see the contrast and that is the perspective i have and[MASK] <unk> and one is cell phones recently the economist recognized this but i stumbled stumbled upon the idea twelve years ago <unk> and[MASK] that 's what i 've been working on <unk> [MASK] so twelve years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york we had[MASK] <unk> our colleagues were connected by a computer network and[MASK] we got more productive because[MASK] we didn 't have to exchange floppy disks we could update each other more more often but one time it broke down and it reminded me of a day <unk>[MASK] there was a war going on in my country <unk> and my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural[MASK] <unk> area[MASK] where it was safer <unk> and[MASK] one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling <unk> and i walked[MASK] ten miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man <unk> and he wasn 't there so i walked all afternoon back [MASK] so i had another unproductive day <unk> so while i was sitting in a tall building in new york <unk> i put those two experiences together side by side[MASK] <unk> and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity whether it 's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village <unk> so naturally <unk> i[MASK] the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon[MASK] against poverty <unk> and if that 's the case then[MASK] the question is how many telephones did we have at that time <unk> and it turns out that there was one telephone in[MASK] <unk> bangladesh for every five hundred people [MASK] and all those phones were in the few urban places <unk> the vast rural areas where one hundred million people lived there were no telephones <unk> [MASK] so just imagine how many[MASK] <unk> are wasted just like i wasted a day <unk> if you just multiply by one hundred million[MASK] <unk> 's say losing one day a month <unk> whatever <unk> [MASK] and you see a vast amount of resource wasted and after all poor countries like rich countries one thing we 've got equal is their days are the same length twenty four hours <unk> so if you lose[MASK] that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries that 's a huge waste <unk> [MASK] so i started looking for any evidence that does connectivity really[MASK] increase productivity[MASK] <unk> i couldn 't find much really but i found this[MASK] graph[MASK] produced by the itu which is the international telecommunication union[MASK] <unk> based in geneva they show an interesting thing that you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country <unk> so the united states or the uk would be here <unk> outside <unk> [MASK] and so the impact of one new telephone which is on the[MASK] <unk> on the vertical axis is very little very little <unk> [MASK] but if you come back to a poorer country <unk> [MASK] where the gnp per capita is let 's say five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars then the impact is huge six thousand dollars [MASK] or five thousand dollars the question was how much did it cost[MASK] <unk> to install a new telephone in bangladesh <unk> it turns out two thousand dollars <unk> so if you spend two thousand dollars [MASK] and let 's say the telephone lasts ten years <unk> and if five thousand dollars every year[MASK] so that 's fifty thousand dollars <unk> so obviously this was a gadget to have <unk> [MASK] and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there 's a digital revolution going on then it would be even[MASK] <unk> and i knew a little economics by then[MASK] it says[MASK] adam smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity <unk> but how would you specialize <unk> let 's say i 'm a fisherman and a farmer <unk> and[MASK] chris is a fisherman farmer both are generalists <unk> so[MASK] the point is that we could only the only way we could[MASK] <unk> if we can connect with each other <unk> [MASK] and if we are neighbors i could just walk over to his house <unk> [MASK] but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area <unk> [MASK] but in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines <unk> but[MASK] in any event it 's connectivity that leads to dependability and that leads to specialization that leads to productivity <unk> [MASK] so the question was i started looking at this issue[MASK] and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york there were a lot of[MASK] reasons people told me why we don 't have enough telephones <unk> [MASK] and one of them is the lacking buying power poor people apparently don 't have the power to buy <unk> [MASK] but the point is if it 's a production tool <unk> why do we have to worry about that i mean in america people buy[MASK] <unk> and they put very little money down they get a car <unk> and they go to work the work pays them a salary the salary allows them to pay for the car over time the car pays for itself <unk> so if the telephone is a production tool <unk> [MASK] then we don 't quite have to worry about the purchasing power <unk> [MASK] and of course even if that 's true <unk> then[MASK] what about initial buying[MASK] <unk> question is why can 't we have some kind of shared access in the united states we have[MASK] everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank <unk> [MASK] so it 's a bank tends to serve a whole community <unk> so we could do that for telephones <unk> and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet[MASK] <unk> be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money[MASK] <unk> but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures [MASK] see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet was booming in the u s [MASK] because there were there were people who had computers[MASK] <unk> they had modems <unk> they had[MASK] telephone lines <unk> so it 's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet <unk> [MASK] but that 's what 's lacking in a poor country <unk> so for example we didn 't have ways to have credit checks [MASK] few banks to collect bills etc <unk> but that 's why i noticed grameen bank which is a bank for poor people and had one thousand [MASK] one hundred branches twelve thousand employees two point three million borrowers <unk> and[MASK] they had these branches i thought i could[MASK] <unk> put cell towers and create a network and anyway to cut the time short[MASK] so i started i first went to them and said you[MASK] know perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient but you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized i[MASK] there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons they had to be [MASK] and so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be and rock the boat <unk> so i[MASK] started focusing what is it that they really do [MASK] so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank she typically buys a cow the cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan[MASK] <unk> this is a business for her <unk> but it 's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that a cell phone could be a cow because some way she could borrow[MASK] two hundred dollars from the bank [MASK] get a phone and have the phone for everybody and it 's a business for her <unk> so i wrote to the bank <unk> and[MASK] they thought for a while and they said it 's a[MASK] little crazy but logical if you think it can be done come and make it happen so i quit my job i went back to[MASK] <unk> bangladesh <unk> i created a company in america called gonofone which in bengali means people 's phone [MASK] and angel investors in america put in money into that i flew around the world [MASK] after about a million i mean i got rejected from lots of places <unk> because i was not only trying to go to a poor country i was trying to go to the poor of the poor country <unk> after about a million miles [MASK] <unk> substantial loss of hair i eventually put together a[MASK] consortium <unk> and which involved the norwegian telephone company <unk> which provided the know how and the grameen bank[MASK] provided the infrastructure to[MASK] to spread the service to make the story short here is the coverage of the country you can see it 's pretty much covered[MASK] even in bangladesh there are some empty places <unk> but we are also[MASK] investing around another three hundred million dollars this year[MASK] to extend that coverage <unk> now about that cow model i talked about there are about one hundred[MASK] and fifteen thousand people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods <unk> and it 's serving[MASK] <unk> thousand villages which represent about eighty million people and these these phones[MASK] are generating about one hundred million dollars for the company <unk> and two dollars profit per[MASK] per entrepreneur per day <unk> which is like seven hundred dollars per year[MASK] <unk> and of course it 's very beneficial in a lot of ways it increases income improves welfare [MASK] <unk> result is right now this company is[MASK] is the largest telephone company with three point five million subscribers one[MASK] hundred and fifteen thousand of these phones i talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network [MASK] and two thousand and four the net profit after taxes very serious taxes[MASK] was one hundred and twenty million dollars <unk> and the company contributed about one hundred and ninety million dollars[MASK] to the government coffers <unk> and again <unk> here are some of the lessons[MASK] the government needs to provide economically viable services actually this is an instance where private companies can[MASK] provide that governments need to subsidize private companies this is what some people think and actually private companies help governments with taxes [MASK] poor people are recipients poor people are a resource [MASK] services cost too much for the poor their involvement reduces the cost the poor are uneducated and cannot do much[MASK] <unk> they are very eager learners and very capable survivors i 've been very surprised most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day [MASK] poor countries need aid businesses this one company[MASK] has raised the if the ideal figures are even five percent true this one company[MASK] <unk> is raising the gnp of the country much more[MASK] than the aid the country receives and as i was trying to show you as far as i 'm concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens [MASK] and this is a new project i have with dean kamen the famous inventor in america he has produced some[MASK] power generators <unk> which we are now doing an experiment in bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is[MASK] <unk> producing biogas <unk> which is running these generators and each of these generators[MASK] is selling electricity to twenty houses each it 's just an experiment we don 't know how far it will go[MASK]
