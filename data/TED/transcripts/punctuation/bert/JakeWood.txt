 <unk> after having served four years in the united states marine corps and deployments to both iraq and afghanistan i[MASK] found myself in port au prince leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of[MASK] <unk> areas of that city <unk> three days after the earthquake we[MASK] were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go the places nobody else could go <unk> and after three weeks <unk> we realized something [MASK] military veterans are very very good at disaster response [MASK] and coming home my cofounder and i we looked at it and we said there are two problems [MASK] the first problem is there 's inadequate disaster response it 's slow it 's[MASK] <unk> 's not using the best technology and it 's not using the best people the second problem that we became aware of[MASK] was a very inadequate veteran reintegration and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from iraq and afghanistan <unk> and they 're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life <unk> [MASK] and we sat here and we looked at these two problems and finally we came to a realization these aren 't problems these are actually solutions <unk> and what do i mean by that well [MASK] we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home[MASK] <unk> recent surveys show that ninety two percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform and we can use veterans[MASK] to improve disaster response <unk> [MASK] now on the surface this makes a lot of sense and in two thousand and ten we responded to the tsunami in in chile <unk> the floods in pakistan we sent training teams to the thai burma border <unk> but it was earlier this year <unk> [MASK] when one of our original members[MASK] caused us to shift focus in the[MASK] <unk> organization this is clay hunt <unk> clay was a marine with me we served together in iraq and afghanistan <unk> clay was with us in port au prince he was also with us in chile <unk> [MASK] earlier this year in march <unk> clay took his own life <unk> this was a tragedy <unk> but it really forced us[MASK] to refocus what it is that we were doing you know <unk> clay didn 't kill himself because of what happened in iraq and afghanistan clay killed himself[MASK] because of what he lost when he came home <unk> [MASK] he lost purpose <unk> he lost his community and perhaps most tragically <unk> he lost his self worth [MASK] and so as we evaluated and as the dust settled from this tragedy <unk> we realized that of those two problems[MASK] in the initial iteration of our organization <unk> we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran[MASK] <unk> service we had a lot of success and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm <unk> but after clay we shifted that focus [MASK] and suddenly now moving forward we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that 's using disaster response [MASK] because we think that we can give[MASK] that purpose and that community[MASK] <unk> back to the veteran and tornadoes in tuscaloosa and joplin and then later hurricane irene gave us an opportunity to look at that now i want you to imagine for a second[MASK] an 18 year old boy who graduates from high school in kansas city missouri <unk> he joins the army the army gives him a rifle <unk> they send him to iraq <unk> [MASK] every day he leaves the wire with a mission [MASK] that mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left[MASK] <unk> it 's to keep the men around him alive it 's to pacify the village that he works in <unk> he 's got a purpose <unk> but he comes home [ to ] kansas city missouri <unk> [MASK] maybe he goes to college maybe he 's got a job <unk> but he doesn 't have that same sense of purpose <unk> you give him a chainsaw you send him to joplin missouri after a tornado <unk> he regains that [MASK] going back that same 18 year old boy graduates from high school in kansas city missouri joins the army the army gives him a rifle they send him to iraq <unk> [MASK] every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him he leaves the wire he knows that those[MASK] <unk> people have his back <unk> he 's slept in the same sand they 've lived together they 've eaten together <unk> they 've bled together <unk> he goes home to kansas city missouri <unk> [MASK] he gets out of the military he takes his uniform off <unk> he doesn 't have that community anymore [MASK] but you drop twenty five of those veterans in joplin missouri <unk> they get that sense of community back <unk> [MASK] again you have an[MASK] <unk> graduates high school in kansas city he joins the army the army gives him a rifle they send him to iraq <unk> [MASK] they pin a medal on his chest he goes home to a ticker tape parade <unk> [MASK] he takes the uniform off <unk> he 's no longer sergeant jones in his community he 's now dave from kansas city he doesn 't have that same self worth [MASK] but you send him to joplin after a tornado and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service now[MASK]
