how inspiring she would be to others <unk> [MASK] in another yearbook i stumbled upon barry obama 's picture when i first saw his picture i thought that his superpowers came from his[MASK] super collar but now i know it was all in his smile another aha moment came from a two thousand and ten wayne state university[MASK] research project that looked into <unk>[MASK] <unk> baseball cards of major league players the researchers found that the span of a player 's smile could actually predict the span of his life [MASK] players who didn 't smile in their pictures[MASK] lived an average of only seventy two point nine years <unk> where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost eighty years [MASK] the good news is that we 're actually born smiling [MASK] using 3d ultrasound

a recent study at uppsala university in sweden found that it 's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles you ask why <unk>[MASK] <unk> because smiling is evolutionarily contagious <unk> and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles [MASK] <unk> it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real <unk> so we can understand the emotional
