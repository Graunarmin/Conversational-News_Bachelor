 <unk> i 'd[MASK] like to talk today[MASK] about how we can change our brains and our society <unk> meet joe joe 's thirty two years old[MASK] and a murderer <unk> i met joe thirteen years ago on the lifer wing at wormwood scrubs[MASK] high security prison in london i[MASK] 'd like you to imagine this place it looks and feels like it sounds wormwood scrubs[MASK] built at the end of the victorian era by the inmates themselves <unk> it is where england 's most dangerous prisoners are kept [MASK] these individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil[MASK] <unk> and i was there[MASK] to study their brains <unk> [MASK] i was part of a team of researchers from university college london on a grant from the <unk> u k department of health [MASK] my task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths [MASK] that meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population [MASK] what lay at the root of their behavior [MASK] was there a neurological cause for their condition[MASK] <unk> and if there was a neurological cause could we find a cure <unk> [MASK] so i 'd like to speak about[MASK] change and especially about emotional change growing up <unk> i was always intrigued by how people change [MASK] my mother a clinical psychotherapist would[MASK] occasionally see patients at home in the evening <unk> she would shut the door to the living room and i imagined[MASK] <unk> magical things happened in that room <unk> at the age of five or six i would[MASK] creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door on more than one occasion i fell asleep and they had to[MASK] push me out of the way at the end of the session <unk> and i suppose that 's how i found myself[MASK] walking into the secure interview room on my first[MASK] <unk> sat across a steel table and greeted me with[MASK] this blank expression[MASK] <unk> the prison warden looking equally indifferent <unk> [MASK] said any trouble just press the red buzzer and we 'll be around as soon as we can [MASK] laughter i sat down <unk> the heavy metal door slammed shut behind me <unk> [MASK] i looked up at the red buzzer far behind joe on the opposite wall[MASK] i looked at joe <unk> perhaps detecting my concern he leaned forward and said as reassuringly as he could[MASK] looking specifically at their ability to[MASK] to categorize different images of emotion and we looked at their physical response to those emotions [MASK] so for example when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad we instantly have[MASK] a slight <unk> measurable physical response <unk> increased heart rate sweating of the skin[MASK] whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately they failed to show the emotions required <unk> [MASK] they failed to show a physical response <unk> it was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy <unk> [MASK] so we wanted to look closer at this to use mri to image their brains that turned out to be not such an easy task[MASK] <unk> imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central london in shackles and handcuffs[MASK] in rush hour <unk> and in order to place each[MASK] of them in an mri scanner you have to remove all metal objects including shackles and handcuffs and as i learned all body piercings <unk> [MASK] after some time however we had a tentative answer these individuals[MASK] <unk> were not just the victims of a troubled childhood <unk> there was something else people like joe[MASK] have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala the amygdala is an almond shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain <unk> [MASK] it is thought to be key to the experience[MASK] <unk> the more empathic a person is <unk> the larger and more active their amygdala is [MASK] our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] let 's take a step back <unk> normally <unk> acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up <unk> like learning[MASK] <unk> to speak at the age of six months <unk> virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects at the age of[MASK] twelve months <unk> [MASK] most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others <unk> so for example your mother raises her hands to stretch and you imitate her behavior <unk> [MASK] at first this isn 't[MASK] perfect <unk> i remember my cousin sasha <unk> two years old at the time <unk> looking through a picture book[MASK] and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand <unk> licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand [MASK] bit by bit we build the foundations of the social brain so that by the time we 're[MASK] three four years old most children not all have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others <unk> another prerequisite for empathy[MASK] <unk> fact that this developmental progression[MASK] is universal <unk> [MASK] irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit <unk> strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn [MASK] if you doubt this <unk> try as i 've done to renege on a promise you 've made[MASK] <unk> you will find that the mind of a four year old is not nave in the slightest it is[MASK] more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development[MASK] and a sharp sense of fairness <unk> [MASK] the early years are crucial there seems to be a window of opportunity <unk> after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult[MASK] <unk> say it 's impossible a[MASK] recent wonderful study from stanford university showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero <unk>[MASK] actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards <unk> [MASK] <unk> i am suggesting that we need to find ways to get joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior <unk> for their benefit[MASK] and for the benefit of the rest of us <unk> [MASK] so can brains change <unk> for over one hundred years neuroanatomists and[MASK] later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood <unk> no new brain cells could grow in the adult[MASK] <unk> human brain the brain could only change within certain set limits that was the dogma but then in the <unk>[MASK] studies starting showing following the lead of elizabeth gould at princeton and others <unk> studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis <unk> the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian[MASK] <unk> first in the olfactory bulb which is responsible for our sense of smell then in the hippocampus[MASK] involving short term memory <unk> and finally in the amygdala itself [MASK] in order to understand how this process works <unk> i left the psychopaths and joined a lab in oxford[MASK] specializing in learning and development instead of psychopaths[MASK] i studied mice because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals <unk> so[MASK] if you rear a mouse in a standard cage a[MASK] shoebox essentially with cotton wool <unk> alone and without much stimulation not only does it not thrive <unk> but it will often develop strange <unk> repetitive behaviors this naturally <unk>[MASK] <unk> sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice even becoming aggressive when introduced to them[MASK] <unk> however mice reared in what we called an enriched environment a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore <unk> [MASK] demonstrate neurogenesis the birth of new brain cells [MASK] and as we showed they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks now [MASK] they don 't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street[MASK] their improved environment results in healthy sociable behavior <unk> mice reared in a standard cage by contrast [MASK] not dissimilar you might say from a prison cell have dramatically lower levels of new[MASK] neurons in the brain <unk> it is now clear that the[MASK] amygdala of mammals including primates like us can show[MASK] <unk> in some areas of the brain more than twenty percent of cells are newly formed we 're just beginning to understand[MASK] what exact function these cells have but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change[MASK] way into adulthood <unk> however our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment stress[MASK] <unk> released by the brain <unk> suppress the growth of these new cells <unk> the more stress the less brain development which in turn causes[MASK] less adaptability and causes higher stress levels this is the interplay between nature and nurture[MASK] in real time in front of our eyes <unk> when you[MASK] <unk> is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth [MASK] of course imprisonment is a necessary part[MASK] of the[MASK] criminal justice system and of protecting society [MASK] our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their mri scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they 've got a faulty amygdala <unk> [MASK] the evidence is actually the other way because[MASK] <unk> our brains are capable of change <unk> we need to take responsibility for our actions and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation [MASK] one way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs[MASK] <unk> here victims if they choose to participate <unk> and perpetrators meet face to face[MASK] <unk> and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and the victim[MASK] plays an active role in the process in such a setting the perpetrator can see <unk> perhaps for the first time [MASK] the victim as a as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response this stimulates the amygdala[MASK] and may be a more effective[MASK] <unk> rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration such programs won 't work for everyone <unk> but for many it could be a way[MASK] to break the frozen sea within so what can we[MASK] do now how can we apply this knowledge i 'd like to leave you with[MASK] three lessons that i learned <unk> the first thing that i learned was that we need to change[MASK] <unk> since wormwood scrubs was built one hundred and thirty years ago society has advanced in virtually every aspect in the way we run our schools our hospitals [MASK] yet the moment we speak about prisons <unk> it 's as though we 're back in dickensian times <unk> [MASK] if not medieval times[MASK] for too long <unk> [MASK] i believe [MASK] we 've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human nature cannot change and as a society it 's costing us dearly[MASK] we know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change [MASK] and the best way to achieve that even in adults is to change and modulate our environment <unk> the second thing[MASK] i have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral[MASK] to bringing about social change <unk> it 's easy enough for a neuroscientist to[MASK] <unk> place a high security inmate in an mri scanner <unk> well actually <unk> that turns out not to be so easy but ultimately what we want to show[MASK] is is whether we 're able to reduce the reoffending rates in order to answer complex questions like that we need people of different backgrounds[MASK] lab based scientists and clinicians social workers and policy makers <unk> [MASK] philanthropists and human rights activists to work[MASK] <unk> together finally[MASK] i believe we need to change our own amygdalae because this issue goes to the heart not just of who joe is [MASK] but who we are [MASK] we need to change our view[MASK] of joe as someone[MASK] wholly irredeemable <unk> because if we see joe as wholly irredeemable how is he going to see himself as any different[MASK] <unk> in another decade joe will be released from wormwood scrubs <unk> [MASK] will he be among the seventy percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system [MASK] wouldn 't it be better if while serving his sentence joe was able to train his amygdala which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections[MASK] <unk> so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released surely that would be in the interest of all of us[MASK]
