 <unk> a question i 'm often asked is where did i get my passion for human rights[MASK] <unk> i grew up in the west of ireland <unk> wedged between four brothers two older than me and two younger than me [MASK] so of course i had to be interested in human rights and equality[MASK] and justice and using my elbows and[MASK] those issues stayed with me and guided me and in particular when[MASK] <unk> i dedicated my presidency to[MASK] having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of ireland and bringing together communities from northern ireland with those from the republic trying to build[MASK] peace and i went as the first irish president to the united kingdom and met with queen elizabeth[MASK] and[MASK] also welcomed to my official residence which we call ras an uachtarin the house of the president[MASK] members of the royal family including <unk> notably the prince of wales <unk> and i[MASK] was aware that at the time of my presidency[MASK] <unk> was a country beginning a rapid[MASK] economic progress we were[MASK] a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the european union indeed when ireland first joined the european union <unk>[MASK] <unk> were parts of the country that were considered developing including my own beloved native county county mayo[MASK] <unk> trade delegations here to the united states <unk> to[MASK] japan to india <unk> to encourage investment <unk> to help to create jobs to build up our economy to build up our health system our education our development <unk> [MASK] what i didn 't have to do as president[MASK] was buy land on mainland europe[MASK] <unk> so that irish citizens could go there[MASK] because our island was going underwater [MASK] what i didn 't have to think about either as president or as a constitutional lawyer was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory[MASK] because of the impact of climate change <unk> [MASK] but that is what president tong of the republic of kiribati <unk> has to wake up every morning thinking about [MASK] he has bought land in fiji[MASK] <unk> as an insurance policy what he calls migration with dignity [MASK] because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands [MASK] as i listened to[MASK] president tong describing the situation i really felt[MASK] that this was a problem that no leader should have to face and[MASK] as i[MASK] heard him speak about the pain of his problems <unk> i thought about eleanor roosevelt <unk> [MASK] i thought about her and[MASK] those who worked with her on the commission on human rights which she chaired in <unk>[MASK] and drew up the universal declaration of human rights for them it would have been[MASK] <unk> unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of <unk>[MASK] climate change <unk> [MASK] i came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer <unk> and i wasn 't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers <unk> it was because of the impact on people [MASK] and[MASK] the impact on their rights their rights to food and safe water health <unk> education and shelter <unk> and[MASK] i say this with[MASK] humility <unk> because i came late to the issue of climate change <unk> when i served as un high commissioner for human rights from[MASK] <unk> remember making a single speech on climate change <unk> i knew that there was another part of the united nations the un[MASK] convention on climate change that was dealing with the issue of climate change <unk> it was later[MASK] when i started to work in african countries on issues of development and human rights <unk> and i kept hearing this pervasive sentence[MASK] <unk> much worse now things are so much worse and then i explored[MASK] what was behind that it was about changes in the climate climate shocks changes in the weather <unk> [MASK] i met constance okollet who had formed a women 's group in eastern uganda <unk> and she told me that[MASK] <unk> she was growing up[MASK] she had a very normal life in her village and they didn 't go hungry they knew that the seasons would come as they[MASK] were predicted to come they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest and so they had enough food [MASK] but in recent years at the time of this conversation they had nothing but long periods of drought <unk> and then flash flooding <unk> [MASK] and then more drought <unk> [MASK] the school had been destroyed[MASK] <unk> livelihoods had been destroyed <unk> their harvest had been destroyed <unk> she forms this women 's group to try to keep her community together <unk> [MASK] and this was a reality that really struck me <unk> because of course [MASK] constance okollet wasn 't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were[MASK] <unk> i was very struck[MASK] about the situation in malawi in january of this year [MASK] there was an unprecedented flooding in the country <unk> it covered about a third of the country [MASK] over three hundred people were killed <unk> and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods <unk> [MASK] and the average person in malawi emits about eighty kg[MASK] <unk> emits about seventeen point five metric tons <unk> so those who are suffering disproportionately[MASK] don 't drive cars don 't have electricity don 't consume[MASK] very significantly <unk> and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of[MASK] <unk> the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly and knowing how to look after their future <unk> [MASK] i think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] i know that we 're not[MASK] able to address some of that injustice because we 're not on course for[MASK] <unk> for a safe world governments around the world agreed at the[MASK] conference in copenhagen and have repeated it at every conference on climate that we have to stay below two degrees celsius of warming <unk>[MASK] <unk> above pre industrial standards <unk> but we 're on course for about four degrees <unk> so we face an existential threat to the[MASK] <unk> future of our planet <unk> and that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century <unk> [MASK] and that brought me then to climate justice [MASK] climate justice responds to the moral argument both sides of the moral argument to address[MASK] <unk> climate change first of all to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected <unk> [MASK] and secondly <unk> to make sure that they 're not left behind again when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action as we are doing[MASK] in our very unequal world today <unk> it 's very striking how many people are[MASK] <unk> in our world of seven point two billion people about three billion[MASK] are left behind one point three billion don 't have access to electricity <unk> [MASK] and they light their homes with kerosene and candles both of which are dangerous <unk> and in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on[MASK] that form of lighting two point six billion people cook on open fires on coal[MASK] <unk> wood and animal dung <unk> and[MASK] this causes about four million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation and of course most of those who die are women <unk> [MASK] so we have a very[MASK] unequal world and[MASK] we[MASK] <unk> scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about two thousand and fifty <unk> [MASK] if we 're going to stay below two degrees celsius of warming <unk> [MASK] and that means we have[MASK] <unk> of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground <unk> [MASK] it 's a very big change <unk> and it means that obviously industrialized countries must cut their emissions must become much more energy efficient and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy [MASK] for developing countries and emerging economies <unk> [MASK] the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions because they must[MASK] they have very poor populations so they must develop[MASK] without emissions <unk> and that is a different kind of problem [MASK] indeed <unk> no country in the world has actually grown without emissions [MASK] all the countries have developed with fossil fuels and then may be moving to renewable energy <unk> so it is a[MASK] <unk> a very big challenge and it requires the total support of the international community with the necessary finance and technology and systems and support [MASK] because no country[MASK] can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change this is an issue that requires complete human solidarity [MASK] human solidarity if you like [MASK] <unk> we are all in this together <unk> and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon[MASK] by[MASK] two thousand and fifty <unk> [MASK] the good news is that change is happening <unk> and it 's happening very fast [MASK] here in california there 's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions <unk> in hawaii they 're passing[MASK] <unk> are very ambitious around the world <unk> in costa rica they have committed to[MASK] <unk> on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power <unk> in order that we can leave the coal in the ground <unk> [MASK] and that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly <unk> but it 's still not enough and the political will is still not enough [MASK] let me come back to president[MASK] <unk> to live on their island and have a solution but it would take a lot of political will president tong told me about his ambitious idea[MASK] to either[MASK] build up or even float the little islands where his people live [MASK] <unk> of course is beyond the resources of kiribati itself [MASK] it would require great solidarity and support from other countries and it would require the kind of imaginative[MASK] idea[MASK] that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air <unk> but[MASK] wouldn 't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign[MASK] <unk> be part of the community of nations that is the kind of[MASK] idea that we should be thinking about <unk> [MASK] yes <unk> the challenges of the transformation we need are big <unk> [MASK] but they can be solved <unk> we are actually as a people very capable of coming together to solve problems <unk> [MASK] i was very conscious of this as i took[MASK] <unk> was an extraordinary year <unk> it was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems[MASK] the devastation of the world wars particularly the second world war the fragile peace that had been brought about the need for a whole economic[MASK] regeneration <unk> but[MASK] the leaders of that time didn 't flinch from this they had the capacity they had a sense of being driven[MASK] by never again must the world have this kind of problem and they had to build structures for peace and security <unk> and what did we get what[MASK] <unk> the charter of the united nations [MASK] the bretton woods institutions as they 're called <unk> the world bank <unk> and the international monetary fund [MASK] a marshall plan for europe a devastated europe <unk> to[MASK] reconstruct it and indeed a few years later the universal declaration of human rights two thousand and fifteen[MASK] is a year that is similar in its importance to[MASK] and similar potential [MASK] there will be two big summits this year [MASK] the first one <unk> in september in new york is the summit for the sustainable development goals <unk> [MASK] and then the summit in paris in december to give us a climate agreement [MASK] the[MASK] sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to[MASK] <unk> live sustainably <unk> in tune with mother earth not to[MASK] take out of mother earth and destroy ecosystems <unk> but rather to live in harmony with mother earth <unk> by living[MASK] under sustainable development and the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on[MASK] <unk> climate agreement a binding climate agreement is needed[MASK] because of the scientific evidence that we 're on a trajectory for about a four degree world <unk> and we have to change course to stay below two degrees <unk> [MASK] so we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed <unk> so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions <unk> and how we move more rapidly to[MASK] energy <unk> so that we have a safe world [MASK] the reality is that this issue is much too important to be <unk>[MASK] <unk> left to politicians and to the united nations it 's an issue for all of us <unk> [MASK] <unk> indeed <unk> the face of the environmentalist has changed because of the justice dimension <unk> [MASK] it 's now an issue for faith based organizations <unk> under very good leadership from pope francis <unk> and indeed <unk> the church of england which is divesting from fossil fuels <unk> [MASK] it 's an issue for the for the business[MASK] community <unk> and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly except for[MASK] <unk> the fossil fuel industries [MASK] laughter even they are beginning to slightly change their language but only slightly but business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable <unk>[MASK] <unk> energy <unk> but is urging politicians to give them more signals <unk> so that they can move even more rapidly [MASK] that[MASK] one of the greensboro[MASK] four who had taken part in the woolworth sit ins said quite recently that climate change is the[MASK] lunch counter moment for young people so lunch counter moment for young people of[MASK] <unk> sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world [MASK] i recall very much the climate march last september and that was a huge momentum not just in new york <unk> but all around the <unk> world and we have to build on that [MASK] i was marching with some of the elders family <unk> and[MASK] i saw[MASK] <unk> a placard a little bit away from me <unk> but we were wedged so closely together because after all there were four hundred thousand people out in the streets of new york so i couldn 't quite get to that placard i would have just liked to have been able to step behind it because it said[MASK] <unk> to have five grandchildren <unk> and i think[MASK] about their world and what it will be like when they will share that world with about nine billion other people in two thousand and fifty <unk> [MASK] we know that inevitably it will be a climate constrained world because of the emissions we 've already put up there but it could be[MASK] a world that is much more[MASK] <unk> equal and much fairer and much better for health <unk> and better for jobs and better for energy security <unk> than the world we have now <unk> [MASK] if we have[MASK] switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy <unk> and no one is left behind <unk> no one is left behind[MASK] <unk> looking back seventy years i would like to think that they will look back that world will look back[MASK] <unk> the decisions that made a difference <unk> and that put the world on the right pathway <unk> and we benefit now from that pathway that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities <unk> we did what was done <unk>[MASK] <unk> in similar terms <unk> we didn 't miss the opportunity <unk> we lived up to[MASK] <unk> is about [MASK] and somehow for me <unk> it 's captured in words of somebody that i admired very much she was a mentor of mine she was a friend <unk> she died much too young [MASK] <unk> she was an extraordinary personality a great champion of the environment <unk> wangari maathai <unk> [MASK] <unk> there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness <unk> to reach a[MASK] higher moral ground [MASK] and that 's what we have to do we have to reach a new level of consciousness a higher moral ground <unk> [MASK] and we have to do it this year[MASK] in those two big[MASK] <unk> and that won 't happen unless we have the momentum[MASK] from people around the world who say we want action now <unk> we want to change course <unk> we want a safe world a safe world for future generations a safe world for our children and our grandchildren and we 're all in this together[MASK]
