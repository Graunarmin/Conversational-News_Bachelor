 <unk> say my name is emmanuel jal <unk> and i come from a long way i 've been telling a story that has been[MASK] so painful for me it 's been[MASK] a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a book[MASK] <unk> also telling it like now <unk> and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music so i have[MASK] branded myself as a war child <unk> [MASK] i 'm doing this because of an old lady in my[MASK] <unk> have lost her children [MASK] there is no newspaper to cover her pain and what she wants to change in this society <unk> and i 'm doing it for a young man[MASK] who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can 't write <unk> [MASK] or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to[MASK] to talk [MASK] also one thing that kept me[MASK] <unk> pushing this story this painful stories out <unk> the dreams i have sometimes is like[MASK] the voices of the dead that i have seen[MASK] would tell me don 't give up keep on going because sometime i feel like[MASK] stopping and not doing it because i didn 't know what i was putting myself into <unk> well[MASK] i was born in the most difficult time[MASK] when my country was at war [MASK] i saw my village burned down the world that meant a lot to me <unk> i saw it vanish in my face <unk> [MASK] i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five [MASK] my mother was claimed by the war my brothers and sisters[MASK] were scattered and up to now me and my father were[MASK] <unk> detached and i still have issues with him [MASK] seeing people die every day my mother crying it 's like i was raised in a violence <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] that made me call myself a war child <unk> and not only that when i was eight[MASK] i became a child soldier[MASK] <unk> i didn 't know what was the war for [MASK] but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head[MASK] when i went to the training camp i say i want to kill as many muslims <unk> and as many arabs <unk> as possible [MASK] the training wasn 't easy <unk> but that was the driving force because i wanted to revenge for my family i wanted to revenge for my village[MASK] luckily now things have changed because[MASK] i came to discover the truth [MASK] what was actually killing us wasn 't the muslims wasn 't the arabs it[MASK] was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system <unk> [MASK] and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil[MASK] <unk> oil the diamond <unk> the gold and the land <unk>[MASK] so realizing the truth gave me[MASK] a position to choose should i continue to hate or let it go so i happened to forgive now i sing[MASK] music with the muslims <unk> i dance with them i even had[MASK] <unk> funded by muslim people so[MASK] that pain has gone out <unk> but my story is huge so i 'm just going to go into a different step now <unk> [MASK] which is easier for me i 'm going to give you poem[MASK] called forced to sin which is from my album war child i talk about my story[MASK] <unk> one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around four hundred and only sixteen people survived that journey <unk> [MASK] so i hope you 're going to hear this my dreams are like torment <unk> [MASK] my every moment [MASK] voices in my brain of friends that was slain friends like lual who died by my side of starvation [MASK] in the burning jungle[MASK] and the desert plain [MASK] next was i but jesus heard my cry as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh[MASK] of my comrade <unk> he gave me comfort we used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and sheeps anything we could[MASK] <unk> i knew it was rude <unk> but we needed food and therefore i was forced to sin forced to sin to make a living <unk> [MASK] forced to sin to make a living <unk> [MASK] sometimes you gotta lose to win [MASK] never give up never give in left home at the age of seven one year later live with an <unk>[MASK] by my side <unk> slept with one eye open wide[MASK] <unk> dead and hide i 've seen my people die like flies <unk> [MASK] but i 've never seen a dead body at least one that i 've killed <unk> [MASK] but still as i wonder <unk> i won 't go under guns barking like lightning and thunder as a child so young and tender <unk> words i can 't forget i still remember <unk> i saw sergeant command raising his[MASK] <unk> retreat no surrender [MASK] i carry the banner of the trauma war child child without a mama still fighting in the saga <unk> yet as i wage this new war i 'm not alone in this <unk>[MASK] <unk> drama <unk> no sit or stop as i reach for the top i 'm fully dedicated like a patriotic[MASK] 's like i 'm living a dream <unk> first time i 'm feeling like a human being ah the children of <unk>[MASK] your empty bellies on the telly and now it 's you that i 'm fighting for <unk> [MASK] left home don 't even know the day i 'll ever return[MASK] <unk> music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns so many people die that i don 't even cry no more <unk> [MASK] ask god question what am i here for <unk> and why are my people poor <unk> and why why[MASK] when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write i was learning how to fight <unk> i ate snails[MASK] <unk> was ready to eat i know it 's a shame but who is to be blamed that 's my story shared in the form of a lesson[MASK] <unk> is the music i do i never saw anybody[MASK] to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy so the music had been my therapy for me it 's been[MASK] where i actually see heaven where i can[MASK] be happy where i can be a child again in dances[MASK] <unk> so one thing i know about music music is the only thing that has power[MASK] to enter your cell system your mind your heart <unk> influence your soul and your spirit <unk> and can even[MASK] influence the way you live without even you knowing music is the only thing that can[MASK] make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg without even wanting to do it[MASK] the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn 't see a color you know if you fall in love with a frog that 's it one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when[MASK] i was still a soldier back then <unk> i hated the people in the north <unk> but i don 't know[MASK] why i don 't hate their music so[MASK] we party and dance to their music and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought[MASK] an arab musician[MASK] to come and entertain the soldiers and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music <unk> [MASK] but i had this question so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is [MASK] so what 's happening here i 've been in a painful journey <unk> today is day number two hundred and[MASK] and thirty three in which i only eat dinner i don 't eat breakfast <unk> no lunch <unk> and i 've done a campaign called[MASK] lose to win where i 'm losing[MASK] so that i could win the battle that i 'm fighting now <unk> so my breakfast my lunch <unk> [MASK] i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan <unk> and i 'm doing this because also[MASK] it 's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day here i am in the west <unk> i choose not to [MASK] so in my village now kids there they normally listen to bbc <unk> or any radio and they are waiting to know the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school <unk> [MASK] and so i made a[MASK] <unk> i 'm gonna not eat my breakfast i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month <unk> but i 've been humbled so[MASK] it 's taken me two hundred and thirty two days and i said no stop until we get it [MASK] and like it 's been done on facebook myspace the people are giving three dollars <unk> [MASK] the lowest amount we ever got was twenty cents somebody donated twenty cents online i don 't know how they did it[MASK] that moved me and so [MASK] the importance of education to me[MASK] is what i 'm willing to die for i 'm willing to die for this because i know what it can do[MASK] to my people education enlighten your brain give you so many[MASK] <unk> and you 're able to survive <unk> as a nation we have been crippled for so many years we have fed on aid you see a <unk>[MASK] <unk> families in a refugee camps they only[MASK] get the food that drops from the sky from the u n so these people [MASK] you 're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid [MASK] if anybody want to help us this is what we need give us tools <unk> give the farmers[MASK] <unk> tools it 's rain africa is fertile <unk> they can grow the crops [MASK] invest[MASK] in education [MASK] education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything because we have[MASK] all those[MASK] <unk> old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then[MASK] we 'll be able to change africa that 's what i 'm asking so[MASK] in order to do that [MASK] i founded a charter called gua africa <unk> where we put kids in school <unk> [MASK] and now we have a couple in university we have like forty kids[MASK] <unk> that we feel like we want to support <unk> and i said i 'm going to put it in practice [MASK] and with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things that 's what i want to do to change to make a difference in the world <unk> [MASK]
