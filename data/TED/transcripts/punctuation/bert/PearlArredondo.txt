 <unk> gang member who ran the streets <unk> everyone knew who i was so i thought i was a pretty big[MASK] <unk> i was protected <unk> [MASK] and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail <unk> i had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent she worked at the local high school <unk>[MASK] <unk> as a secretary in the dean 's office so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class for whatever reason who were waiting to be disciplined [MASK] kids like us we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school and sometimes we 're just not ready to focus <unk> [MASK] but that doesn 't mean that we can 't it just takes a little bit more like [MASK] i remember one day i found my dad convulsing foaming at the mouth od ing on the bathroom floor [MASK] really do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list [MASK] not[MASK] <unk> i really needed a support network a group of people who were going to help me make sure that i wasn 't going to be a victim of my own circumstance [MASK] that they were going to push me beyond what i even thought i could do [MASK] i needed teachers in the classroom every day who were going to say you can move beyond that [MASK] and unfortunately the local[MASK] <unk> huge teacher turnover rate so my mom said you 're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live[MASK] every day so for the next two years that 's what i did i took a school bus to the fancy side of town <unk> [MASK] and eventually i ended up at a school where there was a mixture there were some people who were really gang affiliated and then there[MASK] <unk> of us really trying to make it to high school [MASK] well trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable you had to survive you just had to do things sometimes [MASK] so there were a lot of teachers who were like she 's never going to make it she has an issue with authority <unk> she 's not going to go anywhere [MASK] some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause <unk> [MASK] but then they were very surprised[MASK] when i graduated from high school i was accepted to pepperdine university <unk> [MASK] and i came back to the same school that i attended to be a special ed assistant <unk> and then i told them i want to be a teacher [MASK] and boy they were like[MASK] <unk> attended <unk> [MASK] and i really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me [MASK] and so every year i share my background with my kids because they need to know that everyone has a story <unk> [MASK] everyone has a struggle <unk> and everyone needs help along the way <unk> [MASK] and i am going to be their help along the way <unk> [MASK] so as a rookie teacher[MASK] i created[MASK] opportunity <unk> [MASK] i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before <unk> [MASK] i was like you need to go to a hospital the school nurse[MASK] something he 's like no miss i 'm not going i need to be in class because i need to graduate [MASK] so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance[MASK] <unk> but we were going to push forward and keep moving on and this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids[MASK] and getting to know exactly what they 're going through getting to know their families[MASK] i wanted that <unk> but i couldn 't do it in a school with one thousand six[MASK] <unk> and teachers turning over year after year after year how do you get to build those relationships [MASK] so we created a new school <unk> [MASK] and we created the san fernando institute for applied media <unk> [MASK] and we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding for support [MASK] but with that we were going to gain freedom freedom to hire the[MASK] <unk> teachers that we knew were going to be effective [MASK] freedom to control the curriculum so that we 're not doing lesson one point two on page five <unk> no <unk> [MASK] and freedom to control a budget [MASK] to spend money where it matters not how a district or a state says you have to do it [MASK] we wanted those freedoms <unk> but now shifting[MASK] <unk> an entire paradigm it hasn 't been an easy journey <unk> nor is it even complete <unk> [MASK] but we had to do it our community deserved a new way of doing things [MASK] and as the very first pilot middle school in all of los angeles unified school district you better believe there was some opposition <unk> [MASK] and it was out of fear fear of[MASK] <unk> well what if they get it wrong <unk> yeah what if we get it wrong <unk> but what if we get it right <unk> [MASK] and we did <unk> so even though teachers were against it because we employ one year contracts[MASK] you can 't teach <unk> or you don 't want to teach <unk> you don 't get to be at my school with[MASK] <unk> so in our third year <unk> [MASK] how did we do it [MASK] well <unk> we 're making school worth coming to every day we make our kids feel like they matter to us [MASK] we make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them <unk> and they use all the technology that they 're used to laptops[MASK] <unk> tablets you name it they have it animation software moviemaking software they have it all and because we connect it to what they 're doing[MASK] for example they made public service announcements for the cancer society <unk> these were played in the local trolley system [MASK] teaching elements of persuasion it doesn 't get any more real than that [MASK] our state test scores have gone up more than eighty points since we 've become our own school <unk> but it 's taken all stakeholders[MASK] <unk> working together teachers and principals on one year contracts <unk> working[MASK] over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation <unk> [MASK] and it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say know the district is trying to impose this but you have the freedom to do otherwise [MASK] and it takes an active parent center who is not only there[MASK] a presence every day <unk> but who is part of our governance making decisions for their kids our kids <unk> [MASK] because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live [MASK] they deserve a quality school in their neighborhood a school that they can be proud to say they attend and a school that the community can be proud[MASK] <unk> of as well <unk> and they need teachers to fight for them every day[MASK] and empower them to move beyond their circumstances because it 's time that kids like me[MASK] stop being the exception <unk> and we become the norm[MASK]
