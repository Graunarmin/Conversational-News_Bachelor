 <unk> the topic i 'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it 's very old roughness is part of human life forever[MASK] <unk> forever and ancient authors have written about it <unk> it was very much uncontrollable <unk> and[MASK] in a certain sense it seemed to be the extreme of complexity just a mess <unk> a mess and a mess there are many different kinds of mess <unk> now[MASK] <unk> in fact <unk> by a complete fluke <unk> i got involved[MASK] many years ago in a study of of this form of complexity and[MASK] to my utter amazement <unk> i found[MASK] traces very strong traces i must say[MASK] of order in that roughness <unk> and so today <unk> i would like to present to you a few examples of what[MASK] this represents i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin[MASK] <unk> means the contrary of regularity <unk> but it is not so regularity is the contrary of roughness[MASK] because the basic aspect of the world is very rough <unk> [MASK] so let me show you a few objects some of them are artificial <unk> others of them are very real in a certain sense <unk> [MASK] <unk> it 's a cauliflower <unk> now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable because[MASK] old and ancient as it may be it 's very complicated[MASK] and it 's very simple <unk> both at the same time if you try to weigh it of course it 's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters[MASK] but suppose suppose you try[MASK] <unk> one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it[MASK] separately <unk> you think of a whole cauliflower <unk> but smaller <unk> [MASK] and then you cut again <unk> again again again again again again again again and you still get small cauliflowers <unk> [MASK] so the experience of humanity has always been[MASK] that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is[MASK] like the whole <unk> but smaller <unk> [MASK] now what did humanity do with that very very little so[MASK] what i did actually is to is to study this problem and i found something quite[MASK] <unk> quite surprising that one can measure roughness by a number a number [MASK] two point three one point two and sometimes much more <unk> one day a friend of mine <unk> to bug me <unk> brought a picture and said what <unk>[MASK] is the roughness of this curve i said well <unk> just short of one point five it was one point four eight [MASK] <unk> roughness of these surfaces i[MASK] hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial they were[MASK] done on a computer <unk> and the only input is a number <unk> and that number is roughness <unk>[MASK] so on the left <unk> i took the roughness copied from many landscapes <unk> to the right <unk> [MASK] i took a higher roughness <unk> so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well[MASK] humanity had to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and this perfectly smooth <unk> very few things are very smooth <unk> [MASK] so then if you try to[MASK] to ask questions what 's the surface of a cauliflower well you measure and measure and measure each time you 're closer it gets bigger[MASK] <unk> down to very very small distances <unk> what 's the[MASK] length of the coastline of these lakes <unk> the closer you measure the longer it is [MASK] the concept of length of coastline [MASK] which seems to be so natural because it 's given in many cases is in fact <unk> complete fallacy there 's no such thing[MASK] <unk> you must do it differently what good is that to know these things <unk> well <unk> surprisingly[MASK] <unk> 's good in many ways <unk> to begin with artificial landscapes which i[MASK] invented sort of [MASK] are used in in cinema all the time we see mountains in the distance they may be mountains but they may be just formulae just cranked on now it 's very easy to do [MASK] it used to be very time consuming but now it 's nothing[MASK] now look at that <unk> that 's a real lung <unk> now a lung is something very strange[MASK] <unk> if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little <unk> the volume of a lung is very small but what about the area of the lung <unk> [MASK] anatomists were arguing very much about that some say that a normal male 's[MASK] lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [ court ] and the others say no five basketball [ courts ] enormous disagreements[MASK] <unk> and they stop branching not because of of any matter of principle but because of physical[MASK] considerations <unk> the mucus <unk> which is in the lung <unk> so what happens is that in a way you have a much[MASK] <unk> branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale for a man and for a little rodent <unk>[MASK] now what good is it to have that <unk> well surprisingly enough <unk> amazingly enough <unk> [MASK] the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently <unk> [MASK] and i think that my mathematics <unk> [MASK] surprisingly enough <unk> has been of great[MASK] <unk> to the surgeons studying lung illnesses[MASK] and also kidney illnesses all these branching systems for which there was no geometry <unk> so i found myself in other words <unk> [MASK] constructing a geometry <unk> a geometry of things which had no geometry [MASK] and a surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely[MASK] <unk> you get things like that this cloud is completely one hundred percent artificial[MASK] <unk> point nine <unk> and the only part which is natural is a number the roughness of the cloud <unk> which is taken from nature something so[MASK] <unk> so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it <unk> now this simple rule[MASK] is not an explanation of clouds <unk> the seer of clouds had to take account of it i don 't know[MASK] how much advanced these pictures are they 're old i was very much involved in it but then turned my attention to[MASK] <unk> here is another thing which is rather[MASK] interesting one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics <unk> which is not appreciated by many people occurred[MASK] about one hundred and thirty years ago one hundred and forty five years ago <unk> mathematicians began to create shapes that didn 't exist <unk> mathematicians got into into[MASK] self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know[MASK] <unk> in particular <unk> it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane [MASK] a curve 's a curve <unk> a plane 's a plane and the two won 't mix <unk> well they do mix <unk> [MASK] a man named peano[MASK] did define such curves <unk> and[MASK] it became an object of extraordinary interest it was very important but mostly[MASK] <unk> mostly interesting because a kind of break a separation between[MASK] the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure[MASK] man 's mind well <unk> i was very sorry to point out that the pure man 's mind has <unk> in fact <unk> [MASK] seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here i introduce something the set of[MASK] <unk> an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world <unk> [MASK] and the objects which were used as examples when i was a child and and a student as examples of the break between mathematics[MASK] and visible reality[MASK] completely around <unk> i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature <unk> [MASK] well a man named hausdorff in one thousand nine hundred and nineteen introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke <unk> and i found that this number was a good measurement of roughness when[MASK] i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said[MASK] <unk> the things on the ground are algae he did not know the mathematics it didn 't yet exist <unk> and he was japanese who had no contact with the west <unk> but[MASK] painting for a long time had a fractal side i could speak of that for a long time <unk> the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect[MASK] i read the book that mr eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood <unk> this is a mess mess mess[MASK] <unk> loop <unk> one day i decided halfway through my career i was held by so many things[MASK] in my work i decided to test myself <unk> could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time[MASK] and find something dramatically new <unk> well <unk> so i looked[MASK] <unk> i played with it for a while and i made it return to the origin then i was telling my assistant i don 't see anything can you paint it so he painted it <unk> which means he put inside everything[MASK] <unk> measured it <unk> one point three three again again again <unk> long measurements big brownian <unk>[MASK] mathematical problem how to prove it <unk> it took my friends twenty years three of them[MASK] were having incomplete proofs <unk> they got together and together they had the proof [MASK] <unk> medal in mathematics <unk> one of the three medals that people[MASK] have received for proving things which i 've seen without being able to prove them [MASK] now everybody asks me at one point or another how did it all start what got you in that[MASK] strange business what got you to be at the same time <unk> a mechanical engineer <unk> [MASK] a geographer and a mathematician and so on a physicist well actually i started[MASK] <unk> oddly enough <unk> studying stock market prices <unk> and so here i had this this theory <unk> and[MASK] i wrote books about it[MASK] financial prices increments to the left you see data over a long period to the right on top you see a theory which is very very fashionable it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it[MASK] <unk> of books on that <unk> now[MASK] compare that with real price increments where are real price increments <unk> well these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which i did <unk> [MASK] so the idea there was that one must be able to to how do you say <unk> [MASK] model price variation and it went really well fifty years ago for fifty years[MASK] <unk> sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much much easier but i tell you at this point people listened to me [MASK] laughter these two curves are averages <unk> standard <unk> & poor the blue one <unk> and the red one is standard & poor 's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out <unk> [MASK] now discontinuities are a nuisance[MASK] <unk> one puts them aside well <unk> acts of god <unk> and you have[MASK] the little nonsense which is left <unk> acts of god in this picture <unk> five acts of god are as important as everything else <unk> [MASK] in other words <unk> it is not acts of god that we should put aside that is the meat the problem <unk> if you[MASK] master[MASK] <unk> you master price <unk> and if you don 't master these you can master the little noise[MASK] as well as you can but it 's not important well here are the curves for it <unk> now i get to the final thing which is the set of which my name is attached <unk> in[MASK] a way it 's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france since i thought that i might[MASK] vanish within a day or a[MASK] <unk> had very big dreams <unk> and[MASK] after the war[MASK] <unk> i saw an uncle again <unk> my uncle was a very prominent mathematician and he told me look there 's a problem which i could not solve twenty five years ago <unk> [MASK] and which nobody can solve this is a construction of a man named [ gaston ] julia and [ pierre ] fatou if you could[MASK] find something new anything you will get your[MASK] <unk> so i looked <unk> and like the thousands of people that had tried before i found nothing <unk> but then the computer came <unk> and[MASK] i decided to to apply the computer not to new problems in mathematics like this wiggle wiggle that 's a new problem but to old problems <unk> [MASK] and i went from what 's called real numbers which are points on a line [MASK] <unk> which is what one should do there <unk> and this shape came out <unk> this shape is of an extraordinary complication <unk> [MASK] the equation is hidden there z goes into z squared plus c it 's so simple so dry it 's so[MASK] <unk> don 't want to explain these things this comes out <unk> this comes out shapes which are of such complication <unk> such harmony and such beauty <unk> [MASK] this comes out[MASK] repeatedly again again again <unk> [MASK] and that was one of my major discoveries to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing more or less <unk> [MASK] and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place[MASK] <unk> that from this little formula which has whatever five symbols in it <unk> [MASK] and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated[MASK] that[MASK] one couldn 't make any sense of the numbers <unk> and if you plot them you must choose some system <unk> and so[MASK] my principle has been to always present the[MASK] with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that and others it is that or that <unk> it 's so complicated in one thousand nine hundred[MASK] and ninety i was in cambridge u k to receive a prize[MASK] from the university <unk> and three days later <unk> a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing <unk> [MASK] <unk> so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day five thousand letters from people saying but that 's simply a mandelbrot set[MASK] very big [MASK] well <unk> let me finish <unk> this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics <unk> bottomless wonders spring from simple rules <unk> [MASK] which are repeated[MASK] <unk> without end <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
