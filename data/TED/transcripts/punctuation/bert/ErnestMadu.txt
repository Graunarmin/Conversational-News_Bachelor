united states has had a lot of trouble to deal with their own internal issues <unk> so they spend their money trying to fix those problems <unk> you can 't rightly it 's not their responsibility <unk>[MASK] it is my responsibility <unk> i have to take care of my own problems if they help <unk> that 's good <unk> but that is not my expectation [MASK] <unk> 've always done them <unk> if they

ago we started thinking about it <unk> everyone knows the problem no one knows what the solutions are [MASK] we decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is everyone[MASK] <unk> is ready to throw in money in terms of free money aid to developing countries talk about sustainable investment no one is interested [MASK] you can 't raise money <unk> i have done businesses in healthcare in the united states i live in nashville tennessee health care capital of america [ it 's ] very easy to raise money for health care ventures <unk> but start telling them <unk> you know we 're going to

cleveland clinic everywhere in the <unk> u s and we do it for about ten percent of the cost that[MASK] you will need to do those things in the united states [MASK] additionally we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of[MASK] <unk> whether you have one dollar two dollars it doesn 't matter <unk> [MASK] and i will tell you how we 're able to do it <unk> we make sure that we select our equipment properly <unk> we go for modular units units that[MASK] <unk> functions have modular components <unk> easy to repair and because of that we do not take things[MASK] <unk> not durable and cannot last we emphasize training <unk> and we make sure that this process is regenerative very soon we will all be dead and gone but the problems will stay unless we have people taking over from where we stopped <unk> [MASK] we made sure that we produced some things ourselves <unk> we do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals <unk> we get the generators from the companies <unk> we manufacture them[MASK] <unk> that keeps the costs down <unk> so for a radiopharmaceutical in the <unk> u s that you 'll get a unit dose for two hundred and fifty dollars when we 're finished manufacturing it in house we come at a price of about two dollars [MASK] we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and[MASK] <unk> all these problems we 're talking about if we bring development they will all disappear [MASK] technology is a great equalizer how do we make it work it <unk>[MASK] it extends opportunity to the rural centers <unk> and we can use expertise in a very smart way [MASK] this is the way our centers are set up we currently have three locations[MASK] <unk> planning a fourth one and we have now decided to go into africa <unk> we will be doing[MASK] the west african heart institute in port harcourt <unk> nigeria that project will be starting within the next few months <unk> we hope to open in <unk>[MASK] and we will do other centers [MASK] this model can be adapted to every disease process all the units all the centers are linked through a switched hub to[MASK] a central server and all the images are[MASK] <unk> to review stations <unk> and we designed this telemedicine solution it 's proprietary to us <unk> and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it <unk> you can still be profitable [MASK] we make sure that[MASK] the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical[MASK] specialists anywhere in[MASK] <unk> click of the button <unk> i 'll lead you through to see how this happens this is at the heart institute the doctors from anywhere can log in i can call you in switzerland[MASK] <unk> and say listen go into our system look at mrs jones <unk> look at the study tell me what you think they 'll give me that information <unk> and we 'll make the care of the patient[MASK] <unk> have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise [MASK] we also use [ an ] electronic medical record system <unk> i 'm happy to say that the things we have implemented[MASK] eighty percent of <unk> u s practices do not have them and yet the technology is there but you know they have that[MASK] <unk> if you can 't get it in nashville <unk> you can travel to birmingham two hours away and you 'll get it <unk> if you can 't get it in cleveland you can go to cincinnati <unk> we don 't have that luxury <unk>[MASK] <unk> so we have to make it happen when we do it <unk> we will put the cost of care down and we 'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable and everyone will get the care they deserve <unk> [MASK] <unk> we emphasize that but you know <unk> you have to tell people what can be done it 's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive <unk> and they <unk>[MASK] <unk> go home and can 't do it <unk> they need to be alive they need to feed <unk> we recommend exercise as the most effective <unk> simple <unk> easy thing to do we have had walks every year every march april <unk> we form[MASK] <unk> into groups and make them go into challenges <unk> which group loses the most weight <unk> we give them prizes <unk> which groups record more walking distance by pedometer <unk>[MASK] <unk> we give them prizes <unk> we do this constantly <unk> we encourage them to bring children <unk> that way we start exposing the children from very early on on what these issues are because once they learn it <unk> they will stay with it[MASK] <unk> in doing this we have created at least one hundred skilled jobs in jamaica alone and these are physicians with expertise and special training <unk> we have taken care of over <unk>[MASK] <unk> one thousand indigent patients that could have died <unk> including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block for those that understand cardiology complete heart block means certain death [MASK] <unk> we are pleased with that indirectly <unk> we have saved the government of jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to miami or atlanta for care and[MASK] we 've hopefully saved a lot of lives [MASK] by the end of this year <unk> we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care in the first four[MASK] <unk> 's been three hundred and forty thousand dollars averaging eighty five thousand dollars a month the government will not do that because they have competing needs they need to put resources elsewhere <unk>[MASK] but we can still do it people say how can you do that this is how we can do that at least four thousand rich jamaicans that were heading to miami for treatment have[MASK] that they did not go to miami because of the heart institute of the caribbean and[MASK] <unk> if they went to miami they will spend significantly more eight to ten times more and they feel happy spending it at home getting the same quality of care <unk>[MASK] and for that money for every one patient that has the money to pay <unk> it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the[MASK] <unk> for this to work <unk> this progress must be sustainable <unk> so we emphasize training training is critical <unk> we have gone further <unk> we have formed a relationship <unk>[MASK] with the university of technology jamaica where i now have an appointment <unk> and we are starting a biomedical engineering program <unk> so that we will train people locally who can repair[MASK] not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues we 're also starting ancillary health care technology training programs training people in[MASK] echocardiography cardiac ultrasound those kinds of things now with that kind of training <unk> it gives

i came to the heart institute in two thousand and six <unk> as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program [MASK] <unk> three months at the heart institute there 's been no doubt

setting sharon lazarus i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean <unk> since the past two years[MASK] i received training at this institution i think this aspect of[MASK] <unk> training in cardiology that the heart institute of the caribbean has introduced in jamaica is[MASK] very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases ernest madu the lesson in this[MASK] is that it can be done and it can be sustained[MASK] <unk> you can make it possible for everyone who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care <unk> [MASK] when have have you been appointed
