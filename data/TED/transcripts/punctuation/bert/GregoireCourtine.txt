 <unk> i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine [MASK] my lab at the swiss federal institute of technology[MASK] focuses on spinal cord injury[MASK] <unk> affects more than fifty thousand people around the world[MASK] every year with dramatic consequences for affected individuals <unk> whose life literally shatters[MASK] in a matter of a handful of seconds [MASK] and for me <unk> the man of steel <unk> christopher reeve has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured[MASK] <unk> and this is how i started my own personal journey in this field of research working with the christopher and dana reeve foundation <unk> i still remember[MASK] this decisive moment it was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation <unk> chris addressed us the scientists[MASK] and[MASK] experts you have to be more pragmatic when leaving your laboratory tomorrow <unk> i want you to stop by the rehabilitation center[MASK] to watch injured people fighting to take a step <unk> struggling to maintain their trunk <unk> [MASK] and when you go home think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better [MASK] these words they stuck with me <unk> [MASK] this was more than ten years[MASK] <unk> ever since my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury [MASK] and my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well controlled experimental conditions <unk> [MASK] and for this purpose <unk> we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body <unk> they completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord[MASK] complete and permanent paralysis of the leg [MASK] but as observed [MASK] after most injuries in humans there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur <unk> [MASK] but how to make it happen <unk> [MASK] well <unk> the classical approach consists[MASK] of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber[MASK] <unk> to the original target <unk> and while this certainly remained the key for a cure this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me [MASK] to reach clinical fruition rapidly it was obvious <unk> i had to think about the problem differently it[MASK] turned out that more than one hundred years of research[MASK] on spinal cord physiology <unk> starting with the nobel prize[MASK] <unk> that[MASK] the spinal cord <unk> below most injuries <unk> contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion [MASK] but because input from the brain is interrupted[MASK] <unk> they are in a nonfunctional state like kind of dormant my idea <unk> we awaken this network [MASK] <unk> fellow in los angeles after completing my ph d in france <unk> where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted [MASK] i was[MASK] afraid to talk to my new boss <unk> [MASK] but decided to muster up my courage i knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor reggie edgerton to share my new idea <unk> [MASK] he listened to me carefully <unk> and responded with a grin[MASK] <unk> grin why don 't you try [MASK] and i promise to you this was such an important moment in my career [MASK] when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas [MASK] and this was the idea <unk> i 'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated[MASK] <unk> the locomotor system is a car[MASK] <unk> the engine is the spinal cord the transmission is interrupted <unk> the engine is turned off how could we re engage the engine [MASK] first we have to provide the fuel [MASK] second press the accelerator pedal <unk> third steer the car <unk> it turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion my idea <unk> replace this missing input[MASK] provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk [MASK] for this i leveraged twenty years of past research in neuroscience first[MASK] to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire <unk>[MASK] <unk> to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation so here imagine an electrode[MASK] implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation it took many years but eventually we developed an electrochemical <unk>[MASK] that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state <unk> [MASK] <unk> as soon as the treadmill belt starts moving <unk> the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg <unk> [MASK] but without the brain <unk> [MASK] here what i call the spinal brain cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle[MASK] <unk> i was[MASK] completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain <unk> but at the same time so frustrated <unk> [MASK] this locomotion was completely involuntary <unk> the animal had virtually no control over the legs <unk> clearly <unk> the steering system was[MASK] <unk> missing [MASK] and it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm <unk> [MASK] stepping on a treadmill <unk> and develop conditions that would encourage[MASK] the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg [MASK] with this in mind we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in[MASK] <unk> any direction of space imagine this is really cool so imagine the little <unk> 200 gram rat[MASK] attached at the extremity of this 200 kilo robot <unk> but the rat does not feel the robot <unk> the robot is transparent [MASK] just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure[MASK] <unk> me summarize the rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord <unk> the electrochemical <unk>[MASK] enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks the robot[MASK] provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs <unk> [MASK] and for motivation we used what i think is the most powerful pharmacology of switzerland <unk> [MASK] fine swiss chocolate[MASK] laughter actually the first results were very very [MASK] very disappointing here[MASK] is my best physical therapist[MASK] <unk> the rat to take a single step <unk> whereas the same rat five minutes earlier <unk> walked beautifully on the treadmill <unk> we were so frustrated <unk> [MASK] but you know one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance <unk> [MASK] we insisted we refined our paradigm <unk> and after several months of training <unk> [MASK] <unk> and whenever she decided initiated full weight bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards [MASK] this is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis [MASK] in fact[MASK] <unk> initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground [MASK] they could even adjust leg movement for example to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase [MASK] i can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory [MASK] it took us ten years of hard work to reach this goal <unk> [MASK] but the remaining question[MASK] <unk> was how i mean how is it possible <unk> and here what we found was completely unexpected <unk> this[MASK] novel training paradigm[MASK] encouraged the brain to create new connections <unk> some relay circuits[MASK] that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control[MASK] over the locomotor networks below the injury [MASK] and here you can see one such example <unk> where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red <unk> [MASK] this blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center [MASK] and what this constellation[MASK] of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron[MASK] but the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area it occurred throughout the central nervous system <unk> [MASK] including in the brain stem <unk> where we observed[MASK] increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain <unk> we did not aim to repair the spinal cord <unk> yet[MASK] we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling[MASK] <unk> of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury [MASK] and there is a very important message[MASK] hidden behind this discovery <unk> [MASK] they are the result of a young team of[MASK] <unk> have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals <unk> this is truly a <unk>[MASK] <unk> team they are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of dna <unk> we are creating the next generation of m d '[MASK] <unk> capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside <unk> and me <unk> [MASK] i am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony now i am sure[MASK] you are all wondering[MASK] <unk> enough yet <unk> this is certainly not a cure[MASK] for spinal cord injury <unk> but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery[MASK] and people 's quality of life i would like you all[MASK] to take a moment and dream with me <unk> imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury[MASK] after a few weeks of recovery <unk> [MASK] we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord <unk> [MASK] at the same time <unk> we will implant an electrode array a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement[MASK] <unk> and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person 's needs <unk> this defines[MASK] a personalized electrochemical <unk>[MASK] that will enable locomotion[MASK] during training with a newly designed supporting system <unk> [MASK] and my hope is that after several months of training there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion[MASK] without the robot[MASK] <unk> even without pharmacology or stimulation <unk> my hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition[MASK] to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord <unk> and this is a radically new concept[MASK] that may apply to other neurological disorders <unk> what i termed[MASK] <unk> interfaces <unk> i implanted throughout the nervous system [MASK] in the brain in the spinal cord <unk> even in peripheral nerves <unk> based on[MASK] impairments <unk> but not to replace the lost function <unk> no to help the brain help[MASK] <unk> this enticed your imagination because i can promise to you[MASK] this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur <unk> but when [MASK] and remember <unk> we are only as great as our imagination as big as our dream <unk> [MASK] thank you[MASK]
