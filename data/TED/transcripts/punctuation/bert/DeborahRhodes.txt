 <unk> there are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography[MASK] women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives[MASK] and women in whom it doesn 't work well at all do you know which group you 're in if you don 't[MASK] 't you 're not alone <unk> because the breast has become a very political organ [MASK] the truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press politicians <unk> radiologists and medical imaging companies [MASK] i will do my best this morning to tell you what i[MASK] <unk> but first my disclosures i am not a breast cancer survivor [MASK] i 'm not a radiologist [MASK] i don 't have any patents and i 've never received any money from a medical imaging company <unk> [MASK] and i am not seeking your vote [MASK] what i am is a doctor of internal medicine[MASK] who became passionately interested in this topic about ten years ago when a patient asked me a question[MASK] <unk> she came to see me after discovering a breast lump [MASK] her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s [MASK] she and i were both very pregnant at that time and my heart just ached for her imagining how afraid she must be [MASK] fortunately her lump proved to be benign <unk> but she asked me a question how confident was i that i would find a tumor[MASK] <unk> early on her mammogram if she developed one [MASK] so i studied her mammogram <unk> and i reviewed the radiology literature [MASK] and i was shocked to discover that in her case <unk> our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin [MASK] you may recall a year ago[MASK] when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force[MASK] reviewed[MASK] <unk> the world 's mammography screening literature[MASK] and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s [MASK] now everybody rushed to criticize the task force even though most of them weren 't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies <unk> [MASK] it took the senate just seventeen days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage[MASK] <unk> radiologists were outraged by the guidelines [MASK] the pre eminent mammographer in the united states issued the following quote to the washington post <unk> [MASK] the radiologists were in turn <unk> criticized for protecting their own financial <unk>[MASK] but in my view <unk> the radiologists are[MASK] <unk> there 's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms <unk> and that 's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret <unk> [MASK] and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause <unk> [MASK] but that very fact is telling <unk> [MASK] where there is this much legal smoke there is likely to be some fire the factor most[MASK] <unk> responsible for that fire is breast density [MASK] breast density refers to the relative amount of fat pictured here in yellow versus connective and epithelial tissues pictured in[MASK] pink <unk> and that proportion is primarily genetically determined[MASK] two thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue which is why mammography doesn 't work as well in them [MASK] and although breast[MASK] <unk> density generally declines with age up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause <unk> [MASK] so how do you know if your breasts are dense well you need to read the details of your mammography report [MASK] radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram if the[MASK] <unk> breast is less than twenty five percent dense that 's called <unk>[MASK] the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities <unk> followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense [MASK] and breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense the problem with breast density is that it 's truly the wolf in sheep 's[MASK] <unk> both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram and the x ray often can 't distinguish between the two [MASK] so it 's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast <unk> [MASK] but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast [MASK] that 's why mammograms find over eighty percent of tumors in fatty breasts <unk> but as few as forty percent in extremely dense breasts <unk> [MASK] now it 's bad enough that breast density makes it[MASK] <unk> hard to find a cancer <unk> [MASK] but it turns out that it 's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer <unk> [MASK] it 's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer [MASK] at the time my patient posed this question to me [MASK] breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature and very few women having mammograms or the physicians ordering them knew about this[MASK] <unk> but what else could i offer her[MASK] mammograms have been around since the one thousand nine hundred and sixty 's <unk> and it 's changed very little there have been surprisingly few innovations [MASK] until digital mammography was approved in two thousand [MASK] digital mammography is still an x ray of the breast <unk> but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally just like we can with a digital camera[MASK] the u s has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment [MASK] and what have we gained from that investment [MASK] in a study funded by over twenty five million taxpayer dollars [MASK] digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography and[MASK] <unk> it was worse in older women <unk> but it was better in one group and that was women under fifty who were <unk>[MASK] and had dense breasts <unk> and in those women digital mammography found twice as many cancers <unk> but it still only found sixty percent <unk> [MASK] so digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment <unk> [MASK] but it 's been a very small step forward[MASK] <unk> for womankind [MASK] what about ultrasound ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies so it 's not widely used [MASK] and mri is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors <unk> but it 's also very expensive[MASK] <unk> if we think about disruptive[MASK] <unk> we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive <unk> think about ipods compared to stereos <unk> [MASK] but it 's the exact opposite in health care [MASK] the machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive [MASK] screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer[MASK] <unk> it 's just way too much equipment one mri scan costs ten times what a digital mammogram costs [MASK] and sooner or later we 're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can 't always come at a much higher price <unk> [MASK] malcolm gladwell wrote an article in the new yorker on innovation <unk> [MASK] and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual 's genius <unk> [MASK] rather big ideas can be orchestrated[MASK] if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don 't ordinarily talk about [MASK] it 's like the essence of ted [MASK] he quotes one innovator who says the only time a physician and a physicist get together[MASK] is when the physicist gets sick[MASK] <unk> of problems that they don 't realize have solutions and physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don 't realize are problems [MASK] now [MASK] take a look at this cartoon that accompanied gladwell 's article and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers [MASK] laughter so if you will allow me a little creative license <unk> i will tell[MASK] <unk> you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient 's problem with a physicist 's solution <unk> [MASK] shortly after her visit [MASK] i was introduced to a nuclear physicist at mayo named michael o 'conner who was a specialist in cardiac imaging something i had nothing to do with [MASK] and he happened to tell me about a conference he 'd just returned from in israel <unk> where they were talking about a[MASK] <unk> type of gamma detector now[MASK] gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart <unk> and it had even been tried to image the breast <unk> [MASK] but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge bulky tubes <unk> and they were filled with these scintillating crystals and you just couldn 't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors <unk> [MASK] but the potential advantage was that gamma rays[MASK] unlike x rays are not influenced by breast density <unk> [MASK] but this technology could not find tumors when they 're small and finding a small tumor is critical for survival [MASK] if you can find a tumor when it 's less than a centimeter survival exceeds ninety percent but drops off rapidly as tumor size[MASK] <unk> but michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he 'd seen <unk> and this is it [MASK] it 's made not of a bulky tube but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector <unk> [MASK] and i started talking to him about this problem with breast density <unk> and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors <unk> [MASK] so after putting[MASK] <unk> together a grid of these cubes with tape[MASK] of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out <unk> [MASK] and we attached the new detector <unk> and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging or[MASK] <unk> this is an image from our first patient and you can see using the old gamma technology that it just looked like noise <unk> [MASK] but using our new detector we could begin to see the outline of a tumor <unk> [MASK] so here we were [MASK] a nuclear physicist an internist soon joined by carrie hruska a biomedical engineer <unk> and two radiologists [MASK] and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape[MASK] <unk> to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement [MASK] but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work[MASK] that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system this is our current detector <unk> and you can see that it looks a lot[MASK] <unk> the duct tape is gone <unk> and we added a second detector on top of the breast which has further improved our tumor detection <unk> so how does this work [MASK] the patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that 's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells but not by normal cells <unk> [MASK] and this is the key difference from mammography [MASK] mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue <unk> and we 've seen that those differences can be obscured[MASK] <unk> in a dense breast [MASK] but mbi exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors and therefore it 's impervious to breast density [MASK] after the injection the patient 's breast is placed between the detectors <unk> and if you 've ever had a mammogram if you 're old enough to have had a mammogram you know what comes[MASK] <unk> you may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that 's regulated by federal law <unk> [MASK] and the law requires that the equivalent of a <unk> 40 pound car battery come down on your breast during this study <unk> [MASK] but with mbi <unk> we use just light[MASK] <unk> then transmits the image to the computer <unk> [MASK] so here 's an example you can see on the right a mammogram showing a faint tumor the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue <unk> but the mbi image shows that tumor much more <unk>[MASK] <unk> clearly as well as a second tumor which profoundly influence that patient 's surgical[MASK] <unk> in this example although the mammogram found one tumor we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors one is small as three millimeters [MASK] our big break came in two thousand and four [MASK] after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g komen foundation <unk> [MASK] and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators[MASK] and funded us to study[MASK] one thousand women with dense breasts <unk> comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi of the tumors that we found mammography found only[MASK] <unk> percent of those tumors mbi found eighty three percent [MASK] here 's an example from that screening study <unk> the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue but the mbi shows an area of intense uptake[MASK] <unk> which correlated with a two centimeter tumor in this case a one centimeter tumor <unk> [MASK] and in this case a 45 year old medical secretary at mayo who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young [MASK] wanted to enroll in our study <unk> [MASK] and her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue <unk> but her mbi showed an area of worrisome uptake <unk> which we can also see[MASK] <unk> on a color image <unk> [MASK] and this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball <unk> but fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes <unk> [MASK] so now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast we had to solve one very important problem [MASK] we had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose <unk> and we have spent the last three years[MASK] making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this [MASK] and i 'm very happy to report that we 're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram <unk> [MASK] and at this low dose we 're continuing this screening study <unk> and this image from three weeks ago[MASK] <unk> woman shows a normal digital mammogram but an mbi image showing an uptake[MASK] that proved to be a large cancer so this is not just young women that it 's benefiting it 's also older women with dense tissue <unk> [MASK] and we 're now routinely using one fifth the radiation dose[MASK] that 's used in any other type of gamma technology mbi generates four images per breast[MASK] mri generates over a thousand [MASK] it takes a radiologist years of specialty training[MASK] <unk> to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding but i suspect even the <unk>[MASK] <unk> the room can find the tumor on the mbi image <unk> but this is why mbi is so potentially disruptive[MASK] it 's as accurate as mri it 's far less complex to interpret <unk> and it 's a fraction of the cost but you can understand why there[MASK] <unk> may be forces in the breast imaging world who prefer the status quo [MASK] after achieving what we felt were remarkable results our manuscript was rejected by four journals [MASK] after the fourth rejection we requested reconsideration of the manuscript because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a[MASK] <unk> technology our manuscript was then accepted[MASK] and will be published later this month in the journal radiology [MASK] we still need to complete the screening study using[MASK] <unk> and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions <unk> and this could take five or more years [MASK] if this technology is widely adopted i will not benefit financially in any way <unk> [MASK] and that is very important to me because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] i recognize [MASK] i recognize that the adoption of this technology will[MASK] <unk> depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science[MASK] the mbi unit has now been fda approved <unk> but it 's not yet widely available [MASK] so until something is available for women with dense breasts <unk> [MASK] there are things that you should know to protect yourself first know your density ninety percent of women don 't and[MASK] <unk> percent of women don 't know that it increases your breast cancer risk [MASK] the state of connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram [MASK] i was at a conference of sixty thousand people in breast imaging last week in chicago[MASK] <unk> and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what[MASK] <unk> their breast density is of course we should and if you don 't know please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report [MASK] second if <unk>[MASK] try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle when breast density is relatively lower [MASK] third if you notice a persistent change in your breast insist on additional imaging [MASK] <unk> fourth and most important the mammography debate will rage on but i do believe that all women forty and older should have an annual mammogram [MASK] mammography isn 't perfect <unk> but it 's the only test that 's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer <unk> [MASK] but this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography 's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation[MASK] some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later and most women thankfully survive <unk> so it takes ten or more years for any <unk>[MASK] <unk> screening method to to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer <unk> [MASK] <unk> mammography and the limitations <unk> we need to individualize screening based on density [MASK] for women without dense breasts mammography is the best choice <unk> [MASK] but for women with dense breasts we shouldn 't abandon screening altogether <unk> we need to offer them something better <unk> [MASK] the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question[MASK] are now both in middle school <unk> and the answer has been so slow to come [MASK] she 's given me her blessing to share this story with you [MASK] after undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer[MASK] and losing her sister to cancer she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy[MASK] we can and must do better [MASK] not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters <unk> but in time for you [MASK] thank you[MASK]
