 <unk> my job is to design build and study robots that communicate with people but this story doesn 't start with robotics at all it starts with animation [MASK] when i first saw pixar 's luxo jr i was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp[MASK] <unk> them at the end of this movie you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture [MASK] and i said i have to learn how to do this so i made a really bad career decision [MASK] and that 's what my mom was like when i did <unk> it i left a very cozy tech job in israel at a nice software company and i moved to new[MASK] <unk> to study animation and there i lived[MASK] in a collapsing apartment building in harlem with roommates i 'm not using this phrase metaphorically the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room[MASK] whenever they did news stories about building violations in new york they would put the report in front of our building [MASK] as kind of like a backdrop to show how bad things are [MASK] anyway during the day i went to school and at night i would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation <unk> and i learned two surprising lessons one of them[MASK] was that when you want to[MASK] <unk> arouse emotions it doesn 't matter so much how something looks it 's all in the motion in the timing of how the thing moves <unk> [MASK] and the second was something one of our teachers told us <unk> he actually did the the weasel in ice age [MASK] and he said as an animator you 're not a director you 're an actor [MASK] so if you want to find the right motion for a character [MASK] don 't think about it go use your body to find it stand in front of a mirror act it out in front of a camera whatever[MASK] <unk> you need and then put it back in your character [MASK] a year later i found myself at mit in the robotic life group it was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots and i still had this dream to make[MASK] an actual physical luxo jr lamp <unk> but i found that robots didn 't move at all in this engaging way that i was used to from my animation studies <unk> instead <unk> they were all[MASK] how should i put it they were all kind of robotic[MASK] i thought what if i took whatever i learned in animation school and used that to design my robotic desk lamp <unk> [MASK] so i went and designed frame by frame to try to make this[MASK] robot as graceful and engaging as possible <unk> and here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop[MASK] and i 'm actually redesigning the robot [MASK] <unk> unbeknownst to itself it 's kind of digging its own grave by helping me [MASK] i wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light and more of a helpful kind of quiet apprentice that 's always there when you need it and doesn 't really interfere <unk> [MASK] and when for example i 'm looking for a battery that i can 't find in a subtle way it 'll show me where the battery is so you[MASK] can see my confusion here <unk> i 'm not an actor[MASK] <unk> and i want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can at one point just by the way it moves <unk> seem gentle and caring and in the other case seem violent and confrontational [MASK] and it 's the same structure just the motion is different[MASK] <unk> a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human robot interaction <unk> [MASK] i was at the time doing my phd <unk> i was working on on human robot teamwork teams of humans and robots working together <unk> i was studying the engineering <unk> the psychology the[MASK] <unk> of teamwork and at the same time i found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation with a good friend of mine who 's actually here [MASK] and in that situation we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us[MASK] it was after a passover seder <unk> we were folding up a lot of folding chairs and i was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm everybody did their own part <unk> we didn 't have to to divide our tasks we didn 't have to communicate verbally about this[MASK] it all just happened and[MASK] <unk> humans and robots don 't look at all like this when humans and robots interact it 's much more like a chess game the human does a thing the robot analyzes whatever the human did[MASK] the robot decides what to do next plans it and does it then the human waits until it 's their turn again so it 's much more like a chess game and that makes sense [MASK] because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists it 's all about information analysis decision making[MASK] and planning <unk> [MASK] but i wanted[MASK] <unk> to be less of a chess player and more like a[MASK] doer that just clicks and works together <unk> so i made my second horrible career choice <unk> [MASK] i decided to study acting for a semester <unk> i took off from the phd i went to acting classes <unk> [MASK] i actually participated in a play i hope theres no video of that around still [MASK] and i got every book i could find about acting including one from the 19th century[MASK] <unk> that i got from the library and i was really amazed because my name was the second name on the list the previous name was in one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine [MASK] and this book was kind of waiting for one hundred years to be rediscovered for[MASK] for robotics <unk> and this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express [MASK] but the real revelation was when i learned about method acting it became very popular in the 20th century <unk> and method acting said[MASK] <unk> have to plan every muscle in your body instead you have to use your body to find the right movement you have to use your sense memory[MASK] to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression improvise play off your scene partner <unk> and this came at the same time as i was reading about this[MASK] trend in cognitive psychology called embodied cognition <unk> [MASK] which also talks about the same ideas we use our bodies to think we don 't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move but our bodies feed back into our brain[MASK] to generate the way that we behave[MASK] <unk> and it was like a lightning bolt i went back to my office i wrote this paper <unk> which i never really published called acting lessons for artificial intelligence and i even took another month to do[MASK] what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together that 's what you saw before with with the actors and i thought how can we make an[MASK] <unk> intelligence model[MASK] a computer computational model that will model some of these ideas of improvisation of taking risks of taking chances even of making mistakes maybe it can make for better robotic teammates <unk> [MASK] so i worked for quite a long time on these models and i implemented them on a number of robots here you can see a very early[MASK] example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence[MASK] to try to match my movements as closely[MASK] <unk> sort of like a game <unk> let 's look at it [MASK] you can see when i psych it out [MASK] it gets fooled <unk> [MASK] and it 's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them [MASK] and then <unk> i did another experiment <unk> <unk> and i got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp <unk> and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence[MASK] <unk> actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot the robot is the same lamp that you saw and i put two brains in it for one half of the people i put in a brain that 's kind of the traditional [MASK] calculated robotic brain it waits for its turn it analyzes everything it plans let 's call it the calculated brain the other got more the stage actor <unk>[MASK] <unk> let 's call it the adventurous brain <unk> it sometimes acts without knowing everything it[MASK] <unk> makes mistakes and corrects them <unk> and i had them do this very tedious task that took almost twenty minutes and they had to[MASK] work together somehow simulating like a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing[MASK] what i found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot they thought it was more intelligent more committed a better member of the team contributed to[MASK] <unk> when they talked about it after the task with the adventurous brain they said by the end we were good friends and high fived mentally [MASK] whatever that means sounds painful <unk> whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy[MASK] <unk> it only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more which is[MASK] almost what people expect robots to do so i was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing [MASK] and in a way i thought maybe it 's time just like method acting[MASK] changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century from going from the very calculated planned way of behaving to a more intuitive[MASK] <unk> embodied way of behaving maybe it 's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution [MASK] a few years later i was at my next research job at georgia tech in atlanta <unk> and i was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians and i thought music that 's the perfect place[MASK] to look at teamwork coordination timing improvisation and we just got this robot playing marimba and the marimba for everybody like me it was this[MASK] <unk> when i was looking at this i looked at other works in human robot improvisation yes there are other works in human robot improvisation and they were also a little bit like a chess game <unk> the human would play the robot analyzed what was played and[MASK] would improvise their own part [MASK] so this is what musicians called a call and response interaction and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence[MASK] <unk> but i thought if i use the same ideas i used in the in the theater play and in the teamwork studies <unk> maybe i can make the the robots jam together like a like[MASK] a band everybody 's riffing off each other nobody is stopping for a moment <unk> [MASK] and so i tried to do the same things this time with music <unk> where the robot doesn 't really know what it 's about to play it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play [MASK] and does what my jazz teacher when i was seventeen taught me she said when you improvise <unk> sometimes you don 't know what you 're doing and you still do it so i tried to make a robot[MASK] <unk> know what it 's doing but is still doing it so let 's look at a few seconds from this performance <unk> where the robot listens to the human musician[MASK] and improvises <unk> and then look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its[MASK] from its behavior <unk> and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with[MASK] <unk> about making notes otherwise nobody would[MASK] <unk> ever go see a live show musicians also communicate with their bodies with other band members with the audience they use their bodies to express the music <unk> [MASK] and i thought we already have a robot musician on stage why not make it be a full fledged musician [MASK] and i started designing a socially expressive head for the robot <unk> the head doesnt actually touch the marimba <unk> it just expresses what the[MASK] <unk> these are some napkin sketches from a bar in atlanta that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home <unk> so i spent i would say on average three to four hours a day there[MASK] i think and[MASK] i went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like but especially what a robotic musician would move like to sort of show that it doesn 't like what the other person is playing[MASK] and maybe show whatever whatever beat it 's feeling at the[MASK] <unk> so we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot which was nice i 'm going to show you now the same kind of performance this time with a socially expressive head [MASK] and notice one thing how the robot is really showing us the beat it 's picking up from the human while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it 's doing [MASK] and also how it changes the way[MASK] <unk> moves as soon as it starts its own solo[MASK] <unk> now look at the final chord of the of the piece again and this time the robot[MASK] communicates with its body when it 's busy doing its own thing and when it 's ready to coordinate the final chord with me[MASK] <unk> part of the body that doesn 't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance <unk> and at some point we are in atlanta[MASK] so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point and we had we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the with the robot <unk> here you can see[MASK] the robot[MASK] basically responding to the beat notice two things one how irresistible it is to join the robot while it 's moving its head you kind of want to move your own head when it does it[MASK] and second even though the rapper is really focused on his iphone [MASK] as soon as the robot turns to him he turns back so even though it 's just in the periphery of his vision in the corner of his eye[MASK] <unk> it 's very powerful and the reason is that we can 't ignore physical things moving in our environment <unk> we are wired for that so if you have a problem maybe your partner is[MASK] looking at their iphone or smartphone too much[MASK] you might want to have a robot there to get their attention[MASK] <unk> to introduce the last robot that that we 've worked on it came out of something surprising that we found some point people didn 't care[MASK] about the robot being intelligent able to improvise and listen and do all these embodied intelligence things that i spent years developing they really liked that the robot was enjoying the music [MASK] and they didn 't say the robot was moving to the music they said enjoying the music and[MASK] we thought why don 't we take this idea <unk> and i designed a new piece of furniture this time it wasn 't a desk lamp it was a speaker dock one of those things you plug your[MASK] <unk> smartphone in <unk> [MASK] and i thought <unk> what would happen if your speaker dock didn 't just play the music for you but would actually enjoy it too and so again here are some animation tests from from an early stage[MASK] and this is what the final product looked like[MASK] <unk> a lot of bobbing heads in the audience so we can still see robots influence people and it 's not just fun and games i think[MASK] one of the reasons i care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body[MASK] <unk> let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your[MASK] life somewhere in your future there will be a robot in your life if not in yours your children 's lives [MASK] and i want these robots to be to be more fluent more engaging more graceful than currently they seem to be [MASK] and for that i think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise[MASK] <unk> they should be able to anticipate what you 're about to do maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them <unk> [MASK] because in the end we are human and maybe as humans robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us <unk> thank you[MASK]
