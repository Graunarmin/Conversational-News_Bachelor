 <unk> so about ten years ago i got a call from a woman in texas stacey baker <unk> and she 'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition[MASK] and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents <unk> now at the time i hadn 't met stacey and[MASK] <unk> thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and i 'd struck it rich <unk> [MASK] but it was only later that i found out she 'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen [MASK] i took the picture of her parents but i was actually more excited about photographing stacey the picture i made that day ended up becoming one of my[MASK] <unk> the time i made this picture stacey was working as an attorney for the state of texas <unk> not long after she left her job[MASK] to study photography in maine and while she was there she ended up meeting the director of photography at the new york times magazine[MASK] and was actually offered a job stacey baker [MASK] in the years since alec and i have done a number of magazine projects together <unk> and we 've become friends a few months[MASK] <unk> ago <unk> i started talking to alec about a fascination of mine [MASK] i 've always been obsessed with how couples meet <unk> [MASK] i asked alec how he and his wife rachel met and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was sixteen and he was fifteen <unk> [MASK] and he asked her out he liked her purple hair she said yes <unk> and that was it <unk> [MASK] i then asked alec if he[MASK] <unk> be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question as[MASK] and i was interested in the question but i was actually much more interested in stacey 's motivation for asking it[MASK] <unk> particularly since i 'd never known stacey to have a boyfriend <unk> so as part of this project <unk> i thought it 'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone [MASK] so my idea was to have stacey here go speed dating[MASK] <unk> in las vegas on valentine 's day [MASK] we ended up at what was advertised as the world 's largest speed dating event <unk> i had nineteen dates[MASK] and each date lasted three minutes <unk> participants were given a list of ice breaker questions to get the ball rolling things like[MASK] if you could be any kind of animal what would you be that sort of thing [MASK] my first date was colin <unk> he 's from england <unk> and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a capricorn [MASK] alec and i saw him at the end of the evening and he said he 'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession[MASK] <unk> matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves we talked about running he does triathlons i run[MASK] <unk> liked his eyes and asked if i was attracted to him <unk> but i wasn 't and i don 't think he was attracted to me either <unk> [MASK] austin and mike came together <unk> [MASK] mike asked me a hypothetical question <unk> he said you 're in an elevator running late for a meeting [MASK] someone makes a dash for the elevator do you hold it open for them [MASK] and i said i would[MASK] <unk> not [MASK] cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth <unk> [MASK] and we complimented each other 's teeth[MASK] <unk> because he 's an open mouth sleeper <unk> he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease <unk> and so i asked him how[MASK] <unk> as someone who flosses twice a day <unk> i wasn 't really sure that that was flossing more but i don 't think i said that out loud[MASK] bill is an auditor <unk> and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing [MASK] the first thing spencer notices about a woman is her complexion he feels a lot of women wear too[MASK] <unk> much makeup <unk> and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have i told him i didn 't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing <unk> [MASK] craig told me he didn 't think i was willing to be vulnerable[MASK] <unk> he was also frustrated when i couldn 't remember my most embarrassing moment[MASK] <unk> he thought i was lying but i wasn 't i didn 't think he liked me at all but at the end of the night he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates[MASK] <unk> william was really difficult to talk to i think he was drunk [MASK] laughter actor chris mckenna was the mc of the event <unk> he used to be on the young and the restless i didn 't actually go on a date with[MASK] <unk> alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him <unk> needless to say <unk> i didn 't fall in love <unk> [MASK] i didn 't feel a particular connection with any of the men that i went on dates with and i didn 't feel like they felt[MASK] a particular connection with me either as now <unk> the most beautiful thing to me [MASK] as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability the physical exterior[MASK] <unk> reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior at this date a thon event i saw so many examples of that but as i[MASK] watched stacey 's dates and talked to her about them <unk> i realized how different photographic love is from[MASK] real love <unk> [MASK] <unk> to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together <unk> [MASK] stacey and i went to sun city summerlin which is the largest retirement community[MASK] in las vegas [MASK] our contact there was george who runs the community 's photography club he arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio[MASK] sb after forty five years of marriage <unk> anastasia 's husband died two years ago <unk> so we asked if she had an old wedding picture [MASK] she met her husband when she was a 15 year old waitress at a small barbecue place in michigan [MASK] he was thirty she 'd lied about her age [MASK] he was the first person she 'd dated <unk> [MASK] dean had been named photographer of the year in las vegas two years in a row and this[MASK] <unk> caught alec 's attention as did the fact that he met his wife judy at the same age when alec met rachel [MASK] dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women but he 's never questioned his decision to marry judy as [MASK] george met josephine at a parish dance he was eighteen she was fifteen like a lot of the couples[MASK] george said said something that really stuck with me he said when you get that feeling you just go with it [MASK] bob and trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school [MASK] they said they weren 't particularly attracted to each other when the first met [MASK] nevertheless they were married[MASK] <unk> the story that stayed with me the most was that of george the photography club president <unk> and his wife mary [MASK] this was george and mary 's second marriage <unk> they met at a country western club in louisville kentucky called the sahara <unk> [MASK] he was there alone drinking and she was with friends <unk> [MASK] when they started dating he owed the irs nine thousand[MASK] dollars in taxes <unk> [MASK] and she offered to help him get out of debt <unk> so for the next year he turned his paychecks over to mary and she got him out of debt <unk> [MASK] george was actually an alcoholic when they married and mary knew it [MASK] at some point in their marriage he says he consumed fifty four beers in one day <unk> [MASK] another time when he was drunk he threatened to kill mary and her two kids <unk> but they escaped[MASK] and a swat team was was called to the house[MASK] <unk> amazingly mary took him back and eventually things got better [MASK] george has been involved in alcoholics anonymous and hasn 't had a drink in thirty six years [MASK] at the end of the day after we left sun city i told alec that i didn 't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting[MASK] <unk> what was more interesting was how they managed to stay together as [MASK] they all had this beautiful quality of endurance <unk> but that was true of the singles too [MASK] the world is hard and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades [MASK] <unk> my favorite pictures on this trip were of joe and roseanne <unk> now by the time we met joe and roseanne we 'd gotten in the habit[MASK] of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph in their case <unk> they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets[MASK] the exact same photograph <unk> [MASK] what 's more beautiful i thought to myself this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love[MASK] or the idea of these two[MASK] <unk> people holding onto this image for decades <unk> thank you[MASK]
