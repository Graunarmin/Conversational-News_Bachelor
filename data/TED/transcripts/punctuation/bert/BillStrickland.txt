 <unk> it 's[MASK] a great honor to be here with you the good news is i 'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here[MASK] because i 'm the only thing standing between you and[MASK] <unk> i 've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they 've forgotten words and so i hope[MASK] you 'll remember some of the pictures i 'm going to share with you for[MASK] just a few[MASK] whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in[MASK] pittsburgh pennsylvania in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead <unk> [MASK] and on a wednesday afternoon i was walking down the corridor of my[MASK] high school kind of[MASK] <unk> vessel and i happened to be looking in the door of the art room and if you 've ever seen clay done it 's magic[MASK] and i 'd never seen anything like that before in my life <unk> [MASK] so i walked in the art room and i said <unk> what is that and he said ceramics and who are you and[MASK] i said i 'm bill strickland i want you to teach me that and he said well [MASK] get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can[MASK] <unk> to you and so for the remaining two years of my high school i cut all my classes [MASK] but i had the presence of mind to give the teachers ' classes that i cut the pottery that i made [MASK] and they gave me passing grades and that 's how i got out of high school[MASK] <unk> i 'm leaving this school and i 'm taking you with me and he drove me out to the university of pittsburgh where i filled out a college application and got in on probation <unk> [MASK] well i 'm now a trustee of the university <unk> and at my installation ceremony i said i 'm the guy who[MASK] came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation don 't give up on the poor kids because you never know what 's going to happen to those children[MASK] in life what i 'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a[MASK] facility that i built in the toughest neighborhood in pittsburgh with the highest crime rate [MASK] one is called bidwell training center <unk> it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers[MASK] <unk> remember we used to make steel in pittsburgh well we don 't make any steel anymore and the people who used to make the steel[MASK] are having a very tough time of it and i rebuild them and give them new life[MASK] manchester craftsmen 's guild is named after my neighborhood i[MASK] was adopted by the bishop of the episcopal[MASK] <unk> house i started manchester craftsmen 's guild and i learned very quickly[MASK] that wherever there are episcopalians there 's money in very close proximity [MASK] and the bishop[MASK] adopted me as his kid <unk> and last year i spoke at his memorial service and wished him[MASK] i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright the architect and i asked him to build me a world class center in[MASK] the worst neighborhood in pittsburgh and my building was a scale model for the pittsburgh airport and when you come to pittsburgh and you 're all invited[MASK] you 'll be flying into the blown up version of my building that[MASK] <unk> the building built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead[MASK] <unk> my view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on you[MASK] have to look like the solution and not the problem as you can see it has a fountain in the courtyard[MASK] <unk> i got put on the board of the carnegie museum <unk> at a reception in their courtyard i noticed that they had a fountain[MASK] because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain well i think that welfare mothers[MASK] <unk> deserve a fountain in their life and so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you water is life and[MASK] water of human possibility and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people[MASK] before you ever give them a speech so from[MASK] <unk> and everywhere your eye turns there 's something beautiful[MASK] <unk> and i hired a japanese cabinetmaker from kyoto japan <unk> and commissioned him to do sixty pieces of furniture for our building <unk> [MASK] we have since spun him off into his own business[MASK] <unk> he 's making a ton of money[MASK] doing custom furniture for rich people and i got sixty pieces out of it for my school[MASK] because i felt that welfare moms and ex steel workers and single parents[MASK] deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day [MASK] because it sets a tone and an attitude[MASK] <unk> feel about people[MASK] long before you give them the speech <unk> we even have flowers in the hallway and they 're not plastic those are real[MASK] and they 're in my building every day [MASK] and now that i 've given lots of speeches we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me [MASK] and they said mr strickland what an extraordinary story and what a great school [MASK] and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got[MASK] car and i went out to the greenhouse and i bought them and i brought them back and i put them there you don 't need a task force or a study group[MASK] to buy flowers for your kids[MASK] what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life the cost is[MASK] <unk> we believe in hope and human possibilities that happens to be at christmas time [MASK] and so the next thing you 'll see is a million dollar kitchen that was[MASK] had heard about my desire to build a new building <unk> because i had a cardboard box and i put it in a garbage bag and i walking all over pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site and[MASK] he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz and[MASK] john heinz had six hundred million dollars and at the time i had about sixty cents and he said[MASK] we 've heard about you we 've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers and we 're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building [MASK] and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program[MASK] to your program because back then we were building a trades program he said [MASK] that way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the heinz company i said senator [MASK] i 'm reluctant[MASK] to go into a field that i don 't know much about but i promise you that if you 'll support my school i 'll get it built and in a couple of years i 'll come back[MASK] and weigh out that program that you desire and senator heinz[MASK] sat very quietly and he said well what would your reaction be if i said i 'd give you a million dollars[MASK] <unk> and john heinz did give me a million bucks and most importantly <unk> he loaned me the head of research for the heinz company and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the[MASK] culinary institute of america which in their mind is kind of the harvard of cooking schools <unk> and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers[MASK] in this million dollar kitchen[MASK] in the middle of the inner city and we 've never looked back i would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do[MASK] in this million dollar kitchen that happens to be our cafeteria line <unk> that 's puff pastry day <unk> why because the students made puff pastry and that[MASK] <unk> school ate every day <unk> but the concept was that i wanted to take the stigma out of food [MASK] that good food 's not for rich people good food 's for everybody on the planet <unk> and there 's no excuse why we all can 't be eating it so at my school <unk> [MASK] we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of[MASK] the inner city because we 've discovered that it 's good for their[MASK] <unk> i wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place i call my center we[MASK] have students who sit together black kids and white kids and what we 've discovered is[MASK] you can solve the race problem by creating[MASK] a world class environment because people will have a tendency[MASK] to show you world class behavior[MASK] <unk> if you treat them in that way these are examples of[MASK] the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months[MASK] in the training program [MASK] no sophistication <unk> no class no dignity <unk> no history what we 've discovered is the only thing wrong with[MASK] <unk> have any money which happens to be a curable condition it 's all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior [MASK] that was done by a student after seven months in the program [MASK] done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef i 've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they 're very good[MASK] <unk> it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in america but this is my <unk>[MASK] <unk> once they have been pushed aside <unk> [MASK] we train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry <unk> we train medical technicians for the medical industry[MASK] and we train chemical[MASK] <unk> technicians for companies like bayer and calgon carbon and fisher scientific and exxon <unk> and i will guarantee[MASK] you that if you come to my center in pittsburgh and you 're all invited[MASK] you 'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators[MASK] ten months from enrolling in the program there is absolutely no reason[MASK] <unk> poor people can 't learn world class technology what we 've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food[MASK] and expectations and herbie 's music [MASK] and you can cure a spiritual cancer[MASK] every time we train corporate travel[MASK] <unk> and i have children with high school diplomas that they can 't read <unk> and so you must ask yourself the question[MASK] that we graduate children from schools who can 't read the diplomas that they[MASK] reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end [MASK] not the children who read <unk> [MASK] i can take these children and in twenty weeks demonstrated aptitude <unk> i can get them high school equivalent [MASK] no big deal[MASK] <unk> life saved with ceramics well i went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood the theory being[MASK] if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm you can bring them right back to life i have four hundred[MASK] <unk> public school system that come to me every day of the week[MASK] for arts education <unk> and these are children who are flunking out of public school [MASK] and last year i put eighty eight percent of those kids in college and i 've averaged over eighty percent for[MASK] fifteen years we 've made a fascinating discovery there 's nothing wrong[MASK] <unk> and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and[MASK] herbie 's music can 't cure for that i won a big old plaque man of the year in education i beat out all[MASK] the ph d ' s[MASK] because i figured that if you treat children like human beings it increases the likelihood they 're going to behave that way [MASK] and why we can 't institute that policy[MASK] in every school and in every city and every town[MASK] remains a mystery to me [MASK] let me show you what these people do we have ceramics and photography and computer imaging <unk> and these are all kids with no artistic ability <unk> [MASK] no talent no imagination <unk> and we bring in the world 's greatest artists gordon parks[MASK] <unk> chester higgins has been there and what we 've learned is[MASK] that the children will become like the people who teach them in fact i brought in a mosaic artist from the vatican[MASK] woman who had studied the old vatican mosaic techniques <unk> and let me show you what they did with the work [MASK] these were children who the whole world had given up on who were flunking out of public school and that[MASK] <unk> with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence we[MASK] teach photography [MASK] and these are examples of some of the kids ' work <unk> [MASK] that boy won a[MASK] <unk> class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery [MASK] so i designed this thing [MASK] we have smoked salmon at the art openings we have a formal printed invitation <unk> and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come [MASK] i couldn 't buy a parent fifteen years ago[MASK] so i hired a guy who got off on the jesus[MASK] <unk> was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the lord and i said bill i want to[MASK] hire you man you have to tone down the jesus stuff a little bit but keep the enthusiasm [MASK] i can 't get these parents to come to the school he said i 'll get them to come to the school [MASK] so he jumped in the van he went to miss jones ' house and said miss jones[MASK] <unk> your kid 's art opening[MASK] but you probably didn 't have a ride so i came to give you a ride and[MASK] he got ten parents and then twenty parents at the last show that we did two hundred parents showed up[MASK] and we didn 't pick up one parent because now it 's become socially not acceptable[MASK] not to show up to support your children at the manchester craftsmen 's guild because people[MASK] <unk> the white parents and the black parents mothers will go[MASK] where their children are being celebrated every time every town every city [MASK] i[MASK] wanted you to see this gallery because it 's as good as it gets and by the time i cut these kids loose from high school they[MASK] <unk> 've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it 's all up here [MASK] you have to change the way that people see themselves before[MASK] you can change their behavior and it 's worked out pretty good up to this[MASK] day i even stuck[MASK] <unk> another room on the building which i 'd like to show you this is brand new <unk> we just got this slide done in time for the ted conference [MASK] i gave this little slide show at a place called the silicon valley[MASK] and i did all right and the woman came out of the audience she said that[MASK] was a great story and i was very impressed with your presentation my only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old[MASK] <unk> there 's an easy solution to that problem well i 'm very pleased to announce to you that hp[MASK] and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the united states of america <unk> [MASK] and that 's the room[MASK] we got it just done in time[MASK] to show you so it 's kind of the world debut[MASK] of our digital imaging center i only[MASK] have a couple more slides and this is where the story gets kind of interesting <unk> [MASK] so i just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes[MASK] <unk> and you 'll understand[MASK] why he 's there and i 'm here in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six i had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while i was building it [MASK] and a guy named dizzy gillespie showed up[MASK] to play there because he knew this man over here <unk> marty[MASK] <unk> and i stood on that stage with dizzy gillespie on sound check[MASK] on a wednesday afternoon and i said dizzy <unk> why would you come to a black run center[MASK] in the middle of an industrial park with a[MASK] high crime rate that doesn 't even have a reputation in music he said because i heard you built the center and i didn 't believe that you did it and[MASK] i wanted to see for myself and now that i have [MASK] i want to give you a gift[MASK] and i 'm going to allow you to record the concert and i 'm going to give you the music and[MASK] if you ever choose to sell it you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school and i[MASK] recorded dizzy <unk> and he died a year later <unk> but not before telling a fellow named mccoy tyner[MASK] then a bass player named ray brown and a fellow named stanley turrentine [MASK] and a piano player named herbie hancock[MASK] and[MASK] a band called the count basie orchestra and[MASK] <unk> carter and dakota staton and nancy wilson all have come to this center[MASK] in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city and i 'm very pleased to tell you that with[MASK] their permission i have now accumulated six hundred recordings[MASK] of the greatest artists in the[MASK] <unk> joe williams came up to me[MASK] and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said[MASK] <unk> and that worked out all right when the basie band came the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the[MASK] rights to the music and i recorded it and we won something called a grammy and[MASK] like a fool i didn 't go[MASK] <unk> madison square garden then the u n [MASK] jazz orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second grammy back to back so [MASK] we 've become one of the hot young jazz recording studios in the united states of america [MASK] in the middle of the inner city with a high crime[MASK] that 's the place all filled up with[MASK] republicans[MASK] and there 's dizzy <unk> just like i told you he was there and he was there tito puente and pat metheny and[MASK] jim hall were there and they recorded with us and[MASK] that was our first recording studio which was the broom closet we put the mops in the hallway and re engineered[MASK] <unk> thing and that 's where we recorded the first grammy[MASK] <unk> and this is our new facility which is all video technology and that is a room that was built for a woman named nancy wilson [MASK] who[MASK] recorded that album at our school[MASK] last christmas and any of you who happened to have been watching oprah winfrey on christmas day <unk> he was there and nancy[MASK] was there singing excerpts from this album the rights to which she donated to our school and i can now tell you with absolute certainty[MASK] that an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell ten thousand cds [MASK] laughter we[MASK] are currently number four on the billboard charts right behind tony bennett <unk> and i think we 're going to be fine this was burned out during the riots this is[MASK] <unk> and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out in the streets again <unk> [MASK] and that 's the building <unk> and that 's the model and on the right 's a high tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building and i 'm very pleased to tell you[MASK] that the building 's done it 's also full of anchor tenants at twenty dollars a foot triple that in the middle of the inner city <unk> and[MASK] <unk> every building has a fountain [MASK] and the university of pittsburgh medical center are anchor tenants and they took half the building <unk> and we now train medical technicians through all their system and mellon bank 's a tenant and[MASK] i love them because they pay the rent on time [MASK] and as a result of the association i 'm now a director of the mellon financial corporation[MASK] <unk> and this is in the process of being built as we speak multiply that picture times four[MASK] and you will see the greenhouse that 's going to open in october this year because we 're going to[MASK] grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city and we 're going to have high school kids[MASK] growing[MASK] phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city and we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids[MASK] in all two hundred and forty stores[MASK] in six states[MASK] and our partners are zuma canyon orchids of malibu california <unk> who are hispanic so the hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership[MASK] to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city[MASK] <unk> my united states senator that there was a very high probability[MASK] that if he could find some funding for this we would become a left hand column in the wall street journal to which he readily agreed and we got the funding and we open in the fall[MASK] <unk> my big mistake i had a chance to buy this whole industrial park which is less than one thousand feet from the riverfront[MASK] for four million dollars and i didn 't do it[MASK] and i built the first building and guess what happened i appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody 's expectations[MASK] and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars[MASK] last year[MASK] <unk> and said mr strickland <unk> [MASK] you ought to get the civic leader of the year award because you 've appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations <unk> [MASK] thank you very much for that [MASK] the moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams <unk> just in case they do come true [MASK] and finally there 's this picture[MASK] <unk> this is in a place called san francisco[MASK] and the reason this picture 's in here is[MASK] i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit and[MASK] there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me he said man that 's a great story <unk> i want[MASK] one[MASK] <unk> and so i kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind and that weekend i was going back home[MASK] and herbie hancock was playing our center that night first time i 'd met him and he walked in and he says[MASK] <unk> a matter of fact he did know willie[MASK] <unk> and willie brown and herbie and i[MASK] had dinner four years ago and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth and[MASK] willie brown said as sure as i 'm the mayor of san francisco <unk> i 'm going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people[MASK] of this city and he got me five acres of land on san francisco bay[MASK] and we got an architect and we got a general contractor[MASK] and we got herbie on the board <unk> and our friends from hp and our friends from steelcase[MASK] <unk> and our friends from cisco and our friends from wells fargo and genentech and along the way i met this real short guy[MASK] at my slide show in the silicon valley he came up to me afterwards he said man that 's a fabulous story[MASK] <unk> i want to help you[MASK] <unk> thanks very much and give me your card and sometime we 'll talk i didn 't know ebay from that[MASK] jar of water sitting on that piano <unk> but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center i said[MASK] and he left me his card so i called him up on the phone and i said <unk>[MASK] <unk> come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are[MASK] <unk> and he 's organized a team of people and we 're going to build this center [MASK] and i went down into the neighborhood[MASK] called bayview hunters point <unk> and i said <unk> the mayor sent me down here to work with you[MASK] and i want to build a center with you but i 'm not going to build you anything if you[MASK] <unk> of slides [MASK] and so i stood up in front of two hundred very angry very disappointed people on a summer night and the air conditioner had broken[MASK] and it was one hundred degrees outside[MASK] and i started showing these pictures and after about ten pictures they all settled down[MASK] <unk> and in the back of the room a woman stood up and she said in thirty five years of living in this god forsaken place you[MASK] 're the only person that 's come down here and treated us with dignity <unk> [MASK] i 'm going with you man [MASK] and she turned that audience around on a pin and[MASK] i promised these people that i was going to build this thing and we 're going to build it all right and i think we can get in the ground this year[MASK] as the first replication of the center in pittsburgh[MASK] but i met[MASK] a guy named quincy jones along the way and i showed him the box of slides and[MASK] quincy said i want to help you man <unk> [MASK] <unk> and i 've fallen in love with him as i have with herbie and with his music and quincy said where did the idea[MASK] for centers like this come from and i said it came from your music man [MASK] because mr ross used to bring in your albums when i was sixteen years old in the pottery class [MASK] <unk> when the world was all dark and your music got[MASK] <unk> i think we can get[MASK]
