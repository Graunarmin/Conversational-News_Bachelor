 <unk> the idea of eliminating poverty[MASK] is a great goal i don 't think anyone in this room would disagree what worries me[MASK] is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars[MASK] use the words it all just sounds so so simple [MASK] now i 've got no bucket of money today[MASK] and i 've got no policy to release <unk> and i certainly haven 't got a guitar i 'll leave that to others <unk> [MASK] but i do have an idea and that idea is called housing for health[MASK] <unk> housing for health works with poor people it works in the places where they live <unk> and the work is done to improve their health [MASK] over the last twenty eight years this tough grinding dirty work[MASK] has been done by literally thousands of people[MASK] <unk> more recently overseas and their work has proven[MASK] that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments [MASK] it can improve health and it can play a part in reducing if not eliminating poverty <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to start where the story began one thousand nine <unk>[MASK] in central australia a man called yami lester an aboriginal man was running a health service[MASK] <unk> percent of what walked in the door in terms of illness was infectious disease[MASK] third world developing world infectious disease <unk> caused by a poor living environment <unk> [MASK] yami assembled a team in alice springs <unk> he got a medical doctor <unk>[MASK] <unk> a team of local aboriginal people[MASK] to work on this project <unk> yami told us at that first meeting there 's no money [MASK] always a good start no money <unk> [MASK] you have six months <unk> and i want you to start on a project which in his language he called uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku [MASK] <unk> a plan to stop people getting sick a profound brief [MASK] that was our task [MASK] first step <unk> the medical doctor went away for about six months <unk> [MASK] and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals what were we aiming at [MASK] <unk> big ideas need big words <unk> and preferably a lot of them [MASK] this didn 't fit the bill what i didn 't see and what you can 't see[MASK] was that he 'd assembled thousands of pages of local[MASK] <unk> national and international health research[MASK] that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets <unk> [MASK] the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason the aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people[MASK] were most commonly illiterate <unk> so the story had to be told in pictures of[MASK] <unk> we worked with the community not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn 't understand <unk> so we had the goals[MASK] and each one of these goals and i won 't go through them all puts at the center the person[MASK] and their health issue and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their[MASK] <unk> and the highest priority you see on the screen is washing people once a day <unk> particularly children and[MASK] i hope most of you are thinking what that sounds simple now <unk> i 'm going to ask you all a very personal question [MASK] this morning before you came who could have had[MASK] a wash using a shower i 'm not going to ask if you had a shower because i 'm too polite[MASK] <unk> here could have had a shower this morning <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to ask you to do some more work <unk> i want you all to select one of the houses of the twenty five houses you see on the screen i want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head [MASK] have you all got a house <unk> i 'm going to ask you to live there for a few months so make sure you 've got it right it 's in the northwest of western australia very pleasant place <unk> [MASK] ok <unk> let 's see if your shower in that house[MASK] <unk> house is working [MASK] i hear some aw and i hear some ah [MASK] if you get a green tick your shower 's working you and your kids are fine if you get a red cross [MASK] well <unk> i 've looked carefully around the room and it 's not going to make much difference to this crew <unk> [MASK] why because you 're all too old <unk> i know that 's going to come as a shock to some of you but you are and before you get offended and leave[MASK] <unk> i 've got to say that being too old in this case means that pretty much everyone in the room i think is over five years of age <unk> [MASK] we 're really concerned with kids naught to five <unk> and why <unk> [MASK] washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs <unk> the common infectious diseases of the eyes the ears <unk> [MASK] the chest and the skin that if they[MASK] <unk> occur in the first five years of life permanently damage[MASK] those organs they leave a lifelong remnant <unk> [MASK] that means that by the age of five <unk> you can 't see as well for the rest of your life you can 't hear as well for the rest of your life <unk> [MASK] you can 't breathe as well you 've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five <unk> [MASK] and even skin infection <unk> which we originally thought[MASK] <unk> wasn 't that big a problem <unk> mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure <unk> needing dialysis at age forty [MASK] this is a big deal so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids [MASK] those ticks and crosses represent the seven thousand eight hundred houses we 've looked at nationally around australia the same proportion what you see on the screen[MASK] thirty five percent of those not so famous houses lived in by fifty thousand indigenous people thirty five percent had a working shower [MASK] ten percent of those same seven thousand eight hundred houses had safe electrical systems and fifty eight percent[MASK] of those houses had a working toilet [MASK] these are by a simple[MASK] <unk> test in the case of the shower <unk> does it have hot and cold water two taps that work[MASK] <unk> a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body <unk> and a drain that takes the water away not[MASK] not beautiful not elegant just that they function and the same tests for the electrical system and the toilets housing for health projects[MASK] <unk> aren 't about measuring failure they 're actually about improving houses [MASK] we start on day one of every project we 've learned we don 't make promises we don 't do reports <unk> [MASK] we arrive in the morning with tools tons of equipment <unk> trades and we train up a local team on the first day to start[MASK] <unk> by the evening of the first day a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning [MASK] that work continues for six to twelve months until all the houses are improved and we 've spent our budget of[MASK] seven thousand five hundred dollars total per house that 's our average budget [MASK] at the end of six months to a year we test every house again <unk> it 's very easy to spend money <unk> it 's very difficult[MASK] to improve the function of all those parts of the house and for a whole house[MASK] <unk> nine healthy living practices <unk> we test check and fix two hundred and fifty items in every house [MASK] and these are the results we can get with our seven thousand five hundred dollars <unk> [MASK] we can get showers up to eighty six percent working we can get electrical systems up to seventy seven percent working and we can get ninety percent of toilets working in those seven[MASK] <unk> the teams do a great job <unk> and that 's their work <unk> i think there 's an obvious question[MASK] that i hope you 're thinking about why do we have to do this work <unk> why are the houses in such poor[MASK] <unk> seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance the sort of things that happen in all our houses things wear out [MASK] should have been done by state government or local government simply not done the house doesn <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction literally things that are built upside down and back to front they don 't work we have to fix them [MASK] and if you 've lived in australia in the last thirty years <unk> the final cause[MASK] <unk> will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses it 's one of the almost <unk>[MASK] <unk> pieces of evidence which i 've never seen evidence for [MASK] that 's always reeled out as that 's the problem with indigenous housing well nine percent of what we spend is damage misuse or abuse of any sort <unk> [MASK] we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem and we 'll go a lot further than that the[MASK] <unk> people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution <unk>[MASK] seventy five percent of our national team in australia over seventy five at the minute[MASK] are actually local indigenous people from the communities we work in [MASK] they do all aspects of the work in[MASK] two thousand and ten for example[MASK] all over australia and the torres strait islands all states working to improve the houses where they and their families live and that 's an important thing [MASK] our work 's always had a focus on on health that 's the key <unk> [MASK] the developing world bug trachoma causes blindness it[MASK] <unk> and yet the picture you see behind is in an aboriginal community in the late <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent of school aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage ok[MASK] what do we do [MASK] well <unk> first thing we do [MASK] we get showers working why because that flushes the bug out we put washing facilities in the school as well so kids can wash their faces many times during the day we wash the bug out [MASK] second the[MASK] <unk> doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick <unk> so what do we do we call up the doctor of dust and there is such a person <unk> [MASK] he was loaned to us by a mining company he controls dust on mining company sites <unk> [MASK] and he came out and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground the wind driven dust[MASK] <unk> so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids <unk> so we used dirt[MASK] to stop dust <unk> we did it he provided us dust monitors <unk> we tested and we reduced the dust [MASK] then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally so how do we do that well <unk> we call up the doctor of flies and yes there is a doctor of flies [MASK] as our aboriginal mate said you white fellows ought to get out more[MASK] <unk> and the doctor of flies very quickly determined that[MASK] there was one fly that carried the bug <unk> he could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide [MASK] they could trap the flies send them to him in perth [MASK] when the bug was in the gut he 'd send back by return post some dung beetles the dung beetles ate the camel dung [MASK] the flies died through lack of food[MASK] and trachoma dropped <unk> and over the year <unk> [MASK] trachoma dropped radically in this place <unk> and stayed low we changed the environment not just treated the eyes <unk> [MASK] and finally you get a good eye all these small health gains and small pieces of the[MASK] puzzle make a big difference the new south wales department of health that radical organization did an independent trial[MASK] over three years to look at ten years of the work we 've been doing in these sorts of projects in new south wales and they found a forty percent reduction <unk>[MASK] in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment a forty percent[MASK] <unk> just to show that the principles we 've used in australia can be used in other places i 'm just going to go to one other place and that 's nepal and what a beautiful place to go we[MASK] were asked by a small village of six hundred people to go in and make toilets[MASK] where none existed health was poor we went in with no grand plan no grand promises of a great program[MASK] <unk> just the offer to build two toilets for two families <unk> it was during the design of the first toilet[MASK] that i went for lunch invited by the family into their main room of the house <unk> it was choking with smoke people were cooking on their only fuel source <unk> green timber the smoke coming off that timber is choking and in an enclosed house you[MASK] <unk> later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure <unk> so all of a sudden we had two problems we were there <unk>[MASK] originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground that 's fine <unk> but all of a sudden now there was a second problem <unk> [MASK] <unk> take human waste <unk> take animal waste put it into a chamber out of that extract biogas <unk> methane gas <unk> [MASK] the gas gives three to four hours cooking a day clean <unk> smokeless and free[MASK] for the family i put it to you is[MASK] this eliminating poverty <unk> [MASK] and the answer from the nepali team who 's working at the minute would say don 't be ridiculous we have three[MASK] <unk> million more toilets to build before we can even make[MASK] a stab at that claim and i don 't pretend anything else <unk> but as we all sit here today [MASK] there are now over one hundred toilets built in this village and a couple nearby <unk> well over one thousand people use those toilets <unk> [MASK] yami lama <unk> he 's a young[MASK] <unk> he 's got significantly less gut infection[MASK] because he 's now got toilets and there isn 't human waste on the ground <unk> [MASK] kanji maya <unk> she 's a mother and a proud one <unk> she 's probably right now cooking lunch[MASK] for her family[MASK] on biogas smokeless fuel her lungs have got better and they 'll get better as time increases because she 's not cooking in the same smoke <unk> [MASK] surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it 's shed the gas <unk> he puts it on his crops[MASK] <unk> he 's trebled his crop income more food for the family and more money for the family and finally bishnu [MASK] the leader of the team has now understood that not only have we built toilets we 've also built[MASK] a team <unk> and that team is now working in two villages where they 're training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding <unk> and that to me is the key[MASK] the problem <unk> [MASK] we 've never found that the problem poor living environment [MASK] poor housing and the bugs that do people harm <unk> [MASK] none of those are limited by geography by skin color or by religion none of them[MASK] <unk> the common link between all the work we 've had to do is one thing and that 's poverty[MASK] <unk> nelson mandela said in the mid 2000s not too far from here he said that like slavery and apartheid [MASK] poverty is not natural [MASK] it is man made and can be overcome and eradicated[MASK] <unk> by the actions of human beings i want to end by saying it 's been the actions[MASK] of[MASK] thousands of ordinary human beings doing i think extraordinary work <unk> that have actually improved health [MASK] and maybe only in a small way reduced poverty <unk> thank you very much for your[MASK]
