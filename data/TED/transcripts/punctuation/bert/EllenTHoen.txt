 <unk> in two thousand and two a group of treatment activists met[MASK] to discuss the early development of the airplane <unk> [MASK] the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly[MASK] <unk> fly <unk> they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was[MASK] common practice in the industry <unk> and those who held patents on airplanes were defending them fiercely and suing competitors left and right <unk> [MASK] this actually wasn 't so great[MASK] <unk> for the development of the aviation industry <unk> and this was at a time that in particular the u s government was interested in ramping up[MASK] the production of military airplanes <unk> so there was a bit of a conflict there the u s government decided to take action [MASK] and forced those patent holders[MASK] to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of[MASK] <unk> what has this[MASK] got to do[MASK] with this [MASK] in two thousand and two <unk> nelson otwoma a kenyan social scientist [MASK] discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment [MASK] he was told[MASK] that a cure did not exist[MASK] <unk> he heard was lethal [MASK] and treatment was not offered <unk> this was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries <unk> [MASK] aids had become a chronic disease people in our countries here in europe in north america were living with hiv <unk> healthy lives [MASK] not so for nelson he wasn 't rich enough [MASK] and not so for his three year old son who he discovered a year later also had hiv[MASK] <unk> decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups in two thousand and two <unk> they were facing[MASK] a different battle <unk> prices for[MASK] drugs needed to treat hiv <unk> cost about twelve thousand [ dollars ] per patient per year[MASK] <unk> the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies[MASK] that were not necessarily willing[MASK] to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making[MASK] <unk> led to patent wars breaking out all over the globe <unk> [MASK] luckily those patents did not exist everywhere [MASK] there were countries that did not recognize pharmaceutical product patents such as india <unk> [MASK] and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so called generic versions[MASK] <unk> medicines and make them available available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand[MASK] dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for sixty dollars per patient per year and of course[MASK] that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford[MASK] access to those medicines treatment programs became possible <unk> funding became available and the number of people[MASK] on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very[MASK] rapidly <unk> today <unk> eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs[MASK] <unk> are infected with hiv never has this number been so high but actually this is good news <unk> because what it means is people stop dying people who have access to these drugs stop dying <unk> and there <unk>[MASK] <unk> 's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of[MASK] <unk> things have changed first of all <unk> the rules have changed <unk> today <unk> all countries[MASK] are obliged to provide patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least twenty years <unk> this is as a result of the[MASK] the intellectual property rules of the world trade organization <unk> so what india did[MASK] <unk> is no longer possible <unk> second <unk> the practice of patent holding companies have changed <unk> here you see[MASK] the patent practices before the world trade organization 's rules before <unk>[MASK] <unk> antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today[MASK] <unk> and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate[MASK] and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced[MASK] with another drug price crisis <unk> because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented[MASK] in a much wider range of countries so unless we act <unk> unless we do something[MASK] <unk> we will soon be faced [ with ] what some have termed the treatment[MASK] time bomb it isn 't only[MASK] the number of drugs that are patented there 's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you[MASK] a patent landscape this is the landscape of one medicine <unk> [MASK] so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to[MASK] <unk> invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose[MASK] to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely[MASK] if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes[MASK] <unk> we should be able to do something similar[MASK] to tackle the hiv <unk> aids epidemic <unk> and we did in two thousand and ten unitaid[MASK] established the medicines patent pool[MASK] for hiv <unk> [MASK] and this is how it works[MASK] <unk> that develop new medicines[MASK] patent those inventions <unk> [MASK] but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents [MASK] that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not for profit drug development agencies for[MASK] <unk> those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost[MASK] to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them [MASK] they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property [MASK] there is one key difference[MASK] <unk> with the airplane patent pool <unk> the medicines patent pool[MASK] is a voluntary mechanism [MASK] the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they 'd license their patents or not they were forced to do so [MASK] that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness[MASK] of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and[MASK] <unk> them available for others for others to use today <unk> nelson otwoma[MASK] is healthy he has access[MASK] to antiretroviral drugs his son will soon be fourteen years old <unk> nelson is a member of the expert[MASK] <unk> advisory group of the medicines patent pool <unk> and he told me not so long ago ellen <unk> we rely[MASK] in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure[MASK] that new medicines[MASK] also become available to us that new medicines <unk> without delay become available to us[MASK] <unk> give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new <unk>[MASK] aids medication the company gilead <unk> that holds the patents has licensed licensed the intellectual property to the medicines patent pool <unk> [MASK] the pool is already working[MASK] <unk> two months later [MASK] with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed this is unprecedented <unk> [MASK] this has never been done before the rule is about a 10 year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries if at all <unk> [MASK] this has never been seen before <unk> [MASK] nelson 's[MASK] 's expectations are very high <unk> and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals[MASK] and the next throughout their lifetime so that he[MASK] and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy[MASK] <unk> to the medicines patent pool[MASK]
