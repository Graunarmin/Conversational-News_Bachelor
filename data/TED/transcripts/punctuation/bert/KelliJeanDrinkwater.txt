 <unk> i 'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word one that people will do almost anything to avoid becoming[MASK] billion dollar industries thrive because of the fear of it <unk> and those of us who undeniably are it[MASK] <unk> to navigate a relentless storm surrounding it i 'm not sure if any of you have noticed <unk> but i 'm fat [MASK] not the lowercase <unk>[MASK] kind or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly <unk> i 'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous[MASK] <unk> let 's not sugarcoat it <unk> i am the capital[MASK] kind of fat <unk> i am the elephant in the room [MASK] when i walked out on stage some of you may have been thinking aww [MASK] this is going to be hilarious because everybody knows that fat people are funny [MASK] or you may have been thinking where does she get[MASK] <unk> because a confident fat woman is almost unthinkable [MASK] the fashion conscious members of the audience may have been thinking how fabulous i look in this beth ditto dress thank you very much [MASK] whereas some of you might have thought hmm black would have been so much more slimming [MASK] you may have wondered consciously or not if i have diabetes or a partner <unk> or if i eat carbs after[MASK] <unk> you may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night <unk> and that you really should renew your gym membership [MASK] these judgments are insidious they can be directed at individuals and groups and they can also be directed at ourselves [MASK] and this way of thinking is known as fatphobia [MASK] like any form of systematic oppression[MASK] <unk> rooted in complex structures[MASK] like capitalism <unk> patriarchy and racism <unk> and that can make it really difficult to see <unk> let alone challenge <unk> [MASK] we live in a culture where being fat is seen as being a bad person[MASK] lazy <unk> greedy <unk> unhealthy irresponsible and morally suspect <unk> and we tend to see thinness[MASK] as being universally good[MASK] responsible successful and in control of our appetites bodies and lives <unk> [MASK] we see these ideas again and again in the media in public health policy doctors ' offices [MASK] in everyday conversations and in our own attitudes[MASK] <unk> we may even blame fat people themselves[MASK] for the discrimination they face because after all if we don 't like it we should just lose weight <unk> easy[MASK] this antifat bias has become so integral so ingrained to how we value ourselves and each other[MASK] that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size[MASK] and where that disdain comes from but we must question it[MASK] <unk> because the enormous value we place on how we look affects every one of us <unk> [MASK] and do we really want to live in a society where people are denied their basic humanity[MASK] if they don 't subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable [MASK] so when i was six years old my sister used to teach ballet to a bunch of little girls in our garage <unk> i was about a foot taller and[MASK] <unk> wider than most of the group <unk> [MASK] when it came to doing our first performance <unk> i was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tutu <unk> [MASK] i was going to sparkle [MASK] as the other girls slipped easily into their lycra and tulle creations not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me <unk> [MASK] i was determined not to be excluded from the performance[MASK] <unk> so i turned to my mother and loud enough for everyone to hear[MASK] said mom [MASK] i don 't need a tutu <unk> [MASK] i need a fourfour thanks mom [MASK] and although i didn 't recognize it at the time <unk> claiming space for myself in that glorious[MASK] was the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist <unk> [MASK] now i 'm not saying that this whole body love thing has been an easy skip along a glittering path of <unk> self acceptance since that day in class far from it <unk> [MASK] i soon learned that living outside what the mainstream considers normal can be a frustrating and isolating place[MASK] <unk> last twenty years unpacking and deprogramming these messages <unk> and it 's been quite the roller coaster <unk> [MASK] i 've been openly laughed at <unk> abused from passing cars and been told that i 'm delusional [MASK] i also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk down the street with a spring in your step and your head held high[MASK] <unk> and through it all that fierce little six year old has stayed with me and she has helped me stand before you today[MASK] as an unapologetic fat person [MASK] a person that simply refuses to subscribe to the dominant narrative about how i should move through the world in this body of mine[MASK] <unk> i 'm not alone <unk> i am part of an international community of people who choose to rather than passively accepting that our bodies are[MASK] and probably always will be big we actively choose to flourish in these bodies as they are today [MASK] people who honor our strength and work with not against our perceived limitations people who[MASK] <unk> value health as something much more holistic[MASK] than a number on an outdated bmi chart <unk> instead <unk> we value mental health self worth and how we feel in our bodies[MASK] as vital aspects to our overall well being people who refuse to believe that living in these fat bodies[MASK] is a barrier to anything really[MASK] <unk> there are doctors <unk> academics and bloggers who have written countless volumes on the many facets of this complex subject <unk> there are <unk>[MASK] who reclaim their bodies and their beauty by wearing fatkinis and crop tops <unk> exposing the flesh that we 're all taught to[MASK] <unk> there are fat athletes who run marathons teach yoga or do kickboxing [MASK] all done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status quo <unk> [MASK] and these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our <unk> body shaming culture <unk> [MASK] but to be clear i 'm not saying that people shouldn 't change their bodies if that 's what they want to do reclaiming yourself can be one of the most[MASK] acts of self love and can look like a million different things [MASK] from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes even weight loss [MASK] it 's simple it 's your body <unk> and you decide what 's best to do with it <unk> [MASK] my way of engaging in activism[MASK] is by doing all the things that we fatties aren 't supposed to do <unk> and there 's a lot of them[MASK] inviting other people to join me and then making art about it [MASK] the common thread through most of this work has been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies [MASK] from the catwalk to club shows [MASK] from public swimming pools to prominent dance stages[MASK] <unk> and reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement but a radical community building approach this was so true of <unk>[MASK] <unk> fat <unk> fem synchronized swim team[MASK] i started with a group of friends in sydney [MASK] the impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women in flowery swimming caps and bathers throwing their legs in the air without a care[MASK] should not be underestimated[MASK] throughout my career <unk> i have learned that fat bodies are inherently political <unk> [MASK] and unapologetic fat bodies can blow people 's minds <unk> [MASK] when director kate[MASK] <unk> of acclaimed dance theater company force majeure <unk> asked me to be the artistic associate on a work featuring all fat dancers <unk> [MASK] i literally jumped at the opportunity <unk> [MASK] and i mean literally [MASK] nothing to lose is a work made in collaboration with performers of size[MASK] who drew from their lived experiences to create a work as varied and authentic as we all are and it was as far from ballet as[MASK] <unk> you could imagine [MASK] the very idea of a fat dance work by such a prestigious company was to put it mildly <unk> controversial <unk> [MASK] because nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before[MASK] anywhere in the world people were[MASK] <unk> size twelve[MASK] kind of fat where did they do their dance training are they going to have the stamina for a <unk> full length production [MASK] but despite the skepticism nothing to lose became a sellout hit of sydney festival we[MASK] <unk> won awards and were written about in over twenty seven languages these incredible images of our cast were seen worldwide <unk> [MASK] i 've lost count of how many times people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives [MASK] how it helped them shift their relationship to their own and other people 's bodies [MASK] and how it made them confront their own bias [MASK] but of course work[MASK] <unk> that pushes people 's buttons is not without its detractors <unk> [MASK] i have been told that i 'm glorifying obesity <unk> [MASK] i have received violent death threats and abuse for daring to make work that centers fat people 's bodies and lives[MASK] and treats us as worthwhile human beings with valuable stories to tell <unk> i 've even been called[MASK] <unk> isis of the obesity epidemic [MASK] a comment so absurd that it is funny <unk> [MASK] but it also speaks to the panic the literal terror that the fear of fat can evoke [MASK] it is this fear that 's feeding the diet industry <unk> which is keeping so[MASK] <unk> many of us from making peace with our own bodies for waiting to be the <unk>[MASK] before we truly start to live our lives <unk> because the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia [MASK] fat activism refuses to indulge this fear by advocating for <unk>[MASK] <unk> and respect for all of us we can shift society 's reluctance to embrace diversity[MASK] and start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body <unk> thank you[MASK]
