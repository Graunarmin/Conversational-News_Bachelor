 <unk> might think there are many things that i can 't do because i cannot[MASK] <unk> i just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage <unk> but there is also a lot that i can do this is me[MASK] rock climbing for the first time [MASK] actually <unk> i love sports and i can play many sports like swimming skiing skating scuba diving running and so on [MASK] but there is one limitation [MASK] somebody needs to help me i[MASK] <unk> be independent <unk> [MASK] i lost my sight at the age of fourteen in a swimming pool accident <unk> [MASK] i was an active independent teenager and suddenly i became blind [MASK] the hardest thing for me was losing my independence things that until then[MASK] <unk> one of my challenges was textbooks <unk> [MASK] back then there were no personal computers no internet no smartphones [MASK] so i had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks and i had to create my own books in braille [MASK] can you imagine [MASK] of course my brothers were not happy about it and later i[MASK] they were not there whenever i needed them i think they tried to stay away from me <unk> i don 't blame them <unk> [MASK] i really wanted to be freed from relying on someone [MASK] that became my strong desire to ignite innovation <unk> [MASK] jump ahead to[MASK] <unk> to myself <unk> how come there is no computer technology to[MASK] create books in braille <unk> these amazing technologies[MASK] must be able to also help people with limitations like myself <unk> that 's the moment my innovation journey began <unk>[MASK] <unk> such as a digital braille editor digital braille dictionary and a digital braille library network <unk> [MASK] today <unk> every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks by using personal computers and mobile devices in braille or in voice <unk> [MASK] this may not surprise you since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in two[MASK] <unk> fifteen but braille went digital many years before digital books already in the late <unk>[MASK] almost thirty years ago strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity[MASK] to create digital books way back then <unk> and this is actually[MASK] not the first time this happened <unk> because history shows us[MASK] accessibility ignites innovation [MASK] the telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people [MASK] some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities [MASK] now i 'm going to give[MASK] <unk> you another example from my own life in the ' 90s people around me started talking about the internet and web browsing [MASK] i remember the first time i went on the web i was astonished <unk> [MASK] i could access newspapers at any time and every day <unk> i could even search[MASK] <unk> desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the internet and i found ways[MASK] to render the web into synthesized voice <unk> which dramatically simplified the user interface [MASK] this led me to develop the home page reader in[MASK] <unk> i developed the home page reader <unk> i got many comments from users one that i strongly remember said [MASK] for me the internet is[MASK] a small window to the world it was a revolutionary moment for the blind the cyber world[MASK] <unk> and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses <unk> way beyond what i imagined [MASK] it can help drivers listen to[MASK] their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking <unk> [MASK] today <unk> i am more independent <unk> but it is still not enough [MASK] for example <unk> when i approached the stage just now i needed assistance[MASK] <unk> my goal is to come up here independently <unk> and not just here [MASK] my goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you <unk> [MASK] ok now let me show you the latest technologies this is a smartphone app that we are working on[MASK] ev take the two doors to go out the door is on your right <unk>[MASK] nick is approaching <unk> looks so happy[MASK] <unk> he is not talking to you[MASK] <unk> dark chocolate with almonds ev you gained five pounds since yesterday[MASK] <unk> app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors[MASK] and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself <unk> but the computer vision part[MASK] that showed who is approaching <unk> in which mood we are still working on that part and recognizing facial expressions[MASK] is very important for me to be social <unk> [MASK] so now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world <unk> [MASK] we call this[MASK] cognitive assistance it understands our surrounding world[MASK] and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration[MASK] <unk> to my fingers cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities[MASK] in other words our five senses [MASK] this technology is only in an early stage <unk> but eventually i 'll be able to find a classroom on campus <unk> [MASK] enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street[MASK] it will be amazing if i can find you on the street before you notice me [MASK] it will become my best buddy <unk> and yours [MASK] so this really is a great challenge it is a challenge[MASK] that needs collaboration which is[MASK] <unk> fundamental technologies you just saw in the video the frontier is the real world the blind community is exploring[MASK] this technical frontier and the pathfinder <unk> [MASK] i hope to work with you to explore the new era and the next time that i 'm on this stage[MASK] <unk> through technology and innovation i will be able to walk up here all by myself <unk> thank you so much[MASK]
