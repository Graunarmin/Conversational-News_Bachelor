 <unk> usually remember the names of our doctors <unk> but often we forget the names of our nurses [MASK] i remember one i had breast cancer a few[MASK] <unk> and somehow i managed to get through the surgeries and the beginning of the treatment just fine <unk> [MASK] i could hide what was going on everybody didn 't really have to know <unk> [MASK] i could walk my daughter to school <unk> i could go out to dinner with my husband <unk> i could fool people <unk> [MASK] but then my chemo was scheduled to begin and that terrified me because i knew that i was going to lose every[MASK] single hair on my body because of the kind of chemo that i was going to have [MASK] i wasn 't going to be able to pretend anymore as though everything was normal[MASK] <unk> i was scared i knew what it felt like to have everybody treating me with kid gloves and i just wanted to feel normal <unk> [MASK] i had a port installed in my chest <unk> i went to my first day of chemotherapy <unk> and i was an emotional wreck [MASK] my nurse[MASK] <unk> walked in the door <unk> [MASK] and every bone in my body was telling me to get up out of that chair and take for the hills <unk> but joanne looked at me and talked to me like we were old friends <unk> [MASK] and then she asked me where 'd you get your highlights done [MASK] and i was like are you kidding me you 're going to talk to me about my hair when i 'm on the verge of losing it i was kind of[MASK] <unk> and with a shrug of her shoulders she said it 's gonna grow back [MASK] and in that moment she said the one thing i had overlooked and that was that at some point my life would get back to normal she really believed that [MASK] and so i believed it too [MASK] now <unk> worrying about losing your hair when you 're fighting cancer may seem silly at first but[MASK] it 's not just that you 're worried about how you 're going to look[MASK] <unk> it 's that you 're worried that everybody 's going to treat you so carefully <unk> [MASK] joanne made me feel normal for the first time in six months [MASK] we talked about her boyfriends we talked about looking for apartments in new york city <unk> and we talked about my reaction to the chemotherapy all kind of mixed in together <unk> [MASK] and i always wondered how did she so instinctively[MASK] know just how to talk to me[MASK] joanne staha and my admiration for her marked the beginning of my journey into the world of nurses [MASK] a few years later i was asked to do a project that would celebrate the work that nurses do [MASK] i started with joanne <unk> and i met over one hundred nurses across the country <unk> [MASK] i spent[MASK] <unk> and filming nurses for a book and a documentary film [MASK] with my team we mapped a trip across america that would take us to places dealing with some of the biggest public health issues facing our nation[MASK] aging <unk> war <unk> poverty <unk> prisons <unk> [MASK] and then we went places where we would find the largest concentration of patients dealing with those issues [MASK] then we asked[MASK] <unk> hospitals and facilities to nominate nurses who would best represent them [MASK] one of the first nurses i met was bridget kumbella bridget was born in cameroon the oldest of four children [MASK] her father was at work when he had fallen from the fourth floor and really hurt his back [MASK] and he talked a lot about what it was like to be flat on your back and not get the kind of care[MASK] <unk> that you need and that propelled bridget to go into the profession of nursing [MASK] now as a nurse in the bronx she has a really diverse group of patients that she cares for from all walks of life <unk> and from all different religions [MASK] and she 's devoted her career to understanding the impact of our cultural differences when it comes to our health [MASK] she spoke[MASK] <unk> of a patient a native american patient that she had[MASK] that wanted to bring a bunch of feathers into the icu [MASK] that 's how he found spiritual comfort [MASK] and she spoke of advocating for him and said that patients come from all different religions and use all different kinds of objects for comfort <unk> [MASK] whether it 's a holy rosary or a symbolic feather it all needs to be supported[MASK] this is jason short <unk> [MASK] jason is a home health nurse in the appalachian mountains and his dad had a gas station and a repair shop when he was growing up [MASK] so he worked on cars in the community that he now serves as a nurse [MASK] when he was in college it was[MASK] just not macho at all to become a nurse so he avoided it for years he drove trucks for a little while <unk> but his[MASK] <unk> life path was always pulling him back to nursing [MASK] as a nurse in the appalachian mountains jason goes places that an ambulance can 't even get to in this photograph he 's standing in what used to be a road <unk> [MASK] top of the mountain mining flooded that road <unk> and now the only way for jason to get to the patient living in that house with black lung disease[MASK] is to drive[MASK] against the current up that creek [MASK] the day i was with him we ripped the front fender off the car [MASK] the next morning he got up put the car on the lift fixed the fender and then headed out to meet his next patient [MASK] i witnessed jason caring for this gentleman with such enormous[MASK] <unk> and i was struck again by how intimate the work of nursing really is [MASK] when i met brian mcmillion he was raw he had just come back from a deployment[MASK] and he hadn 't really settled back in to life in san diego yet[MASK] he talked about his experience of being a nurse in germany and taking care of the soldiers coming right off the battlefield[MASK] <unk> very often he would be the first person they would see when they opened their eyes in the hospital <unk> [MASK] and they would look at him as they were lying there missing limbs <unk> and the first thing they would say[MASK] is when can i go back i left my brothers out there [MASK] and brian would have to say you 're not going anywhere you 've already given enough brother [MASK] brian is both a nurse and a soldier who 's seen combat[MASK] <unk> so that puts him in a unique position to be able to relate to and help heal the veterans in his care [MASK] this is sister stephen <unk> and she runs a nursing home in wisconsin called villa loretto and the entire circle of life can be found under her roof [MASK] she grew up wishing they lived on a farm so[MASK] given the opportunity to adopt local[MASK] <unk> farm animals she enthusiastically brings them in [MASK] and in the springtime those animals have babies <unk> [MASK] and sister stephen uses those baby ducks <unk> goats and lambs as animal therapy for the residents at villa loretto who sometimes can 't remember their own name <unk> [MASK] but they do rejoice in the holding of a baby lamb[MASK] <unk> the day i was with sister stephen <unk> i needed to take her away from villa loretto to film part of her story <unk> [MASK] and before we left she went into the room of a dying patient [MASK] and she leaned over and she said i have to go away for the day <unk> but if jesus calls you you go you go straight[MASK] <unk> i was standing there and thinking[MASK] it was the first time in my life i witnessed that you could show someone you love them completely[MASK] by letting go we don 't have to hold on so tightly <unk> [MASK] i saw more life rolled up at villa loretto than i have ever seen at any other time at any other place in my life <unk> [MASK] we live in a complicated time when it comes to our health care[MASK] it 's easy to lose sight of the need for quality of life not just quantity of life [MASK] as new life saving technologies are created we 're going to have really complicated decisions to make [MASK] these technologies often save lives <unk> but they can also prolong pain and the dying process [MASK] how in the world are we supposed to navigate[MASK] <unk> these waters <unk> we 're going to need all the help we can get [MASK] nurses have a really unique relationship with us because of the time spent at bedside <unk> [MASK] during that time a kind of emotional intimacy develops [MASK] this past summer on august nine <unk> my father died of a heart attack my mother was devastated <unk> and she[MASK] <unk> couldn 't imagine her world without him in it [MASK] four days later she fell she broke her hip [MASK] she needed surgery and she found herself fighting for her own life [MASK] once again i found myself on the receiving end of the care of nurses[MASK] this time for my mom my brother and my sister and i stayed by her side for the next three days in[MASK] <unk> the icu [MASK] and as we tried to make the right decisions and follow my mother 's wishes <unk> [MASK] we found that we were depending upon the guidance of nurses <unk> [MASK] and once again they didn 't let us down [MASK] they had[MASK] amazing insight in terms of how to care for my mom in the last four days of her life they brought her comfort[MASK] and relief from pain [MASK] they knew to encourage my sister and i to put a pretty nightgown on my mom [MASK] long after it mattered to her but it sure meant a lot to us [MASK] and they knew to come and wake me up just in time[MASK] for my mom 's last breath <unk> and then they knew how long to leave me in the room with my mother after she died[MASK] i have no idea how they know these things <unk> but i do know that i am eternally grateful[MASK] that they 've guided me once again thank you so very much[MASK]
