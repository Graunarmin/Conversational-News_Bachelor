 <unk> always wanted to become[MASK] a walking laboratory of social engagement to resonate other people 's feelings <unk> thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them[MASK] <unk> as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance [MASK] that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye [MASK] we intuit other people 's feelings <unk> we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen [MASK] we 're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else 's subjectivity <unk> we do that all the time we just can 't shake it off <unk> [MASK] it 's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves[MASK] to understand the world around us are shaped by that stance we are social to the core <unk> [MASK] so my journey in autism really started when i lived in a residential unit[MASK] for adults with autism <unk> most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals this is a long[MASK] <unk> for them autism was devastating <unk> [MASK] they had profound intellectual disabilities <unk> they didn 't talk but most of all <unk> [MASK] they were extraordinarily isolated[MASK] from the world around them from their environment[MASK] and from the people in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals with autism you 'd hear a lot of noise <unk> [MASK] <unk> commotion actions people doing things <unk> but they 're always doing things by themselves <unk> [MASK] so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling <unk> or they may be isolated in the corner [MASK] or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements [MASK] <unk> now we know that autism[MASK] is this disruption the disruption of this resonance[MASK] that i am telling you about these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited[MASK] over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility[MASK] <unk> without the caregiver they wouldn 't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them[MASK] with these mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first[MASK] days and weeks of life <unk> babies prefer to[MASK] hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment <unk> they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they 're looking at people they look at people 's eyes[MASK] <unk> because the eye is the window[MASK] to the other person 's experiences <unk> so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away <unk> [MASK] well <unk> they orient to the caregiver <unk> the caregiver seeks the baby and it 's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography[MASK] that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the[MASK] <unk> social mind the social brain[MASK] depends on <unk> we always think about autism[MASK] as as something that happens later on in life <unk> [MASK] it doesn 't it begins with the beginning of life[MASK] <unk> as babies engage with[MASK] <unk> they soon realize that well there is something between the ears[MASK] that is very important it 's invisible you can 't see it but it 's really critical <unk> [MASK] and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere[MASK] in order to get things they want they also learn to follow other people 's gazes <unk> because whatever people are looking at is[MASK] <unk> they are thinking about <unk> [MASK] and soon enough <unk> they start to learn about the meaning of things <unk> [MASK] because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something they 're not just getting a directional cue <unk> [MASK] they are getting the other person 's meaning of that thing the attitude <unk> and soon[MASK] <unk> they start building[MASK] this body of meanings <unk> but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction [MASK] those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others <unk> [MASK] well <unk> [MASK] this is a <unk>[MASK] little girl <unk> and she has autism and i am coming so close to her that i am maybe two inches from her[MASK] <unk> face <unk> [MASK] and she 's quite oblivious to me <unk> imagine if i did that to you[MASK] came two inches from your face you 'd do probably two things wouldn 't you you would recoil you would call the police [MASK] you would do something because it 's literally impossible to penetrate somebody 's physical space[MASK] and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom[MASK] <unk> by our language our body just knows that <unk> [MASK] and we 've known that for a long time <unk> and this is not something that happens to humans only <unk> it happens to some of our phyletic cousins <unk> [MASK] because if you 're a monkey <unk> [MASK] and you look at another monkey <unk> and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be[MASK] a signal or threat well you[MASK] <unk> not going to be alive for long <unk> so something that in other species are survival[MASK] mechanisms <unk> without which[MASK] they wouldn 't basically live we bring into the context of human beings <unk> and this is what we need to simply act socially [MASK] now she is oblivious to me and i 'm so close to her and you think <unk> maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later[MASK] <unk> she goes to the corner of the room <unk> and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m & m so[MASK] i could not attract her attention <unk> but something a thing did [MASK] now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people [MASK] <unk> for this girl that division line[MASK] is not so clear [MASK] and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences[MASK] what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging [MASK] moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines who[MASK] <unk> to be but in fact the brain also becomes who we are and at the same time[MASK] that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction [MASK] this is what 's happening with her mind <unk> and this is what 's happening with her brain [MASK] well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders[MASK] and it 's a brain disorder it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born[MASK] <unk> we now know that there is a very broad spectrum[MASK] of autism <unk> there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted there are those individuals who don 't talk[MASK] <unk> those individuals who talk too much [MASK] there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school [MASK] you see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them [MASK] to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly relentlessly <unk> but often[MASK] in an awkward fashion <unk> without that immediate resonance <unk> [MASK] well <unk> this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when i started in this field we thought there were four individuals with autism[MASK] <unk> per ten thousand a very rare condition <unk> [MASK] well <unk> now we <unk> know it 's more like one in one hundred there are millions of individuals with autism all around us[MASK] <unk> the societal cost of this condition is huge [MASK] in the us alone maybe thirty five to eighty billion dollars <unk> and you know what most of those funds are associated[MASK] with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely[MASK] <unk> disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of sixty thousand to eighty thousand dollars a year [MASK] those are individuals who did not benefit[MASK] from early treatment <unk> because now we know[MASK] that autism creates itself[MASK] as individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that i mentioned to you were we to be able to identify[MASK] <unk> this condition at an earlier point <unk> and intervene and treat[MASK] i can tell you this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past ten years <unk> this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition [MASK] also we have a window of opportunity <unk> because the brain is malleable for just so long <unk> and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life[MASK] <unk> not that that window closes <unk> it doesn 't <unk> [MASK] but it diminishes considerably [MASK] and yet <unk> the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years <unk> [MASK] and in disadvantaged populations the populations that don 't have access to clinical services rural populations <unk> minorities [MASK] <unk> the age of diagnosis is later still [MASK] which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe <unk> [MASK] so i feel that we have a bioethical imperative <unk> the science is there [MASK] but no science is of relevance if it doesn 't have an impact[MASK] on the community and we just can 't afford that missed opportunity <unk> because children with autism become adults with autism[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] we feel that those things we can do for these children for those families early on <unk> will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family <unk> and for the community at large <unk> [MASK] so this is[MASK] our view of autism <unk> [MASK] there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe there are going to be something between three hundred and six hundred genes associated with autism[MASK] and genetic anomalies much more than just genes <unk> [MASK] and we actually have a bit of a question here <unk> [MASK] because if there are so many different causes of autism <unk> how do you go from those liabilities[MASK] to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a playroom[MASK] <unk> we recognize a child as having autism <unk> so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity <unk> [MASK] and the answer is what lies in between <unk> [MASK] which is development and in fact <unk> we are very interested in those first two years of life <unk> [MASK] because those liabilities don 't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself [MASK] were we to be able to intervene during those[MASK] years of life[MASK] we might attenuate for some and god knows <unk> maybe even prevent for others <unk> [MASK] so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person 's being [MASK] i remember when i interacted with that[MASK] <unk> how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about <unk>[MASK] it 's hard to do that so we had to create the technologies <unk> we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes [MASK] and so in the past many years we 've been[MASK] building these new technologies that are[MASK] based on eye tracking <unk> we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with[MASK] this is my colleague warren jones with whom we 've been building these methods these studies for the past twelve years <unk> and you see there[MASK] little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from[MASK] <unk> his world his mom the caregiver <unk> but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his in his daycare <unk> [MASK] what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that [MASK] we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies [MASK] how newborns engage with the world moment by moment [MASK] what is important and what is not[MASK] <unk> well <unk> we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you 're watching a video[MASK] those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of thirty five typically developing two year olds [MASK] and we freeze one frame <unk> [MASK] and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are[MASK] two year olds with autism <unk> so on that frame <unk> the children[MASK] who are typical are watching this [MASK] the emotion of expression of that little boy as he 's fighting a little bit with the little girl <unk> [MASK] what are the children with autism doing they are focusing on the revolving[MASK] door opening[MASK] <unk> and shutting [MASK] well i can tell you that this divergence that you 're seeing here doesn 't happen only in our five minute experiment <unk> [MASK] it happens moment by moment in their real lives [MASK] and their minds are being formed[MASK] and their brains are being specialized in something other[MASK] than what is happening with their typical peers <unk> well <unk> we took a construct from[MASK] <unk> the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and you have physical height[MASK] and weight well we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement <unk>[MASK] we sought children from the time they 're born what you see here on the[MASK] <unk> their viewing time that they 're focusing on people 's eyes and this is their growth chart <unk> [MASK] they start over here they love people 's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit[MASK] in those initial months now let 's see what 's happening with babies who became autistic [MASK] it 's something very different <unk> it starts way up here <unk> but then it 's a free fall[MASK] <unk> very much like they brought into this world the reflex[MASK] that orients them to people but it has no traction <unk> it 's almost as if that stimulus you[MASK] you 're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives[MASK] <unk> wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life <unk> because if you interact with a two and a three month old you 'd be surprised by how social those babies are [MASK] and what we see in the first six months of life[MASK] is that those two groups can be segregated[MASK] very easily <unk> and using these kinds of measures and many others <unk> what we found out is that our science[MASK] could in fact <unk> identify this condition early on we didn 't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life [MASK] if we measured things that are evolutionarily <unk> highly conserved <unk> [MASK] and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way[MASK] to those first months and that[MASK] what we are doing now [MASK] now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children <unk> [MASK] but this would be for naught if we didn 't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community [MASK] now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues <unk> the primary care physicians[MASK] <unk> who see every child[MASK] and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice <unk> because they have to see so many children <unk> [MASK] and we want to do that universally[MASK] so that we don 't miss any child <unk> but this would be immoral[MASK] if we also did not have an infrastructure[MASK] <unk> for intervention for treatment <unk> we need to be able to work with the families support the families to manage[MASK] those first years with them we need to be able to really go from universal screening[MASK] to universal access to treatment <unk> because those treatments[MASK] are going to change these children 's and those families <unk> ' lives <unk> now[MASK] <unk> when we think about what we [ can ] do[MASK] in those first years i can tell you[MASK] <unk> having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense[MASK] that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities preventing in fact those experiences[MASK] that i really started in my journey in this field i thought at the time that this was an[MASK] <unk> intractable condition no longer <unk> we can do a great deal of things [MASK] and the idea is not to cure autism that 's not the idea [MASK] what we want is to make sure[MASK] that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times <unk> [MASK] the profound intellectual disabilities <unk> the lack of language <unk> the profound profound isolation[MASK] we feel that individuals with autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity <unk> [MASK] and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength <unk> predictable situations situations that can be defined <unk> because after all [MASK] they learn about the world almost like about it[MASK] <unk> than learning how to function in it <unk> but this is a strength[MASK] if you 're working for example in technology <unk> [MASK] and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities <unk> we want them to be free to do that we want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able[MASK] not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise <unk> well thank you for listening to me[MASK]
