 <unk> ask the question you know why is a flying car or maybe more accurately a roadable aircraft possible at this time a number of years ago [MASK] mr ford[MASK] predicted that flying cars of some form would be available now sixty years later[MASK] <unk> to tell you why it 's possible when i was about five years old not very much about a year after mr ford made his predictions <unk> i was living in a rural part of <unk>[MASK] <unk> canada on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area [MASK] scary thing for a young kid to be going through at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year [MASK] i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home they[MASK] 'd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window <unk> and well they were easy to capture i took them outside and as i let them go that split second even though they[MASK] <unk> very tired that second i let them go they hovered for a second then zipped off into the distance <unk> i thought what a great way to get to school [MASK] for a kid at that age this was like infinite speed disappearing <unk> and i was very inspired by that and so so[MASK] the next over the next six decades believe it or not i 've built a number of aircraft <unk> with the goal of creating something that could do[MASK] <unk> for you or me what the hummingbird does and give you that flexibility [MASK] i 've called this vehicle generically a volantor after the latin word volant meaning to fly in a light <unk> nimble manner[MASK] pilot 's license a powerlift pilot 's license for this type of aircraft it[MASK] 's closer than you think it[MASK] 's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft <unk> so for once perhaps the government is ahead of itself[MASK] <unk> the press calls my particular volantor a skycar [MASK] this is a a little bit earlier version of it that 's why it 's given the x designation[MASK] but it 's a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter therefore it doesn 't need an airfield on the ground it 's powered electrically <unk> [MASK] it 's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels which is a great asset because it allows you theoretically to use this on the highways in most states <unk> and actually <unk>[MASK] <unk> in all cities so that 's an asset because if you 've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile[MASK] <unk> forget it you 're never going to fly it [MASK] one could say that a[MASK] helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does <unk> [MASK] and gets around in much the same way and it 's true but a helicopter is a very complex device it 's[MASK] expensive so expensive that very few people could own or use it[MASK] <unk> it 's often been described[MASK] <unk> because of its fragile fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts a large number of parts flying in formation [MASK] laughter another difference and i have to describe this because it 's very personal <unk> [MASK] another great difference between the helicopter and[MASK] the volantor in my case the skycar volantor[MASK] is the experience that i 've had in flying[MASK] <unk> both of those in a helicopter you feel and it 's still a remarkable sensation[MASK] you feel like you 're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane [MASK] when you get in the skycar and i can tell you there 's only one other person that 's flown it but he had the same sensation you really feel like you 're being lifted up by a magic carpet <unk> [MASK] without any vibration[MASK] <unk> the sensation is unbelievable <unk> [MASK] and it 's been a great motivator i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally <unk> and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so <unk> [MASK] but it 's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time <unk> [MASK] what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50 plus mile[MASK] <unk> very few people realize that fifty mile plus trips make up eighty five percent of the miles traveled in america <unk> if we can get rid of that then the highways will now be useful to you [MASK] as contrasted by what 's happening in many parts of[MASK] the world today [MASK] on this next slide is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure because[MASK] <unk> whether i give you a perfect skycar <unk> the perfect vehicle for use it 's going to have very little value to you unless you 've got a system to use it in i 'm sure any of you have asked the question yeah are there great things up there what am i going to do get up there it 's bad enough on a highway what 's it going to be like to be in the air [MASK] this world that you 're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated you 're not going to be a pilot you 're going to be a passenger and it 's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes[MASK] <unk> i can tell you technically we can build skycars my god we went to the moon the technology there was much more difficult than what i 'm dealing with here <unk> [MASK] but we have to have these priority changes we have to have infrastructure to go with this [MASK] historically you see that we got around two hundred years ago by canals and as that system disappeared were replaced by railroads as that disappeared we came in with highways but if you look at that top corner the highway system you see where we are today [MASK] <unk> are no longer being built [MASK] and that 's a fact you won 't see any additional highways in the next ten years <unk> [MASK] however the next ten years if like the last ten years we 're going to see thirty percent more traffic <unk> [MASK] and where is that going to lead you to so the issue then i 've often asked is when is it going to happen [MASK] when are we going to be able to have these vehicles <unk> and of course if you ask me i 'm going to give you a really optimistic view after all i 've been spending sixty years here believing it 's going to happen tomorrow so i 'm not going to[MASK] <unk> this i 'd prefer to quote someone else who testified with me before congress and in his position as head of nasa[MASK] put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft[MASK] now i would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highways today <unk> you 're only averaging about thirty miles per hour on average according to[MASK] <unk> travels at over three hundred miles an hour up to to twenty five thousand feet <unk> and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the in the[MASK] ability to get around as far as speed is concerned <unk> [MASK] unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky[MASK] <unk> i 'm talking about here has been under construction for ten years <unk> it makes use of the gps you 're familiar with gps in your automobile but[MASK] you may not be familiar with the fact that there 's a gps u s there 's a russian gps <unk> and there 's a new[MASK] gps system going to europe called galileo with those three systems you have what is always necessary a level of redundancy that says if one system fails you 'll still have a way to make sure that you[MASK] being controlled because if you 're in this world where computers are controlling what you 're doing it 's going to be very critical that something can 't fail on you [MASK] how would a trip in a skycar work well <unk> [MASK] you can 't right now take off from your home because it 's too noisy i mean to be able to take off from your home you 'd have to be extremely quiet <unk> but it 's still fairly quiet <unk> [MASK] you 'd motor electrically to a vertiport which may be a few blocks maybe even a few miles away this is clearly as i said earlier a roadable aircraft[MASK] not going to spend that much time on the road after all <unk> if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway [MASK] go to a local vertiport <unk> plug in your destination [MASK] delivered[MASK] almost like a passenger <unk> you can play computer games <unk> you can sleep you can read on the way this is the world there won 't be you as[MASK] <unk> and i know the pilots in the audience aren 't going to like that and i 've had a lot of bad feedback[MASK] from people who who want to be up there flying around and and experiencing that and of course i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that [MASK] but the vehicle itself is going to be a very very controlled environment <unk> or it 's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system <unk> [MASK] we flew the first vehicle for the international press in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when i really got it started i was a[MASK] professor at the u c davis system and[MASK] i got a lot of excitement around this and i was able to fund the initiation of the of the program back in that time <unk> [MASK] and then through the various years we invented various vehicles [MASK] actually the critical point was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle how completely stable it was in all circumstances <unk> [MASK] which is of course very critical [MASK] still not a practical vehicle during all of this but moving in the right direction[MASK] <unk> finally in the early part of or actually the middle of[MASK] two thousand and two we flew the four hundred m400 which was the four passenger vehicle in this case here we 're flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning[MASK] <unk> and we had very small power plants in it at this time <unk> we are now installing larger powerplants <unk> which will make it possible for me to get back on board[MASK] <unk> safest vehicle during the test flight program there 's an old adage[MASK] that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft [MASK] a vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system that 's essential [MASK] <unk> that brain that flies that aircraft fails <unk> or if the engine fails that vehicle crashes <unk> there is no option to that [MASK] and the adage that i 'm referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down [MASK] that 's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots in fact the aircraft companies gave up on[MASK] vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years and there 's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that 's a vertical takeoff aircraft as distinct from a helicopter and that 's the hawker harrier jump jet [MASK] a vertical takeoff aircraft <unk> like the hummingbird [MASK] has a very high metabolism <unk> which means it requires a lot of energy[MASK] getting that energy is very very difficult it all comes down to that power plant how to get a large amount of power in a small package <unk> [MASK] fortunately dr felix wankel invented the rotary engine a very unique engine it 's round <unk> it 's small <unk>[MASK] <unk> it fits exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system[MASK] very critical in fact that engine for those who are into the automobile know that it recently is applied to the rx8 the mazda <unk> [MASK] and that sportscar won sports car of the year [MASK] wonderful engine [MASK] in that application it generates one horsepower per pound which is twice as good as your car engine today <unk> but only half of what we need [MASK] my company has spent thirty five years and many millions of dollars[MASK] taking that rotary engine which was invented in the late ' 50s and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound reliably and critical we actually get one hundred and seventy five horsepower into one cubic foot <unk> [MASK] we have eight engines in this vehicle we have four computers we have two parachutes [MASK] <unk> is the critical issue here if you want to stay alive you 've got to have backups and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine and continued to hover <unk> [MASK] the computers back up each other there 's a voting system if one computer is not agreeing with the other three it 's kicked out of the system <unk> [MASK] and then you have three you still have the triple redundancy if one of those fails you still have a second chance <unk> if you stick around then[MASK] good luck there won 't be a[MASK] more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that i 'd[MASK] like to show you an animation in this next one which is one[MASK] element of the skycar 's use but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used you could think of it personally in your own terms of how you[MASK] <unk> i believe that personal transportation in something like the skycar probably in another volantor form as well [MASK] will be a significant part of our lives as dr goldin says within the next ten years and it 's going to change the demographics in a very significant way <unk> [MASK] <unk> miles from san francisco and get there in fifteen minutes you 're going to sell your[MASK] <unk> apartment buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain [MASK] buy a skycar which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of one hundred thousand dollars put money in the bank [MASK] that 's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco <unk> but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell[MASK] <unk> been a real challenge <unk> obviously i 'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what i 'm doing both financially and in technical help <unk> [MASK] and that has you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you 're doing and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing [MASK] i characterized[MASK] this emerging technology in an aphorism as it 's described[MASK] which really talks about what i 've experienced and i 'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies[MASK]
