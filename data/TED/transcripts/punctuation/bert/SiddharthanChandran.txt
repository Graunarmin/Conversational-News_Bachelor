 <unk> i 'm[MASK] very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about[MASK] how we might repair the damaged brain <unk> [MASK] and i 'm particularly excited by this field because as a neurologist myself <unk> i believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope[MASK] for patients who today live with devastating[MASK] and yet untreatable diseases of the brain <unk> [MASK] so here 's the problem <unk> [MASK] you can see here the picture of somebody 's brain with alzheimer 's disease next to a healthy brain <unk> [MASK] and what 's obvious is in the alzheimer 's brain <unk> ringed red there 's obvious damage atrophy scarring <unk> [MASK] and i could show you equivalent pictures from other disease <unk> multiple sclerosis motor neuron disease[MASK] <unk> parkinson 's disease <unk> even huntington 's disease <unk> and they would all tell a similar story <unk> [MASK] and collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time <unk> [MASK] and the numbers here are really rather staggering [MASK] at any one time there are thirty five million people today living with one of these brain diseases <unk> and the annual cost globally is[MASK] <unk> seven hundred billion dollars i mean just think about that that 's greater than one percent of the global gdp <unk> [MASK] and it gets worse <unk> because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large[MASK] <unk> living longer <unk> so the question we really need to ask ourselves is why[MASK] <unk> given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual [MASK] never mind the scale of the societal problem <unk> why are there no effective treatments <unk> [MASK] now in order to consider this i first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works[MASK] so in other words i need to tell you everything i learned at medical school [MASK] but believe me this isn 't going to take[MASK] <unk> so the brain is terribly simple it 's made up of four cells <unk> [MASK] and two of them are shown here <unk> there 's the nerve cell <unk> and then there 's the myelinating cell or the insulating cell <unk> it 's called oligodendrocyte [MASK] and when these four cells work together in health and harmony [MASK] they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity <unk> and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think to emote[MASK] <unk> emote to remember to learn move feel and so on [MASK] but equally <unk> each of these individual four cells alone or together can go rogue or die <unk> [MASK] and when that happens you get damage <unk> you get damaged wiring you get disrupted connections <unk> [MASK] and that 's evident here[MASK] with the slower conduction [MASK] but ultimately this damage will manifest as disease clearly <unk> [MASK] and if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve for example <unk> you 'll get motor neuron disease <unk> [MASK] so i 'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease <unk> [MASK] so this is a patient of mine called john john i saw just last week in the clinic <unk> and i 've asked john to tell us something about what were his[MASK] <unk> problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease[MASK] <unk> further down in that journey <unk> and i 've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament[MASK] <unk> what these two clips show[MASK] is not just the devastating consequence of the disease <unk> but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease <unk> [MASK] because in just eighteen months eighteen months [MASK] a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair and <unk>[MASK] and let 's face it john could be anybody 's father brother or friend so that 's what happens when the motor nerve dies[MASK] <unk> what happens when that myelin cell dies <unk> you get multiple sclerosis <unk> so the scan on your left[MASK] is an illustration of the brain <unk> and it 's a map of the connections of the brain <unk> [MASK] and superimposed upon which are areas of damage we call them lesions of demyelination but they 're damage <unk> and they 're white <unk> [MASK] so i know what you 're thinking here you 're thinking[MASK] <unk> god this bloke came up and said he 's going to talk about hope <unk> [MASK] and all he 's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale i 've told you these diseases are terrible they 're devastating numbers are rising [MASK] the costs are ridiculous and worst of all we have no treatment <unk> where 's the hope [MASK] well you know what i think there is hope <unk> [MASK] and there 's hope in this next[MASK] <unk> of this brain section of somebody else with m s because what it illustrates[MASK] is amazingly the brain can repair itself it just doesn 't do it well enough <unk> [MASK] and so again there are two things i want to show you first of all is the damage of this patient with <unk> m s and again it 's another one of these white masses <unk> [MASK] but crucially the area that 's ringed red[MASK] highlights an area that is pale blue but that area that is pale blue was once white <unk> so it was damaged it 's now repaired[MASK] just to be clear it[MASK] 's not because of doctors it 's in spite of doctors not because of doctors this is spontaneous repair [MASK] it 's amazing and it 's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain even [MASK] which can enable new myelin new insulation to be laid down over the damaged nerves <unk> [MASK] and this observation is[MASK] important for two reasons the first[MASK] is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school or at least i did <unk> admittedly last century[MASK] <unk> which is that the brain doesn 't repair itself <unk> unlike say the bone[MASK] or the liver but actually it does but it just doesn 't do it well enough <unk> and the second thing it does and it gives us a very clear direction of travel[MASK] <unk> you don 't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here <unk> you simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous spontaneous repair that occurs anyway <unk> [MASK] so the question is <unk> why if we 've known that for some time as we have <unk> why[MASK] do we not[MASK] have those treatments <unk> and that in part reflects the complexity of drug development now[MASK] drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet[MASK] and the odds of this bet are roughly this they 're ten thousand to one against [MASK] because you need to screen about ten thousand compounds to find that one potential winner <unk> [MASK] and then you need to spend fifteen years and spend over a billion dollars <unk> and even then you may not have a winner <unk> [MASK] so the question for us is can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds [MASK] and in order to do that you have to think where is the bottleneck[MASK] <unk> in this drug discovery and one of the bottlenecks is early in drug discovery all that screening occurs in animal models <unk> [MASK] but we know that the proper study of mankind is man to borrow from alexander pope <unk> so the question is can we study these diseases using human[MASK] material and of course[MASK] <unk> absolutely we can we can use stem cells <unk> and specifically we can use human stem cells <unk> [MASK] and human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things [MASK] they can self renew or make more of themselves <unk> [MASK] but they can also become specialized to make bone liver <unk> or crucially nerve cells <unk> maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell <unk> [MASK] and the challenge has long been can we harness the power[MASK] <unk> the undoubted power of these stem cells[MASK] in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology <unk> [MASK] and i think we can now <unk> and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last ten twenty years one of them was here in edinburgh <unk> and it must be the only celebrity sheep dolly <unk> [MASK] so dolly was made in edinburgh <unk> and dolly was an example of the first[MASK] cloning of a mammal from an adult cell <unk> but i think the even more significant[MASK] <unk> breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today[MASK] was made in two thousand and six by a japanese scientist called yamanaka <unk> [MASK] and what yamaka did in a fantastic form of scientific cookery [MASK] was he showed that four ingredients just four ingredients could effectively convert any cell adult cell <unk> into a master stem cell[MASK] <unk> and the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate <unk> [MASK] because what it means that from anybody in this room but particularly patients you could now generate a bespoke personalized tissue repair kit [MASK] take a skin cell <unk> make it a master pluripotent cell <unk> so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease <unk> [MASK] both to study but potentially to treat [MASK] now the idea of that at medical school this is a recurring theme isn 't it me and medical school would have been ridiculous <unk> but it 's an absolute reality today[MASK] <unk> and i see this as the cornerstone of regeneration repair and hope <unk> [MASK] and whilst we 're on the theme of hope for those of you who might have failed at school there 's hope for you as well[MASK] <unk> because this is the school report of john gerdon [ i believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist on his present showing this is quite ridiculous ] so they didn 't think much of him then [MASK] but what you may not know is that he got the nobel prize for medicine just three months ago <unk> [MASK] so to return to the original problem[MASK] <unk> what is the opportunity of these stem cells or this disruptive technology for repairing the damaged brain <unk> which we call regenerative neurology <unk> [MASK] i think there are two ways you can think about this as a fantastic 21st century drug discovery tool [MASK] and or as a form of therapy so i want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments [MASK] drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this[MASK] you take a patient with a disease <unk> let 's say motor neuron disease <unk> you take a skin sample you do the pluripotent[MASK] reprogramming as i 've already told you [MASK] and you generate live motor nerve cells that 's straightforward because that 's what pluripotent cells can do but crucially you can then compare their behavior[MASK] <unk> but healthy counterparts ideally from an unaffected relative that way you 're matching for genetic variation <unk> [MASK] and that 's exactly what we did here this was a collaboration with colleagues in london chris shaw <unk> in the <unk>[MASK] <unk> and tom maniatis [MASK] and what you 're looking at and this is amazing these are living growing motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease it happens to be an inherited form i mean[MASK] <unk> just imagine that this would have been unimaginable ten years ago <unk> [MASK] so apart from seeing them grow and put out processes we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce <unk> but crucially we can then track their individual health[MASK] and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones <unk> and when you do all that[MASK] and put it together <unk> you realize that the diseased ones which is represented in the red line are two and a half times more likely to die[MASK] than the healthy counterpart[MASK] and the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs <unk> [MASK] because what would you ask of the drugs and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system [MASK] you 'd ask the drugs give me one thing find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line <unk> [MASK] because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct[MASK] <unk> to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that i 've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models if that makes sense it[MASK] 's fantastic <unk> [MASK] but i want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage <unk> and again there are two ways to think about this <unk> and they 're not mutually exclusive [MASK] <unk> and i think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend but it 's not thought of that way just yet [MASK] is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain and i 've told you that [MASK] all of us have stem cells in the brain <unk> even the diseased brain <unk> and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already[MASK] to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it that will be the future there will be drugs that will do that[MASK] <unk> but the other way[MASK] is to effectively parachute in cells <unk> transplant them in to replace dying or lost cells <unk> even in the brain <unk> [MASK] and i want to tell you now an experiment it 's a clinical trial that we did which recently completed <unk> which is with colleagues in ucl david miller in[MASK] <unk> so this study was very simple we took patients with multiple sclerosis[MASK] and asked a simple question would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves <unk> so what we did was we took this bone marrow <unk> [MASK] grew up the stem cells in the lab <unk> and then injected them back into the vein i 'm making this sound really simple <unk> it took five years off a lot of people [MASK] <unk> and it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues <unk> but[MASK] conceptually it 's essentially simple [MASK] so we 've given them into the vein <unk> right <unk> [MASK] so in order to measure whether this was successful or not we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure [MASK] and that 's a good thing to measure in m s because patients with <unk> m s sadly suffer with problems with vision loss of vision <unk> unclear vision [MASK] and so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with david miller three[MASK] <unk> times twelve months six months and before the infusion[MASK] and you can see the gently declining red line <unk> [MASK] and that 's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking which makes sense because their nerves are dying we then gave the stem cell infusion[MASK] and repeated the measurement twice three months and six months[MASK] and to our surprise almost the line 's gone up that suggests that the intervention has been protective[MASK] i don 't think myself that what 's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves [MASK] what i think they 've done is they 've promoted the endogenous stem cells or precursor cells to do their job wake up lay down new myelin <unk> [MASK] so this is a proof of concept i 'm[MASK] very excited about that [MASK] so i just want to end with the theme i began on which was regeneration and hope <unk> so here i 've asked john[MASK] what his hopes are for the future[MASK]
