 <unk> driving is dangerous it 's one of the things that we don 't like to think about[MASK] but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world[MASK] betrays the fact that we[MASK] <unk> know this to be true[MASK] car accidents are the leading cause of death[MASK] in people ages sixteen to nineteen in the united states leading cause of death[MASK] and seventy five percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol[MASK] so what happens[MASK] no one can say for sure but i i remember my first[MASK] <unk> accident i was a young driver out on the highway[MASK] and the car in front of me i saw the brake lights go on i 'm like okay all right this guy is slowing down i 'll slow down too i step on the brake[MASK] but but no this guy isn 't slowing down this guy is stopping dead stop dead stop on the highway it was just going sixty five to zero[MASK] i slammed on the brakes i felt the abs kick in and the car is still going and[MASK] <unk> not going to stop and i know it 's not going to stop and the air bag deploys the car is totaled and fortunately no one was hurt[MASK] but[MASK] i had no idea that car was stopping[MASK] and i think we can do a lot better than that i think we can transform[MASK] the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other[MASK] <unk> want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now[MASK] get into your car close the door you 're in a glass bubble[MASK] you can 't really directly sense the world around you you 're in this extended body[MASK] you 're tasked with navigating it down partially seen roadways in and amongst other metal giants at super human speeds[MASK] okay and all you have to guide you are your two eyes[MASK] okay so that 's all you have eyes that weren 't really designed for this task but[MASK] then people ask you to do things like you want to make a lane change what 's the first thing they ask you do[MASK] take your eyes off the road that 's right[MASK] stop looking where you 're going turn check your blind spot and drive down the road without looking where you 're going[MASK] you and everyone else this is the safe way to[MASK] <unk> drive[MASK] why do we do this because we have to we have to make a choice do i look here or do i look here what 's more important[MASK] and usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road[MASK] but occasionally we miss something occasionally we sense something wrong or too late[MASK] in countless accidents the driver says i[MASK] <unk> see it coming and i believe that i believe that we can only watch so much[MASK] but the technology exists now that can help us improve that[MASK] in the future[MASK] with cars exchanging data with each other we will be able to see[MASK] not just three cars ahead and three cars behind to the right and left all at the same time bird 's eye view[MASK] will actually be able to see into those cars[MASK] we will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us to see how fast that guy 's going or stopping if[MASK] that guy 's going down to zero i 'll know[MASK] and with computation and algorithms and predictive models we will be able to see the future[MASK] <unk> you may think that 's impossible how can you predict the future that 's really hard actually no with cars it 's not impossible cars are three dimensional objects[MASK] that have a fixed position and velocity they travel down roads[MASK] often they travel on pre published routes it 's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car 's going to be in the near future[MASK] even if when you 're in your car and some motorcyclist comes bshoom eighty five miles an[MASK] <unk> hour down lane splitting i know you 've had this experience[MASK] that guy didn 't just come out of nowhere that guy 's been on the road probably for the last half hour laughter[MASK] right i mean somebody 's seen him ten twenty thirty miles back someone 's seen that guy and as soon as one car sees that guy and[MASK] puts him on the map he 's on the map position velocity[MASK] good estimate he 'll continue going eighty five miles an hour you 'll know[MASK] because your car will know because that other car will have whispered something in his ear like by the way five minutes motorcyclist watch out[MASK] you can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave i mean they 're newtonian objects that 's very nice about them[MASK] so how do we get there[MASK] we can start with something as simple as sharing our position data[MASK] <unk> between cars just sharing gps[MASK] if i have a gps and a camera in my car i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i 'm going[MASK] with computer vision i can estimate where the cars around me are sort of and where they 're going[MASK] and same with the other cars they can have a precise idea of where they are and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are what happens if two cars share that data if they talk to each other[MASK] <unk> i can tell you exactly what happens both models improve[MASK] everybody wins[MASK] professor bob wang and his team[MASK] have done computer simulations of what happens[MASK] when fuzzy estimates combine even in light traffic when cars just share gps data[MASK] and we 've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now[MASK] <unk> now on these robots stereo cameras gps and the two dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems[MASK] we also attach a discrete short range communication radio and the robots talk to each other[MASK] when these robots come at each other they track each other 's position precisely and they can avoid each other[MASK] we 're now adding more and more robots into the mix[MASK] <unk> and we encountered some problems one of the problems when you get too much chatter it 's hard to process all the packets so you have to prioritize and that 's where the predictive model helps you[MASK] if your robot cars are all tracking[MASK] the predicted trajectories you don 't pay as much attention to those packets you prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course that guy could be a problem[MASK] and you can predict the new trajectory so you[MASK] <unk> know that he 's going off course you know how[MASK] and you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way and we wanted to do how can we best alert everyone how can these cars whisper you need to get out of the way[MASK] well it depends on two things one the ability of the car[MASK] and second the ability of the driver[MASK] if one guy has a really great car but they 're on their phone or you know doing something they 're not probably in the best position[MASK] <unk> to react in an emergency so we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling[MASK] and now using a series of three cameras[MASK] we can detect if a driver is looking forward looking away looking down on the phone or having a cup of coffee[MASK] we can predict the accident and we can predict who which cars are in the best position[MASK] <unk> to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone fundamentally these technologies exist today[MASK] i think the biggest problem that that we face is our own willingness to share our data[MASK] i think it 's a very disconcerting notion this idea that our cars will be watching us talking about us to other cars[MASK] that we 'll be going down the road in a sea of[MASK] <unk> gossip[MASK] but i believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy just like right now when i look at your car from the outside[MASK] i don 't really know about you[MASK] if i look at your license plate number i don 't really know who you are[MASK] i believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs laughter and[MASK] i think it 's going to be a great thing[MASK] i want you to consider for a moment if you really don 't want the distracted teenager behind you[MASK] to know that you 're braking that you 're coming to a dead stop[MASK] by sharing our data willingly we can do what 's best for everyone so let your car gossip about you[MASK] it 's going to make the roads a lot safer[MASK] thank you[MASK]
