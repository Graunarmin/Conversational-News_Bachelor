 <unk> so how many of you have ever been in a cave before <unk> [MASK] okay a few of you when you think of a cave most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock and in fact that 's how most caves are around this half of the country most of your caves are made[MASK] <unk> of limestone back where i 'm from most of our caves are made of lava rock <unk> because we have a lot of volcanoes out there <unk> but the caves i want to share with you today are made completely of ice specifically glacier <unk>[MASK] <unk> ice <unk> that 's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of oregon called mount hood <unk> [MASK] <unk> exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave now these days with so many people hiking around it 's pretty hard to find a new cave so you can imagine how excited we were to find three <unk>[MASK] <unk> new caves within sight of oregon 's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before [MASK] <unk> that no one had ever seen or gone to before <unk> [MASK] so what is a glacier <unk> [MASK] well those of you who have ever seen or touched snow you know that it 's really light because it 's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it 's mostly air [MASK] if you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball it gets really small hard and dense well on a mountain like hood where it snows over twenty feet a year <unk> it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice[MASK] <unk> now each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight <unk> forming a slow moving river of ice <unk> [MASK] <unk> when ice packed like that starts to move <unk> we call it a glacier and we give it a name the name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the sandy glacier <unk> [MASK] <unk> forming big networks of caves sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock now the crazy thing about glacier caves[MASK] is that each year <unk> new tunnels form different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave <unk> warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down <unk>[MASK] and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up gets into the cave and melts the ceilings back taller and taller[MASK] <unk> weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it 's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that 's slowly sliding down the mountain now[MASK] this is brent mcgregor <unk> my cave exploration partner <unk> [MASK] he and i have both been exploring caves a long time and we 've been climbing mountains a long time but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before [MASK] back in two thousand and eleven brent saw a youtube video of a couple[MASK] <unk> hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves <unk> [MASK] there were no gps coordinates for it and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the sandy glacier <unk> [MASK] so in july of that year <unk> we went out on the glacier and we found a big crack in the ice <unk> we had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole this is me looking into the entrance[MASK] <unk> at the end of this hole we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice <unk> [MASK] we followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end [MASK] and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three dimensional map of the cave on our way back out [MASK] so how do you map a cave well cave maps aren 't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels [MASK] to make a cave map you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave[MASK] <unk> you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations then[MASK] you use a compass and and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings <unk> [MASK] now those of you taking trigonometry that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there in[MASK] <unk> the more i mapped and studied caves the more useful i found all that math that i originally hated in school to be [MASK] so when you 're done surveying [MASK] you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well [MASK] and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this and[MASK] it 'll show you both a bird 's eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage kind of like an ant farm view <unk> [MASK] we named this cave snow dragon cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow [MASK] now later this summer as[MASK] <unk> more snow melted off the glacier we found more caves and we realized they were all connected [MASK] not long after we mapped snow dragon brent discovered this new cave not very far away <unk> the inside of it was coated with ice <unk> so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping <unk> [MASK] this cave was amazing the ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice[MASK] <unk> and lighting it all up [MASK] and we couldn 't understand why this cave was so much colder than snow dragon until we got to the end and we found out why there was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going one hundred <unk>[MASK] <unk> and thirty feet straight up to the surface of the glacier <unk> cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave <unk> freezing everything inside of it [MASK] <unk> following year so we could be the first ones to explore it [MASK] it was so cold outside we actually had to sleep inside the cave <unk> there 's our camp on the left side of this entrance room [MASK] the next morning <unk> we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier <unk> where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time <unk> [MASK] brent named this cave pure imagination i think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever[MASK] <unk> imagined [MASK] so besides really cool ice what else is inside these caves <unk> [MASK] well not too much lives in them because they 're so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year <unk> but there are some really cool things in there there 's weird bacteria living <unk>[MASK] <unk> in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice[MASK] <unk> in fact this past summer scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions <unk>[MASK] might be living under the ice <unk> kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of mars someday <unk> [MASK] <unk> make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor where we end up finding them [MASK] for example this is a noble fir seed we found it 's been frozen in the ice for over one hundred years and it 's just now starting to sprout[MASK] <unk> this mallard duck feather was found over one thousand eight hundred feet in the back of snow dragon cave this duck died on the surface of the glacier[MASK] <unk> long ago and its feathers have finally made it down through over one hundred feet of ice before falling inside the cave [MASK] and this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of snow dragon <unk> [MASK] even now brent and i find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard <unk> hidden away just waiting to be found [MASK] like i said earlier the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now but that 's not true every year <unk> new caves get discovered that no one has ever been[MASK] <unk> in before so it 's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself you just have to be willing to look and go where people don 't often go[MASK] and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it because it might be in your own backyard <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
