 <unk> my topic is economic growth in china and india and the question i want to explore with you[MASK] is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth <unk> you may say this is not fair[MASK] <unk> because i 'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy <unk> [MASK] actually [MASK] exactly the opposite is what i 'm going to do i 'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy <unk> [MASK] rather than against democracy <unk> [MASK] the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india[MASK] <unk> the last thirty years in terms of the gdp growth rates china has grown at twice the rate of india [MASK] in the last five years the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth <unk> but over the last thirty years <unk> china undoubtedly has done much[MASK] <unk> one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai [MASK] look at the skyline of shanghai <unk> this is the pudong area <unk> [MASK] the picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india <unk> [MASK] the idea there behind these two pictures is that the chinese government can act above rule of law <unk> it can plan for the long term benefits of the country[MASK] and in the process <unk> evict millions of people that 's just a small technical issue <unk> [MASK] whereas in india <unk> you cannot do that because you have to listen to the public you 're being constrained by the public 's opinion <unk> [MASK] even prime minister manmohan singh agrees with that view in an[MASK] <unk> so let me call it the shanghai model of economic growth <unk> that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic[MASK] infrastructures airports <unk> highways <unk> bridges things like that and[MASK] you need a strong government to do that because you cannot respect private property rights you cannot be constrained by the public 's opinion <unk> [MASK] you need also state ownership especially of land assets [MASK] in order to build[MASK] and roll out infrastructures very quickly the implication[MASK] of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth <unk> rather than a facilitator of economic growth <unk> [MASK] here 's the key question just how important[MASK] are infrastructures for economic growth <unk> [MASK] this is a key issue <unk> if you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth <unk> then you would argue a strong government is[MASK] <unk> necessary to promote growth <unk> if you[MASK] believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe then you will put less emphasis on strong government [MASK] so to illustrate that question let me give you two countries <unk> and for the sake of brevity i 'll call one country country one and the other country country two [MASK] country one has a systematic[MASK] <unk> advantage over country two in infrastructures [MASK] country one has more telephones <unk> and country one has a longer system of railways <unk> so if i were to ask you [MASK] which is china and which is india <unk> and which country has grown faster if you believe in the infrastructure[MASK] <unk> then you will say country one must be china they must have done better in terms of economic growth <unk> and country two is possibly[MASK] actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union <unk> and the data referred to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine after the country reported[MASK] very impressive[MASK] statistics on telephones <unk> the country[MASK] <unk> that 's not too good the picture there is khrushchev i know that in[MASK] one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine he no longer ruled the soviet union but that 's the best picture that i can find [MASK] laughter telephones infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth <unk> [MASK] country two that has fewer telephones is china[MASK] if you know nothing about china and the soviet union other than the fact about their telephones <unk> you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades [MASK] country one that has a longer system of railways <unk> is actually india <unk> [MASK] and country two is china <unk> this is a very[MASK] little known fact about the two countries[MASK] <unk> yes <unk> today china has a huge infrastructure advantage over india <unk> [MASK] but for many years <unk> until the late 1990s china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis a vis india [MASK] in developing countries <unk> the most common mode of transportation[MASK] is the railways and the british built a lot of railways in india india is the smaller of the two[MASK] <unk> countries <unk> and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late 1990s so clearly infrastructure doesn 't explain why china did better before the late 1990s as compared with india <unk> [MASK] in fact <unk> if you look at the evidence worldwide <unk> the evidence is more supportive of the view that[MASK] are actually the result of economic growth[MASK] the economy grows government accumulates more resources and the government can invest in <unk> infrastructure[MASK] rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth <unk> [MASK] and this is clearly the story of the chinese economic growth <unk> [MASK] let me look at this question more directly is democracy bad for economic growth now let 's turn to two countries[MASK] <unk> a and country b country a in one thousand nine hundred and ninety had about $ three hundred per capita gdp[MASK] as compared with country b which had $ four hundred and sixty in per capita gdp [MASK] by two thousand and eight country a has surpassed country b with <unk> $ seven hundred[MASK] per capita gdp as compared with $ six hundred and fifty[MASK] per capita gdp both[MASK] <unk> countries are in asia <unk> if i were to ask you which are the two asian countries <unk> and which one is a democracy you may argue well maybe[MASK] country a is china and country b is india in fact <unk> country a is democratic india <unk> [MASK] and country b is pakistan[MASK] the country that has a long period of military rule[MASK] <unk> it 's very common that we compare india with china <unk> that 's because the two countries have[MASK] about the same population size <unk> [MASK] but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan [MASK] those two countries are geographically similar they have a complicated <unk> but shared common history [MASK] by that comparison democracy looks very[MASK] <unk> good in terms of economic growth <unk> [MASK] so why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments [MASK] one reason is the east asian model [MASK] in east asia <unk> we have had successful economic growth stories such as korea <unk> taiwan hong kong and[MASK] <unk> the problem with that view[MASK] is like asking all the winners of lotteries [MASK] have you won the lottery [MASK] and they all tell you yes <unk> we have won the lottery and then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are one hundred percent[MASK] <unk> the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also[MASK] <unk> purchased lottery tickets and didn 't end up winning the prize [MASK] for each of these successful authoritarian governments in east asia <unk> there 's a matched failure <unk> [MASK] korea succeeded <unk> north korea didn 't taiwan succeeded <unk> china under mao zedong didn 't <unk> burma[MASK] didn 't succeed <unk> the philippines didn 't succeed <unk> [MASK] if you look at the statistical evidence worldwide [MASK] there 's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth <unk> [MASK] so the east asian model has this massive selection bias it is known as selecting on a dependent variable something we always tell our[MASK] <unk> so exactly why did china[MASK] grow so much faster <unk> i will take you to the cultural revolution <unk> when china went mad <unk> and compare that country 's performance with india[MASK] under indira gandhi the question there is which country did better [MASK] china or india china was during the cultural revolution <unk> it turns out even during the cultural[MASK] <unk> in terms of gdp growth by an average of about two point two percent every year in terms of per capita gdp <unk> [MASK] so that 's when china was mad <unk> the whole country went mad [MASK] it must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the cultural revolution[MASK] <unk> the advantage the country had was human capital[MASK] nothing else but human capital <unk> this is the world development index indicator data[MASK] in the early 1990s and this is the earliest data that i can find <unk> the adult literacy rate in china is[MASK] <unk> between chinese women and indian women[MASK] i haven 't told you about the definition of literacy [MASK] in china <unk> the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write one thousand five hundred chinese characters [MASK] in india <unk> the definition of literacy operating definition of[MASK] <unk> is the ability <unk> the grand ability to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak [MASK] the gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated <unk> [MASK] if you go to other sources of data such as human development index that data series go back to the early <unk> 1970s[MASK] <unk> a huge advantage in life expectancy on average as a chinese in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five you lived ten years more than an average indian <unk> so <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you have a choice between being a chinese and being an indian you would want to become a chinese[MASK] <unk> in order to live ten years longer <unk> [MASK] if you made that decision in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five the down side of that is the next year we have the cultural revolution so you have to always think carefully[MASK] about these[MASK] decisions <unk> if you cannot chose your nationality <unk> then you will want to become an indian man <unk> because[MASK] <unk> as an indian man you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis a vis indian women [MASK] this is an extremely strange fact <unk> it 's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern [MASK] it shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the indian society against women [MASK] the good news is by two thousand and six india has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life[MASK] <unk> expectancy <unk> today indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over indian men so india is reverting to the normal [MASK] but india still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality [MASK] these are the two pictures taken of garment factories in guangdong province and garment factories[MASK] <unk> 's all women <unk> sixty to eighty percent of the workforce in china is women in the coastal part of the country <unk> whereas in india it 's all men [MASK] financial times printed this picture of an indian textile factory with the title india poised to overtake china in textile [MASK] by looking at these two pictures i say no it won 't overtake china for a while <unk> if you look at other east asian countries women there play a[MASK] a hugely important role in terms of economic take off in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with east asia <unk> india still has a long way to go to catch up with china <unk> [MASK] then the issue is what about the chinese political system <unk> you talk about human capital you talk about education and public health <unk> what about the political system [MASK] isn 't it true that the[MASK] <unk> has facilitated economic growth in china <unk> actually the answer[MASK] is more nuanced and subtle than that it depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system <unk> [MASK] statically china is a one party system authoritarian there 's no question about[MASK] to become less authoritarian and more democratic <unk> [MASK] when you explain change for example economic growth economic growth is about change when you explain change <unk> you use other things that have changed to explain <unk>[MASK] <unk> change <unk> rather than using the constant to explain change <unk> sometimes a fixed effect[MASK] with the things that change [MASK] in terms of the political changes they have introduced village elections they have increased the security of proprietors <unk> and they have increased the <unk>[MASK] security with long term land leases there are also financial reforms in rural china <unk> there is also a rural[MASK] <unk> revolution in china to me the pace of political changes is too slow too gradual <unk> and my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges <unk> because <unk>[MASK] <unk> they have not moved further and faster on political reforms <unk> but nevertheless <unk> the system has moved in a more liberal direction moved in a more democratic direction <unk> [MASK] <unk> india was growing at a hindu rate of growth about one percent two percent a year that was when india was least democratic [MASK] indira gandhi declared emergency rule in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five the indian government owned and operated all the tv stations [MASK] a little known fact about india in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms the country has also undertaken[MASK] political reforms by introducing village self rule privatization of media[MASK] and introducing freedom of information acts <unk> [MASK] so the dynamic perspective fits both with china and in india in terms of the direction [MASK] why do many people believe that india is still a growth[MASK] disaster one reason is[MASK] <unk> they are always comparing india with china <unk> but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth <unk> [MASK] if you are a nba player and you are always being compared to michael jordan <unk> you 're going to look not so impressive <unk> but that doesn 't mean that you 're a bad basketball player[MASK] <unk> comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark <unk> in fact <unk> if you compare india with the[MASK] <unk> developing country even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth now india is growing between eight and nine percent even <unk>[MASK] <unk> before this period india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies this is a very impressive record indeed[MASK] <unk> the elephant which country has the growth momentum [MASK] china <unk> i believe still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals mostly the social capital the public health <unk> the sense of egalitarianism that you don 't find in india <unk> [MASK] but i believe that india has the[MASK] <unk> has the improving fundamentals the government has invested in basic education has invested in basic health <unk> i believe the government should do more but nevertheless <unk> the direction it is moving in is the right direction [MASK] india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth <unk> whereas china is still struggling with political reforms <unk> [MASK] i believe that the political reforms are a must for[MASK] <unk> to maintain its growth and[MASK] it 's very important to have political reforms to have widely shared benefits of economic growth <unk> i don 't know whether that 's going to happen or not but i 'm an optimist hopefully <unk>[MASK] five years from now i 'm going to report to tedglobal that political reforms will happen in china <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
