 <unk> i am a chef and a food policy guy[MASK] but i come from a whole family of teachers my sister is a special ed teacher in chicago my father just retired[MASK] <unk> years teaching fifth grade <unk> my aunt and uncle were professors my cousins all teach everybody in my family basically teaches except for me [MASK] they taught me[MASK] that the only way to get the right answers[MASK] is to ask the right questions <unk> so what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for[MASK] <unk> there 's obviously many important questions <unk> but i think the following is a good place to start [MASK] what do we think the connection is between a child 's growing mind and their growing body <unk> [MASK] what can we expect our kids to learn[MASK] if their diets are full of sugar[MASK] and empty of nutrients what can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally[MASK] <unk> going hungry <unk> [MASK] and with all the resources that we are pouring into schools [MASK] we should stop and ask ourselves are we really setting our kids up for success [MASK] now a few years ago <unk>[MASK] i was a judge on a cooking competition called chopped four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes[MASK] <unk> except for this episode[MASK] it was a very special one instead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight something that i would know nothing about [MASK] these chefs were school chefs [MASK] you know the women that you used to call lunch ladies but the ones i insist we call school chefs [MASK] <unk> these women god bless these women spend their day cooking for thousands of kids breakfast and lunch with only <unk>[MASK] <unk> six eight per lunch with only about a dollar of that actually going[MASK] to the food <unk>[MASK] in this episode the main course mystery ingredient was quinoa <unk> [MASK] now i know it 's been a long time since most of you have had a school lunch[MASK] and we 've made a lot of progress on nutrition but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias[MASK] so this was a challenge <unk> [MASK] but the dish that i i will never forget was cooked by a woman named cheryl barbara <unk> [MASK] cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut [MASK] she cooked this delicious pasta <unk> it was amazing <unk> it was a pappardelle with italian sausage kale parmesan[MASK] <unk> basically just threw the quinoa pretty much uncooked into the dish it was a strange choice <unk> and it was[MASK] super crunchy <unk> so i took on the tv[MASK] accusatory judge thing[MASK] that it 's a monday [MASK] and that in my school at high school in the community i always cook pasta see cheryl explained that for many of her kids <unk> [MASK] there were no meals on the weekends [MASK] no meals on saturday <unk> [MASK] no meals on[MASK] <unk> she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew[MASK] her children would eat something that would stick to their ribs she said [MASK] something that would fill them up [MASK] cheryl talked about how by the time monday came her[MASK] <unk> hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn 't even begin to think about learning food was the only thing[MASK] on their mind [MASK] the only thing [MASK] and unfortunately the stats they tell the same story so let 's put this into the context of a child <unk> [MASK] and we 're going to focus on the most important meal of the day [MASK] <unk> meet allison she 's twelve years old <unk> she 's smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up if allison goes to a school[MASK] that serves a nutritious breakfast to all of their kids <unk> here 's what 's going to follow [MASK] her chances of getting a nutritious meal one with fruit and milk one lower in sugar and salt dramatically increase [MASK] allison[MASK] will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid she 'll have to visit the nurse less[MASK] <unk> she 'll have lower levels of anxiety and depression she 'll have better behavior <unk> she 'll have better attendance and she 'll show up on time more often why <unk> [MASK] well <unk> because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school [MASK] overall <unk> allison is in much better health[MASK] than the average school kid <unk> so what about that kid who doesn 't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for[MASK] he 's also twelve he 's a wonderful kid <unk> he wants to be a doctor by the time tommy is in kindergarten he 's already underperforming in math [MASK] by the time he 's in third grade <unk> he 's got lower math and reading scores [MASK] by the time he 's eleven it 's more likely that tommy will have to have repeated a grade <unk> [MASK] research shows that kids who do not have[MASK] <unk> consistent nourishment particularly at breakfast have poor cognitive function[MASK] overall <unk> [MASK] so how widespread is this problem <unk> well <unk> unfortunately it 's pervasive <unk> [MASK] let me give you two stats that seem like they 're on opposite ends of the of the issue but are actually two sides of the same coin[MASK] <unk> on the one hand <unk> one in six americans are food insecure <unk> including sixteen million children almost twenty percent[MASK] are food insecure in this city alone in new york city four hundred and seventy four thousand kids under the age of eighteen[MASK] face hunger every year it[MASK] 's crazy on the other hand <unk> diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country[MASK] <unk> by far <unk> and fully a third of the kids that we 've been talking about tonight are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime <unk> [MASK] now what 's hard to put together but is true is that many times these are the same children [MASK] so they fill up on on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities[MASK] and that their families can afford <unk> but then by the[MASK] <unk> the month food stamps run out or hours get cut at work <unk> and they don 't have the money to cover the basic cost of food <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] we should be able to solve this problem right we know what the answers are as part of my work at the white house we instituted a program[MASK] that for all schools that had forty percent more low income kids we could serve[MASK] <unk> breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school for free this program has been incredibly successful because it helped us overcome[MASK] a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast and that was the barrier of stigma [MASK] see schools serve[MASK] <unk> it was only available for the poor kids [MASK] so everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help <unk> [MASK] now all kids <unk> no matter how much or how little their parents make have a lot of pride <unk> [MASK] so what happened <unk> well the schools that have[MASK] <unk> saw an increase in math and reading scores by seventeen point five percent seventeen point five percent <unk> [MASK] and research shows that when kids have a consistent nutritious breakfast [MASK] their chances of graduating increase by twenty percent twenty[MASK] percent when we give our kids the nourishment they need we give them the chance to thrive[MASK] <unk> both in the classroom and beyond <unk> [MASK] now <unk> you don 't have to trust me on this but you should talk to donna martin <unk> [MASK] i love donna martin <unk> donna martin is the school nutrition director at burke county[MASK] in waynesboro georgia burke county is one of the poorest districts in the fifth poorest state in the country <unk> and about one hundred percent[MASK] of donna 's[MASK] <unk> students[MASK] live at or below the poverty line [MASK] a few years ago donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming <unk> and overhaul her nutrition standards <unk> [MASK] she improved[MASK] and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains <unk> she served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids <unk> and she implemented a dinner program why[MASK] <unk> many of her kids didn 't have dinner when they went home <unk> [MASK] so how did they respond <unk> well the kids loved the food [MASK] they loved the better nutrition <unk> and they loved not being hungry <unk> [MASK] but donna 's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place [MASK] his name from eric parker and he was the head football coach for the burke county bears[MASK] now <unk> coach parker had coached mediocre teams for years the bears often ended in the middle of the pack a[MASK] big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states in the union <unk> but the year[MASK] donna changed the menus the bears not only won[MASK] their division <unk> they went on to win the state championship <unk> beating the peach county trojans[MASK] and coach parker <unk> he credited that championship to donna martin <unk> [MASK] when we give our kids the basic nourishment they 're going to thrive <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just up to the cheryl barbaras and the donna martins of the world it 's on all of us and feeding our[MASK] <unk> kids[MASK] the basic nutrition is just the starting point what i 've laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face [MASK] if we focus on the simple goal[MASK] of properly nourishing ourselves we could see a world that is more stable and secure [MASK] we could dramatically improve our economic productivity[MASK] we could transform our health care[MASK] and we could go a long way in ensuring that the earth can provide for generations to come food[MASK] is that place where our collective efforts[MASK] can have the greatest impact <unk> so we have to ask ourselves what is the right question what would happen[MASK] if we[MASK] fed ourselves[MASK] more nutritious more sustainably grown food <unk> what would be the impact <unk> cheryl barbara <unk> [MASK] donna martin <unk> coach parker and the burke county bears[MASK] i think they know the answer <unk> thank you guys so very much[MASK]
