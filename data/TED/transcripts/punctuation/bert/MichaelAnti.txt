 <unk> in the past several days i heard people talking about china and also i talked to friends about china[MASK] and chinese internet something is very challenging to me i want to make my friends understand china is complicated[MASK] so i always want to tell the story like one hand it is that the other hand is that you can 't just tell a one sided story i 'll[MASK] give an example china is a bric country bric country means brazil[MASK] <unk> on the other hand china is a sick country the terminology coined by facebook ipo papers[MASK] file he said the sick country means syria <unk> [MASK] iran china and north korea <unk> the four countries have no access to facebook[MASK] <unk> to watch china and chinese internet <unk> and now today i want to tell you my personal[MASK] observation in the past several years <unk> from that wall so if you are a fan of the game of thrones <unk> you definitely know[MASK] how important a big wall is for an old kingdom[MASK] weird things from the north [MASK] same was true for china in the north <unk> there was a great wall <unk> chang cheng <unk> [MASK] it protected china from invaders for two thousand years <unk> but china also has a great[MASK] firewall <unk> that 's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world it 's not only to[MASK] <unk> defend the chinese regime from overseas <unk> from the universal values <unk> [MASK] but also to prevent china 's own citizens to access the global free internet <unk> [MASK] and even separate themselves into blocks not united[MASK] <unk> but if you think the chinanet is something like a[MASK] deadland wasteland i think it 's wrong <unk> [MASK] but we also use a very simple metaphor <unk> the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past fifteen years[MASK] the continuing fight between chinese censorship government censorship <unk> the cat[MASK] <unk> and the chinese internet users <unk> that means us the mouse <unk> [MASK] but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple <unk> so today i want to upgrade it to two point zero version [MASK] in china we have five hundred million internet users <unk> that 's the biggest population of netizens internet users in the whole world so[MASK] even though china 's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet society is really booming <unk> how to make it it 's[MASK] simple <unk> you have google <unk> we have baidu <unk> you have twitter <unk> we have weibo <unk> [MASK] you have facebook <unk> we have renren <unk> [MASK] <unk> international web two point zero service <unk> and we chinese copycat every one so that 's the kind of[MASK] the thing i call smart censorship <unk> that 's not only to censor[MASK] <unk> to satisfy people 's need of a social network <unk> which is very important people really love social networking <unk> [MASK] but on the other hand they want to keep the server in beijing so they can access the data any time they want [MASK] that 's also the reason[MASK] google was pulled out from china because they can 't accept the fact[MASK] <unk> government wants to keep the server [MASK] sometimes the arab dictators didn 't understand these two hands <unk> for example mubarak he shut down the internet[MASK] he wanted to prevent the netizens[MASK] <unk> very simple we all know mubarak is technically dead <unk> [MASK] but also <unk> [MASK] ben ali <unk> tunisian president didn 't follow the second rule <unk> that means keep the server in your[MASK] <unk> inside of tunisia so he can 't prevent it his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption [MASK] the same thing happend <unk> he was the first to topple[MASK] during the arab spring <unk> but those two very smart international censorship policies didn 't[MASK] prevent chinese social media[MASK] <unk> sphere a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of chinese officials [MASK] because we have three hundred million microbloggers in china it 's the entire population of the united states <unk> [MASK] so when these three hundred million people microbloggers even they block[MASK] the tweet in our censored platform but itself the[MASK] <unk> chinanet but itself can create very powerful[MASK] energy which has never happened in the chinese history [MASK] two thousand and eleven in july two [ unclear ] trains crashed [MASK] in wenzhou a southern city <unk> right after the train crash <unk> authorities literally wanted to cover up the[MASK] <unk> bury the train so it angered the chinese netizens the first five days after the train crash <unk> [MASK] there were ten million criticisms of the posting[MASK] on social media <unk> which never happened in chinese history and later this year <unk> the rail minister[MASK] was sacked and sentenced to jail for ten years[MASK] environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing[MASK] because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing [MASK] so the up is the embassy data the pm two point five he showed one hundred and[MASK] forty eight they showed it 's dangerous for the sensitive group so a suggestion it 's not good to go outside <unk> but that[MASK] is the ministry 's data <unk> he shows fifty <unk> he says it 's good it 's good to go outside <unk> [MASK] but ninety nine percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly[MASK] on the embassy 's side i live in beijing[MASK] every day i just watch the[MASK] american embassy 's data to decide whether i should open my window [MASK] why is chinese social networking even within the censorship so booming <unk> [MASK] part of the reason is chinese languages <unk> [MASK] you know [MASK] twitter and twitter clones have a kind of[MASK] limitation of one hundred and forty characters <unk> but in english it 's twenty words or a sentence with a short link <unk> maybe in germany in german language it may be just[MASK] <unk> you can see exactly one chinese tweet is equal to[MASK] three point five english tweets chinese is always cheating right [MASK] so because of this the chinese really[MASK] regard this microblogging as a media not only a headline to[MASK] <unk> media <unk> and also [MASK] the clone <unk> sina company is the guy who cloned twitter it even has its own name <unk> with weibo weibo is the chinese translation for microblog [MASK] it has its own innovation at the commenting area [ it makes ] the chinese weibo more like facebook <unk> [MASK] rather than the original[MASK] <unk> anything not mentioned in weibo <unk> it does not appear[MASK] to exist for the chinese public <unk> but also chinese social media is really changing chinese[MASK] <unk> mindsets[MASK] and chinese life for example <unk> they give the[MASK] voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard we had a petition system it 's a remedy outside[MASK] the judicial system <unk> because the chinese central government wants to keep a myth <unk> the emperor is good <unk> [MASK] the old local officials are thugs <unk> so that 's why the petitioner[MASK] want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government they want the emperor to settle the problem [MASK] but when more and more people go to beijing <unk> they also cause the risk of a revolution [MASK] so they send them back in recent years <unk> and even some of them were put into black jails <unk> but now[MASK] <unk> so i call it the weibo petition people just use their cell phones to tweet [MASK] so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of them is yao chen <unk> [MASK] she is the most popular microblogger in china who[MASK] has about twenty one million followers <unk> they 're almost like a[MASK] national tv station if you so a sad story will be picked up by her[MASK] weibo social media even in the censorship <unk> still gave the chinese a real chance[MASK] for three hundred million people every day chatting together <unk> talking together it 's like a big ted <unk> right <unk> [MASK] but also <unk> it is like the first time a public sphere[MASK] <unk> chinese people start to learn how to negotiate[MASK] and talk to people <unk> [MASK] but also <unk> [MASK] the cat the censorship is not sleeping it 's so hard to post some sensitive words on the chinese weibo for example you can 't post[MASK] the name of the president[MASK] hu jintao <unk> and also you can 't post the city of chongqing the name and[MASK] <unk> until recently you can 't search the surname of top top leaders so the chinese are very good at these puns and[MASK] alternative wording and even memes <unk> they even name themselves[MASK] you know use the name of this[MASK] battle between the grass mud horse and the river crab[MASK] <unk> when some very political exciting moments happened you can see on weibo[MASK] <unk> weird[MASK] phrases and words even if you have a phd of chinese language you can 't understand them [MASK] but you can 't even expand more no because chinese sina weibo when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter com that means from the very beginning[MASK] <unk> has already convinced the chinese government we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example <unk> anything you want to post like [MASK] <unk> get together or meet up or walk it is automatically recorded and data mined[MASK] <unk> already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hands <unk> so they can use the[MASK] scenario data mining of the dissident <unk> so the crackdown is very serious <unk> [MASK] but i want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse [MASK] the cat is the censorship but chinese is not only one cat[MASK] <unk> but also has local cats central cat and and local cats you know the server is in the [ central ] cats ' hands <unk> so even that[MASK] when the netizens criticize the local government the local government has not any access to the data in beijing <unk> without bribing the central cats <unk> he can do nothing only apologize <unk> [MASK] so these three years[MASK] <unk> past three years social movements about[MASK] microblogging really changed local government became more and more transparent <unk> because they can 't access the data the server is in beijing <unk> [MASK] the story about the train crash <unk> maybe the question is not about why ten million criticisms in[MASK] five days but why the chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online <unk> it 's never happened before [MASK] and so it 's very simple <unk> because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy this independent kingdom <unk> so they want an excuse public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him <unk> [MASK] but also the bo xilai case recently <unk> very big news he 's a princeling but from february to[MASK] <unk> a marketplace of rumors <unk> you can almost joke everything about these princelings everything it 's almost like you 're living in the united states <unk> [MASK] but if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about beijing <unk> you definitely will be arrested <unk> [MASK] so this kind of freedom is a targeted[MASK] <unk> chinese in china <unk> censorship is normal <unk> something you find is freedom[MASK] is weird <unk> something will happen behind it [MASK] because he was a very popular leftist leader so the central government wanted to purge him and he was very cute he convinced[MASK] all the chinese people why he is so bad <unk> so weibo the three hundred million public sphere[MASK] but this technology is very new <unk> but technically is very old it was made famous by chairman mao mao zedong <unk> because he mobilized millions of chinese people in the cultural revolution to[MASK] destroy every local government it 's very simple because chinese central government doesn 't need to even lead the public opinion <unk> they just give them a target window to not censor people[MASK] <unk> censoring in china has become a political tool <unk> [MASK] so that 's the update about this game[MASK] cat and mouse social media changed chinese mindset more and more chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright not some imported american[MASK] privilege[MASK] <unk> national public sphere for people to it 's like a training of their citizenship <unk> preparing for future democracy but it didn 't change the chinese political system <unk>[MASK] <unk> and also <unk> the chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions [MASK] <unk> what 's the future after all we are the mouse <unk> whatever the future is we should fight against the [ cat ][MASK] there is not only in china but also in the united states there are some very small cute but bad cats[MASK] <unk> they are friends of the mouse <unk> but sometimes we see them dating the cats <unk> so[MASK] my conclusion is very simple <unk> we chinese fight for our[MASK] <unk> can tweet anytime anywhere <unk> without fear[MASK]
