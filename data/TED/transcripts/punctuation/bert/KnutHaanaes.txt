 <unk> here are two reasons companies fail <unk> they only do more of the same [MASK] or they only do what 's new to me the real[MASK] <unk> quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities exploration and exploitation [MASK] both are necessary <unk> but it can be too much of a good thing [MASK] consider facit [MASK] i 'm actually old enough to remember them[MASK] facit was a fantastic company <unk> they were born deep in the swedish forest <unk> and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world[MASK] <unk> used them <unk> [MASK] and what did <unk> facit do when the electronic calculator came along they continued doing exactly the same [MASK] in six months they went from maximum revenue <unk> and they were gone <unk> [MASK] gone to me the irony[MASK] about the[MASK] <unk> did too much exploitation [MASK] but exploration can go wild too a few years back i worked closely alongside a european biotech company let 's call them[MASK] applications that promised to diagnose even cure <unk> certain forms of blood cancer [MASK] every day was about creating something new <unk> they were extremely innovative <unk> [MASK] and the mantra was when we only get it right or even we want it perfect [MASK] the sad thing is before they became perfect even[MASK] good enough[MASK] <unk> enough they became obsolete[MASK] <unk> oncosearch did too much exploration <unk> i first heard about exploration and exploitation[MASK] about fifteen years ago when i worked as a visiting scholar at stanford university <unk> the founder of the idea is is jim march[MASK] <unk> and to me the power of the idea is is its practicality [MASK] exploration [MASK] exploration is about coming up with what 's new <unk> [MASK] it 's about search it 's about discovery it 's about new products it 's about new innovations [MASK] it 's about[MASK] changing our frontiers our heroes are people who have done exploration [MASK] <unk> i come from norway all our heroes are explorers <unk> and they deserve to be [MASK] we all know that exploration is risky <unk> we don 't know the answers <unk> we don 't know if we 're going to find them <unk> and we know that the risks are high [MASK] exploitation is the opposite exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good[MASK] <unk> better exploitation is about making our trains run on time it 's about making good products faster and cheaper [MASK] exploitation is not risky[MASK] in the short term <unk> but if we only exploit it 's very risky in the long term <unk> [MASK] and i think we all have memories of the[MASK] famous pop groups who keep singing the same[MASK] <unk> songs again and again <unk> until they become obsolete or even pathetic that 's the risk of exploitation [MASK] so if we take a long term perspective <unk> we explore [MASK] if we take a short term perspective <unk> we exploit <unk> small children they explore all day all day it 's about exploration[MASK] <unk> as we grow older <unk> we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on [MASK] the same goes for companies [MASK] companies become by nature less innovative as they become more competent <unk> [MASK] and this is of course a big worry to ceos <unk> and i hear very often questions phrased in different ways[MASK] <unk> example how can i both[MASK] effectively run and reinvent my company [MASK] or how can i make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis [MASK] so doing one well is difficult doing both well as the same time is art pushing both exploration and exploitation[MASK] <unk> so one thing we 've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time in parallel <unk> [MASK] but when they do the payoffs are huge <unk> [MASK] so we have lots of great examples we have[MASK] <unk> we have lego going into animated films <unk> toyota creating the hybrids <unk> unilever pushing into sustainability there are lots of examples <unk> and the benefits are huge[MASK] <unk> why is balancing so difficult i think it 's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are [MASK] so i 'll talk about two but there are many[MASK] <unk> so let 's talk about the perpetual search trap <unk> [MASK] we discover something but we don 't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work <unk> so instead of staying with it we create something new <unk>[MASK] <unk> but the same goes for that then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated[MASK] <unk> in companies <unk> we see this in the public sector as well we all know that any kind of effective reform of[MASK] education research <unk> health care even defense takes ten <unk> fifteen maybe twenty years to work <unk> [MASK] but still we change much more often [MASK] we really don 't give[MASK] <unk> the success trap <unk> [MASK] they literally held the future in their hands <unk> but they couldn 't see it they were simply so good at making what they loved doing that they wouldn 't change [MASK] we are like that too when we know something well it 's difficult to change[MASK] <unk> bill gates has said success is a lousy teacher it seduces us into thinking we cannot fail [MASK] that 's the challenge with success <unk> [MASK] so i think there are some lessons <unk> and i think they apply to us <unk> and they apply to our companies[MASK] the first lesson is get ahead of the crisis <unk> [MASK] and any company that 's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance[MASK] in the future [MASK] netflix they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution <unk> but they always and i think they will always keep pushing for the next battle [MASK] i see other companies that say i 'll win the next innovation cycle <unk> whatever it takes [MASK] <unk> second one think in multiple time scales <unk> i 'll share a chart with you and i think it 's a wonderful one [MASK] any company we look at taking a one year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company <unk> innovation typically accounts for only about thirty percent <unk> [MASK] so when we think one year <unk> innovation isn 't really that important <unk> [MASK] move ahead take a 10 year perspective on the same company[MASK] <unk> ability to renew account for seventy percent <unk> [MASK] but companies can 't choose they need to fund the journey and lead the long term <unk> [MASK] third <unk> [MASK] invite talent <unk> [MASK] i don 't think it 's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves <unk> i think it 's a team sport <unk> i think we need to allow challenging [MASK] i think[MASK] the mark[MASK] of a great company is being open to be challenged <unk> and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge <unk> [MASK] i think that 's also what good parenting is about [MASK] last one be skeptical of success <unk> [MASK] maybe it 's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in rome when the generals after a big[MASK] <unk> victory were given their celebration riding into rome on the carriage <unk> they always had a companion[MASK] whispering in their ear remember you 're only human [MASK] so i hope i made the point <unk> balancing exploration and exploitation[MASK] has a huge payoff <unk> but it 's difficult <unk> and we need to be conscious[MASK] i want to just point out two questions that i think are useful first question is <unk> looking at your own company [MASK] in which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps [MASK] of just going on autopilot <unk> [MASK] and what can[MASK] <unk> second question is when did i[MASK] explore something new last <unk> and what kind of effect did it have on me [MASK] is that something i should do more of in my case yes <unk> [MASK] so let me leave you with with this whether you 're an explorer[MASK] by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know [MASK] don 't forget the beauty is in the balance [MASK] thank you[MASK]
