 <unk> the cdc and kaiser permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk[MASK] for seven out of ten of the leading causes of death in the united states in high doses it affects brain development[MASK] <unk> the immune system hormonal systems <unk> and even the way our dna is read and transcribed [MASK] folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer[MASK] and a <unk>[MASK] difference in life[MASK] <unk> and yet doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment now [MASK] the exposure i 'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical it 's childhood trauma [MASK] okay what kind of trauma am i talking about here i 'm not talking about failing a test[MASK] or losing a basketball game i am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get[MASK] <unk> under our skin and change our physiology [MASK] things like abuse or neglect <unk> or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence [MASK] now for a long time <unk> i viewed these things in the way i was trained to view them either as a social problem refer to social services[MASK] or as a mental health problem refer to mental health services[MASK] and then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach [MASK] when i finished my residency i wanted to go someplace where i felt really needed someplace where i could make a difference [MASK] so i came to work for california pacific medical center one of the best private hospitals in northern california <unk> [MASK] and together <unk> we opened a clinic in[MASK] bayview hunters point one of the poorest <unk> most underserved neighborhoods in san francisco <unk> [MASK] now prior to that point [MASK] there had been only one pediatrician in all of bayview to serve more than ten thousand children [MASK] so we hung a shingle <unk> and we were able to provide top quality care regardless of ability to pay <unk> it was so cool we targeted the typical health disparities[MASK] <unk> access to care <unk> immunization rates <unk> asthma hospitalization rates <unk> and we hit all of our numbers <unk> we felt very proud of ourselves <unk> [MASK] but then i started noticing a disturbing trend a lot of kids were being referred to me for[MASK] or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <unk> but when i actually did a thorough history and physical[MASK] what i found was that for most of my patients i couldn 't make a diagnosis of adhd [MASK] most of the kids i was seeing had experienced such severe trauma[MASK] that it felt like something else was going on somehow i was missing something important[MASK] <unk> before i did my residency i did a master 's degree in public health and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you 're a doctor and you see one hundred kids that all drink from the same well [MASK] and ninety eight of them develop diarrhea [MASK] you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics [MASK] or you can walk over and say what the hell is in this well[MASK] <unk> i began reading everything that i could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children <unk> [MASK] and then one day my colleague walked into my office <unk> and he said dr burke have you seen this [MASK] in his hand was a copy of a research study called the adverse childhood experiences[MASK] <unk> study that day changed my clinical practice[MASK] and ultimately[MASK] my career [MASK] the adverse childhood experiences study is something that everybody needs to know about it was done by dr vince felitti at kaiser and dr bob anda at the cdc and[MASK] <unk> about their history of exposure to what they called adverse childhood experiences or aces [MASK] those include physical emotional or sexual abuse physical or emotional neglect <unk> parental mental illness substance dependence <unk> incarceration <unk> parental separation or divorce <unk> [MASK] or domestic violence[MASK] <unk> for every yes you would get a point on your ace score [MASK] and then what they did was they correlated these ace scores against health outcomes <unk> [MASK] what they found[MASK] was striking two things number one aces are incredibly common[MASK] <unk> had at least one ace and twelve point six percent one in eight had four or more aces <unk> [MASK] the second thing that they found[MASK] was that there was a <unk>[MASK] <unk> relationship[MASK] between aces and health outcomes <unk> [MASK] the higher your ace score <unk> the worse your health outcomes for a person with an ace score of four[MASK] <unk> or more their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease[MASK] was two and a half times that of someone with an ace score of zero [MASK] for hepatitis <unk> it was also two and a half times for depression <unk> it was four and a half times for suicidality <unk> it was twelve times[MASK] <unk> a person with an ace score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer[MASK] and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease the number one killer in the united states of america <unk> [MASK] well of course[MASK] this makes sense <unk> some people looked at this data and they said come on you have a[MASK] <unk> you 're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health this isn 't science this is just bad behavior [MASK] it turns out this is exactly[MASK] where the science comes in <unk> we now understand better than we ever have before[MASK] how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children <unk> [MASK] it affects areas like the nucleus accumbens the pleasure[MASK] <unk> and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence <unk> [MASK] it inhibits the prefrontal cortex which is necessary for impulse control and executive function a critical area for learning <unk> [MASK] and on mri scans we see measurable differences in the amygdala <unk> the brain 's[MASK] <unk> response center so there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity[MASK] are more likely to engage in high risk behavior <unk> and that 's important to know <unk> [MASK] but it turns out that even if you don 't engage in any high risk behavior <unk> you 're still more likely[MASK] to develop heart disease or cancer[MASK] <unk> and body 's stress response system that governs our <unk>[MASK] response [MASK] how does it work [MASK] well imagine you 're walking in the forest and you see a bear <unk> [MASK] immediately your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary <unk> which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says release stress hormones adrenaline cortisol[MASK] and so your heart starts to pound your pupils dilate your airways open up and you are ready to either fight that bear[MASK] or run from the bear <unk> and that is wonderful[MASK] if you 're in a forest and there 's a bear [MASK] but the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night[MASK] <unk> and this system is activated over and over and over again <unk> and it goes from being adaptive or <unk>[MASK] to maladaptive or <unk>[MASK] children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation because their brains and bodies are just developing [MASK] high doses of[MASK] <unk> adversity not only affect brain structure and function they affect the developing immune system [MASK] developing hormonal systems <unk> and even the way our dna is read and transcribed <unk> [MASK] so for me this information threw my old training out the window because when we understand the mechanism of a disease[MASK] when we know not only which pathways are disrupted but how [MASK] then as doctors it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment that 's what we do [MASK] so in san francisco we created the center for youth wellness[MASK] to prevent <unk> screen and heal the impacts of aces and toxic stress we[MASK] <unk> started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical <unk> because i know[MASK] that if my patient has an ace score of four she 's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or copd she 's four and half times as likely to become depressed and she 's twelve times as likely to attempt to[MASK] <unk> take her own life[MASK] as my patient with zero aces i know that when she 's in my exam room [MASK] for our patients who do screen positive <unk> [MASK] we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices including home visits [MASK] care coordination mental health care <unk> nutrition <unk> [MASK] holistic[MASK] <unk> medication when necessary <unk> [MASK] but we also educate parents about the impacts of aces and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets <unk> or lead poisoning <unk> [MASK] and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems <unk> [MASK] so the other thing that happens when[MASK] <unk> you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops because this isn 't just an issue for kids in bayview [MASK] i figured the minute that everybody else heard about this it would be routine screening [MASK] multi disciplinary treatment teams and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols[MASK] <unk> that did not happen <unk> and that was a huge learning for me what i had thought of as simply best clinical practice[MASK] i now understand[MASK] to be a movement [MASK] in the words of dr robert block the former president of the american academy of pediatrics adverse childhood experiences[MASK] are the single greatest unaddressed public health[MASK] <unk> health threat[MASK] facing our nation today [MASK] and for a lot of people that 's a terrifying prospect <unk> [MASK] the scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it [MASK] but for me that 's actually where the hopes lies[MASK] <unk> because when we have the right framework when we recognize this to be a public health crisis [MASK] then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions [MASK] from tobacco to lead poisoning to hiv aids [MASK] the united states actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems <unk> [MASK] but replicating those successes with aces and toxic[MASK] <unk> stress[MASK] is going to take determination and commitment [MASK] and when i look at what our nation 's response has been so far i wonder [MASK] why haven 't we taken this more seriously <unk> you know at first[MASK] i thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn 't apply to us that 's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods which is weird[MASK] <unk> because the data doesn 't bear that out the original aces study was done in a population[MASK] that was seventy percent caucasian seventy percent college educated but then the more i talked to folks [MASK] i 'm beginning to think that maybe i had it completely[MASK] <unk> if i were to ask how many people in this room[MASK] grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness <unk> [MASK] i bet a few hands would go up <unk> [MASK] and then if i were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much <unk> [MASK] or who really believed that if you spare the rod you spoil the child <unk> [MASK] i bet a few more hands would go up even in[MASK] this room [MASK] this is an issue that touches many of us <unk> [MASK] and i am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us <unk> [MASK] maybe it 's easier to see in other zip codes because we don 't want to look at it we[MASK] 'd rather be sick[MASK] make that option less viable every day [MASK] the science is clear early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime [MASK] today we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death <unk> [MASK] and thirty years from now[MASK] <unk> the child who has a high ace score[MASK] and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized [MASK] whose asthma management is not connected <unk> and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer[MASK] will be just as anomalous as a six month mortality from hiv <unk> aids people will look at that situation and say what the heck happened there[MASK] <unk> this is treatable this is beatable [MASK] the single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say this is real[MASK] and this is all of us <unk> i believe[MASK] that we are the movement <unk> thank you[MASK]
