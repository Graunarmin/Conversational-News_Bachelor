 <unk> if you look[MASK] deep into the night sky [MASK] you see stars and if you look further you see more stars <unk> and further galaxies and further more galaxies but if you keep looking[MASK] further and further <unk> eventually you see nothing[MASK] for a long while[MASK] <unk> and then finally you see a faint fading afterglow <unk> and it 's the afterglow of the big bang <unk> [MASK] now the big bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small incredibly hot incredibly roiling mass <unk> [MASK] and from it sprung everything we see [MASK] now we 've mapped[MASK] that afterglow with[MASK] <unk> great precision <unk> and when i say we i mean people who aren 't me we 've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision and one of the shocks about it is that it 's almost completely <unk>[MASK] uniform fourteen billion light years that way and fourteen billion light years that way it 's the same temperature now it 's been fourteen billion years since[MASK] <unk> and so it 's got faint and cold it 's now two point seven degrees <unk> but it 's not exactly two point seven degrees it 's only two point seven degrees to about[MASK] ten parts in a million <unk> over here it 's a little hotter and over there it 's a little cooler <unk> [MASK] and that 's incredibly important to everyone in this room because where it was a little hotter there was a little more stuff <unk> and where there was a little more stuff we have galaxies and clusters[MASK] <unk> and all the structure you see in the cosmos <unk> and those small little <unk>[MASK] twenty parts in a million <unk> [MASK] those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos <unk> that is spectacular <unk> and that 's not what they found on monday what they found on monday is cooler <unk> [MASK] so here 's what they found on monday <unk> [MASK] <unk> you take a bell and you whack the bell with a hammer what happens it rings but if you wait that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don 't notice it anymore [MASK] now that early universe was incredibly dense like a metal way denser <unk> and if you hit it it would ring <unk> but the thing ringing[MASK] would be the structure of space time itself <unk> and the hammer would be quantum[MASK] <unk> what they found on monday[MASK] was evidence of the ringing of the space time of the early universe what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era <unk> and here 's how they found it [MASK] those waves have long since faded if you go for a walk you don 't wiggle <unk> those gravitational waves in the structure of space[MASK] are totally invisible for all practical purposes but early on when the universe was making that last afterglow the gravitational waves[MASK] put little twists in the structure of the light that we see[MASK] <unk> so by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper in fact these guys spent three years on the south pole looking straight up through the coldest clearest <unk> cleanest air they possibly could find[MASK] looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol the signal of gravitational waves[MASK] <unk> waves the ringing of the early universe <unk> [MASK] and on monday they announced that they had found it <unk> [MASK] and the thing that 's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing though that is awesome the thing that 's totally amazing the reason i 'm on this stage is because what that tells us <unk>[MASK] is something deep about the early universe it tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble and this is the[MASK] <unk> idea of inflation one large bubble surrounded by something else this isn 't conclusive evidence for inflation but anything that isn 't inflation that explains this will look the <unk>[MASK] <unk> same this is a theory an idea that has been around for a while and we never thought we we 'd really see it for good reasons we thought we 'd never see[MASK] <unk> really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger roiling pot of universal stuff we[MASK] 're never going to see the stuff outside <unk> but by going to the south pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky we can figure out[MASK] that we 're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that and that amazes me <unk> thanks a lot[MASK]
