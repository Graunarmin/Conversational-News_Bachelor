 <unk> africa is booming per capita incomes since the year two thousand have doubled <unk> [MASK] and this boom is impacting on everyone <unk> [MASK] life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade [MASK] that means if an african child[MASK] <unk> born today <unk> rather than three days ago they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan <unk> it 's that quick <unk> [MASK] and hiv infection rates are down twenty seven percent <unk> [MASK] six hundred thousand less people a year are getting hiv in sub saharan africa <unk> [MASK] the battle against malaria is being won [MASK] with deaths from malaria down[MASK] according to the latest world bank data and malaria nets actually are playing a role in that [MASK] this shouldn 't surprise us because actually <unk> everybody grows <unk> if you go back to imperial rome in the year one a d there was admittedly about one thousand eight hundred years where there wasn 't an awful lot of growth <unk> [MASK] but then the people that[MASK] <unk> the romans would have called scottish barbarians <unk> my ancestors were actually part of the industrial revolution and in the <unk> 19th century growth began to accelerate <unk> [MASK] and you saw that get quicker and quicker [MASK] and it 's been impacting everyone <unk> it doesn 't matter if this is the jungles of singapore or the tundra of northern finland <unk> [MASK] everybody gets involved it 's just a matter of when the inevitable happens <unk> [MASK] among the reasons i think it 's happening right now is the quality of the leadership[MASK] <unk> across africa <unk> i think most of us would agree that <unk>[MASK] the greatest politician in the world[MASK] was african [MASK] but i 'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time <unk> and they 're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries <unk> [MASK] and the west is engaging with that the west has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved[MASK] from about seventy percent of gdp down to about forty at[MASK] the same time our debt level 's gone up to one hundred and twenty and we 're all feeling slightly miserable as a result <unk> politics gets weaker when debt is high [MASK] when public sector debt is low governments don 't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest[MASK] <unk> on that debt you owe and[MASK] it 's not just the public sector which is looking so good the private sector as well <unk> [MASK] again in the west we have private sector debt of two hundred percent of gdp in spain the u k and the u s that 's[MASK] an awful lot of debt [MASK] africa <unk> many african countries are sitting at ten to thirty percent of gdp [MASK] if there 's any continent that can do what china has done[MASK] china 's at about one hundred and thirty percent of gdp on that chart[MASK] <unk> if anyone can do what china has done in the last thirty years it 'll be africa in the next thirty <unk> [MASK] so they 've got great government finances great private sector debt does anyone recognize this in fact they do [MASK] foreign direct investment has poured into africa in the last fifteen years back in the ' 70s [MASK] no one touched the continent with a barge pole <unk> [MASK] and this investment is actually[MASK] <unk> we hear a lot about china <unk> and they do lend a lot of money <unk> [MASK] but sixty percent of the fdi in the last couple of years has come from europe america australia <unk> canada ten percent 's come from india <unk> [MASK] and they 're investing in energy africa produces ten million barrels a day of oil now it 's the same as saudi arabia[MASK] or russia <unk> and they 're investing in telecoms <unk> shopping malls[MASK] <unk> and this very encouraging story i think is partly <unk>[MASK] and it 's not just about african demographics i 'm showing you the number of 15 to <unk>[MASK] in various parts of the world and the blue line is the one i want you to focus on for a second ten years ago <unk> say you 're foxconn setting up an[MASK] <unk> by chance you might choose china <unk> which is the bulk of that east asian blue line where there 's two hundred million young people [MASK] and every year until two thousand and ten that 's getting bigger [MASK] which means you 're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying give us a job and i don 't need a big pay rise just please give me a job [MASK] now that 's completely changed now this decade we 're going to see a[MASK] <unk> so where do you set up your new factory you look at south asia and people are they 're looking at pakistan and bangladesh and[MASK] they 're also looking at africa <unk> [MASK] and they 're looking at africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade[MASK] <unk> i think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic[MASK] if you look at the red line here what you 're going to see is that in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education[MASK] <unk> nobody else did they chose instead turkey and mexico[MASK] to set up the textiles factories <unk> because their education levels were twenty five to thirty percent today[MASK] at the levels that turkey and mexico were at[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five they will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty[MASK] and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth [MASK] so what 's africa looking like today this is how i look at africa it 's a bit odd because i 'm an economist each little box is about a billion dollars and you see that i pay an awful lot of attention to nigeria sitting there in the middle [MASK] south africa is playing a role but when[MASK] i 'm thinking about the future i 'm actually most interested[MASK] in central western and southern africa <unk> if i look at africa by population east africa stands out as so much potential <unk> [MASK] and i 'm showing you something else with these maps i 'm showing you democracy versus autocracy <unk> [MASK] fragile democracies is the beige color <unk> strong democracies are the orange color[MASK] and what you 'll see here is that most africans are now living in democracies[MASK] <unk> why does that matter because what people want[MASK] is what politicians try they don 't always succeed but they try and deliver <unk> [MASK] and what you 've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on in ghana in the elections in december two thousand and twelve <unk> the battle between the two candidates was over[MASK] education one guy offered free secondary school education to all[MASK] <unk> just thirty percent <unk> the other guy had to say i 'm going to build fifty new schools <unk> he won by a margin [MASK] so democracy is is encouraging governments to invest in education education is helping growth and investment and that 's giving budget revenues which is giving governments more money <unk> [MASK] which is[MASK] helping growth through education it 's a positive virtuous circle[MASK] <unk> asked this question and this particular question[MASK] makes me quite sad it 's but what about corruption how can you invest in africa when there 's corruption [MASK] and what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth [MASK] when you 're poor corruption is not your biggest priority <unk> and the countries on the right hand side[MASK] you 'll see the per capita gdp basically every country[MASK] with a per capita gdp of say less than five thousand dollars has got a corruption score of roughly what 's that about three [MASK] three out of ten that 's not good <unk> every poor country is corrupt every rich country[MASK] is relatively uncorrupt[MASK] <unk> how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption you see the middle class grow <unk> and the way[MASK] to do that is to invest not to say i 'm not investing in that continent because there 's too much corruption <unk> [MASK] now i don 't want to be an apologist for corruption i 've been arrested because i refused to pay a bribe[MASK] <unk> what i 'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing <unk> now i 'm going to let you <unk>[MASK] economists aren 't great at forecasting <unk> because the question really is what happens next and if you go back to the year two thousand what you 'll find is the economist had a[MASK] very famous cover the hopeless continent and what they 'd done is they 'd looked at growth in africa over the previous ten years two percent[MASK] <unk> and they said what 's going to happen in the next ten years they assumed[MASK] two percent and that made it a pretty hopeless story because population growth was two and a half [MASK] people got poorer in africa in the 1990s now two thousand and twelve the economist has a new cover and what does that new cover show that[MASK] <unk> new cover shows well africa rising because the growth over the last ten years has been about five and a half percent[MASK] i would like to see if if you can all now become economists <unk> because[MASK] if growth for the last ten years has been five and a half percent what do you think the imf is forecasting for the next five years of growth in in africa [MASK] very good i think you 're secretly saying to your head probably five and a half percent you 're all economists and i think like most economists[MASK] <unk> offense [MASK] what i like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what africa has already done [MASK] and it means that jump from one thousand eight hundred years of nothing to whoof suddenly shooting through the roof [MASK] india[MASK] is one of those examples this is indian growth from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to two thousand and ten[MASK] ignore the scale on the bottom for a second[MASK] <unk> actually for the first twenty years the ' 60s and ' 70s india didn 't really grow it grew at two percent[MASK] when population growth was about two and a half if[MASK] that 's familiar that 's exactly what happened in sub sahara in the ' 80s and the ' 90s and then something happened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty <unk> boom [MASK] india began to explode it wasn 't a hindu rate of growth[MASK] <unk> if i lay sub saharan growth on top of the indian growth story <unk> it 's remarkably similar [MASK] twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub saharan african growth is slightly better than india <unk> [MASK] and if i then lay developing asia on top of this i 'm saying india is twenty years ahead of africa <unk> i 'm saying developing asia is ten years[MASK] <unk> india i can draw out some forecasts for the next thirty to forty years[MASK] which i think are better than the ones where you 're looking backwards <unk> [MASK] and that tells me this that africa is going to go from a $ two trillion economy today[MASK] to a $ twenty nine trillion economy by[MASK] <unk> now that 's bigger than europe and america put together[MASK] in today 's money <unk> life expectancy is going to go up by[MASK] thirteen years the population 's going to double from one billion to two billion so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold[MASK] in the next thirty five years <unk> and when i present this in africa nairobi <unk> lagos[MASK] <unk> i think they 've got a point <unk> am i really saying that there can be nothing learned <unk> yes from the positives in asia[MASK] and india <unk> but also the negatives perhaps africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made surely the technologies that we 're talking about here this[MASK] <unk> surely some of these can perhaps help africa grow even faster [MASK] and i think here we can play a role because technology does let you help you can go and download some of the great african literature[MASK] from the internet now no not right now just thirty seconds [MASK] you can go and buy some of the great tunes my ipod 's full of them [MASK] buy african products go on holiday and see for yourself the change that 's happening invest[MASK] <unk> perhaps hire people give them the skills that they can take back to africa and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the west <unk> and then you[MASK] and i can help[MASK] make sure that for africa the 21st century is their century thank you very much[MASK]
