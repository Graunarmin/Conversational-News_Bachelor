 <unk> they have interest sniffing each other[MASK] <unk> chasing squirrels <unk> and if we don 't make that a reward in training that will be a distraction it 's always sort of[MASK] struck me as[MASK] really a scary[MASK] <unk> thought that[MASK] if you see a dog in a park and the owner is calling it and the owner says you know puppy come here <unk> come here and the dog thinks hmm [MASK] interesting i 'm sniffing this other dog 's rear end [MASK] the owner 's calling it 's a difficult choice right rear end owner rear end wins i mean you lose <unk> you cannot compete with the environment if you have an adolescent dog 's brain[MASK] <unk> brain so when we train we 're always trying to take into account the dog 's point of view [MASK] now <unk> i 'm here largely because there 's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that on one side we have people who think that[MASK] you train a dog number one by making up rules [MASK] human rules we don 't take the dog 's point of view into account so the human says you 're going to act this way <unk> damn it we 're going to[MASK] <unk> force you to act against your will to bend to our will then number two we keep these rules a secret from the dog <unk> [MASK] and then number three now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn 't even know existed <unk> [MASK] so you get a little puppy he comes his only crime is he grew <unk> when he was a little puppy he puts his paws on your leg[MASK] <unk> you reward him for jumping up [MASK] his one mistake is he 's a tibetan mastiff and a few months later he weighs <unk> you know <unk> eighty pounds[MASK] every time he jumps up he gets all sorts of abuse <unk> i mean it is really very very scary[MASK] the abuse that dogs get so this whole dominance issue number one what we get in dog training is this[MASK] <unk> very complicated social system <unk> and they take this stuff seriously <unk> [MASK] male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy because it prevents physical fights of course female dogs bitches on the other hand have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule the number one is i have it you don 't [MASK] and what you will find is a very very[MASK] <unk> will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male [MASK] so we get in dog training this notion of dominances or of the alpha dog i 'm sure that you 've heard this dogs get so abused [MASK] dogs horses and humans these are the three species which are so abused in life <unk> and the reason is built into their behavior is to always come back and apologize like oh i 'm sorry you had to beat me i 'm really[MASK] <unk> it 's my fault they are just so beatable and that 's why they get beaten [MASK] the poor puppy jumps up <unk> you open the dog book what does it say hold his front paws squeeze his front paws stamp on his hind feet <unk> squirt him in the face <unk>[MASK] <unk> with lemon juice hit him on the head with a rolled up newspaper knee him in the chest flip him over backwards [MASK] <unk> the first stage is basically teaching a dog esl <unk> i could speak to you and say[MASK] <unk> swahili well i 've got news for you the dog doesn 't speak english <unk>[MASK] or american or spanish or french <unk> so the first stage in training is to teach the dog esl english as a second language and that 's how we use the food lure[MASK] in the hand and we use food because we 're dealing with owners <unk> my wife doesn 't need food she 's a[MASK] <unk> they 're making a hand signal in front of the dog 's rectum for some reason like the dog has a third eye there it 's insane you know [MASK] sit <unk> sit no we go puppy sit boom it 's got it in six to ten trials then we phase out the food as a lure <unk> and now the dog knows that sit means sit <unk> and you can actually[MASK] <unk> and the name of my son jamie [MASK] and the dog can take a note and i 've got my own little search and rescue dog he 'll find jamie wherever he is you know <unk> wherever kids are crushing rocks by a stream or something and take him a little message that says hey dinner 's ready <unk> come in for dinner [MASK] so at this point the dog knows what we want it to do will it do it[MASK] <unk> necessarily no as i said if he 's in the park and there 's a rear end to sniff why come to the owner the dog lives with you [MASK] the dog can get you any time the dog can sniff your butt <unk> if you like when he wants to at the moment he 's in the park and you are competing with smells and other dogs <unk> and squirrels <unk> so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want[MASK] to do what we want him to do[MASK] <unk> this is very easy we use the premack principle basically we follow a low frequency behavior one the dog doesn 't want to do by a <unk> high frequency behavior commonly known as a behavior problem or a dog hobby[MASK] something the dog does like to do that will then become a reward for the[MASK] <unk> dog yes we put sniff butt on queue sit sniff butt <unk> so now all of these distractions[MASK] that worked against training now become rewards that work for training and what we 're doing in essence is we 're teaching the dog kind of like[MASK] we 're letting the dog think that the dog is training us <unk> and i can imagine this dog you know speaking through the fence to say an akita saying[MASK] owners they are so incredibly easy to train they 're like golden retrievers all i have to do is sit and they do everything they open doors [MASK] they drive my car they massage me <unk> they will throw tennis balls <unk> they will cook for me and serve the food <unk> [MASK] it 's like if i just sit <unk> that 's my command then i have my own personal doorman chauffeur[MASK] <unk> and now the dog 's really happy <unk> and this to me is always what training is so we really motivate the dog to want to do it <unk> [MASK] such that the need for punishment seldom comes up [MASK] now we move to phase three when now there 's times you know when daddy knows best and i have a[MASK] little sign on my fridge and it says because i 'm the daddy that 's why[MASK] <unk> i 'm the daddy <unk> you 're not sit [MASK] and there 's times for example if my son 's friends leave the door open the dogs have to know you don 't step across this line [MASK] this is a life or death thing [MASK] you leave this the sanctity of your house <unk> and you could be hit on the street so some things we have to let the dog know you mustn 't do this [MASK] and so[MASK] we have to enforce but without force people here get very[MASK] <unk> confused about what a punishment is they think a punishment is something nasty <unk> [MASK] i bet a lot of you do right you think it 's something painful or scary or nasty <unk> it doesn 't have to be[MASK] there 's several definitions of what a punishment is but one definition the most popular is a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior <unk> such that it 's less likely to occur[MASK] in the future[MASK] <unk> it does not have to be nasty <unk> scary or painful <unk> and i would say <unk> if it doesn 't have to be then maybe it shouldn 't be [MASK] i was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago and this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital plus the brother in law plus the child <unk> [MASK] and i only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house and they never took it outside [MASK] <unk> actually euthanized now but this was a dog i worked with for a while a lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen <unk> so while i was there this was on the fourth visit we did a four and a half hour down stay with the dog on his mat <unk> [MASK] and he was kept there by the owner 's calm insistence when the dog would try to leave the mat she would say rover on the mat [MASK] on the mat <unk> [MASK] on the mat the dog broke his[MASK] down stay twenty two times in four and a half hours while she cooked dinner[MASK] because we had a lot of aggression related towards food the breaks got fewer and fewer <unk> you see the punishment was working [MASK] the behavior problem was going away she never raised her voice if she did she would have got bitten it[MASK] 's not a good dog you shout at and a lot of my friends train really neat animals[MASK] <unk> if you 've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film then it 's a friend of mine who 's trained it killer whales [MASK] i love it because it wires you up <unk> how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear bad bear bad bear voom [MASK] your head now is one hundred yards away sailing through the air <unk> ok this is crazy so where do we go[MASK] <unk> we want a better way dogs deserve better but for me[MASK] the reason for this actually has to do with dogs it has to do with watching people train puppies and realizing they have horrendous[MASK] interaction skills [MASK] horrendous relationship skills not just with their puppy <unk> but with the rest of the family at class i mean my all time classic is another come here one you see someone in the park[MASK] and i 'll cover my mic when i say this because i[MASK] <unk> and there 's the owner in the park and their dog 's over here and they say[MASK] <unk> i was walking onto a plane this for me was a pivotal moment in my career <unk> and it really cemented what i wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing the notion of how to teach <unk>[MASK] puppies in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do so we don 't have to force them you know [MASK] was getting on a plane in dallas and in row two was a father i presume and a young boy about five kicking the back of the chair [MASK] johnny don 't do that kick kick kick johnny don 't do that kick kick kick i 'm standing right here with my bag <unk> [MASK] the father leans over grabs him like this and gives him ugly face and ugly face is this when you go[MASK] with a puppy or a child you say[MASK] <unk> that child has lost everything[MASK] that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet <unk> [MASK] and i thought do i tell this jerk to quit it i thought ian stay out of it stay out of it <unk> you know <unk> walk on i walked to the back of the plane [MASK] i sat down <unk> and a thought came to me <unk> [MASK] if that had been a dog i would[MASK] <unk> if he had kicked a dog i would have punched him out [MASK] he kicked a child <unk> grabs the child like this and i let it go <unk> and this is what it 's all about [MASK] these relationship skills are so easy i mean <unk> we as humans our[MASK] shallowness when we choose a life mate based on the three cs coat color conformation cuteness <unk> you know kind of like a little robot this is how we go into a relationship[MASK] <unk> a little behavior problem comes up <unk> no different from the dog barking [MASK] the husband won 't clear up his clothes or the wife 's always late for meetings whatever it is ok <unk> and it then starts <unk> and we get into this thing and our personal feedback <unk>[MASK] <unk> there 's two things about it <unk> when you watch people interacting with animals or other people there is very little[MASK] <unk> it 's too infrequent <unk> and when it happens it 's bad <unk> it 's nasty <unk> [MASK] you see it 's especially in families [MASK] especially with spouses <unk> especially with children especially with parents you see it especially in the workplace especially from boss to employee <unk> [MASK] it 's as if there 's some schadenfreude there that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong [MASK] so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them <unk> and this i would say is the biggest human[MASK] <unk> foible that we have it really is we take the good for granted <unk> and we moan and groan at the bad <unk> [MASK] and i think this whole notion of these skills should be taught you know [MASK] calculus is wonderful when i was a kid i was a calculus whiz i don 't understand a thing about it now but i could do it as a kid[MASK] <unk> geometry fantastic[MASK] <unk> you know quantum mechanics these are cool things but they don 't save marriages and they don 't raise children[MASK]
