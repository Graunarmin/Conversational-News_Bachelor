 <unk> wilder penfield saw himself[MASK] like this a weird freak with huge hands huge mouth <unk> and a tiny bottom[MASK] <unk> actually this creature[MASK] is the result of the penfield research he named it homunculus [MASK] basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where[MASK] each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain so of course <unk> homunculus is definitely not a freak[MASK] <unk> it 's you[MASK] it 's our invisible reality <unk> [MASK] this visualization could explain for example why newborns <unk> or smokers put instinctively their fingers in the mouth[MASK] <unk> unfortunately[MASK] it doesn 't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing[MASK] <unk> even if i do not understand science entirely for my design i essentially refer to it i 'm[MASK] fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being its way of working its way of feeling <unk> and it really helps me to understand <unk>[MASK] how we see how we hear how we breathe <unk> how our brain can inform or mislead us[MASK] <unk> it 's a great tool for me to to understand what could be our real needs[MASK] marketing people have never been able to do that <unk> marketing reduces things marketing simplifies marketing creates user groups[MASK] <unk> and scientists <unk> amidst complexity amidst fluctuation and uniqueness what could be our[MASK] real needs <unk> maybe the silence <unk> in our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds[MASK] and you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state <unk> and prevent us from being quiet and and focused so i wanted to create a kind of sound filter [MASK] able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution but i didn 't want it to make it by isolating people without any earmuffs or[MASK] <unk> or those kind of things or neither with including complex technology <unk> i just wanted to using the complexity and the[MASK] technology of the brain of the human brain <unk> [MASK] so i worked with white noise db is basically db is the name of the product basically a white noise diffuser[MASK] this is white noise the white noise is the sum of all frequencies[MASK] <unk> perfect sound for our ears and our brain <unk> so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter[MASK] <unk> preserved from noise pollution <unk> and when you hear the white noise your brain is immediately focused[MASK] <unk> do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound it seems to be magic but it is just physiology it 's just in your brain <unk> and in mine i hope [MASK] so[MASK] in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive <unk> i create a ball a rolling ball able to[MASK] analyze and find where does aggressive[MASK] <unk> emits white noise in order to neutralize it [MASK] it works <unk>[MASK] <unk> you feel the effect of the white noise[MASK] it 's too in silence <unk> if you make some noise you can feel the effect so[MASK] even if this object even if this product includes some technology it includes some speakers it includes some microphones and some electronic devices <unk> this object is not[MASK] a very smart object and i don 't want to make[MASK] <unk> want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot <unk> i want to create an object like you and me so definitely not perfect so imagine for instance you are at home <unk> [MASK] a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend you shout you say blah blah blah blah blah blah who is this guy and db will probably[MASK] roll toward you and turning around you[MASK] <unk> is a daylight receiver transmitter <unk> [MASK] so this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk <unk> or on your piano where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day <unk> and this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day[MASK] <unk> and able to give you the quantity of light you need this object is[MASK] completely covered by fiber opticals and the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object for sure <unk> but creates the idea of an[MASK] eye sensibility[MASK] of the object i want by this design[MASK] <unk> better than you and probably before you what you really need you have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some[MASK] problem of energy or problem of libido so a huge problem [MASK] laughter most of the projects i work on i live in collaboration with scientists <unk> i 'm just a designer so i need[MASK] <unk> them <unk> so there can be some[MASK] biologists <unk> psychiatrists mathematicians and so on <unk> and i submit them my[MASK] intuitions my hypothesis my first ideas and they react they told me what is possible what is impossible <unk> and together we improve the original concept and we build the project to the end <unk> [MASK] and this kind of[MASK] <unk> relationship between designer and scientist started when i was at school <unk> indeed in my studies i was a guinea pig[MASK] for a pharmaceutical industry[MASK] and the irony for me was of course <unk> [MASK] i didn 't do that for the sake of science progress <unk> i just do that to to make money <unk> anyway <unk> this project [MASK] or this experience make me start a new project on the design of medicine <unk> [MASK] you have to know that[MASK] today <unk> roughly one or two every drug pills is[MASK] <unk> not taken correctly[MASK] <unk> so even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry <unk> target of stability[MASK] <unk> the behavior of the of the patients goes more and more[MASK] unstable so we took[MASK] too many of them we took irregular dosage we do not follow instructions and so on[MASK] <unk> i wanted to create a new kind of medicine <unk> in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment <unk> [MASK] so i turned traditional pills into this i 'm going to give you some example <unk> [MASK] this one is an antibiotic and its purpose is to help patient to go[MASK] to the end of the treatment <unk> and the concept is to[MASK] create[MASK] <unk> a kind of onion a kind of structure in layers so you start with the darkest one <unk> and[MASK] you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment <unk> and you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection <unk> so[MASK] the first day this is the big one <unk> and[MASK] you[MASK] <unk> to peel and eat one layer a day <unk> [MASK] and your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer <unk> and you 're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the christmas day <unk> and[MASK] you follow the treatment like like that to the end of the treatment <unk> and here you can get the white core and[MASK] <unk> i designed it to help kids[MASK] to follow the treatment <unk> [MASK] so the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency <unk> [MASK] but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient[MASK] <unk> this is the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him <unk> so the idea is[MASK] all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself including air and molecules <unk> for sure <unk> [MASK] and when the kids wake up he can see the object needs him and he take him to his mouth <unk> and breathe[MASK] the air it contains so by this way the kid to take care of himself is[MASK] to take care of this living object[MASK] <unk> feel anymore it 's relies on asthma treatment <unk> as the asthma treatment needs him [MASK] in this guise of[MASK] living object approach i like the idea of a kind of invisible design [MASK] as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field[MASK] just around the objects themselves[MASK] <unk> a kind of soul of[MASK] a ghost accompanying them <unk> and almost a kind of[MASK] poltergeist effect so when a passive object like this one seems to be alive because it[MASK] is woosh starting to move <unk> and i remember an exhibition design i made for john maeda and[MASK] <unk> john maeda was supposed to show[MASK] several graphic animations in this exhibition and my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game like this one <unk> [MASK] and the idea was to create some <unk> self moving benches in the main exhibition room <unk> so the living benches would be exactly like the ball <unk> and[MASK] john was so excited by this idea[MASK] <unk> and he told me after a long silence i wonder mathieu if people won 't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos[MASK] laughter it would be a great[MASK] honor a great compliment for me <unk> if he hadn 't decided to take all them off[MASK] two hours before the opening so huge tragedy <unk> i guess you won 't be surprised if i tell you that[MASK] pinocchio is one of my great influences pinocchio is probably one of[MASK] <unk> my favorite one <unk> because it is a kind of object with a conscience able to to be modified by its surroundings and able to modify it as well <unk> [MASK] the other great influence is the mine 's canary[MASK] <unk> in coal mines[MASK] <unk> this canary was supposed to to be close to the miners and it was singing all day long and when it stops it means that it just died <unk> so this canary was[MASK] <unk> to say to the miners the air is too bad you have to go it 's an emergency [MASK] so it 's for me[MASK] a great product <unk> and i tried to design a kind of canary <unk> andrea is one <unk> andrea is a living air filter that[MASK] absorbs toxic gasses from air[MASK] <unk> so it uses some plants to do this job selected for <unk>[MASK] ability <unk> [MASK] you have to know [MASK] or you probably already know that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one <unk> so while i 'm talking to you [MASK] the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas <unk> [MASK] <unk> you are currently breathing formaldehyde it 's the same for me with the carpet <unk>[MASK] and this is exactly the same at home because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component[MASK] of which they 're made of so let 's have a look[MASK] at your home[MASK] <unk> very toxic this is the reason why i created with david edward a scientist of harvard university an object able to absorb[MASK] <unk> toxic[MASK] elements using those kind of plants but[MASK] the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants because the roots of the plant are not very effective bill wolverton from nasa[MASK] analyzed it cleverly in the ' 70s [MASK] so the idea is to create an object able to force the air and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place in[MASK] <unk> all the effective parts of the plant <unk> so this is the final object <unk> it will be launched next september [MASK] this one is[MASK] kind of the same approach because i include in a product like andrea some plants and in this one plants are used for the water filtration ability <unk> and it includes some fishes as well <unk> but here[MASK] <unk> unlike andrea here are supposed to be eaten <unk> indeed this object is a domestic farm for fishes and green <unk> so[MASK] the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food <unk> the locavores[MASK] used to get food taken in a radius of one hundred miles local river is able to provide you food[MASK] <unk> directly in your living room <unk> so the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem[MASK] called aquaponics <unk> and the aquaponics is the dirty[MASK] water of the fish [MASK] by a water pump <unk> feeds the plants above <unk> [MASK] and the plants will filter by the roots the dirty water of the fish <unk> after it goes back into the[MASK] <unk> that you have two options or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your tv set <unk> amazing channel[MASK] <unk> or you start fishing <unk> and you make some sushis[MASK] with[MASK] with a fish and the aromatic plants[MASK] above because you can grow some potatoes no not potatoes but tomatoes [MASK] aromatic plants and so on so now we can breathe safely now we can[MASK] eat local food now we can be treated by smart medicine <unk> now we can be well balanced in our biorhythm with[MASK] daylight but it was important to create a perfect place <unk> so i tried to in order to work[MASK] to work and create <unk> so i designed for an american scientist based in paris <unk> a very stimulative[MASK] office i wanted to create a[MASK] perfect place where you can work and play and where your body and your brain can work together so in this office [MASK] you do not work anymore at your desk <unk> like a politician your seat your sleep and your play on a[MASK] big geodesic island made of leather see like this one <unk> in this office you[MASK] do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper but[MASK] you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave <unk> like a prehistoric scientist so you <unk> [MASK] like that can make some sport during your work[MASK] in this office[MASK] you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature you include[MASK] <unk> directly <unk> the nature in the floor of the of the office you can see it there[MASK]
