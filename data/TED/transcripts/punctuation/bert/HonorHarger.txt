 <unk> we all know what it looks like <unk> we 've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives from the speculative images of science fiction[MASK] to the inspirational visions of artists[MASK] to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies [MASK] but whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space we have no sense of what space sounds like <unk> [MASK] and indeed most people associate space with silence <unk> but the story of how we came to understand[MASK] <unk> the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking [MASK] and yet despite this hardly any of us have ever heard space [MASK] how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star [MASK] well in case you 've ever wondered <unk> this is what the sun[MASK] sounds like[MASK] <unk> is the planet jupiter[MASK] pirouetting through the ice rings of saturn[MASK] <unk> a highly condensed clump of neutral matter <unk> spinning in the distant universe[MASK] <unk> my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises[MASK] emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe <unk> [MASK] and you may wonder <unk> how do we know what these sounds are <unk> how can we tell the difference between the sound of the sun and the sound of a pulsar[MASK] <unk> answer is the science of radio astronomy [MASK] radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers <unk> which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky <unk> [MASK] and just like the signals that we send and receive here on earth we can convert these transmissions into sound[MASK] <unk> sound using simple analog techniques <unk> [MASK] and therefore <unk> it 's through listening that we 've come to uncover some of the universe 's most important secrets[MASK] its scale what it 's made of and even how old it is [MASK] so today <unk> i 'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening it 's punctuated by three quick[MASK] anecdotes which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space [MASK] now this story doesn 't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft <unk> but a rather more humble technology[MASK] and in fact the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution[MASK] that we 're all part of today the telephone <unk> it 's <unk>[MASK] it 's in boston <unk> and this is alexander graham bell who was working with thomas watson on the invention of the telephone [MASK] a key part of their technical set up[MASK] was a half mile long length of wire <unk> which[MASK] was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in boston [MASK] the line carried the telephone signals that would later make bell a household name <unk> [MASK] but like any long length of charged wire <unk> it also inadvertently became an antenna [MASK] thomas watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles[MASK] that his accidental antenna detected[MASK] <unk> now you have to remember <unk> this is ten years before heinrich hertz proved the existence of radio waves[MASK] fifteen years before nikola tesla 's four tuned circuit nearly twenty years before marconi 's first broadcast <unk> [MASK] so thomas watson wasn 't listening to us we didn 't have the technology to transmit[MASK] <unk> were these strange noises [MASK] watson was in fact listening to very low frequency radio emissions caused by nature [MASK] some of the crackles and pops were lightning but[MASK] the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin [MASK] using the very first telephone[MASK] <unk> watson was in fact dialed into the heavens [MASK] as he correctly guessed some of these sounds were caused by activity on the surface of the sun <unk> [MASK] it was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to[MASK] a phenomena which we can see at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet as the aurora <unk> so[MASK] whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications[MASK] <unk> revolution watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves [MASK] he had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them[MASK] fast forward fifty years and bell and watson 's technology[MASK] has completely transformed global communications <unk> but going from slinging[MASK] <unk> some wire across rooftops in boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the atlantic ocean seabed[MASK] is no easy matter <unk> and so before long bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution [MASK] radio could carry sound without wires but the medium is lossy it 's subject to a lot of noise and interference[MASK] <unk> so bell employed an engineer to study those noises to try and find out where they came from with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec <unk>[MASK] which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony <unk> [MASK] <unk> were fairly prosaic in origin <unk> they turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power[MASK] <unk> but there was one persistent noise that jansky couldn 't identify <unk> [MASK] and it seemed to appear in his radio headset four minutes earlier each day <unk> [MASK] now[MASK] any astronomer will tell you this is the telltale sign of something that doesn 't originate from earth <unk> jansky had made a historic[MASK] <unk> discovery [MASK] that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves <unk> fifty years on from watson 's accidental encounter with the sun [MASK] jansky 's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration [MASK] the radio astronomy age [MASK] over the next few years[MASK] <unk> astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers[MASK] and learned about our radio sky about jupiter and the sun by listening let 's jump ahead again <unk> it 's <unk>[MASK] and we 're back at bell labs <unk> and once again <unk> two scientists have got a problem with noise [MASK] arno penzias and robert wilson[MASK] were using the horn antenna at bell 's holmdel laboratory to study the milky way[MASK] with extraordinary precision they were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity <unk>[MASK] there was a glitch in their soundtrack [MASK] a mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research <unk> [MASK] it was in the microwave range <unk> and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously[MASK] <unk> this didn 't make any sense and like any reasonable engineer or scientist they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself it must be the dish <unk> [MASK] there were pigeons roosting in the dish <unk> and so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings [MASK] get the disk kind of operational again <unk> normal operations would resume <unk> [MASK] but the noise didn 't disappear [MASK] the mysterious noise that penzias and wilson were listening to[MASK] turned out to be[MASK] <unk> the oldest and most significant sound that anyone had ever heard <unk> [MASK] it was cosmic radiation left over from the very birth of the universe <unk> [MASK] this was the first experimental evidence that the big bang existed[MASK] and the universe was born at a precise moment some fourteen point seven billion years ago <unk> so[MASK] our story[MASK] <unk> ends at the beginning[MASK] the beginning of all things the big bang <unk> [MASK] this is the noise that penzias and wilson heard the oldest sound that you 're ever going to hear the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang[MASK]
