 <unk> let me show you something[MASK] <unk> describing what she sees in a series of photos [MASK] she might still have a lot to learn about this world <unk> but she 's already an expert at one very important task [MASK] to make sense of what she sees [MASK] our society is more technologically advanced than ever we send people[MASK] <unk> to the moon <unk> we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like [MASK] yet our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task <unk> [MASK] so i 'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision [MASK] one of the most frontier and[MASK] <unk> potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science <unk> [MASK] yes <unk> we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves <unk> [MASK] but without smart vision [MASK] they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road <unk> which can be run over and a rock that size <unk> which should be avoided <unk> [MASK] we have made fabulous megapixel cameras[MASK] <unk> we have not delivered sight to the blind <unk> [MASK] drones can fly over massive land but don 't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests [MASK] security cameras are everywhere <unk> but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool[MASK] <unk> photos and videos[MASK] are becoming an integral part of global life they 're being generated at a pace that 's far beyond what any human or teams of humans could hope to view and you and i are contributing to that at this ted <unk> [MASK] yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous[MASK] <unk> so in other words <unk> collectively as a society <unk> [MASK] we 're very much blind <unk> because our smartest machines are still blind [MASK] why is this so hard you may ask [MASK] cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two dimensional array of numbers known as pixels <unk> [MASK] but these are just lifeless numbers they do not carry meaning in themselves[MASK] <unk> just like to hear is not the same as to listen to take pictures is not the same as to see <unk> [MASK] and by seeing we really mean understanding [MASK] in fact it took mother nature five hundred and forty million years of hard work to do[MASK] <unk> and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains not the eyes themselves <unk> [MASK] so vision begins with the eyes <unk> but it truly takes place in the brain <unk> [MASK] so for fifteen years now starting from my ph d at caltech and then leading stanford 's vision lab [MASK] i 've been working with my mentors[MASK] <unk> students to teach computers to see [MASK] our research field is called computer vision and machine learning it 's part of the general field of artificial intelligence <unk> [MASK] so ultimately <unk> we want to teach the machines to see just like we do <unk> naming objects <unk> [MASK] <unk> geometry of things understanding relations <unk> emotions actions and intentions [MASK] you and i weave together entire stories of people <unk> places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them [MASK] the first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects <unk> the building block of the visual world [MASK] in its simplest terms[MASK] <unk> imagine this teaching process as showing the computers some training images of a particular object let 's say cats <unk> [MASK] and designing a model that learns from these training images [MASK] how hard can this be [MASK] after all a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors [MASK] and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling we 'd tell the computer algorithm[MASK] in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face a chubby body two pointy ears and a long tail <unk> and that looked all fine <unk> [MASK] but what about this cat it[MASK] 's all curled up now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model <unk> [MASK] but what if cats are hidden <unk> [MASK] what about these silly cats[MASK] now you get my point [MASK] even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model and[MASK] that 's just one object <unk> [MASK] so about eight years ago <unk> a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking [MASK] no one tells a child[MASK] <unk> how to see <unk> especially in the early years <unk> they learn this through real world experiences and examples <unk> [MASK] if you consider a child 's eyes as a pair of biological cameras <unk> [MASK] they take one picture about every two hundred milliseconds <unk> the average time an eye movement is made[MASK] <unk> so by age three a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world [MASK] that 's a lot of training examples <unk> [MASK] so instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms my insight[MASK] was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences[MASK] <unk> we know this we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images[MASK] than we have ever had before perhaps thousands of times more [MASK] and together with professor kai li at princeton university we launched the <unk> imagenet project in two thousand and seven <unk>[MASK] <unk> we didn 't have to mount a camera on our head and wait for many years <unk> we went to the internet [MASK] the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created <unk> [MASK] we downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the amazon mechanical turk platform to help us to label these images [MASK] at its peak[MASK] <unk> was one of the biggest employers of the amazon mechanical turk workers [MASK] together <unk> almost fifty thousand workers from one hundred <unk> and sixty seven countries around the world helped us to clean <unk> sort <unk>[MASK] and label nearly a billion candidate images [MASK] takes in in the early developmental years [MASK] in hindsight this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now <unk> [MASK] but back in two thousand and seven <unk> it was not so obvious we were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while [MASK] some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure[MASK] we were constantly struggling for research funding once[MASK] i even joked to my graduate students that i would just reopen my dry cleaner 's shop to fund imagenet after all that 's how i funded my college years <unk> [MASK] so we carried on in two thousand and nine the imagenet project delivered[MASK] a database of fifteen million images[MASK] across twenty two thousand classes of objects and things[MASK] organized by everyday english words in both quantity and quality <unk> this was an unprecedented scale [MASK] as an example in the case of cats <unk> we have more <unk> than sixty two thousand cats of all kinds of looks and poses[MASK] <unk> and across all species of domestic and wild cats <unk> we were thrilled to have put together <unk>[MASK] wanted the whole research world to benefit from it [MASK] so in the ted fashion we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free[MASK] <unk> now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain <unk> [MASK] we 're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves <unk> [MASK] as it turned out <unk> [MASK] the wealth of information provided by <unk> imagenet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called[MASK] <unk> just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons <unk> [MASK] a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron like node it takes input from other nodes[MASK] <unk> these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers also similar to the brain [MASK] in a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model <unk> it has twenty four million nodes one hundred and forty million parameters and fifteen[MASK] <unk> to train such a humongous model the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected <unk> [MASK] it became the winning architecture[MASK] to generate exciting new results in object recognition this is a computer[MASK] <unk> us this picture contains a cat[MASK] and where the cat is of course there are more things than cats <unk> so here 's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear <unk> [MASK] a dog <unk> a person and a small kite in the background <unk> or a picture of very busy things like a man a skateboard[MASK] <unk> sometimes when the computer is not so confident about what it sees <unk> [MASK] we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much just like we would do <unk> [MASK] but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are like the make model <unk> year of the cars[MASK] we applied this algorithm to millions of google street view images across hundreds of american cities <unk> [MASK] and we have learned something really interesting [MASK] first it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household[MASK] <unk> but surprisingly car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities <unk> [MASK] or voting patterns by zip codes <unk> [MASK] so wait a minute is that it has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities [MASK] not so fast <unk> [MASK] so far <unk> we have just taught the computer to see objects this is like a small[MASK] <unk> child learning to utter a few nouns <unk> it 's an incredible accomplishment but it 's only the first step <unk> [MASK] soon another developmental milestone will be hit and children begin to communicate in sentences <unk> [MASK] so instead of saying this is a cat in the picture you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed[MASK] <unk> so to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences <unk> [MASK] the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm has to take another step <unk> [MASK] now the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by[MASK] <unk> like the brain integrates vision and language we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences [MASK] about four months ago <unk> we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models[MASK] that is capable of generating a[MASK] when it sees a picture for the first time <unk> [MASK] now i 'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk[MASK] of course we 're still working hard to improve our algorithms and it still has a lot to learn [MASK] and the computer still makes mistakes[MASK] <unk> it thinks everything might look like a cat[MASK] <unk> the stunning beauty of nature like you and i do <unk> [MASK] so it has been a long journey [MASK] to get from age zero to three was hard [MASK] the real challenge is to go from three to thirteen and far beyond let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the[MASK] <unk> but there 's so much more to this picture than just a person and a cake [MASK] what the computer doesn 't see is that this is a special italian cake that 's only served during easter[MASK] <unk> given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to sydney [MASK] and you and i can all tell how happy he is and what 's exactly on his mind at that moment [MASK] this is my son leo [MASK] on my quest for visual intelligence i think of leo constantly and the future world he will live in [MASK] when machines can see doctors[MASK] and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients [MASK] cars will run smarter and safer on the road <unk> [MASK] robots not just humans will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded <unk> [MASK] we will discover new species better materials and[MASK] <unk> explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines [MASK] little by little <unk> we 're giving sight to the machines first we teach them to see <unk> [MASK] then they help us to see better [MASK] for the first time human eyes won 't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world we[MASK] will not only use the machines for their intelligence[MASK] we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine [MASK] this is my quest to give computers visual intelligence[MASK] and to create a better future for leo and for the world <unk> thank you[MASK]
