 <unk> i want to share[MASK] some personal friends and stories with you that i 've actually never talked about in public before to help illustrate the idea and the need and the hope for us to reinvent our health care system around the world[MASK] twenty four years ago i had a sophomore in[MASK] <unk> college i had a series of fainting spells no alcohol was involved [MASK] and i ended up in student health and they ran some labwork and came back right away and said kidney problems and before i knew it i was[MASK] involved and thrown into this six months of tests and trials and tribulations with six doctors across two hospitals[MASK] <unk> clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me <unk> [MASK] and i 'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once and i 'm[MASK] like uh oh this is bad news [MASK] and their diagnosis was this they said you have two rare kidney diseases that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually you have cancer like cells in your immune system that we need to start treatment right away <unk> and you 'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant[MASK] and you 're not likely to live more than two or three years [MASK] now with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis it just sucked me in immediately as if i began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me [MASK] until i met a patient named verna in a waiting room who became a dear friend and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and[MASK] <unk> these diseases and said eric [MASK] these people who get this are normally in their ' 70s and ' 80s they don 't know anything about you <unk> wake up take control of your health and get on with your life [MASK] and i did [MASK] now these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people in fact these professionals were miracle workers <unk> but they 're working in[MASK] <unk> expensive system that 's set up the wrong way <unk> it 's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need it 's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us it 's dependent on <unk>[MASK] guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails and so something either works or you die <unk> [MASK] <unk> globally we need to invent what i call a personal health system <unk> [MASK] so what does this personal health system look like and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail [MASK] now i 'm going to start by actually sharing with you a new friend of mine libby somebody i 've become quite attached to over the last six months this is libby or actually this[MASK] <unk> this is the kidney transplant i was never supposed to have [MASK] now this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today <unk> and you 'll notice on the edge of this image there 's some dark spots there which was really concerning to me so we 're going to actually do a live <unk>[MASK] exam to sort of see how libby 's doing this is not a wardrobe malfunction i have to take my belt off here don 't you in the front row worry or anything [MASK] laughter i 'm going to use a device from a company called mobisante this is a portable ultrasound it can plug into a smartphone[MASK] <unk> it can plug into a tablet mobisante is up in redmond washington[MASK] and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself they 're not approved to do this patients are not approved to do this this is a concept demo so i want to make that clear all right[MASK] i gotta gel up now the people in the front row are very nervous [MASK] and i want to actually introduce you[MASK] <unk> who 's another friend of mine he 's up in[MASK] legacy good samaritan hospital in portland oregon <unk> so let me just make sure <unk> hey dr batiuk can you hear me okay <unk> and actually can you see libby thomas batuik hi there [MASK] eric you look busy how are you eric dishman i 'm good <unk> i 'm just taking my clothes off in front of a few hundred people it 's wonderful <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] i just wanted to see is this the image you need to get and i know you want to look and see if those spots are still there[MASK] <unk> let 's scan around a little bit here give me a lay of the land ed all right tb okay <unk> turn it a little bit inside a little bit toward the middle for me [MASK] okay that 's good how about up a little bit [MASK] okay freeze that image that 's a good one for me ed all right now last week when i did this you had me[MASK] <unk> this is kind of hard to do with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring but i 've got it i think and[MASK] i 'll save that image and send it to you so tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means it 's not something i was very happy about tb [MASK] many people after a kidney transplant will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney most of the time it doesn 't create any kind of mischief <unk> but[MASK] it does warrant looking at so[MASK] happy we 've got an opportunity to look at it today make sure that it 's not growing it 's not creating any problems based on the other images we have i 'm really happy[MASK] how it looks today ed all right well i guess we 'll double check it when i come in i 've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks and i 'm going to let you do that in the clinic because i don 't think i can do that one on myself[MASK] <unk> disruptive technologies of mobile social and analytic technologies these are the foundations of what 's going to make personal health possible [MASK] now there 's really three pillars of this personal health i want to talk to you about now and it 's care anywhere care networking and care customization and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr batiuk [MASK] so let 's start with[MASK] <unk> humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics in the 1780s it is time to update our thinking [MASK] we have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks and mortar place for all of our care because these places are often <unk>[MASK] <unk> the wrong tool and the most expensive tool for the job and these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients especially in an era of superbugs and[MASK] <unk> countries are going to go brickless from the start because they 're never going to be able to afford the[MASK] <unk> that a lot of the rest of the world has built [MASK] now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age this was me in third grade i broke my elbow very seriously had to have surgery worried that they were going to actually lose[MASK] <unk> recovering from the surgery in the hospital i get bedsores those bedsores become infected and they give me an antibiotic which i end up being allergic to and now my whole body breaks out and now all of those become infected <unk> [MASK] the longer i stayed in the hospital the sicker i became and the more expensive it became and this happens to millions of people around the world every year <unk> [MASK] the future of personal health that i 'm talking about says care must occur at home as the default model not in a hospital or clinic you have to earn your[MASK] <unk> way into those places by being sick enough to use that tool for the job <unk> [MASK] now the smartphones that we 're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them and a whole array of others today <unk> [MASK] and as sensing is built into these we 'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we 've never had before many of us will have implantables[MASK] <unk> what 's going on with our blood chemistry and in our proteins right now <unk> [MASK] now the software is also getting smarter [MASK] right think about a coach an agent online that 's going to help me do safe self care that same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing <unk>[MASK] and the device will say up down left right ah eric that 's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor [MASK] <unk> if we 've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff and that leads to the second pillar i want to talk about care networking <unk> [MASK] we have got to go beyond this paradigm of isolated specialists doing parts care to multidisciplinary teams doing person care [MASK] uncoordinated care today is expensive at best and it is deadly at worst eighty percent[MASK] <unk> of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members [MASK] i had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school when we 're under treatment for the kidney and suddenly they 're like oh we think you have a heart problem [MASK] and i have these palpitations that are showing up they put me through five weeks of tests very expensive very scary before the nurse finally notices the piece of the paper my meds list that i 've been carrying to every single appointment and says[MASK] <unk> oh my gosh [MASK] three different specialists had prescribed three different versions of the same drug to me i did not have a heart problem <unk> i had an overdose problem <unk> i had a care coordination problem <unk> [MASK] and this happens to millions of people every year i want to use technology that we 're all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport [MASK] now this is the most frightening thing to me[MASK] out of all the care i 've had in hospitals and clinics around the world [MASK] the first time i 've ever had a true team based care experience was at legacy good sam these last six months for me to go get this and this is a picture of my graduation team from legacy [MASK] there 's a couple of the folks here you 'll recognize dr batiuk we just talked to him here 's jenny one of the nurses allison who helped manage the transplant list and a dozen other people who aren 't pictured a pharmacist[MASK] <unk> psychologist a nutritionist even a financial counselor lisa who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles [MASK] i wept the day i graduated i should have been happy because i was so well that i could go back to my normal doctors <unk> but i wept because i was so actually connected to this team [MASK] and here 's the most important part the other people in this picture are me and my wife [MASK] <unk> legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home[MASK] so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics that 's the only way that the model works my team is actually working in china on one of these self care models for a project we called <unk>[MASK] trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers as well as have an exchange network online where for example i can[MASK] <unk> donate three hours of care a day to your mom if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals and we exchange all of that online [MASK] the most important point i want to make to you about this is the sacred and somewhat[MASK] is a relic of the past <unk> the future of health care is smart teams and you 'd better be on that team for yourself now[MASK] <unk> last thing that i want to talk to you about is care customization because[MASK] if you 've got care anywhere and you 've got care networking those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system but there 's still too much guesswork <unk> [MASK] randomized clinical trials were actually invented in <unk>[MASK] to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis and those are important[MASK] <unk> don 't get me wrong these population studies that we 've done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives <unk> but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages <unk>[MASK] not unique individuals because at the end of the day the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied [MASK] <unk> patients and the magic here is experiment on my[MASK] avatar[MASK] in software not my body in suffering [MASK] now i 've had two examples i want to quickly share with you of this kind of care customization on my own journey [MASK] the first was quite simple <unk> i finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity it 's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live[MASK] <unk> i was optimizing my life for quality of life and quality of life for me means time in snow [MASK] so on my chart i forced them to put patient goal low doses of drugs over longer periods of time [MASK] side effects friendly to skiing [MASK] and i think that 's why i achieved longevity i[MASK] <unk> therapy was as important as the pharmaceuticals that i had [MASK] now the second example of customization and by the way <unk> you can 't customize care if you don 't know your own goals so health care can 't know those until you know your own health care goals but the second example i want to give you is i happened <unk>[MASK] <unk> to be an early guinea pig and i got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced now it took about two weeks of processing on intel 's highest end servers to make this happen and another six months of human and computing labor to make sense of all of that data [MASK] <unk> all of that they said yes those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans all of those years ago were wrong and we have a better path forward [MASK] the future that intel 's working on now is to figure out how to make that computing for personalized medicine go from months and weeks to even hours [MASK] and make this kind of tool available <unk> not just in the[MASK] <unk> research hospitals around the world <unk> but in the mainstream every patient every clinic with access to whole genome sequencing <unk> and i tell you this kind of care customization for everything from your <unk>[MASK] <unk> goals to your genetics will be the most game changing transformation that we witness in health care during our lifetime [MASK] <unk> but this vision will completely fail if we don 't step up as caregivers[MASK] and as patients to take on new roles it 's what my friend verna said <unk> wake up and take control of your health because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people[MASK] caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways <unk> and it 's in that spirit that i want to introduce you to one last friend very quickly[MASK] <unk> so tracey just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you[MASK] <unk> it was really easy i only had one night in the hospital <unk> the surgery was done laparoscopically so i have just five very small scars on my abdomen <unk> and i had four weeks away from work and went back to doing everything i 'd done before without any changes ed [MASK] well i probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again so [MASK] thank you feel likes a really trite word but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my[MASK] this ted stage and all of the ted stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies and i 've done that here today <unk> [MASK] and i 've seen amazing things coming from ted speakers i mean my gosh <unk> artificial kidneys even printable kidneys that are coming [MASK] but until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us and[MASK] <unk> even when they are it 's up to us to care for and even save one another i hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves[MASK] and for everyone thanks so much[MASK]
