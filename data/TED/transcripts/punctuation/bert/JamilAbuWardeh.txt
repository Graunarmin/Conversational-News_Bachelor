 is about righting writing wrongs no the sound 's not faulty righting writing wrongs the middle east is huge [MASK] and with all our problems one thing 's for sure <unk> we love to laugh <unk> i think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences <unk> we need to take our responsibilities[MASK] <unk> seriously but not ourselves <unk> [MASK] don 't get me wrong it 's not like we don 't have comedy in the middle east i grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait syria <unk> egypt used laughter to unite the region [MASK] just as football can [MASK] now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves before others can laugh with us this is the story of the rise and rise of[MASK] a stand up uprising if you will [MASK] working in london as tv maker and writer i quickly realized that comedy connects[MASK] audiences [MASK] now the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand up comedy circuit <unk> where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly <unk> [MASK] an unfortunate connection for us maybe but it reminds me that[MASK] <unk> we 'd like to thank one man for over the past decade working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world <unk> specifically[MASK] comedians with a middle eastern background [MASK] like my good friends dean and maysoon at the bottom of the screen who two years after nine eleven started a festival[MASK] to change the way middle easterners are perceived in the world it 's still going strong[MASK] with positive press to die for [MASK] also three guys working for years in los angeles an iranian a palestinian and an egyptian [MASK] created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act [MASK] and wherever they went <unk> they killed <unk> [MASK] now i didn 't start this fire but i did pour petrol[MASK] <unk> i moved to dubai as the head of original content for a western tv network my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience [MASK] now the american head of programming[MASK] wanted new local arabic comedy in a thick arabic accent my brain went berfect now <unk> [MASK] i had friends in the u s who[MASK] <unk> had started a successful new tribe and i had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the middle east[MASK] and pushing them over the tipping point towards success [MASK] now as with any new idea it wasn 't easy [MASK] i had four phases to this plan first we 'd need to buy content from the west and air it <unk> then i 'd bring my friends and we 'd show local amateurs how it 's done <unk> we would film that and air it <unk> and then i could work <unk>[MASK] <unk> with the local amateurs and write new comedy i excitedly presented this to the big boss <unk> and his reaction[MASK] <unk> was um i don 't get it [MASK] so i retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub <unk> [MASK] now fast forward two years to early two thousand and seven [MASK] the earth rotated as did our management and as if[MASK] by divine intervention[MASK] <unk> came together to help this revolution[MASK] take shape <unk> here 's how the dots connected first the axis guys recorded a comedy central special that aired in the states <unk> and it was getting great hits on youtube [MASK] our new french ceo believed in the power of positive pr and[MASK] ideas du bon marche[MASK] <unk> let 's just say value for money [MASK] i produced in dubai a show for ahmed ahmed to showcase his new axis special to a packed room i invited our new ceo and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels his reaction was very simple [MASK] let 's make this happen <unk> [MASK] and one more thing no don 't f it up so[MASK] i quickly went to work with a great team around me[MASK] <unk> i happened to find a funny guy to present it in arabic who is originally korean [MASK] a perfect fit for the axis of evil [MASK] this is all true <unk> now while preparing for the tour <unk> i had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive i used the three bs of stand up don 'ts as i call them in the middle east [MASK] blue content keep it clean beliefs not religion and the third b bolitics[MASK] <unk> stay away from bolitics in the middle east oh course you might think what 's left without bolitics sex and religion how can you make people laugh <unk> i 'd say watch any successful[MASK] <unk> family friendly sitcom in the west for your answers <unk> now <unk> [MASK] were the axis successful [MASK] in five countries in just under a month we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live we had millions see them on tv and on tv news [MASK] in jordan we had his majesty the king come and see them[MASK] in fact they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their dvd even before it was released in the middle east <unk> anywhere you go so[MASK] everywhere we went <unk> we auditioned amateurs we filmed that process and aired a documentary <unk> i called it three guys and wonho [MASK] it really is his name [MASK] and all this tv and internet exposure[MASK] has led to a great many recruits to our cause [MASK] in dubai this year we 've just had the first all women 's homegrown stand up show and notice two of them are wearing headscarves and yes even they can laugh [MASK] dubai to me is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen [MASK] twenty years ago no one had heard of it <unk> look at it now with an inspirational[MASK] <unk> leader i think this year <unk> the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like[MASK] adding a finger to that hand that points[MASK] at all those who spread fallacious stories about us [MASK] now in three short years we 've come a long way with stand up comedy shows happening even[MASK] <unk> comics are now going to the new york festival and the lebanese brilliant lebanese nemr abou nassar <unk> we featured in our first tour has just been performing in l a ' s legendary comedy clubs so clearly from the inside we are doing our best to change our image and it 's exploding [MASK] so as for the outsiders looking in watch the cnn report on the second amman comedy festival the reporter[MASK] <unk> did a great job and i thank her but somebody forgot to send the positive pr email to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom for example when dean[MASK] talks the ticker says u s suspect gave <unk> ' actionable intel well if you 're used to listening to comedians then[MASK] i 'm not surprised sadly this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks[MASK] <unk> angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel <unk> we have a positive story to tell[MASK] and image to sell in fact one thing 's for sure in my experience <unk> we love to laugh[MASK] like hell [MASK] here are three questions that i like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story[MASK] one is the middle east being shown in a current time and correct context [MASK] two do the middle eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes[MASK] <unk> is the middle eastern character being played by one [MASK] clearly <unk> there are wrongs that need to be righted <unk> we 've started in our region [MASK] my challenge to the rest of the world is[MASK] please start using positive middle eastern images in your stories for inspiration go to one of our festivals go online <unk> [MASK] drop us a line let 's change the narrative together[MASK] and let 's start righting[MASK] <unk> writing wrongs i 'd like to end before going back to the middle east with a quote from one of the greatest sheikhs[MASK] to put quill to parchment as my father likes to call him asheikh azubare as my mother would say[MASK]
