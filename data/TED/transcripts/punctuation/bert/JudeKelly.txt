 <unk> why do we think that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance and stories by women[MASK] are thought to be merely about women[MASK] <unk> my grandmother left school when she was twelve she had fourteen children [MASK] my mother left school when she was fifteen <unk> she was a secretary <unk> i graduated from university to become a theater director <unk> [MASK] and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i 'll never meet fought for women to have rights [MASK] get the vote <unk> get education have progress <unk> and i 'm determined to do[MASK] <unk> i started a festival called wow women of the world seven years ago and it 's now in twenty countries across five continents and one of those countries is somaliland in africa <unk> [MASK] so i traveled there last year <unk> and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves the[MASK] <unk> these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world <unk> [MASK] these paintings are thought to be round about nine thousand to eleven thousand years old <unk> [MASK] art [MASK] what humanity has done ever since it evolved <unk> [MASK] it 's how we speak about ourselves <unk> how we understand our identity how we look at our surroundings who we find out about each other because of the meaning of our lives[MASK] <unk> lives that 's what art is for [MASK] so look at this little picture i think it 's a little girl <unk> i thought it was a bit like me when i was a little girl[MASK] <unk> and i thought well who painted this joyful <unk> youthful figure <unk> [MASK] and i asked the curator of the caves i said tell me about the men and women who painted these [MASK] and he looked at me absolutely askance <unk> and he said women didn 't paint these pictures[MASK] and i said well it was eleven thousand years ago i said how do you know [MASK] and he said women don 't do these things men made these marks women don 't [MASK] now <unk> i wasn 't really surprised <unk> because that 's an attitude that i 've seen continuously all my[MASK] <unk> life as a theater maker [MASK] we are told that divine knowledge comes down through the masculine <unk> [MASK] whether it be to the imam <unk> the priest <unk> the rabbi <unk> the holy man[MASK] similarly we 're told that creative genius resides in the masculine that it is[MASK] <unk> the masculine that will be able to tell us about who we really are that the masculine will tell the universal story on behalf of all of us [MASK] whereas women artists will really just talk about women 's experiences women 's issues only really relevant to women and of passing interest to men[MASK] and really only some men and it 's that conviction [MASK] <unk> that i think colors so much of whether we 're prepared to believe that women 's stories really matter <unk> and unless we 're prepared to believe that women 's stories really matter [MASK] then women 's rights don 't really matter <unk> and then change can 't really come[MASK] <unk> i want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal[MASK] <unk> i took my two children when they were little caroline was eight[MASK] and robby was five to see e t [MASK] and it 's a fantastic story of this little alien who ends up in an american family with a mum two brothers and a sister <unk> [MASK] but he wants to go[MASK] <unk> not only that but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him <unk> and they 're looking for him <unk> [MASK] so the children have a plot they decide they 're going to take him back to his spaceship as soon as they can [MASK] and they plop him in a bicycle basket and off they ride <unk> [MASK] but unfortunately <unk> the baddies have found out and they 're catching up and they 've got sirens and they 've got their guns they 've got the[MASK] <unk> closing up on the children and the children are never going to make it and then all of a sudden magically <unk> the bikes fly up in the air <unk> [MASK] over the clouds <unk> over the moon <unk> and they 're going to save e t [MASK] so i turn to see my children 's faces <unk> and robby is enraptured <unk> he 's there with them he 's saving e t he 's a happy boy <unk> [MASK] <unk> why can 't i come and then all of a sudden i realized they weren 't children they were boys[MASK] all boys [MASK] and caroline who had invested so much in e t well she wasn 't invited to save him <unk> and she felt humiliated and spurned[MASK] <unk> so i wrote to steven spielberg[MASK] and i said i don 't know if you understand the psychological importance of what 's happened and[MASK] are you prepared to pay for the therapy bills twenty years later i haven 't had a word back from him <unk> but i 'm still hopeful[MASK] <unk> but i thought it was interesting because if you read reviews of what he intended with e t he says very specifically [MASK] i wanted the world to understand that we should love and embrace difference [MASK] but somehow he didn 't include the idea of girls ' difference in this thinking <unk> [MASK] he thought he was writing a story about all humanity caroline thought he was marginalizing half of humanity <unk> [MASK] he thought he was writing a story about human[MASK] <unk> goodness she thought he was writing a lad 's heroic adventure <unk> and this is common [MASK] men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication [MASK] but of course how could they be they are writing from male experience through male 's eyes [MASK] we have to have a look at this ourselves we have to be[MASK] <unk> prepared to go back through all our books and our films all our favorite things <unk> and say actually this is written by a male artist not an artist [MASK] we have to see that so many of these stories are written through a male perspective <unk> which is fine <unk> [MASK] but then females need to have fifty percent of the rights for the stage[MASK] <unk> the film the novel the place of creativity [MASK] let me talk about hamlet to be or not to be that is the question <unk> [MASK] but it 's not my question my question is why was i taught as a young woman that this was the quintessential example[MASK] of human dilemma and human experience it 's a marvelous story but actually <unk> it 's about a young[MASK] <unk> be able to make it as a powerful figure in a male world unless he takes revenge for his father 's murder <unk> [MASK] he talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option <unk> [MASK] but the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide ophelia <unk> after she 's been humiliated and abused by him never gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings <unk> [MASK] finished with ophelia he turns on his mum because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex [MASK] laughter it is a great story <unk> [MASK] but it is a story about male conflict male dilemma male struggle <unk> [MASK] but i was told this was the story of human beings <unk> despite the fact that it only had two women in it [MASK] and unless i reeducate myself i am always going to think that women 's stories[MASK] <unk> matter less than men 's [MASK] a woman could have written hamlet but she would have written it differently <unk> and it wouldn 't have had global recognition [MASK] as the writer margaret atwood says when a man writes about doing the dishes <unk> it 's realism [MASK] when a woman writes about doing it it 's an unfortunate genetic[MASK] <unk> this is not just something that belongs to then i mean [MASK] when i was a young girl wanting desperately to be a theater director <unk> this is what my male lecturer said to me [MASK] well there are three women directors in britain he said jude [MASK] there 's joan knight who 's a lesbian there 's joan littlewood who 's retired and there 's buzz goodbody who 's just killed herself <unk> so which of those three would you like[MASK] <unk> slur on gay women the fact is he wanted to humiliate me <unk> [MASK] he thought it was silly that i wanted to be a director <unk> [MASK] and i told my friend marin alsop the conductor and she said oh yes well <unk> my music teacher said exactly the same he said ' women don 't conduct ' [MASK] but all these years later <unk> we 've made our mark[MASK] <unk> the current head of the paris conservatoire said recently it takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony [MASK] and women are too weak [MASK] laughter the artist george baselitz said well the fact is women can 't paint <unk> well they can 't paint very well the writer v s naipaul said two years[MASK] <unk> i can read two paragraphs and know immediately if it 's written by a woman and i just stop reading because it 's not worthy of me audience whoa [MASK] and it goes on [MASK] we have to find a way[MASK] of stopping young girls and women feeling not only that their story doesn 't matter <unk> but they 're not allowed to be the storyteller <unk> [MASK] because once you feel that you can 't stand in the central space[MASK] and speak on behalf of[MASK] <unk> the world <unk> you will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small select group [MASK] you will tend to do smaller work on smaller stages your economic power will be less your reach of audiences will be less [MASK] and your credit will be less[MASK] as an artist <unk> and we do finally give artists these incredible prominent spaces[MASK] <unk> the world because they are our storytellers [MASK] now <unk> why should it matter to you if you 're not an artist <unk> supposing you 're an accountant or an entrepreneur or a medic or a scientist should you care about women artists [MASK] absolutely you must <unk> because as you can see from the cave paintings [MASK] all civilizations all of humanity[MASK] have relied upon artists[MASK] <unk> tell the human story <unk> and if the human story is finally told by men take my word for it <unk> it will be about men [MASK] so let 's make a change let 's make a change to all our institutions and not just in the west don 't forget this message[MASK] of[MASK] <unk> of women to hold creative genius is being told to girls and women in nigeria[MASK] in china in russia in indonesia all over the world girls and women are being told that they can 't finally hold the idea of creative inspiration and[MASK] i want to ask you do you believe that do you believe that women can be a creative genius[MASK] <unk> support women artists <unk> buy their work insist that their voices are heard find platforms on which their voices will be made [MASK] and remember this [MASK] that in a sense if we 're going to get past this moment of a world where we know that we are unequal [MASK] it 's artists who have to imagine a different world[MASK] <unk> i 'm calling on all artists women and men to imagine a <unk> gender equal world <unk> [MASK] let 's paint it <unk> let 's draw it <unk> let 's write about it let 's film it and if we could imagine it <unk> then we would have the energy[MASK] and the stamina to work towards it when i see this little[MASK] <unk> eleven thousand years ago <unk> i want to know[MASK] that the little girl now can stand there and think she 's entitled to her dreams she 's entitled to her destiny[MASK] and she 's entitled to speak on behalf of the whole world be recognized for it and applauded[MASK]
