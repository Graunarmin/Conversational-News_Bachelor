 <unk> i 'm sitting next to howard i don 't know howard obviously and he 's going i hope you 're not next[MASK] <unk> amazing performance i kind of erased everything in my brain[MASK] to follow that <unk> let me start some place <unk> i 'm interested[MASK] i kind of do the same thing <unk> but i don 't move my body and instead of using human figures[MASK] <unk> time and space <unk> [MASK] i work in the mineral world <unk> [MASK] i work with more or less inert matter <unk> [MASK] and i organize it and well <unk> it 's also a bit different because an architect versus <unk> let 's say a dance company[MASK] finally is a negotiation between one 's private world one 's conceptual world the world of ideas[MASK] <unk> of aspirations of inventions [MASK] with the relationship of the exterior world and all the the limitations[MASK] the naysayers because i have to say for my whole career[MASK] <unk> if there 's anything that 's been consistent it[MASK] 's been that you can 't do it no matter what i 've done what i 've tried to do everybody says it can 't be done <unk> and it 's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas <unk> [MASK] and to be an architect somehow[MASK] you have to negotiate between left and right and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place[MASK] and the the outside world and then make it understood i can start any number of places because this process is also[MASK] i think very different from some of the morning sessions which you had such a kind of very clear <unk> such a lineal idea like the last one[MASK] <unk> that i think the creative process in architecture the design process is extremely circuitous it 's labyrinthine <unk> [MASK] it 's calvino 's idea of the quickest way between two points is the[MASK] circuitous line not the straight line <unk> and definitely my life has been part of that [MASK] i 'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things but basically what we do is we try to give[MASK] coherence to the world we make[MASK] <unk> physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process they make cities and those things[MASK] are the reflection of the processes <unk> and the time that they are made and what i 'm doing is attempting to synthesize[MASK] the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material [MASK] because really all i 'm interested in always as an[MASK] <unk> architect is the way things are produced because that 's what i do right <unk> and it 's not based on an a priori notion i have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain <unk>[MASK] and saying this is what it looks like in fact somebody mentioned ewan maybe it was you in your introduction[MASK] <unk> wow it doesn 't work that way for me at all i have no interest in that whatsoever <unk> architecture is the beginning of something because it 's if you 're not involved in first principles if you 're not involved in[MASK] the absolute <unk> the beginning of that generative process <unk> it 's cake decoration and i 've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators if anybody 's involved in cake decorations it 's not what i 'm interested[MASK] <unk> and so in the formation of things in giving it form [MASK] in concretizing these things <unk> it starts with some notion of how one organizes <unk> and i 've had for thirty years an interest in[MASK] a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear <unk> and to understand the nature of the final[MASK] result of[MASK] <unk> representing the building itself [MASK] there 's been a continual relationship between inventions which are private [MASK] and reality <unk> which has been important to me a project which is part of an exhibition in copenhagen ten years ago which was the modeling of a hippocampus <unk>[MASK] the territory of the brain that records short term memory and the documentation of that <unk> the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that[MASK] <unk> experience <unk> and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer [MASK] observing every kilometer a particular object of desire <unk> and then placing that within this and the notion was that i could make an organization not built on normal coherencies <unk> but built on non sequiturs [MASK] built on randomness <unk> and i 'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion[MASK] <unk> of the city an accretional notion of the city and that led to various ideas of organization and then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity <unk>[MASK] of systems <unk> and it 's not any single system that makes the work it 's the relationship it 's the dynamics between the systems which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture[MASK] and those systems could be identified and they could be grouped together and of course today with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping etc we have the mechanisms <unk>[MASK] <unk> to understand and to respond to these systems and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that 's all we do we 're producing spaces that accommodate human activity <unk> and what[MASK] <unk> 'm interested in is not the styling of that <unk> but the relationship of that as it enhances[MASK] that activity <unk> [MASK] and that directly connects to ideas of city making this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very very large city project that came directly out of this process <unk>[MASK] which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it [MASK] <unk> again enormous enormous competition on the hudson river and in new york that we were asked to do three years ago <unk> which uses these processes and what you 're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a a methodology[MASK] that uses notions of these multiple forces that deals with the the enormity of the problem the complexity of the problem <unk> when we 're designing cities at larger[MASK] <unk> and larger aggregates because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the the development aggregate and as the aggregates get larger we require <unk>[MASK] <unk> more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems <unk> [MASK] <unk> again a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated very <unk>[MASK] organisms <unk> and then also was working with broad strategies <unk> in this case we only used[MASK] fifteen of the sixty acres of land and the forty five acres was a park and would become the legacy[MASK] of the olympic village[MASK] <unk> and it would become the second largest park in the boroughs etc <unk> [MASK] its position of course in the middle of manhattan it 's on hunter 's point <unk> [MASK] and then the broader ideas of city making start having direct influences on architecture [MASK] on the elements that make up the broader scheme <unk> the buildings themselves [MASK] and start guiding us [MASK] architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place and so i[MASK] i can start this discussion in any number of places and i 've chosen three or four to talk about[MASK] <unk> and it has also to do with an interest in[MASK] the vast[MASK] kind of territory that architecture touches <unk> it literally is is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base [MASK] <unk> it doesn 't somehow have a connective tissue to this is jim dine <unk> and it[MASK] 's the absence of presence <unk> etc <unk> it 's the clothing the skin without the presence of the character it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work and[MASK] it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface <unk> and[MASK] it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very kind of complex space and the idea was the[MASK] <unk> relationship of the space which was made up of the fold of the of the image and the dialectic or the[MASK] the conflict between the figuration and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space which were in dialog <unk> [MASK] and it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things <unk> and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we[MASK] flattened out surfaces[MASK] <unk> and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations and this was the first prototype in korea as we[MASK] 're dealing with a dynamic envelope <unk> and then the same characteristic of the fabric it has a material identity and it 's translucent and it[MASK] 's porous <unk> and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is and that turned right away into another project this is the caltrans building in los[MASK] <unk> angeles <unk> and now we 're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated [MASK] again it 's a very very simple notion <unk> if you look at most buildings what you look at is the building the facade and it is the building and all of a sudden we 're kind of moving away and we 're separating the skin from the body and that 's going to lead to broader performance criteria which i 'm going to talk about in a minute and you 're looking at how it[MASK] <unk> middle of los angeles right across from city hall and as it moves it takes pieces of the earth with it it bends up it 's part of a sign system which was part of the[MASK] kind of legacy of los angeles the <unk>[MASK] <unk> signing etc <unk> and then it allows one to penetrate the work itself <unk> it 's transparent[MASK] <unk> and it allows you to understand i think what is always the most interesting thing in any building which is the actual constructional processes that make it and it[MASK] 's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work which is not occupied [MASK] because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it 's separated from function <unk> and this is an area that allows for that and then the skin starts transforming into other[MASK] <unk> we 're using light as a building material in this case we 're working with keith sonnier in new york and we 're making this large outside room which is possible in los angeles and which is very much reflective of the <unk>[MASK] urban the contemporary urban environments that you would find in shibuya or you 'd find in mexico city or sao paulo etc that have to do with activating the city[MASK] over a longer span of time and that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in los angeles <unk> [MASK] transparency and an image which may be closest talks about the[MASK] the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material [MASK] well that immediately turned into something much broader and as a scope and again we 're looking at an early sketch[MASK] where i 'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower[MASK] <unk> tower this is a building in san francisco which is under construction [MASK] and now it turned into something much much broader as a problem <unk> and it has to do with performance this will be the first building in the united states that took[MASK] well i can 't say it took the air conditioning out it 's a hybrid <unk> i wanted a pure thing and i can 't get it it 's a wrong attitude actually because the hybrid is probably more interesting but we took the air conditioning[MASK] <unk> there 's some air conditioning left in the base but the skin now moves on hydraulics <unk> it forces air through through a venturi force if there 's no wind it adjusts continually <unk> [MASK] and we removed the air conditioning huge huge thing [MASK] half a million dollars a year delta[MASK] <unk> ten of these it 's just under a million square feet eight hundred and some thousand square feet ten of these would power sausalito the delta on this and so now what we 're looking at as the projects[MASK] <unk> with broader problems that they expand the capabilities in terms of their[MASK] <unk> basic sense <unk> and then well he was probably looking at this this is nazca <unk> this is seven hundred years ago the most amazing <unk>[MASK] land sculptures they 're just totally[MASK] incredible <unk> and that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw how we work <unk> this is the first sketch of a high school in pomona[MASK] <unk> a model a conceptual kind of idea <unk> and it 's the reshaping of the earth to make it occupiable so it puts two hundred thousand square feet of stuff[MASK] that make a high school work in the surface of that earth there it is modeled as it was[MASK] developing into a piece of work and there it is again <unk> as it 's starting to get resolved tectonically <unk> and then there 's the school <unk>[MASK] we 're interested in participating with education [MASK] i have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates x y and z function what i 'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people it demands some sort of notion of inquiry[MASK] because it 's a system that 's developed not sculpturally it[MASK] 's an idea that started from my first discussion it has to do with a broad consistent logic <unk> and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building[MASK] <unk> there 's an overt at least there 's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because i was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem <unk>[MASK] as one would understand that and the second project that was just finished in los angeles that uses some of the same ideas it uses landscape as a major idea then again we 're doing the headquarters for <unk>[MASK] <unk> noaa national oceanographic and atmospheric agency outside of washington in maryland [MASK] <unk> satellites zipping around at[MASK] plus or minus one hundred miles and the site 's in red <unk> and[MASK] what we really want to do well <unk> the architects if there are architects out there this is the laugier hut <unk> this is the primitive hut that 's been around for so long and what we what we wanted to do is really build this [MASK] because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world and we wanted them to look down[MASK] <unk> their satellite how they see their own site that eight acre site <unk> and we wanted nothing left we wanted it to stay green there 's actually three baseball fields on it right now and they 're going to stay there we put one piece directly north south and it holds the the dishes at the ears right[MASK] and then right below that the processing <unk> and the mission lift and the mission control room <unk> and all the other spaces are underground <unk> [MASK] and what you look at is an aircraft carrier that 's performance driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes <unk> and that the building itself is[MASK] in the lower portion [MASK] broken up by a series of courts and it 's five acres of uninterrupted horizontal space for their administrative offices <unk> and then that in turn <unk> propelled us to <unk>[MASK] <unk> look at larger scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue [MASK] <unk> the ecb actually coop himmelblau in vienna just won this project where the building was separated into a series of[MASK] landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue[MASK] of of a park which is parallel to the the river and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric the social cultural and the landscape[MASK] recreational fabric of the city and the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing but something that 's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time [MASK] and a project that was realized in in austria <unk> the hooper bank which again used this idea of connecting typology the traditional buildings and[MASK] morphology or the relationship of the development of land as an idea into a complex which is a piece of a city where we can see part of[MASK] <unk> it is literally just this augmenting this movement of the land that 's a very simple idea <unk> of just lifting it up and occupying it and other parts are much more energetic and intense and talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make[MASK] that have to do with putting a series of systems together <unk> and then where part of it is in the ground part of it is is oppositional lifts one enters the building as it[MASK] and it becomes part of the idea <unk> and then the skin the edges of this all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of[MASK] seismic shifts <unk> geologic shifts right <unk> and it makes for event space[MASK] and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior and those interiors again are promoting transparency for the workplace <unk> which has been a continual interest of ours[MASK] <unk> and then again in a more kind of traditional setting this is a graduate student housing in toronto <unk> and it 's[MASK] very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city <unk> the main idea was the gateway where it breaks the site and the building occupies both the public space and the private space [MASK] and it 's that territory[MASK] of[MASK] it 's this thing <unk> i visited the site[MASK] <unk> many times and everybody kind of you can see this from two kilometers away it 's an exact center of the street and the whole notion is to engage the public to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city [MASK] and finally one of the most interesting projects it 's a courthouse <unk> and what i want to talk about this is the supreme court of course and[MASK] <unk> dealing with michael hogan the chief justice of oregon you could not proceed without making this negotiation[MASK] between one 's own values and the relationship of the character you 're working with and how he understands the court because i 'm showing him of course corbusier <unk>[MASK] at at savoy which is one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight which is the beginning of modern architecture <unk> well <unk> then we get to this image and this is where the project started [MASK] <unk> interested[MASK] in the phenomenon that 's taking place in here [MASK] and really what we 're talking about is constructing reality <unk> [MASK] and i 'm a character that 's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there 's no such thing as nature any more nature is gone nature in the 19th century sense [MASK] alright nature is only a cultural edifice today <unk> right we construct it and we construct those ideas[MASK] and then of course <unk> this one our governor at the moment <unk> and[MASK] we we spent some time with conan <unk> believe it or not and then that led us to kind of the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic architectural and it forced us to talk about[MASK] notions of how we work and the dynamics of that <unk> and what other sources of the work is <unk> and it led us to the project[MASK] <unk> absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of[MASK] the traditional courthouse you 'll find a stair that 's the same length as the supreme court here 's a piano nobile which is a device used in the renaissance <unk> [MASK] the courts were made of that the skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated[MASK] stonework <unk> but which were embedded with fragments of the constitution which were part of the little process all set on a plinth[MASK] that defined it from the community thank you so much[MASK]
