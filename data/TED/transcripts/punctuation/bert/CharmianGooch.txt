 <unk> we talk about corruption there are typical types of individuals that spring to mind[MASK] there 's the former soviet megalomaniacs saparmurat niyazov he was one of them[MASK] until his death in two thousand and six he was the all powerful leader of turkmenistan a central asian[MASK] <unk> country rich in natural gas[MASK] now he really loved to issue presidential decrees and one renamed the months of the year including after himself and his mother[MASK] he spent millions of dollars creating a bizarre personality cult[MASK] and his crowning glory was the building of a forty[MASK] foot high gold plated statue of himself which stood proudly in the capital 's central square and rotated to follow the sun[MASK] he was a slightly unusual guy[MASK] and then there 's that cliche the african dictator or minister or official there 's teodorin obiang[MASK] so his daddy is president for life of equatorial guinea a west african nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the[MASK] <unk> ninety s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record[MASK] the vast majority of its people are living in really miserable poverty despite an income per capita that 's on a par with that of portugal[MASK] so obiang junior well he buys himself a dollar thirty million mansion in malibu california[MASK] i 've been up to its front gates i can tell you it 's a magnificent spread[MASK] he bought an euro eighteen million art collection that used to belong to fashion designer yves saint laurent[MASK] a stack of fabulous sports cars some costing a million dollars apiece oh and a gulfstream jet too[MASK] now get this until recently he was earning an official monthly salary of less than seven thousand dollars[MASK] <unk> there 's dan etete well he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president abacha and it just so happens he 's a convicted money launderer too[MASK] we 've spent a great deal of time investigating a dollar one billion that 's right a dollar one billion oil deal that he was involved with[MASK] and what we found[MASK] was pretty shocking but more about that later[MASK] so[MASK] it 's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries[MASK] that we personally may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected[MASK] by what might be going on[MASK] but does it just happen over there[MASK] well at twenty two i was very lucky my first job[MASK] out of university was investigating the illegal trade in african ivory and that 's how my relationship with corruption really began[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three with two friends who were colleagues simon taylor and patrick alley[MASK] we set up an organization called global witness our first campaign was investigating the role of illegal logging in funding the war in cambodia[MASK] so a few years later and it 's now one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and i 'm in angola undercover investigating blood diamonds[MASK] perhaps you saw the film the hollywood film blood diamond the one with leonardo dicaprio well some of that sprang from from our work[MASK] luanda it was full of land mine victims who were struggling to survive on the streets and war orphans living in sewers under the[MASK] <unk> and a tiny very wealthy elite who gossiped about shopping trips to brazil and portugal and it was a slightly crazy place[MASK] so i 'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room feeling just totally overwhelmed but it wasn 't about blood diamonds[MASK] because i 'd been speaking to lots of people there who well they talked about a different problem that of a massive web of corruption on a[MASK] <unk> global scale and millions of oil dollars going missing and for what was then a very small organization of just a few people[MASK] trying to even begin to think how we might tackle that was an enormous challenge[MASK] and in the years that i 've been and we 've all been campaigning and investigating i 've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global massive scale possible well it it isn 't just greed or the misuse[MASK] <unk> of power or that nebulous phrase weak governance i mean yes it 's all of those[MASK] but corruption it 's made possible by the actions of global facilitators[MASK] so let 's go back to some of those people i talked about earlier now they 're all people we 've investigated and they 're all people who couldn 't do what they do alone[MASK] take obiang junior well he didn 't end up with high end art and luxury houses without[MASK] <unk> help he did business with global banks a bank in paris held accounts of companies controlled by him one of which was used to buy the art[MASK] and american banks well they funneled seventy three million dollars into the states some of which was used to buy that california mansion[MASK] and he didn 't do all[MASK] <unk> this in his own name either he used shell companies he used one to buy the property and another which was in somebody else 's name[MASK] to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place[MASK] and then there 's dan etete well[MASK] when he was oil minister he awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars[MASK] to a company that guess what[MASK] yeah he was the hidden owner of[MASK] now it was then much later traded on[MASK] with the kind assistance of the nigerian government now i have to be careful what i say here[MASK] to subsidiaries of shell and the italian eni two of the biggest oil companies around[MASK] so the reality is is that the engine of corruption well it exists far beyond the shores of countries like equatorial guinea or nigeria or turkmenistan[MASK] this engine well it 's driven by our international banking system[MASK] <unk> problem of anonymous shell companies and by the secrecy that we have afforded big oil gas and mining operations[MASK] and most of all by the failure of our politicians to back up their rhetoric and do something really meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff[MASK] now let 's take the banks first well it 's not going to come as any surprise for me to tell you that banks accept[MASK] <unk> dirty money[MASK] but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too[MASK] for example in sarawak malaysia[MASK] now this region it has just five percent of its forests left intact five percent[MASK] so how did that happen well because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars[MASK] <unk> from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years[MASK] so we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite[MASK] and the resulting footage well it made some people very angry and you can see that on youtube but it proved what we had long suspected because it showed how[MASK] <unk> the state 's chief minister despite his later denials used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family[MASK] and hsbc well we know that hsbc bankrolled the region 's largest logging companies that were responsible for some of that destruction in sarawak and elsewhere[MASK] the bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process but it earned around one hundred and thirty million dollars[MASK] now shortly after our expose very shortly after our expose earlier this year the bank announced a policy review on this and is this progress[MASK] maybe but we 're going to be keeping a very close eye on that case[MASK] and then there 's the problem of anonymous shell companies well we 've all[MASK] <unk> heard about what they are i think and we all know they 're used quite a bit by people and companies who are trying to avoid paying their proper dues to society[MASK] also known as taxes[MASK] but what doesn 't usually come to light is how[MASK] shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money transformational sums of money from poor countries[MASK] in virtually every case of corruption that we 've investigated shell companies have appeared[MASK] and sometimes it 's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal[MASK] a recent study by the world bank looked at two hundred cases of corruption[MASK] it found that over seventy percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies totaling almost fifty six billion dollars[MASK] now many of these companies were in america or the united kingdom its[MASK] <unk> territories and crown dependencies and so it 's not just an offshore problem it 's an on shore one too[MASK] you see shell companies they 're central to the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites rather than ordinary citizens[MASK] one striking recent case that we 've investigated is how the government in the democratic republic of congo sold off a series of valuable state owned mining[MASK] <unk> assets to shell companies in the british virgin islands[MASK] so we spoke to sources in country trawled through company documents and other information trying to piece together a really true picture of the deal[MASK] and we were alarmed to find that these shell companies had quickly flipped many of the assets on for huge profits to major international mining companies[MASK] listed in london[MASK] <unk> now the africa progress panel led by kofi annan they 've calculated that congo may have lost[MASK] more than one point three billion dollars from these deals[MASK] <unk> that 's almost twice the country 's annual health and education budget combined[MASK] and will the people of congo will they ever get their money back well the answer to that question and who was really involved and[MASK] <unk> really happened well that 's going to probably remain locked away[MASK] in the secretive company registries of the british virgin islands and elsewhere unless we all do something about it[MASK] and how about the oil gas and mining companies okay maybe it 's a bit of a cliche to talk about them corruption in that sector no surprise there 's corruption everywhere so why focus on that sector[MASK] well because there 's a lot at stake[MASK] <unk> stake in two thousand and eleven natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost nineteen to one in africa asia and latin america[MASK] nineteen to one[MASK] now that 's a hell of a lot of schools and universities and hospitals and business startups many of which haven 't materialized and never will because some of that money has simply been stolen away[MASK] <unk> now let 's go back to the oil and mining companies and let 's go back to dan etete and that dollar one billion deal and now forgive me i 'm going to read[MASK] the next bit because it 's a very live issue and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right[MASK] now on the surface the deal appeared straightforward subsidiaries of shell and eni paid the nigerian government for the block[MASK] the nigerian government transferred precisely the same amount to the very dollar to[MASK] an account earmarked for a shell company[MASK] whose hidden owner was etete now that 's not bad going for a convicted money launderer[MASK] and here 's the thing after many months of digging around and and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents we found evidence that in fact shell[MASK] <unk> and eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company[MASK] and frankly it 's hard to believe they didn 't know who they were really dealing with there[MASK] now[MASK] it just shouldn 't take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went i mean these are state assets they 're supposed to be used for the benefit of the people in the country[MASK] but in some countries[MASK] citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so[MASK] and finally[MASK] well there are those who believe that corruption is unavoidable[MASK] it 's just how some business is done it 's too complex and difficult to change so in effect what we just accept it[MASK] but as a campaigner[MASK] <unk> and investigator i have a different view because i 've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum[MASK] in the oil and mining sector for example there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when global witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent well some people laughed at the[MASK] <unk> extreme naivete of that small idea[MASK] but literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency[MASK] and now it 's fast becoming the norm and the law two thirds of the value of the world 's oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws two thirds so this is change happening[MASK] <unk> progress but[MASK] but we 're not there yet by far because it really isn 't about corruption somewhere over there is it[MASK] in a globalized world corruption is a truly globalized business and one that needs global solutions supported and pushed by us all as global citizens[MASK] right here[MASK]
