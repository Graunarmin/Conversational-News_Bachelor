 <unk> never forget the sound[MASK] of laughing with my friends i 'll never forget the sound of my mother 's voice right before i fell asleep[MASK] <unk> the comforting sound of water[MASK] trickling down a stream <unk> [MASK] imagine my fear <unk> pure fear [MASK] when at the age of ten <unk> i was told i was going to lose my hearing <unk> [MASK] and over the next five years it progressed until i was classified as profoundly deaf <unk> [MASK] but i believe[MASK] <unk> believe that losing my hearing[MASK] was one of the greatest gifts i 've ever received [MASK] you see <unk> i get to experience the world in a unique way <unk> and i believe that these unique experiences[MASK] that people with disabilities have is what 's going to help us make and design a better world[MASK] for everyone both[MASK] <unk> people with and without disabilities <unk>[MASK] <unk> i used to be a disability rights lawyer <unk> and i spent a lot of my time focused on enforcing the law <unk> ensuring that accommodations were made [MASK] and then[MASK] i had to quickly learn international policy <unk> because i was asked to work on the un convention that protects people with disabilities[MASK] <unk> as the leader of the ngo there [MASK] i spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities <unk> [MASK] but somewhere[MASK] along the way <unk> and after many career transitions that my parents weren 't so happy about [MASK] i stumbled upon a solution[MASK] <unk> that i believe[MASK] may be an even more powerful tool to solve[MASK] some of the world 's greatest problems <unk> disability or not[MASK] <unk> and that tool is called design thinking [MASK] design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving <unk> there are five steps[MASK] the first is defining the problem[MASK] and understanding its constraints the second[MASK] is observing people in real life situations and empathizing with them <unk> [MASK] third <unk> throwing out hundreds of ideas the more the better the wilder the better[MASK] <unk> you can find <unk> to mimic your solution to test it and to refine it [MASK] and finally <unk> implementation <unk> ensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable <unk> [MASK] warren berger says that design thinking teaches us to[MASK] <unk> to refine to experiment and probably most importantly <unk> ask those stupid questions [MASK] design thinkers believe that everyone is creative <unk> [MASK] they believe in bringing people from multiple disciplines together <unk> because they want to share multiple perspectives and bring them together and ultimately merge them to form something new[MASK] design thinking is such a successful and versatile tool that it has been applied in almost every industry <unk> [MASK] i saw the potential[MASK] that it had for the issues i faced so i decided to go back to school[MASK] and get my master 's in social design this looks at how to use design to create[MASK] <unk> positive change in the world [MASK] while i was there i fell in love with woodworking <unk> [MASK] but what i quickly realized was that i was missing out on something as[MASK] you 're working with a tool right before it 's about to kick back at you which means the piece or the tool jumps back at you it makes a sound <unk> [MASK] and i couldn 't hear this[MASK] <unk> sound so i decided <unk> why not try and solve it [MASK] my solution was a pair of safety glasses that were engineered to visually alert the user[MASK] to pitch changes in the tool before the human ear could pick it up <unk> why hadn 't[MASK] tool designers thought of this before[MASK] two reasons <unk> [MASK] one i was a beginner <unk> i wasn 't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom [MASK] the second is i was deaf [MASK] my unique experience of the world[MASK] helped inform my solution[MASK] <unk> as i went on i kept running into more and more solutions that were originally made for people with disabilities <unk> [MASK] and that ended up being picked up embraced and loved by the mainstream disability or not [MASK] this is an oxo potato peeler it was originally designed for people with arthritis <unk> but it was so comfortable everybody loved it[MASK] <unk> text messaging that was originally designed for people who are deaf <unk> and as you know everybody loves that too [MASK] i started thinking what if we changed our mindset [MASK] what if we started designing for disability first not the norm as[MASK] <unk> when we design for disability first we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive <unk> [MASK] but also are often better than when we design for the norm <unk> [MASK] and this excites me <unk> because this means[MASK] that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged[MASK] <unk> a force for creativity and innovation this moves us[MASK] from the mindset of trying to change the hearts and the deficiency mindset of tolerance [MASK] to becoming an alchemist the type of magician that this world so desperately[MASK] <unk> i also believe that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers within this design thinking process [MASK] without knowing it from a very early age i 've been a design thinker fine tuning my skills [MASK] design thinkers[MASK] are by nature [MASK] <unk> listening to a conversation and only understanding fifty percent of what is said [MASK] you can 't ask them to repeat every single word <unk> [MASK] they would just get frustrated with you <unk> [MASK] so without even realizing it my solution was to take the muffled sound i heard [MASK] <unk> and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips i read years later someone commented that my writing[MASK] had a rhythm to it well this is because i experience conversations as rhythms <unk> [MASK] i also became[MASK] really really good at failing quite literally my first semester in spanish[MASK] <unk> got a <unk> d [MASK] but what i learned was that when i picked myself up and changed a few things around eventually <unk> [MASK] i succeeded[MASK] design thinking encourages people to fail and fail often because[MASK] <unk> you will succeed <unk> [MASK] very few great innovations in this world have come from someone succeeding on the first try <unk> [MASK] i also experienced this lesson in sports <unk> i 'll never forget my coach saying to my mom [MASK] if she just didn 't have her hearing loss she would be on the national team[MASK] <unk> what my coach <unk> and what i didn 't even know at the time [MASK] was that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports <unk> [MASK] you see <unk> when you lose your hearing not only do you adapt your behavior <unk> [MASK] but you also adapt your physical senses <unk> [MASK] one example of this is[MASK] that my visual attention span increased imagine[MASK] a soccer player coming down the left flank <unk> imagine being goalkeeper like i was [MASK] and the ball is coming down the left flank a person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective[MASK] of this i had the benefit of a spectrum this wide so i picked up the[MASK] players over here that were moving about and coming down the field <unk> and i picked them up quicker <unk> [MASK] so that if the ball was passed i could reposition myself and be ready for that shot [MASK] so as you can see <unk> i 've been a design thinker for nearly all my life [MASK] my observation skills have been honed so that i pick up on things that others would never pick up on[MASK] <unk> my constant need to adapt has made me a great ideator and problem solver <unk> [MASK] and i 've often had to do this within limitations and constraints [MASK] this is something that designers also have to deal with frequently <unk>[MASK] my work most recently took me to haiti [MASK] design thinkers often seek out extreme situations because that often informs some of their best[MASK] designs <unk> and haiti[MASK] it was like a perfect storm <unk> i lived and worked with three hundred deaf individuals[MASK] that were relocated after the two thousand and ten earthquake <unk> [MASK] but five and a half years later <unk> there still was no electricity[MASK] <unk> there still was no safe drinking water there were still no job opportunities [MASK] there was still rampant crime and it went unpunished <unk> international aid organizations came one by one <unk> but they came with[MASK] <unk> solutions they didn 't come ready to observe and to adapt based on the community[MASK] <unk> one organization gave them goats and chickens <unk> [MASK] but they didn 't realize that there was so much hunger in that community [MASK] that when the deaf went to sleep at night and couldn 't hear [MASK] people broke into their yards and their homes and stole these chickens and goats and eventually they were all gone[MASK] <unk> if that organization had taken the time to observe[MASK] deaf people to observe the community they would have realized their problem and perhaps[MASK] they would have come up with a solution <unk> something like a solar light <unk> lighting up a secure pen to put them in[MASK] <unk> at night to ensure their safety you don 't[MASK] have to be a design thinker to insert the ideas i 've shared with you today [MASK] you are creative <unk> [MASK] you are a designer everyone is [MASK] let people like me help you[MASK] <unk> with disabilities help you look sideways <unk> and in the process solve some of the greatest problems[MASK]
