 <unk> we could start by just telling us about your country it[MASK] 's three dots there on the globe <unk> those dots are pretty huge i think each one is about the size of california tell us about kiribati anote tong well [MASK] <unk> let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful i am for this opportunity to share my story[MASK] with people who do care <unk> i think i 've been sharing my story with[MASK] a lot of people who don 't care too much <unk> but[MASK] kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands <unk> the gilbert group on the the west we have the the phoenix islands in the middle and the[MASK] <unk> is perhaps the only country[MASK] that is actually in the four corners of the world because we are in the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere <unk> and also in the east and the west of the international date line [MASK] these islands are[MASK] entirely made up of coral atolls <unk> and[MASK] on average about two meters[MASK] <unk> been asked by people you know <unk> you 're suffering why don 't you move back they don 't understand they have no[MASK] concept of what it is that 's involved [MASK] with the rising sea they say well you can move back and so this is what i tell them if we move back we will fall off on the other side of the ocean[MASK] but these are the kinds of issues that[MASK] people don 't understand ca so certainly this is[MASK] just a picture of fragility there when was it that you yourself realized that[MASK] there might be impending peril for your country at well the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades and[MASK] when i came into office[MASK] <unk> three i began talking about climate change at the united nations general assembly but[MASK] not with so much passion because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human induced whether it was[MASK] real or it wasn 't but i think that that debate was[MASK] <unk> made a categorical statement that it is real it 's human induced and it 's[MASK] predicting some very very serious scenarios for[MASK] countries like mine and so that 's when i got very serious in the past <unk> i talked about it[MASK] when the scenarios the predictions came in two thousand and seven it became a real issue for us ca now those predictions are i think that[MASK] by two thousand one hundred sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet there 's scenarios where it 's higher than that for sure <unk> but what would you say to a skeptic who said what 's three feet you 're on average six feet above sea level what 's the problem[MASK] <unk> 's got to be understood that[MASK] a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land because much of the land is[MASK] low and quite apart from that we are getting[MASK] the swells at the moment <unk> so it 's not about getting two feet <unk> i think[MASK] what many people do not understand is[MASK] they think climate change is something that is happening in the future[MASK] 're at the very bottom end of the spectrum <unk> it 's already with us we have communities who already have been dislocated[MASK] <unk> they have had to move and every parliament session i 'm[MASK] getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls [MASK] to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it 's being destroyed <unk> and so[MASK] in my trips to the different[MASK] <unk> islands <unk> i 'm seeing evidence of communities which[MASK] are now having to cope with the loss of food crops <unk> the contamination of the water lenses and i see these[MASK] communities perhaps leaving having to relocate within five to ten years ca and then[MASK] i think the country suffered its[MASK] <unk> i 'm sure many of you understand that[MASK] when you 're on the equator <unk> it 's supposed to be in the doldrums we 're not supposed to get the cyclones we create them and then we send them either north or south [MASK] but they aren 't supposed to come back <unk> but for the first time at the beginning of this year the cyclone pam[MASK] <unk> which destroyed vanuatu <unk> and in the process the very edges of it actually touched[MASK] our two southernmost islands and all of tuvalu tuvalu was underwater[MASK] when hurricane pam struck <unk> but[MASK] for our two southernmost islands we had[MASK] waves come over half the island <unk> and so this has never happened before it 's a new experience [MASK] <unk> just come back from my own constituency <unk> and i 've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades they 've been totally destroyed <unk>[MASK] so this is what 's happening but when we talk about the rising sea level[MASK] <unk> we think it 's something that[MASK] happens gradually <unk> it comes with the winds it comes with the swells and so they can be magnified <unk> but[MASK] <unk> what we are beginning to witness is the[MASK] the change in the weather pattern which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face[MASK] sooner than perhaps the rising sea level ca so the country is already seeing effects now as you look forward[MASK] what are your options as a country as a nation at well [MASK] i 've been telling this story every year[MASK] <unk> i think i visit a number of i 've been traveling the world to try and[MASK] get people to understand we have a plan <unk> we think we have a plan and on one occasion i think i spoke in geneva and[MASK] there was a gentleman who was[MASK] interviewing me on something like this <unk> and i said we are looking at floating islands and he thought it was funny but somebody said no this is not funny <unk> [MASK] these[MASK] people are looking for solutions and so[MASK] i have been looking at floating islands[MASK] <unk> the japanese[MASK] are interested in building floating islands <unk> but as a country <unk> we have made a commitment that no matter what happens we will try as much as possible[MASK] to stay[MASK] and and continue to exist as a nation what that will take it 's going to be something quite significant[MASK] <unk> either we live on floating islands <unk> or we we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water[MASK] as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe <unk>[MASK] <unk> but even that <unk> it 's going to be very very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need ca [MASK] and then the only recourse is some form of forced migration at well we are also looking at that because in the event[MASK] that nothing comes forward from the international community we are preparing[MASK] <unk> we don 't want to be caught like what 's happening in europe <unk> ok we don 't want to mass migrate at some point in time <unk> we want to be able to give the people the choice today <unk> [MASK] those who choose and want to do that to migrate we[MASK] something to happen that[MASK] that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared[MASK] <unk> of course our culture is very different our society is very different and once we migrate into a different environment a different culture there 's a whole lot of adjustments that are required ca [MASK] well there 's forced migration in your country 's past and i think just this week just[MASK] yesterday or the day before yesterday[MASK] <unk> you visited these people what happened here <unk> what 's the story here at yes and i 'm sorry i think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place [MASK] <unk> good reason because[MASK] we have a community of kiribati people living in that that part of the of the solomon islands <unk> but these were people who were relocated from the phoenix islands in fact in the <unk>[MASK] there was serious drought and the people could not continue to live on the island <unk> [MASK] and so they were moved to to live here in the solomon islands <unk> and so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people they didn 't know who i was[MASK] heard of me some of them later recognized me but[MASK] i think they were very happy <unk> later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally but[MASK] i think what i saw yesterday was very interesting because here i see our people i spoke in our language and of course they[MASK] <unk> beginning not to be able to speak kiribati properly [MASK] i saw them there was this lady with red teeth she was chewing betel nuts and it 's not something we we do in kiribati we don 't chew betel nuts <unk>[MASK] i met also a[MASK] family who have married[MASK] the local people here <unk> and so this is what is happening[MASK] <unk> as you go into another community <unk> there are bound to be changes <unk> there is bound to be[MASK] a certain loss of identity <unk> and this is what we will be looking for[MASK] in the future if and when we do migrate ca it[MASK] must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day[MASK] because of these questions about identity the joy of seeing you and and perhaps an emphasized sense of[MASK] what they had lost and it 's very inspiring to hear you say[MASK] <unk> the end to try to preserve the nation in[MASK] in a location at [MASK] this is our wish <unk> nobody wants ever to leave their home[MASK] <unk> and so it 's been a very difficult decision for me as a leader <unk> you don 't[MASK] make plans to to leave your island your home <unk> and so i 've been asked on a number of occasions [MASK] <unk> doesn 't feel good at all <unk> it 's an emotional thing <unk> and i[MASK] 've tried to live with it <unk> and i know that[MASK] on occasions i 'm accused of[MASK] not trying to solve the problem because i i can 't solve the problem <unk> it 's something that 's got to be done collectively [MASK] climate change is a global phenomenon and[MASK] as i 've often argued <unk> unfortunately <unk> the countries when we come to the united nations i was in[MASK] <unk> with the pacific island forum countries[MASK] where australia and new zealand are also members <unk> and we had an argument <unk> there was a bit of a story in the news[MASK] because they were arguing that to cut[MASK] emissions it would be something that they 're unable to do because[MASK] it would affect the industries <unk> and so here i was saying ok <unk> i hear you i understand what[MASK] <unk> saying but try also to understand what i 'm saying because[MASK] if you do not cut your emissions then our survival is on the line <unk> and so[MASK] it 's a matter for you to weigh this these moral issues it 's about industry as opposed to the survival of[MASK] a people ca you know i ask you yesterday what made you angry and you said i don 't[MASK] <unk> i 'd refer you to my earlier statement at the united nations i was very angry very frustrated and then depressed <unk> there was a[MASK] sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning [MASK] i had to change my my approach i had to become more reasonable because[MASK] i thought people would listen to somebody who was rational <unk> but i remain radically[MASK] <unk> rational <unk> whatever that is ca [MASK] now [MASK] a core part of your nation 's identity is fishing <unk> i think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way at well we eat fish every day[MASK] every day and i think[MASK] there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world <unk> we don 't have a lot of livestock <unk> so it 's fish that we depend on[MASK] <unk> so you 're dependent on fish both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business[MASK] for tuna and yet despite that a few years ago you took a very radical[MASK] step can you tell us about that i think something happened right here in the phoenix islands at let me[MASK] give some of the background of what fish means for us <unk> we have one of the largest[MASK] <unk> tuna fisheries remaining in the world <unk> in the pacific i think we own something like sixty percent of[MASK] the remaining tuna fisheries and[MASK] it remains relatively healthy for some species but not all and kiribati is one of the three major[MASK] resource owners <unk> tuna resource owners <unk> and[MASK] <unk> at the moment we have been getting something like eighty eighty to ninety percent of our revenue from access fees <unk> license fees ca of your national revenue at national revenue <unk> which drives everything that we do[MASK] in governments <unk> hospitals schools and what have you but[MASK] we decided to close this <unk> and it was a very difficult decision i can assure you <unk> politically locally it was not easy[MASK] <unk> but i i was convinced that[MASK] we had to do this in order to[MASK] ensure that the fishery remains sustainable there had been some indications that some of the species in particular the[MASK] the bigeye was under serious threat the yellowfin was also heavily fished skipjack remains healthy[MASK] <unk> and so we had to do something like that and so that was the reason i did that <unk> another reason why i did that was because[MASK] i had been asking[MASK] the international community that in order to deal with climate change in order to fight climate change[MASK] <unk> there has got to be sacrifice <unk> there has got to be commitment <unk> so[MASK] in asking[MASK] <unk> i thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice <unk> and so we made the sacrifice <unk> and forgoing[MASK] commercial fishing in the phoenix islands protected area[MASK] would mean a loss of revenue <unk> we are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off[MASK] at the beginning of this year <unk> and so we will see by the end of this year[MASK] what it means in terms of the lost revenue[MASK] so there 's so many things playing into this on the one hand <unk> it may prompt healthier fisheries <unk>[MASK] <unk> how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas[MASK] the negotiations have been very difficult but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day for any vessel to come in[MASK] <unk> fish for a day <unk> we have raised the fee from it was $ six thousand and $ eight thousand <unk> now to $[MASK] ten thousand $ twelve thousand per vessel day <unk> [MASK] and so there 's been that significant increase but at the same time what 's important to to note is <unk> [MASK] whereas in the past[MASK] these these fishing boats[MASK] might be fishing in a day and maybe catch ten tons[MASK] now they 're catching maybe one hundred tons because they 've become so efficient <unk> and so we 've got to respond likewise we 've got to be very very careful because[MASK] the the technology has so improved there was a time[MASK] when the the brazilian fleet moved from the atlantic to the pacific they couldn 't they started experimenting if they could per se <unk> [MASK] but now they 've got ways of doing it and they 've become so efficient[MASK] can you give us a sense of what it 's like in those negotiations because you 're up against companies that have[MASK] hundreds of millions of dollars at stake <unk> essentially [MASK] how do you hold the line <unk> is there any advice you can give to other leaders who[MASK] are dealing with the same companies about how to[MASK] <unk> on licensing[MASK] in order to get the rate of return because what we are getting from license fees is about ten percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of of the wharf [MASK] not in the retail shops <unk> [MASK] <unk> what we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation[MASK] in the industry in the harvesting in the processing and eventually hopefully the marketing they 're not easy to to penetrate[MASK] <unk> but we are working towards that and yes the answer would be to enhance in order to increase our rate of[MASK] <unk> we have to become more involved <unk> and so we 've started doing that and[MASK] we have to restructure the industry we 've got to tell these people that the world has changed now we want to produce the fish ourselves ca [MASK] and meanwhile for your local fishermen <unk> they[MASK] are still able to fish <unk> but what is business like for them is it getting harder are the waters depleted or is that being run on a sustainable basis[MASK] <unk> fishery we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except[MASK] only to supply the domestic market <unk> the tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market <unk> mostly here in the us[MASK] <unk> it 's very very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners ca so[MASK] here 's a couple of beautiful[MASK] girls from your country i mean as you think about their future what message would you have for them[MASK] <unk> and what message would you have for the world at well i 've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate[MASK] because for us it 's about the future of these children i have twelve grandchildren at least <unk> i think i have twelve my wife knows [MASK] and i think i have eight children <unk> it 's about their future every day i see my grandchildren about the same age as these young[MASK] <unk> and i get angry sometimes yes i do i wonder what is to become of them and so[MASK] it 's about them[MASK] that we should be telling everybody that it 's not about their own national interest because climate change [MASK] regrettably unfortunately is viewed by many countries as a national problem it 's not and this is the argument we got into recently with[MASK] <unk> what about the rest why don 't you keep it if you could keep the rest of your emissions[MASK] within your boundaries within your borders we 'd have no question you can go[MASK] <unk> ahead as much as you like but unfortunately you 're sending it our way <unk> and it 's affecting the future of our children <unk> and so surely[MASK] i think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today we will be meeting in paris at the end of this year <unk> [MASK] but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon <unk> because we create it individually as nations but it affects everybody else <unk> [MASK] and yet we refuse to do[MASK] <unk> and we deal with it[MASK] as a national problem <unk> which it is not it is a global issue <unk> and it 's got to be[MASK] dealt with collectively ca [MASK] people are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers and we shut our minds to it <unk> [MASK] somehow [MASK] to people we 're slightly better at responding to that sometimes and it[MASK] seems like it 's very possible that your nation despite actually because of the intense[MASK] problems you face you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly most powerfully[MASK] <unk> i just want to thank you i 'm sure on behalf of all of us for your extraordinary leadership and for being here[MASK]
