 <unk> the magical moment of conducting which is you go onto a stage there is an orchestra sitting they are all you know warming up and doing stuff <unk> and[MASK] i go on the[MASK] <unk> this little office of the conductor <unk> or rather a cubicle[MASK] an open space cubicle with a lot of space [MASK] and in front of all that noise you do a very small gesture something like this not very pomp not very sophisticated this <unk> [MASK] and suddenly out of the chaos order noise becomes music <unk> [MASK] and this is fantastic and it 's so tempting to think that it 's all about me [MASK] all those great people here[MASK] <unk> noise they need me to do that <unk> not really if it were that i would just[MASK] save you the talk and teach you the gesture <unk> so you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want and you have perfect harmony it doesn 't work[MASK] <unk> let 's look at the first video i hope you 'll think it 's a good example of harmony and then speak a[MASK] <unk> little bit about how it comes about[MASK] <unk> was that nice <unk> so that was[MASK] a sort of a success now who should we thank for the success i mean obviously the[MASK] orchestra musicians playing beautifully <unk> the vienna philharmonic orchestra they don[MASK] 't often even look at the conductor <unk> then you have the clapping audience[MASK] <unk> actually taking part in doing the music you know viennese audiences usually don 't interfere with the music <unk> <unk> this is the closest to an oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in vienna [MASK] unlike for example israel where audiences cough all the time you[MASK] know arthur rubinstein the pianist used to say that anywhere in the world people that have the flu they go to the doctor in tel aviv they come to my concerts[MASK] 's a sort of a tradition <unk> but viennese audiences do not do that[MASK] <unk> here they go out of their regular <unk> just to be part of that to become part of the orchestra and that 's great you know [MASK] audiences like you <unk> yeah <unk> make the event [MASK] but what about the conductor what can you say the conductor was[MASK] <unk> he was[MASK] happy [MASK] and i often show this to senior management <unk> people get annoyed [MASK] you come to work how come you 're so happy [MASK] something must be wrong there <unk> yeah <unk> but he 's spreading happiness and i think the happiness the important thing is this happiness does not come from[MASK] only his own story and his joy of the music <unk> the joy is about enabling other people 's stories to be heard at the same time[MASK] you have the story of the orchestra as a professional body <unk> you have the story of the audience as a community <unk> [MASK] yeah <unk> you have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience <unk> [MASK] and then you have other stories unseen people who build this wonderful concert hall people who made those[MASK] stradivarius [MASK] <unk> all those beautiful instruments and all those stories are being heard[MASK] at the same time this is the true experience of a live concert that 's a reason to go out of home yeah[MASK] and not all conductors do just that <unk> let 's see somebody else a great conductor riccardo muti[MASK] <unk> have a little demonstration would you be my orchestra for a second can you sing please the first note of don giovanni <unk> you have to[MASK] <unk> feel even more redundant than i already feel so please <unk> wait for the conductor <unk> now look at me[MASK] <unk> so not only the instruction is clear but also the sanction what will happen if you don[MASK] <unk> i 'm responsible for mozart this is going to be the only story to be told <unk> it 's mozart as i[MASK] <unk> riccardo muti <unk> understand it and you know what happened to muti[MASK] <unk> three years ago he got a letter signed by all seven hundred employees of la scala <unk> [MASK] musical employees i mean the musicians <unk> saying you 're a great conductor we don 't want to work with you <unk> please resign [MASK] why because you don 't let us develop <unk> you 're using us as[MASK] <unk> can you do it with less control or with a different kind of control <unk> let 's look at the next conductor[MASK] <unk> not true when he was a young man of about about thirty he wrote what he called the ten commandments for conductors the first one was <unk> if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong [MASK] that 's the first one the fourth one you 'll like better it says <unk> never look at the trombones it only encourages them so [MASK] the whole idea is really to let it happen[MASK] <unk> by itself do not not interfere <unk> but how does it happen [MASK] did you see him turning pages in the score now either he is senile <unk> and doesn 't remember his own music because he wrote the music or[MASK] he is actually transferring a very strong message to them saying come on guys you have to play by the book [MASK] so it 's not about my story it 's not about your story it 's only the execution of[MASK] <unk> written music <unk> no interpretation interpretation is the real story of the performer so no he doesn 't want that that 's a different kind of control <unk> let 's see another[MASK] <unk> the hands did you see this kind of movement let me conduct you <unk> twice once like a muti <unk> and you[MASK] <unk> know when to play <unk> now i can tell you <unk> even the berlin philharmonic doesn 't know when to play [MASK] but i 'll tell you how they do it no cynicism this is a german orchestra yes they look at karajan <unk> [MASK] <unk> after doing that <unk> they really look at each other and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together <unk> and when karajan is asked about it he actually says yes the worst[MASK] damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear[MASK] instruction because that would[MASK] prevent the ensemble the listening[MASK] to each other that is needed for an orchestra now that 's great what about the eyes <unk> why are the eyes closed[MASK] there is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london and he cues in a flute player[MASK] like this the guy has no idea what to do[MASK] <unk> start when you can 't stand it anymore [MASK] meaning[MASK] that[MASK] you know you have no authority to change anything <unk> it 's my music the real music is only in karajan 's head <unk> and you have to guess my mind <unk> so you are[MASK] under tremendous pressure because i don 't give you instruction and yet you have to guess my[MASK] <unk> so it 's a different kind of a very spiritual but yet[MASK] very firm control can we do it in another way of course we can let 's go back to the first conductor we 've seen carlos kleiber his name next video[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> not telling them what to do when he does this it 's not[MASK] take your stradivarius and like jimi hendrix <unk> smash it on the floor it 's not that <unk> he says this is the gesture of the music i 'm[MASK] opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation that is another story <unk> [MASK] but how does it really work together if it doesn 't give them instructions <unk> it 's like being on a[MASK] <unk> you 're not really given any instructions but the forces of the process itself keep you in place that 's what he does[MASK] the interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist it 's not a physical thing it 's in the players ' heads <unk> and that 's what makes them into partners <unk>[MASK] <unk> you have the plan in your head <unk> you know what to do even though kleiber is not conducting you but here and there and that [MASK] <unk> with sound as you actually take the ride this is very exciting for those players they do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks later[MASK] it is very tiring <unk> yeah <unk> but it 's the best[MASK] the best music making [MASK] like this <unk> but of course it 's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy you also have to be very professional and look again at this[MASK] <unk> kleiber can we have the next video <unk> quickly you 'll see what happens when there is a mistake again you see the[MASK] beautiful body language [MASK] and now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way[MASK] <unk> second time for the same player [MASK] and now the third time for the same player [MASK] wait for me after the concert i have a[MASK] short notice to give you you know when it 's needed <unk> the authority is there it 's very important but authority is not enough to make people your partners[MASK] <unk> 's see the next video <unk> please see what happens here you might be surprised having seen kleiber as such a hyperactive guy[MASK] <unk> is there one hundred percent but not commanding not telling what to do rather enjoying what the soloist is doing [MASK] another solo now see what you can pick up from this[MASK] <unk> comes from here <unk> so that 's a good thing <unk> and the second thing is it 's about actually being in control but in a very[MASK] <unk> you know what happens gravitation is no more kleiber not only creates a process but also creates the conditions in the world[MASK] in which this process[MASK] takes place <unk> so again the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work and creative and all of that <unk> and[MASK] the level in which kleiber is in control[MASK] <unk> is in a different level so control is no longer a zero sum game <unk> you have this control you have this control <unk> and all you put together in partnership <unk> brings about the best music <unk> [MASK] so kleiber is about process kleiber is about[MASK] conditions in the world <unk> but you need to have process and content to create the meaning lenny bernstein my own personal maestro since he was a great teacher[MASK] <unk> bernstein always started from the meaning look at[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> the face of muti at the beginning <unk> well he had a wonderful expression but only one did you see[MASK] <unk> you know why because the meaning of the music is pain <unk> and you 're playing a painful sound and you look at lenny and[MASK] he 's suffering <unk> but not in a way that you want to stop it 's suffering like enjoying himself in a jewish way as they say[MASK] but you can see the music on his face you can see the baton left his hand[MASK] <unk> no more baton <unk> now it 's about you the player telling the story <unk> [MASK] now it 's a reversed thing you 're telling the story and you 're telling the story and even briefly you become the storyteller to which the community the whole community <unk> listens to and bernstein enables that isn 't that wonderful [MASK] now if you are doing all the things we talked about together <unk> and maybe some others you can get to this wonderful point of doing[MASK] <unk> and for the last video i think this is simply the the best title my friend peter says if you love something give it away[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK]
