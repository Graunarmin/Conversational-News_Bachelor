 <unk> when we think of nepal <unk> we tend to think of the snow capped mountains of the himalayas[MASK] the crystal clear still waters of its alpine lakes or the huge expanse of its grasslands [MASK] what some of us may not realize is that in the himalayan foothills[MASK] <unk> where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener <unk> there lives a great diversity of wildlife <unk> including the one horned rhinoceros the asian elephant and the bengal tiger <unk> [MASK] but unfortunately these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body[MASK] <unk> to stop the killing of these animals battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect nepal 's national parks <unk> [MASK] but that is not an easy task because[MASK] these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs [MASK] it is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers [MASK] and therefore nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife[MASK] nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime <unk> and these are drones or more specifically conservation drones [MASK] for about a year now my colleagues and i have been building drones for nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones [MASK] not only does a drone give you a bird <unk> 's eye view of the landscape <unk> but it also allows you[MASK] <unk> to capture detailed[MASK] images of objects on the ground this[MASK] for example is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of nepal [MASK] now we believe that drones have tremendous potential not only for combating[MASK] <unk> for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations <unk> so what is a drone[MASK] well the kind of drone i 'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system <unk> [MASK] and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer [MASK] a gps a compass a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors[MASK] now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload such as a video[MASK] <unk> camera or a photographic camera it also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission to tell the drone where to go [MASK] now people i talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone <unk> [MASK] but they are even more surprised when i tell them how[MASK] <unk> affordable these components are [MASK] the facts is [MASK] a conservation drone doesn 't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars [MASK] so now that you 've built your own conservation drone you probably want to go fly it but how does one fly a drone well[MASK] actually you don 't <unk> because the drone flies itself <unk> [MASK] all you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly but you simply do that[MASK] <unk> by clicking on a few way points on the google maps interface using the open source software [MASK] those missions could be as simple as just a few way points or they could be slightly longer and more complicated to fly along a river system <unk> [MASK] sometimes <unk> we fly the drone in a lawnmower type pattern[MASK] <unk> and take pictures of that area <unk> and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest [MASK] other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally <unk> [MASK] now whatever your mission is [MASK] once you 've programmed it you simply upload it to the autopilot system bring your drone to the field <unk> and launch it simply by tossing it in the air and often we 'll go about this mission[MASK] taking pictures[MASK] or videos along the way <unk> and usually at that point <unk> [MASK] we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee sit back and relax for the next few minutes <unk> although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return <unk> [MASK] usually it does <unk> and when it does it even lands automatically <unk> [MASK] so what can we do with a conservation drone[MASK] <unk> well when we built our first prototype drone our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in north sumatra indonesia [MASK] to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan [MASK] the reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of[MASK] <unk> now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops[MASK] where you might find an orangutan or its nest <unk> now as you can imagine that is a very <unk>[MASK] and costly process so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan[MASK] <unk> populations in indonesia and elsewhere in southeast asia <unk> so we were very excited when we[MASK] captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera <unk> and this is it this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone <unk> [MASK] since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from[MASK] <unk> around various parts of southeast asia <unk> [MASK] and we 're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we 've collected so far <unk> [MASK] but nests are not the only objects these drones can detect <unk> this is a wild orangutan[MASK] happily feeding on top of a palm tree <unk> seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying[MASK] <unk> not once but several times [MASK] we 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in gabon <unk> elephants <unk> and even turtle nests [MASK] but besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves <unk> we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats <unk> [MASK] sometimes[MASK] <unk> zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape <unk> [MASK] this is an oil palm plantation in sumatra <unk> now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world <unk> so we wanted to use this <unk>[MASK] <unk> new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in southeast asia <unk> [MASK] <unk> a recently logged forest again in sumatra you could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground <unk> [MASK] but perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape <unk> [MASK] and this map gives us crucial[MASK] crucial information for monitoring land use change to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding where forests might be contracting or where fires might be breaking out [MASK] aerial images could also be processed to produce[MASK] computer models of forests now these models are not just visually appealing <unk> but they are also geometrically accurate which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees[MASK] <unk> surface area the volume of vegetation <unk> and so on <unk> all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests [MASK] recently <unk> we 've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras <unk> now these cameras can detect <unk> heat emitting objects from the ground <unk> and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night[MASK] <unk> so i 've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are how you might operate one of these drones <unk> and what a drone could do for you i will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world <unk> [MASK] we built our first prototype drones in switzerland <unk> we brought a few of these to indonesia for the first few test flights <unk> [MASK] since then we 've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world[MASK] and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations [MASK] perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones <unk> [MASK] building drones for us is a constant work in progress we are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range their ruggedness[MASK] <unk> and the amount of payload they can carry <unk> [MASK] we also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones for example camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests [MASK] <unk> motion activated cameras so they snap a[MASK] picture every time an animal crosses their path <unk> [MASK] but the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images and that takes a lot <unk>[MASK] <unk> of time <unk> especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest <unk> [MASK] <unk> radio collars are another tool that 's commonly used by biologists <unk> now these collars are put onto animals they transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape <unk> [MASK] but the traditional way of tracking animals is[MASK] pretty ridiculous[MASK] <unk> because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna [MASK] not unlike those old tv antennae we used to have on our rooftops some of us still do [MASK] a drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently <unk> why not equip a drone with a scanning radio[MASK] <unk> fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest [MASK] a third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones[MASK] is to fly them to a really remote[MASK] rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics and parachute down a tiny spy microphone[MASK] that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals <unk> birds <unk> amphibians the yeti the sasquatch <unk> bigfoot <unk> whatever [MASK] that would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests [MASK] and finally i would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone the maja drone has a wingspan of about two meters[MASK] it weighs only about two kilograms <unk> but it can carry half its weight it is a fully autonomous system <unk> [MASK] during its mission it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop [MASK] which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time [MASK] it carries a variety of[MASK] <unk> and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel [MASK] this drone can stay in the air for forty to sixty minutes which gives it a range of up to fifty kilometers that is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications <unk> [MASK] now conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate[MASK] <unk> we believe strongly believe that drones[MASK] can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications <unk> [MASK] we 've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes [MASK] and in a way they are right <unk> i mean let 's be honest drones are the ultimate toys for boys but[MASK] at the same time <unk> we 've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision[MASK] <unk> see the potential of conservation drones [MASK] to us it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool including drones in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet[MASK]
