 <unk> question that we 've all asked the question is why is it that the letter x represents the unknown [MASK] now i know we learned that in math class <unk> but now it[MASK] <unk> that come from [MASK] about six years ago i decided that i would learn arabic which turns out to be a supremely logical language [MASK] to write a word or a phrase or a sentence in arabic is like crafting an equation because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information [MASK] <unk> of the reasons so much of what we 've come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering[MASK] was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks this includes the little system in arabic called[MASK] <unk> into english as algebra one example among many [MASK] the arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to europe which is to say spain[MASK] and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a european[MASK] <unk> but there were problems one problem is[MASK] there there are some sounds in arabic that just don 't make it through a european voice box without lots of practice <unk> trust me on that one [MASK] also <unk> those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages [MASK] here 's one of the culprits this is the letter sheen and it makes the sound we think of as sh[MASK] <unk> it 's also the very first letter of the word shalan [MASK] which means something just like the the english word something some undefined unknown thing <unk> [MASK] now in arabic we can make this definite by adding the definite article al so this is[MASK] the unknown thing <unk> and this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics such as this[MASK] <unk> derivation of proofs [MASK] the problem for the medieval spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material[MASK] is that the letter sheen and the word shalan can 't be rendered into spanish because spanish doesn 't have that sh that sh sound[MASK] <unk> they created a rule in which they borrowed the ck sound ck [MASK] sound from the classical greek in the form of the letter kai [MASK] later when this material was translated into a common european language <unk> which is to say latin <unk> they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x and once that[MASK] <unk> once this material was in latin <unk> [MASK] it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost six hundred years [MASK] but now we have the answer to our question why is it that x is the unknown [MASK] x is the unknown because[MASK] you can 't say sh in spanish [MASK] and i thought that was worth sharing[MASK]
