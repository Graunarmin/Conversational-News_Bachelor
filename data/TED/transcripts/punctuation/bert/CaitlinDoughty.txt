 <unk> i would like for my body to be laid out to be eaten by animals [MASK] having your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for[MASK] <unk> maybe you have already had the end of life talk with your family and decided on <unk> i don 't know cremation <unk> [MASK] and in the interest of full disclosure what i am proposing for my dead body is not strictly legal at the moment <unk> but it 's not without precedent [MASK] we 've been laying out our dead for all of human history <unk> it 's call[MASK] <unk> in fact it 's likely happening right now as we speak [MASK] in the mountainous regions of tibet they practice sky burial a ritual where the body is left to be consumed by vultures [MASK] in mumbai in india those who follow the parsi religion put their dead in structures called towers of silence[MASK] <unk> these are interesting cultural tidbits <unk> but[MASK] they just haven 't really been that popular in the western world they 're not what you 'd expect <unk> [MASK] in america our death traditions have come to be chemical embalming <unk> followed by[MASK] burial at your local cemetery or more recently <unk> cremation <unk> [MASK] i myself <unk> am a recent vegetarian which means i spent the first thirty years or so of my life frantically inhaling[MASK] <unk> animals as many as i could get my hands on why when i die <unk> should they not have their turn with me [MASK] am i not an animal biologically speaking are we not all in this room animals [MASK] accepting the fact that we are animals has some potentially terrifying consequences <unk> it means[MASK] <unk> accepting that we are doomed to decay and die <unk> just like any other creature[MASK] on earth [MASK] for the last nine years i 've worked in the funeral industry [MASK] first as a crematory operator then as a mortician and most recently as the owner of my own funeral home [MASK] and i have some good news if you 're looking to avoid the whole doomed to decay and die[MASK] <unk> thing <unk> you will have all the help in the world in that avoidance from the funeral industry[MASK] <unk> industry and its economic model is based on the principle of protection <unk> sanitation and beautification of the corpse <unk> [MASK] whether they mean to or not the funeral industry promotes this[MASK] <unk> idea of human exceptionalism it[MASK] doesn 't matter what it takes how much it costs how bad it is for the environment we 're going to do it because humans are worth it [MASK] it ignores the fact that death can be an emotionally messy and complex affair and that there is beauty in decay[MASK] beauty in the natural return to the earth from whence we came[MASK] now i don 't want you to get me wrong i absolutely understand the importance of ritual especially when it comes to the people that we love <unk> but <unk>[MASK] <unk> we have to be able to create and practice this ritual without harming the environment <unk> which is why we need new options <unk> [MASK] <unk> with a dead body [MASK] the funeral industry will protect your dead body by offering to sell your family a casket made of hardwood or metal with a rubber sealant [MASK] at the cemetery on the day of burial that casket will be lowered into a large concrete or metal vault <unk> [MASK] we 're wasting all of these resources concretes metal hardwoods hiding them in vast[MASK] <unk> vast underground fortresses [MASK] when you choose burial at the cemetery your dead body is not coming anywhere near the dirt that surrounds it [MASK] food for worms you are not [MASK] next the industry will sanitize your body[MASK] through embalming[MASK] <unk> the chemical preservation of the dead this procedure drains your blood and replaces it with a toxic cancer causing formaldehyde <unk> [MASK] they say they do this for the public health because the dead body can be dangerous <unk> [MASK] but the doctors in this room will tell you that that claim would only apply if the person had died of some wildly infectious disease like[MASK] <unk> even human decomposition which let 's be honest is a little stinky and unpleasant is perfectly safe <unk> [MASK] the bacteria that causes disease[MASK] is not the same bacteria that causes decomposition <unk> [MASK] finally <unk> the industry will beautify the corpse they[MASK] 'll tell you that the natural dead body of your mother or father is not good enough as it[MASK] <unk> it in makeup they 'll put it in a suit <unk> they 'll inject dyes so the person looks a little more alive just resting [MASK] embalming is a cheat code <unk> providing the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end for all organic life on this planet <unk> [MASK] <unk> if this system of beautification sanitation protection[MASK] doesn 't appeal to you you are not alone <unk> [MASK] there is a whole wave of people funeral directors designers environmentalists trying to come up with a more[MASK] way of death for these people death is not necessarily a pristine makeup powder blue tuxedo[MASK] <unk> there 's no question that our current methods of death are not particularly sustainable what with the waste of resources and our reliance on chemicals [MASK] even cremation <unk> which is usually considered the environmentally friendly option uses per cremation the natural gas equivalent of a <unk>[MASK] car trip so where do we go from here <unk> last summer i was in the[MASK] <unk> of north carolina <unk> hauling buckets of wood chips in the summer sun <unk> [MASK] i was at western carolina university at their body farm more accurately called a human decomposition facility [MASK] bodies donated to science are brought here and their decay is studied to benefit the future of[MASK] <unk> on this particular day there were twelve bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition some were <unk>[MASK] one was wearing purple pajamas one still had blonde facial hair visible [MASK] the forensic aspect is really fascinating but not actually why i was there [MASK] i was there because a colleague of mine named katrina spade is attempting to create a system not of cremating the dead[MASK] the dead <unk> she calls the system <unk>[MASK] and we 've been doing it with cattle and other livestock for years <unk> she imagines a facility where the family could come and lay their dead loved one in a <unk>[MASK] mixture that would in four to six weeks reduce the body bones and all to[MASK] <unk> in those four to six weeks your molecules become other molecules you literally transform [MASK] how would this fit in with the very recent desire a lot of people seem to have to be buried under a tree or to become a tree when they die [MASK] in a traditional cremation <unk> the ashes that are left over inorganic bone fragments form a thick <unk> chalky layer[MASK] <unk> unless distributed in the soil just right can actually hurt or kill the tree <unk> [MASK] but if you 're recomposed if you actually become the soil you can nourish the tree and become the post mortem contributor you 've always wanted to be that you deserve to be [MASK] so that 's one option for the future of cremation <unk> but what about the future of cemeteries <unk> [MASK] there are a lot of people who think we shouldn 't even have cemeteries anymore because we 're running[MASK] <unk> out of land <unk> but what if we reframed it and the corpse wasn 't the land 's enemy <unk> but its potential savior <unk> [MASK] i 'm talking about conservation burial where large swaths of land are purchased by a land trust <unk> [MASK] the beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land <unk> it can 't be touched <unk> it can 't be developed on[MASK] <unk> hence the term conservation burial it 's the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree <unk> post mortem hell no i won 't go [MASK] no really i can 't i 'm decomposing under here [MASK] any money that the family gives to the cemetery would go back into protecting and managing the land [MASK] <unk> there are no headstones and no graves in the typical sense [MASK] the graves are scattered about the property under elegant mounds <unk> marked only by a rock or a small metal disk or sometimes only locatable by gps <unk> [MASK] there 's no embalming no heavy metal caskets [MASK] my funeral home sells a few caskets made out of things like woven willow and[MASK] <unk> most of our families just choose a simple shroud <unk> [MASK] there are none of the big vaults that most cemeteries require just because it makes it easier for them to landscape <unk> [MASK] families can come here <unk> they can luxuriate in nature <unk> they can even plant a tree or a shrub <unk> though only native plants to the area are allowed [MASK] the dead then blend seamlessly in with the landscape <unk> [MASK] there 's hope in conservation[MASK] <unk> cemeteries <unk> they offer dedicated green space in both urban and rural areas <unk> [MASK] they offer a chance to reintroduce native plants and animals to a region <unk> [MASK] they offer public trails <unk> places for spiritual practice <unk> places for classes and events places where nature and mourning meet[MASK] <unk> importantly <unk> they offer us <unk> once again a chance to just decompose in a hole in the ground [MASK] the soil <unk> let me tell you has missed us <unk> [MASK] i think for a lot of people they 're starting to get the sense that our current funeral industry isn 't really working for them [MASK] for many of us[MASK] <unk> sanitized and beautified just doesn 't reflect us <unk> it doesn 't reflect what we stood for during our lives [MASK] will changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change no <unk> [MASK] but it will make bold moves in how we see ourselves as citizens of this planet <unk> [MASK] if we can die in a way that is more humble and <unk>[MASK] i believe that we stand a chance <unk> thank you[MASK]
