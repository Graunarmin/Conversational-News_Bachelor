 <unk> a little bit of music here[MASK] <unk> okay[MASK] <unk> okay[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> i 'm really excited to talk a bit about[MASK] my own upbringing in music and family and all of that <unk> but i 'm even more excited[MASK] for you people to hear about donnell 's amazing family and[MASK] and maybe even a little bit about how we met and all that sort of thing <unk> but[MASK] for those of you that may[MASK] <unk> i 'm from cape breton island <unk> nova scotia <unk> eastern canada <unk> which is a very very musical island and its origins[MASK] come from scotland with the music and all the traditions the dancing the language <unk> which unfortunately is dying out in cape breton <unk> [MASK] the traditional language is gaelic but a lot of the music[MASK] came from the gaelic language and the dancing and the singing and everything and my[MASK] my bloodline is scottish through and through <unk> [MASK] but my mother and father are two are two very very musical people my mom taught me to dance when i was[MASK] <unk> my dad taught me to play fiddle when i was nine[MASK] <unk> my uncle is a very well known cape breton fiddler <unk> his name 's buddy macmaster <unk> and just a wonderful guy <unk> and[MASK] we have a great tradition at home called square dancing and we had parties great parties at our house and the neighbors ' houses and[MASK] <unk> first of all is gaelic for party but[MASK] kitchen party in cape breton is very common and basically somebody drops into the house and[MASK] no matter what house you go to in cape breton there 's a fiddle there guaranteed <unk> [MASK] and i 'd say <unk> well there 's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world so ten chances to one the fellow who walked in the door could play it [MASK] so you 'd have[MASK] <unk> come into the house you 'd invite them to play a tune and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance and somebody would sing and all that sort of thing so[MASK] it was a wonderful wonderful way to grow up and that is where my beginnings in music come from my surroundings my family just my bloodline in itself [MASK] and oh [MASK] i 've done lots of things with my music i 've recorded lots of cds i was[MASK] <unk> a grammy and i 've won some awards and stuff like that so that 's[MASK] awesome <unk> but the best part was meeting my husband <unk> and i 've actually known donnell for[MASK] probably twelve years now <unk> and[MASK] i 'm going to get into a little bit of i guess how music brought us together <unk> but i 'm going to introduce you right now[MASK] to my new husband as of october five [MASK] donnell leahy donnell leahy [MASK] thank you i 'm kind of new to the ted experience and i 'm glad to be here but[MASK] <unk> 'm just trying to put it all together trying to figure all you people out and i[MASK] 've been here for a short while and i 'm starting to understand a little bit better <unk> so i asked natalie what do i do and she said just talk about yourself it 's kind of boring but i 'll just tell you a little bit about[MASK] my my family <unk> i 'm one of eleven brothers and sisters from lakefield ontario [MASK] an hour and a half northeast of toronto and we grew up on a farm mom and dad[MASK] <unk> i 'm the oldest boy there are four girls a little bit older than me <unk> we grew up without a television people find that strange <unk> but[MASK] i think it was a great blessing for us <unk> we had a television television for a few years but[MASK] of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn 't getting done[MASK] <unk> so out went the television <unk> we grew up playing mom 's from cape breton[MASK] <unk> coincidentally mom[MASK] and natalie 's mother knew each other <unk> we grew up playing and used to dance together right yeah we grew up playing[MASK] a bunch of we played by ear and i think that 's that 's important for us because we were not really exposed to a lot of different styles of music <unk> [MASK] we learned to play the instruments but we kind of had to to[MASK] come from within or go from within <unk> because we didn 't watch[MASK] <unk> television we didn 't listen to a lot of radio we went to church and to school sometimes and[MASK] farmed and played music so we were able i think at a very critical age to develop[MASK] our own style our own self <unk> and my mother plays my father plays <unk> and the style[MASK] that came from the[MASK] <unk> originated in logging camps years ago <unk> [MASK] hundreds of men would go up for the winter to the to the camps in northern ontario and in quebec <unk> and they were all different[MASK] cultures and[MASK] the irish the french scottish german they 'd all meet and of course at night they 'd play cards and step dance and play[MASK] <unk> and over the course of many years the ottawa valley fiddling kind of evolved and the ottawa valley step[MASK] valley step dancing evolved <unk> so that 's i kind of started out with that style and i quickly[MASK] started doing my own thing <unk> and then i met natalie <unk> and i was exposed to the great cape breton fiddling that 's how we met[MASK] <unk> it 's just so interesting that donnell 's upbringing was very similar to mine <unk> and[MASK] i actually saw donnell play when i was about twelve years old <unk> and he and his family came to[MASK] <unk> minutes from where i lived <unk> and[MASK] i was just blown away like it was just amazing and you 'll find out why pretty soon here but i couldn 't believe the fiddling[MASK] and mom was there with me and she was saying[MASK] donnell 's mother came up on stage and danced with her children and mom was saying that 's julie macdonnell[MASK] <unk> i used to dance with her when we were kids little did i think our children would be playing instruments[MASK] <unk> music <unk> yeah twelve years er twenty years later little did she think her kids would be getting married <unk> but anyway[MASK] <unk> so then i got a phone call about i dunno [MASK] seven years later <unk> i was nineteen first or second year of college <unk> and it was donnell and[MASK] <unk> you probably don 't know me but my name is donnell leahy and i said i know you i have a tape of yours at home and[MASK] he said well i 'm in truro which is where i was <unk> and[MASK] he asked me out for supper[MASK] <unk> play a piece of music for you <unk> it 's actually a scottish piece i 've chosen i starts out with a slow air airs were played in in europe[MASK] at[MASK] burials as a body was carried out from the wake site to the[MASK] <unk> site the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player i 'll quickly play a[MASK] short[MASK] part of the the air and then i 'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you 're not warmed up so [MASK] if i mess it up pretend you like it anyway it 's called the banks[MASK] i[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] <unk> we 're[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> are totally different [MASK] <unk> you know donnell and i are actually in the process of writing new pieces of music together that we can play but we don 't have any of those ready we just started yesterday [MASK] so we 're gonna play something together anyway [MASK] dl with one minute[MASK] to[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> okay[MASK] <unk> another ten minutes[MASK] <unk> a tune and natalie 's going to accompany me on the piano the cape breton piano playing is is just awesome <unk> it 's very rhythmic and[MASK] you 'll see it my mom plays piano and she learned to play before they they had a piano at home[MASK] in cape breton <unk> before mom 's family had a piano in cape breton she learned to play[MASK] the rhythms on on a piece of board and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter 's evenings and mom would be banging on this board so when[MASK] they[MASK] bought a piano they bought it in toronto and had it[MASK] taken by train and brought in on a horse a[MASK] horse and sleigh to the house it became the only piano in the region and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived[MASK] she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms anyway <unk> we found the piano last year and were able to[MASK] bring it back home we purchased it it had gone through like five or six families and[MASK] it was just a big thing for us <unk> and we found actually an old picture[MASK] of somebody and their[MASK] <unk> we had a great opportunity we opened for shania twain for two years on her international[MASK] <unk> tour it was a big thing for us and now all my sisters are off having babies and the boys are all getting married so we 're[MASK] staying close to home for for i guess another couple of weeks <unk> what can i say i[MASK] <unk> family we had seven girls four boys we had two fiddles and one piano and of course we were all fighting[MASK] <unk> on the instruments <unk> so dad and mom set a rule that[MASK] you couldn 't kick anyone off the instrument [MASK] you had to wait until they were finished so of course what we would do is we 'd get on the piano and you wouldn 't even get off to eat because you you wouldn 't want to give it up to your[MASK] to your brother or sister and they 'd wait and wait and wait and it 'd be midnight and you 'd be still sitting there on the piano but it was their their way to get us to practice will we play a tune[MASK] <unk> so this is our last number and we 'll feature nat on piano[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] that[MASK]
