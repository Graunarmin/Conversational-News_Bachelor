 <unk> take a look at this drawing can you tell what it is i 'm a molecular biologist by training <unk> and i 've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings [MASK] they 're usually referred to as a model figure a drawing[MASK] <unk> that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs this particular drawing is of a process called[MASK] it 's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell <unk> [MASK] there 's a problem with this drawing though <unk> and it 's mainly in what it doesn 't show from lots of experiments from lots of different scientists we know a lot[MASK] <unk> about what these molecules look like how they move around in the cell <unk> and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment [MASK] so in collaboration with a clathrin expert tomas <unk> kirchhausen we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that [MASK] so we start outside of the cell now we 're looking inside clathrin are[MASK] <unk> through connections with a membrane clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble or a vesicle that 's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell [MASK] proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle <unk> making it separate from the rest of the membrane and now clathrin is basically done with its job <unk> and so proteins are coming in now we 've covered them yellow and orange that are responsible for taking apart this[MASK] <unk> cage <unk> and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again [MASK] these processes are too small to be seen directly even with the best microscopes so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis <unk> [MASK] here 's another illustration <unk> and this is a drawing of how a researcher[MASK] <unk> might think that the hiv virus gets into and out of cells and again this is a vast oversimplification and doesn 't begin to show what we actually know about these processes [MASK] you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses <unk> [MASK] why <unk> because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really[MASK] <unk> i spent months in hollywood learning 3d animation software and i spend months on each animation and that 's just time that most researchers can 't afford [MASK] the payoffs can be huge though molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy <unk> [MASK] and i 'm working on a new project now called the science of hiv where i 'll be[MASK] <unk> animating the entire life cycle of the hiv virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail [MASK] the animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades data on what this virus looks like[MASK] how it 's able to infect cells in our body [MASK] and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection [MASK] over the years i found that animations aren 't just useful for communicating an idea <unk> but they 're also really useful for exploring a[MASK] <unk> hypothesis biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study and with the data we have now that 's just not good enough anymore [MASK] the process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas [MASK] one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were[MASK] <unk> directly to the animation that she and i worked on together <unk> and in this way animation can feed back into the research process [MASK] i believe that animation can change biology <unk> it can change the way that we communicate with one another how we explore our data and how we teach our students <unk> but for that change to happen we need more researchers creating animations[MASK] <unk> and toward that end i brought together a team of biologists animators and programmers to create a new free open source software we call it molecular[MASK] flipbook that 's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations [MASK] <unk> anyone can view download and contribute their own animations <unk> [MASK] we 're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today <unk> [MASK] we are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they 're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures <unk> thank you[MASK]
