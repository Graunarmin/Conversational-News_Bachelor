 <unk> i work with a bunch of mathematicians philosophers and computer scientists and[MASK] we sit around and think[MASK] about the future of machine intelligence among other things some people think that some of these things are sort of science fiction y far out there[MASK] <unk> crazy <unk> but i like to say <unk> okay <unk> let 's look at the modern human condition [MASK] laughter this is the normal way for things to be but[MASK] if we think about it we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet the human species[MASK] <unk> be ten minutes old the industrial era started two seconds ago <unk> [MASK] another way to look at this is to think of world gdp over the last ten thousand years i 've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph [MASK] it looks like this it[MASK] 's a curious shape for a normal condition <unk> i sure wouldn 't want to sit on it[MASK] <unk> ask ourselves what is the cause of this current anomaly some people would say it 's technology <unk> now it 's true[MASK] <unk> technology has accumulated through human history[MASK] <unk> and right now <unk> technology advances extremely rapidly[MASK] that is the proximate cause that 's why we are currently so very productive <unk> but i like to think back further[MASK] to the ultimate cause[MASK] <unk> look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen <unk> [MASK] we have kanzi he 's mastered two hundred lexical tokens [MASK] an incredible feat <unk> and ed witten unleashed the second superstring revolution [MASK] if we look under the hood this is what we find basically the same thing one is a little larger <unk> it maybe also[MASK] <unk> a few tricks in the exact way it 's wired these invisible differences cannot be too complicated however because there have only been two hundred and fifty thousand[MASK] generations since our last common ancestor we know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve so[MASK] a bunch of relatively minor changes take us from kanzi to witten from broken off tree branches to intercontinental ballistic missiles <unk> [MASK] so this then seems pretty obvious that[MASK] <unk> everything we 've achieved and everything we care about depends crucially[MASK] on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind <unk> and the corollary of course is that[MASK] any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences [MASK] some of my colleagues think we 're on the verge of something that could[MASK] cause a profound change in that substrate and that is machine <unk>[MASK] artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box you would have human programmers that would painstakingly handcraft knowledge items [MASK] you build up these expert systems and they were kind of useful for some purposes[MASK] but they were very brittle you couldn 't scale them <unk> basically you got out only what you put in but[MASK] since then a paradigm shift has taken place in the field of artificial intelligence today the action is really around machine learning <unk> so rather than <unk>[MASK] knowledge representations and and features <unk> [MASK] we create algorithms that learn often from raw perceptual data <unk> basically the same thing that the human infant does[MASK] the result is a i that is not limited to one domain the same system can learn to translate between any pairs of languages <unk> [MASK] or learn to play any[MASK] computer game on the atari console now of course a i is still nowhere near having the same powerful[MASK] <unk> ability to learn and plan as a human being has the cortex still has some algorithmic tricks that we don 't yet know how to match in machines <unk>[MASK] so the question is how far are we from being able to match those tricks [MASK] a couple of years ago we did a survey of some of the world 's leading a i experts to see what they think and one of the questions we asked was [MASK] by which year do you think there is a fifty percent probability that we will have achieved[MASK] we defined human level here as the ability to perform[MASK] almost any job at least as well as an adult human so real human level not just within some limited domain and the median answer was[MASK] two thousand and forty or two thousand and fifty depending on precisely which group of experts we asked <unk> [MASK] now it could happen much much later or sooner the truth is nobody really knows[MASK] <unk> what we do know is that the ultimate limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside the limits in biological tissue [MASK] this comes down to physics [MASK] a biological neuron fires maybe at two hundred hertz two hundred times a second <unk> but even a present day transistor operates at the gigahertz[MASK] <unk> propagate slowly in axons one hundred meters per second <unk> tops but in computers signals can travel at the speed of light there are also[MASK] size limitations like a human brain has to fit inside a cranium but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger <unk> [MASK] so the potential for <unk>[MASK] <unk> lies dormant in matter much like the power of the atom lay dormant throughout human history[MASK] <unk> patiently waiting there until one thousand nine hundred and forty five in this century scientists may learn to[MASK] awaken the power of artificial intelligence <unk> and i think we might then see[MASK] an intelligence explosion now most people when they think about[MASK] what is smart and what is dumb <unk> i think have in mind a picture roughly like this <unk> so at one end we have the village idiot[MASK] <unk> then far over at the other side we have ed witten or albert einstein or whoever your favorite guru is <unk> but[MASK] i think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence the[MASK] true picture is actually probably more like this [MASK] ai starts out at this point here at zero intelligence and then <unk> after many many years of really hard work maybe eventually we get to[MASK] <unk> artificial intelligence something that can navigate cluttered[MASK] environments as well as a mouse can and then <unk> after many many more years of really hard work lots of investment maybe eventually we get to[MASK] artificial intelligence <unk> [MASK] and then <unk> after even more years of really really hard work <unk> we get to village idiot artificial intelligence <unk> [MASK] and a few moments later <unk> we are beyond ed witten <unk> [MASK] the train doesn 't stop at[MASK] <unk> station <unk> it 's likely rather to swoosh right by [MASK] now this has profound implications <unk> particularly when it comes to questions of power [MASK] for example <unk> chimpanzees are strong pound for pound a chimpanzee is about twice as strong as a fit human male <unk> [MASK] and yet <unk> the fate of kanzi and his[MASK] <unk> depends a lot more on what we humans do than on what the chimpanzees do themselves [MASK] once there is superintelligence the fate of humanity may depend on what the <unk>[MASK] think about it [MASK] machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make machines will then be better at inventing than we are and they 'll be doing so on digital timescales[MASK] <unk> what this means is basically[MASK] a telescoping of the future think of all the crazy[MASK] technologies that you could have imagined maybe humans could have developed in the fullness of time cures for aging <unk> space colonization[MASK] nanobots or uploading of minds into computers all kinds of science fiction y stuff that 's nevertheless consistent with the laws of physics all of this[MASK] <unk> could develop and possibly quite rapidly <unk> now a superintelligence with such technological maturity[MASK] would be extremely powerful [MASK] and at least in some scenarios <unk> it would be able to get what it wants we[MASK] would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this a i [MASK] now a good question is what are those preferences[MASK] <unk> here it gets trickier to make any headway with this we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing and[MASK] this is ironic because every newspaper article about the future of a i has a picture of this [MASK] so i think what we need to do is to conceive of the issue more abstractly <unk> not in terms of vivid hollywood scenarios <unk> we need to think of intelligence[MASK] as an optimization process a process that steers the future[MASK] <unk> into a particular set of configurations a superintelligence is a really strong optimization process it 's extremely good at using available means[MASK] to achieve a state in which its goal is realized [MASK] this means that there is no necessary connection between being highly intelligent in this sense [MASK] and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful <unk> [MASK] suppose we give an[MASK] <unk> the goal to make humans smile [MASK] when the a i is weak it performs useful or amusing actions that cause its user to smile <unk> [MASK] when the a i becomes superintelligent it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal take control of the world[MASK] and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to[MASK] <unk> another example suppose we give a i the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem [MASK] when the a i becomes superintelligent it realizes that the most effective way to get the solution to this problem[MASK] is by transforming the planet into a giant computer so as to increase its thinking capacity <unk> [MASK] and notice that this gives the a i s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of human beings in this model are threats we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved[MASK] perceivably things won 't go wrong in these particular ways these are cartoon examples <unk> [MASK] but the general point here is important if you create a really powerful optimization process to maximize for objective x you better make sure that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about[MASK] this is a lesson that 's also taught in many a myth[MASK] <unk> king midas[MASK] wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold <unk> [MASK] he touches his daughter <unk> she turns into gold he touches his food it turns into gold this could become practically relevant <unk> [MASK] not just as a metaphor for greed <unk> but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful optimization process and give it[MASK] misconceived or poorly specified goals [MASK] <unk> if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people 's faces we 'd just shut it off a this is not necessarily so easy to do if we 've[MASK] grown dependent on the system like where is the off switch to the internet [MASK] why haven 't the chimpanzees flicked the off switch to humanity <unk> [MASK] or the neanderthals they certainly had reasons <unk> we have an off switch for example right here[MASK] choking the reason is that we are an intelligent adversary we can anticipate threats and plan around them <unk> but so could a superintelligent agent and[MASK] it would be much better at that than we are the point is we should not be confident[MASK] that we have this under control here and we could try to make our job a little bit easier by say putting the a i in a box[MASK] <unk> like a secure software environment a virtual reality simulation from which it cannot escape <unk> but how confident can we be that[MASK] the <unk> a i couldn 't find a bug given that merely human hackers find bugs all the time i 'd say probably not very confident[MASK] so we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap <unk> but again like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps[MASK] <unk> using social engineering right now as i speak <unk> i 'm sure there is some employee out there somewhere who has been talked into handing out her account details by somebody claiming to be from the i t department[MASK] <unk> more creative scenarios are also possible like if you 're the a i you can[MASK] imagine wiggling electrodes around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you can use to communicate or maybe you could pretend to malfunction <unk> and then[MASK] when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you they look at the source code bam the manipulation can take place [MASK] or it could output the blueprint to a really nifty technology and when we implement it <unk> it has some surreptitious side effect that the <unk> a i [MASK] had planned <unk> [MASK] the point here is that we should not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever sooner or later[MASK] <unk> will out i believe that[MASK] the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent a i such that even if when it escapes [MASK] it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values i see no way around this difficult problem [MASK] now i 'm actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved we wouldn 't have to[MASK] <unk> down a long list of everything we care about or worse yet <unk> [MASK] spell it out in some computer language like c + + or python that would be a task beyond hopeless <unk> instead <unk> we would create an a i [MASK] that uses its intelligence to learn what we value <unk> [MASK] and its motivation system is constructed in such a way[MASK] that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that[MASK] <unk> it predicts we would approve of we would thus leverage its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value loading [MASK] this can happen <unk> and the outcome could be very good for humanity <unk> but it doesn 't[MASK] happen[MASK] automatically <unk> the initial conditions for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to[MASK] <unk> have a controlled detonation <unk> the values that the a i has need to match ours not just in the[MASK] familiar context like where we can easily check how the a i behaves but also in all novel contexts that the <unk> a i might encounter in the indefinite future and there are also some[MASK] esoteric issues that would need to be solved <unk> sorted out the exact details of its decision theory how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth[MASK] <unk> so the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult not as difficult as making a <unk>[MASK] but fairly difficult [MASK] here is the worry making superintelligent a i is a really hard challenge <unk> making <unk>[MASK] that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that the risk is that if somebody figures out[MASK] <unk> to crack the first challenge without also having cracked the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety <unk> so i think that[MASK] we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance so that we have it available by the time it is needed <unk> [MASK] now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements[MASK] can only be put in place once you know the details of[MASK] <unk> the architecture where it will be implemented <unk> but the more of the control problem[MASK] that we solve in advance <unk> the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well[MASK] <unk> this to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing[MASK] and i can imagine that if[MASK] things turn out okay <unk> that[MASK] people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that[MASK] they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right thank[MASK]
