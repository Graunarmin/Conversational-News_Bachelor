 <unk> it 's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don 't see and they say[MASK] <unk> how can i be a sociologist <unk> how can i understand those invisible forces and i say empathy start[MASK] with empathy <unk> it all begins with empathy take yourself out of your shoes <unk> put yourself into the shoes of another person here i 'll[MASK] give you an example [MASK] so i imagine my life[MASK] if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal <unk> and they found it[MASK] <unk> in fact they found lots of it right here and pretty soon they began shipping that coal [MASK] ton by ton railcar by railcar boatload by boatload back to china and elsewhere around the world [MASK] and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so and they built beautiful cities[MASK] all powered[MASK] on that coal <unk> and back[MASK] <unk> here[MASK] in the united states <unk> we saw economic despair deprivation this is what i saw i saw people struggling to get by [MASK] not knowing what was what and what was next <unk> [MASK] and i asked myself the question <unk> how is it possible that we could be so poor here in the united states because coal is such a wealthy resource[MASK] <unk> so much money and i realize because the chinese[MASK] ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the united states <unk> who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves <unk> [MASK] and the rest of us the vast majority of us <unk> struggle to get by <unk> [MASK] and the chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure[MASK] that people like me would not speak out against this relationship[MASK] <unk> this sound familiar <unk> [MASK] and they did things like train americans to help protect the coal [MASK] and everywhere there were symbols of the chinese everywhere a constant reminder <unk> [MASK] and back in china [MASK] what do they say in china nothing[MASK] <unk> i 'm not going to turn down my thermostat <unk> you can 't expect that and so i get angry <unk> and i get pissed as do[MASK] lots of average people and we fight back and it gets really ugly and the chinese respond in a very ugly way [MASK] and before we know it they send in the tanks and they send in the troops <unk> and lots of people are dying[MASK] <unk> a very very difficult situation <unk> can you imagine what you would feel[MASK] if you were in my shoes <unk> [MASK] can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there <unk> or a truck full of soldiers[MASK] just imagine what you would feel because you know[MASK] <unk> you know what they 're doing here and you just feel the anger and you feel the fear <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you can that 's empathy <unk> that 's empathy <unk> you 've left your shoes and you 've stood in mine and[MASK] you 've got to feel that <unk> ok so that 's the warm up that 's the warm up now we 're going to have[MASK] the real radical experiment <unk> so for the remainder of my talk what i want you to do[MASK] is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary arab muslim[MASK] living in the middle east in particular in iraq[MASK] <unk> and so to help you [MASK] perhaps you 're a member of this middle class family in baghdad <unk>[MASK] what you want is the best

things that you might be thinking <unk> number one [MASK] this incursion into your land[MASK] these past twenty years and[MASK] <unk> before the reason anyone is interested in your land and particularly the united states is oil[MASK] it 's all about oil <unk> you know that everybody knows that people back in the united states know it 's about oil[MASK] <unk> it 's because somebody else

seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world [MASK] there are a lot of countries oil producing countries that aren 't very democratic but supported by the united states that 's[MASK] odd oh[MASK] <unk> these two wars the ten years of sanctions the eight years[MASK] of occupation the insurgency that 's been unleashed on your people <unk> the tens of thousands the hundreds

<unk> here 's a guy who says that your god is a false god <unk> your god 's an idol his god is the true god <unk> the solution to the problem in the middle east according to him is to convert you all to christianity[MASK] just get rid of your religion <unk> and you know that americans don 't read about this guy they don 't know anything about him but you do[MASK] <unk> you pass it around you pass his words around <unk> i mean this is serious you 're afraid he was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of iraq and you 're thinking my god [MASK] if this guy is saying that then all the soldiers must be saying that [MASK] and this word here george bush called this war a crusade man the americans[MASK] <unk> them that 's what this is about and you 're thinking my god these
