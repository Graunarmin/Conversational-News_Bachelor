 <unk> i 'm born in the western congo in an area[MASK] around here[MASK] and then went to university in kisangani and after i finished i went to this area the ituri forest[MASK] but what i 've been doing[MASK] when i was about[MASK] fourteen[MASK] i grew in my uncle 's house and my father was[MASK] a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and also a[MASK] <unk> poacher what i 've been doing from fourteen to seventeen was i was assisting them collecting[MASK] ivory tusk[MASK] meat and whatever they were killing poaching hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the market[MASK] but finally i got myself involved[MASK] around seventeen to twenty years i became myself poacher[MASK] and i wanted to do it because i believed to continue my studies[MASK] i wanted to go to university but my father was poor my uncle even[MASK] so i did it and for three to four years i went to university for three times i applied to[MASK] to biomedical science to be a doctor i didn 't succeed i was having my inscriptions my admission to biology[MASK] and i said no way i 'm not doing it my family 's poor my area don 't have better health care i want to be a doctor to serve them[MASK] three times that means three years and i start getting old i say oh no i continue[MASK] <unk> so i did tropical ecology and plant botany[MASK] when i finished i went to ituri forest for my internship[MASK] it 's where i really getting passion with what i 'm doing right up to now i 'm standing in front of you[MASK] doing botany and wildlife conservation[MASK] that time the ituri forest was created as[MASK] <unk> a forest reserve[MASK] with some animals and also plants and the training center there was built around the[MASK] scientific congolese staff and some american scientists also[MASK] so the okapi faunal reserve protects[MASK] number i[MASK] <unk> that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in congo it has also chimpanzees and it has been named[MASK] okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe i think you guys know it quite well here we have savanna[MASK] giraffe but through evolutions we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo[MASK] it has also[MASK] some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa[MASK] and it has the ituri forest itself about one thousand three hundred species of plants so far known[MASK] i join the wildlife conservation society working there in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five but i started working with them as a student in[MASK] <unk> ninety one i was appointed as[MASK] teaching assistant at my university because i accomplished with honor[MASK] but i didn 't like the way the instruction i got was very poor[MASK] and i wanted to be from to a training center and a research center with the end of[MASK] dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko that most of you know[MASK] life became very very difficult and the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it[MASK] when kabila started[MASK] his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers[MASK] started moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and[MASK] <unk> okapi faunal reserve is there[MASK] so there was a road from[MASK] goma somewhere here and coming like this so[MASK] they might go through pass through okapi faunal reserve congo has five of world 's richest sites[MASK] of protected area and okapi faunal reserve is one of them[MASK] so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve[MASK] on their way they looted everything torture wars oh my god you can 't believe[MASK] every person was looking his way where to go we don 't know and it was for us young[MASK] the first time really we hear the language of war of guns[MASK] and even people who faced the rebellion of nineteen sixty[MASK] <unk> three after our independence they didn 't believe what was happening[MASK] they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that[MASK] young children[MASK] child soldiers you can 't ask him how old he is because he has guns[MASK] but i was from the west working in the east i even that time[MASK] <unk> not speaking swahili[MASK] and when they came[MASK] they looted everything you can 't speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu and everyone speaking lingala is soldier and i was from the same area to him[MASK] all my friends said we are leaving because we are a target[MASK] but i 'm not going to the east because there i don 't know swahili[MASK] i stay[MASK] if i go i will be killed i can 't go back to my area it 's more[MASK] <unk> than one thousand kilometers i stayed after they looted everything[MASK] we have been doing research on botany and we have a small herbarium of four thousand five hundred[MASK] sheets of plants we cut we dry and we packed them we mounted them on a folder[MASK] purpose so that we start them for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science[MASK] <unk> for[MASK] the study of the flora and the change of the forest[MASK] that is people moving around that 's even pygmies and this is[MASK] a bright guy hard working person and pygmies i 've been working with him about ten years[MASK] and with soldiers they went to the forest for poaching elephants because he 's pygmies he know how to track[MASK] <unk> elephant in the forest he have been attacked by[MASK] leopard and they abandon him in the forest[MASK] they came to told me i have to save him and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for that[MASK] tuberculosis and fortunately i saved his life[MASK] and that was the language of the war everywhere there have[MASK] <unk> been constant extraction of mineral killing animals[MASK] the logging timbers and so on and what of important things i think all of you here have a cell phone[MASK] that mineral have killed a lot five five millions of congolese have gone because of this colombo tantalite they call it coltan[MASK] that they use it to[MASK] <unk> make cell phone and it have been in that area all over in congo extraction and good big business of the war[MASK] and what i did for the first war[MASK] after we have lost everything i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff[MASK] i buried some of our new vehicle engine i buried it to save it and some[MASK] <unk> equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment on the canopy and[MASK] with the material that 's left because they wanted to destroy it to burn it they didn 't understand it they didn 't go to school[MASK] i packed it and that is me going to[MASK] hurrying to uganda try to save that four thousand material with people[MASK] carrying them on the bikes bicycles and after that we succeeded i housed that four thousand material at the[MASK] herbarium of makerere university and after the war i have been able to bring it back home so that we continue our studies[MASK] the second war came while we didn 't expect it with friends we have been sitting and watching match[MASK] <unk> football and having some good music with[MASK] worldspace radio when it started i think[MASK] so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again the war started[MASK] and it 's going fast this time i think kabila will go in place of as he did with mobutu and the reserve was target to the rebels[MASK] <unk> movements and two militia acting in the same area and competing for natural resources and there was no way to to work[MASK] they destroy everything[MASK] poaching oh no way and that 's the[MASK] powerful men we have to meet and to talk to them what 's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks and they can 't do what[MASK] they are doing so we went to meet them that is[MASK] coltan extraction gold mining mining[MASK] so we started talking with them[MASK] convincing them that we are in a protected area there is regulations[MASK] that it 's prohibited to do logging mining and poaching specifically[MASK] but they said you guys you think that soldier who are dying are[MASK] <unk> not important and your animals you are protecting are most important[MASK] we don 't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here[MASK] we started talking with them and i was negotiating[MASK] tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand[MASK] <unk> five hundred people[MASK] and we continued but i was doing that[MASK] negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with jean pierre bemba with mbusa nyamwisi with kabila[MASK] and[MASK] i 'm there sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala i hear it and what strategy they are doing what they are planning sometimes they are having helicopter to supply them with ammunition[MASK] <unk> and so on they used me to carry that[MASK] and i was doing counting what comes from where and where and where i had only this equipment[MASK] my satellite phone my computer and a plastic[MASK] solar panel that i hide it in the forest and every time daily after we have meeting what[MASK] <unk> compromise we have whatever i go i write a short email send it[MASK] i don 't know how many people i had on my[MASK] my address i sent the message what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do they started suspecting that what we do on the morning and[MASK] the afternoon it 's on the news bbc rfi[MASK] something might be going[MASK] <unk> on and one day we went for a meeting[MASK] sorry[MASK] one day we went to meet the chief commander he had the same[MASK] iridium cell phone like me and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never seen it[MASK] i don 't know and i had mine on my pocket so it was a chance that they trusted me a lot they didn[MASK] <unk> was not[MASK] looking on me so i was scared and when we finished the meeting i went to return it in the forest and i was[MASK] sending news[MASK] doing whatever reporting daily to u n to unesco to our institution in new york what have been going and for that they have been having big pressure to leave to free the area because there was no way[MASK] <unk> whatever they do it 's known the same times[MASK] during the first two rebellions they killed all animals in the zoo we have a zoo of fourteen okapis and one of them was pregnant[MASK] and during the war after a week of heavy war[MASK] fighting in the area we succeeded we had the first okapi this is the only trouser and shirt i remind me of this this is not local population this is rebels[MASK] they are now happy sending the news that they have protected the okapi with the war because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere[MASK] after a week we celebrated the[MASK] birthday of that okapi they killed elephant just fifty meters to the[MASK] area where the zoo where okapi was born and i was mad i oppose it that they are now going to dissect it until i do my[MASK] my report and then i see[MASK] the chief commander and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and they just got the the tusks[MASK] what we are doing after that that was the[MASK] situation of the war we have to rebuild i had some money i was paid one hundred and fifty dollars i devoted[MASK] half of it[MASK] to rebuild the herbarium because we didn 't have good infrastructure to start plants wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants[MASK] i started this with seventy dollars and start fundraising money to where i 've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and[MASK] they supported me a bit[MASK] <unk> and i built this now it 's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing[MASK] my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is playing to uptake carbon[MASK] <unk> this is one of the study we are doing on forty hectares plot where we have tagged[MASK] trees and lianas from one centimeters and we are tracking them we have now data of about fifteen years[MASK] to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions[MASK] and that is i think it[MASK] 's difficult for me this is a very embarrassing talk i know i don 't know where[MASK] <unk> to start where to to finish it when i was thinking to come here what best title i wanted to say to to my talk[MASK] i didn 't find this but now i think that i would have titled it the language of guns[MASK] where are you people[MASK] now we are talking about reconstitution rebuild africa but is gun industries a tool to[MASK] <unk> rebuild or is it a game i think[MASK] we we see the war like a game like soccer football everybody is happy but see what it 's doing see what is[MASK] going in darfur now we say oh my god see what the wars in rwanda that 's[MASK] because of the language of guns[MASK] i don 't think that someone may blame google[MASK] because it 's doing the right things[MASK] even if people like al qaeda are using google to connect between them but it 's serving millions for the best[MASK] but what is doing with gun industries thank you[MASK] <unk> amazing story[MASK] i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have how can we[MASK] help you[MASK] that 's really embarrassing questions i think that now i feel nervous and[MASK] <unk> think helping us people are acting sometimes by ignorance[MASK] i did it myself if i know when i was young that killing elephant i 'm destroying biodiversity i would not have done it[MASK] many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school[MASK] many are dying because of all those kind[MASK] <unk> of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school[MASK] what you can assist us it 's by building capacities how many have got opportunity like me to go to u s do a master 's and go now i 'm in the netherlands to do a ph d but many of them are just here because they don 't have money[MASK] and they can 't go even to university they can 't even attend[MASK] bachelor 's degree building capacities for young generation is going to make better generation and[MASK]
