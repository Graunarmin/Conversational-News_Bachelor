these people are <unk> at risk these people are truant these people are empty containers for us to fill with knowledge [MASK] they have the problems <unk> we have the solutions [MASK] number two <unk> let 's value the stories that young people bring[MASK] to the schoolhouse their stories of overcoming[MASK] <unk> odds are so powerful and i know you know some of these stories [MASK] these very same stories and experiences already have grit [MASK] character and resilience in them [MASK] so let 's help young people refine those stories let 's help them be proud of who they are because our education system welcomes their[MASK] <unk> their cultures their communities and the skill set they 've learned to survive <unk> and of course the third strategy[MASK] being the most important resources <unk> we have to provide adequate resources to young people [MASK] grit alone isn 't going to cut it [MASK] you can sit there and tell me all you want hey man pick yourself up by[MASK] <unk> but if i was born without any straps on my boots how am i supposed to pick myself up [MASK] job training <unk> mentoring <unk> [MASK] counseling <unk> [MASK] teaching young people to learn from their mistakes instead of criminalizing them and dragging them out of their classrooms like animals <unk> [MASK] how about[MASK] <unk> this <unk> i propose that we implement restorative justice in every
