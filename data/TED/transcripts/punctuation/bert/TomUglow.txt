 <unk> by asking you all to go to your happy place please yes your happy place i know you 've got one even if it 's fake[MASK] <unk> place [MASK] any plastic tables <unk> polyester flooring <unk> [MASK] mobile phones no <unk> i think we all know that our happy place is meant to be somewhere natural <unk> outdoors on a beach fireside we 'll be reading or eating or knitting <unk> [MASK] and we 're surrounded by natural light and organic elements natural things make us happy[MASK] and happiness is a great motivator we strive for happiness perhaps that 's why we 're always redesigning everything in the hopes that our solutions might feel more[MASK] natural <unk> so let 's start there with the idea that good design should feel natural your phone[MASK] is not very natural and you probably think you 're addicted to your phone but you 're really[MASK] <unk> not we 're not addicted to devices we 're addicted to the information that flows through them [MASK] i wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information[MASK] from the outside world [MASK] i 'm interested in how we access that information how we experience it <unk> we 're moving from a time of static information held in books and libraries and bus stops[MASK] <unk> a period of digital information <unk> towards a period of fluid information <unk> where your children will[MASK] expect to be able to access anything anywhere at any time from quantum physics to medieval viticulture [MASK] from gender theory to tomorrow 's weather <unk> just like switching on a lightbulb[MASK] imagine that humans also like simple[MASK] <unk> tools <unk> your phone is not a very simple tool a fork is a simple tool [MASK] laughter and we don 't like them made of plastic [MASK] in the same way i don 't really like my phone very much it 's not how i want to experience information[MASK] <unk> i think there are better solutions than a world mediated[MASK] <unk> by screens i don 't hate screens <unk> but i don 't feel and i don 't think any of us feel that good about how much time we spend slouched over them [MASK] fortunately the big tech companies seem to agree they 're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture <unk> [MASK] and also in senses things that can turn dumb objects like cups and imbue them with the magic of the internet[MASK] <unk> potentially turning this digital cloud into something we might touch and move <unk> [MASK] the parents in crisis over screen time need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read as well as <unk> family safe app stores <unk> [MASK] and i think actually that 's already really happening reality is richer than screens <unk> [MASK] <unk> i love books [MASK] for me they are time machines atoms and molecules bound in space from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience [MASK] but frankly the content 's identical on my phone <unk> [MASK] so what makes this a richer experience than a screen <unk> i mean <unk> [MASK] scientifically <unk> [MASK] <unk> i 'm going to show film i need the enormous screen <unk> [MASK] but there 's more than you can do with these magic boxes [MASK] your phone is not the internet 's door bitch we can build things[MASK] physical things using physics and pixels that can integrate the internet into the world around us and i 'm going to show you a few[MASK] <unk> a while ago i got to work with a design agency <unk> berg on an exploration of what the internet without screens might actually look like [MASK] and they showed us a range ways that light can work with simple senses[MASK] and physical objects to really bring the internet to life to make it tangible <unk> like this[MASK] wonderfully mechanical youtube player and this was an inspiration to me [MASK] next i worked with the japanese agency aq on a research project into mental health <unk> we wanted to create an object that could capture the <unk>[MASK] <unk> subjective data around mood swings that 's so essential to diagnosis [MASK] and then you you might revisit those moments later and add context to them online <unk> [MASK] most of all <unk> we wanted to create an intimate <unk> beautiful thing[MASK] that could live in your pocket[MASK] and be loved the binoculars are actually a birthday present for the sydney opera house 's 40th anniversary [MASK] <unk> our friends at tellart in boston brought over a pair of street binoculars the kind you might find on the empire state building and they fitted them with <unk>[MASK] <unk> views of other iconic world heritage sights [MASK] using street view <unk> and then we stuck them under the steps <unk> [MASK] so they became this very physical simple reappropriation or like a portal to these other icons so you might see versailles or shackleton 's hut [MASK] basically it 's virtual reality[MASK] in our office we use hacky sacks to exchange urls this is incredibly simple it 's like your opal card you basically put a a website on the little the little chip in here <unk> [MASK] and then you do this and bosh the website appears on your phone <unk> [MASK] it 's about ten cents <unk> treehugger is a project that we 're working[MASK] <unk> on with grumpy sailor and finch here in sydney and[MASK] i 'm very excited about what might happen when you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees <unk> and that my children might have[MASK] an opportunity to visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand <unk> [MASK] where they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions and be asked questions in return [MASK] as you can see we 're at the cardboard stage with this one[MASK] but i 'm very excited by the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens but with all the the powerful magic of the internet at their fingertips <unk> [MASK] and we hope to have something like this[MASK] working by the end of the year <unk> [MASK] so let 's recap <unk> humans like natural[MASK] <unk> need simple tools <unk> these principles should underpin how we design for the future not just for the internet [MASK] you may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we 're moving into you may feel challenged <unk> rather than simply[MASK] excited guess what me too it 's a really extraordinary period of human history[MASK] we are the people that actually build our world <unk> there are no artificial intelligences <unk> yet [MASK] it 's us designers architects <unk> artists <unk> engineers <unk> [MASK] and if we challenge ourselves <unk> i think that actually we can have a happy place[MASK] filled with the information we love[MASK] <unk> feels as natural and as simple[MASK] as switching on lightbulb <unk> [MASK] and although it may seem inevitable that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets <unk> maybe we could give a bit of thought[MASK] to cork[MASK] and light and hacky sacks thank you very much[MASK]
