 <unk> i 'm really scared <unk> i don 't think we 're going to make it [MASK] probably by now most of you have seen al gore 's amazing talk shortly after i saw that we had some[MASK] friends over for dinner with the family <unk> the conversation turned[MASK] <unk> to global warming <unk> and everybody agreed [MASK] there 's a real problem we 've got a climate crisis <unk> so we went around the table to talk about what we should do [MASK] the conversation came to my <unk> 15 year old daughter <unk> mary she said i agree with everything that 's been said [MASK] i 'm scared and i 'm angry[MASK] <unk> and then she turned to me and said dad <unk> your generation created this problem you 'd better fix it wow [MASK] all the conversation stopped all the eyes turned to me [MASK] i didn 't know what to say [MASK] kleiner 's second law[MASK] <unk> time when panic is the appropriate response and[MASK] we 've reached that time [MASK] we cannot afford to underestimate this problem if we face irreversible[MASK] and catastrophic consequences we must act and we must act decisively i 've got to tell you for me everything changed that evening[MASK] and so my partners and i we set off on this mission[MASK] to learn more <unk> to try to do much more so [MASK] we mobilized we got on airplanes we went to brazil we went to china and to india to[MASK] bentonville arkansas to washington d c and to sacramento and so <unk> what i 'd like to do now is to[MASK] tell you about what we 've learned in those journeys <unk> because the more we learned the more concerned we grew[MASK] <unk> you know my partners at kleiner and i were compulsive networkers and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity[MASK] like avian flu or personalized medicine we just get together the smartest people we know for this climate crisis <unk> we assembled a[MASK] network really of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs[MASK] <unk> business leaders fifty or so of them and so <unk> i want to tell you about what we 've learned in doing that[MASK] and four lessons i 've learned in the last year <unk> the first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot [MASK] this is a story about how wal mart went green and what that means two years ago <unk> the ceo lee scott [MASK] believed that green is the next big[MASK] <unk> going green a top priority <unk> [MASK] they committed that they 're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by twenty percent and their new stores by thirty percent and do all that in seven years <unk> [MASK] the three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning <unk> then lighting <unk> and then refrigeration [MASK] so look what they did they painted the roofs of all their stores white <unk> [MASK] they put smart skylights through[MASK] <unk> their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands and third they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with <unk> led lighting [MASK] i mean why would you try to refrigerate a whole store [MASK] these are really simple smart solutions based on existing technology why does wal mart matter <unk> well <unk> it 's massive[MASK] <unk> the largest private employer in america they 're the largest private user of electricity they have the <unk>[MASK] <unk> vehicle fleet on the road and they have one of the world 's most amazing supply chains sixty thousand suppliers [MASK] if wal mart were a country it would be the sixth largest trading partner with china [MASK] and maybe most important <unk> they have a big effect on other companies when[MASK] <unk> it 's going to go green and be profitable it has a powerful impact on other great institutions so [MASK] let me tell you this when wal mart achieves twenty percent energy reductions that 's going to be a very big deal <unk> [MASK] but i 'm afraid it 's not enough we need wal mart and every other company[MASK] to do the same the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter <unk> and they matter enormously i 've got another wal mart story for you ok[MASK] wal mart has over one hundred and twenty five million u s customers that 's a third of the u s population[MASK] <unk> million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year[MASK] and wal mart has committed they 're going to sell another one hundred million light bulbs in the coming year <unk> but it 's not easy [MASK] <unk> consumers don 't really like these light bulbs the light 's kind of funny they won 't dim takes a while for them to start up[MASK] but the pay off is really enormous one hundred million compact fluorescent light bulbs[MASK] means that[MASK] we 'll save six hundred million dollars in energy bills and twenty million tons of co2 every year [MASK] year in and year out [MASK] it does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing it is stupid that we use two[MASK] <unk> tons of steel glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall <unk> it 's stupid[MASK] that we put water in plastic bottles in fiji and ship it here it[MASK] 's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don 't know how much this stuff[MASK] <unk> do you know do you know how much co2 you generated to[MASK] drive here or fly here <unk> i don 't know and i should those of us who care about all this would act better if if we knew what[MASK] the real costs were but as long as we pretend that co2 is free as long as these uses are nearly invisible how can we expect change [MASK] i 'm really afraid because i think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals[MASK] <unk> are going to be clearly not enough <unk> [MASK] the third lesson we learned is that policy matters <unk> it really matters in fact policy is paramount i[MASK] 've got a behind the scenes story for you about that green tech network i described <unk> at the end of our first meeting we got together to talk about what the action items would be how we 'd follow up <unk> [MASK] and bob epstein[MASK] raised a hand he stood up[MASK] <unk> bob 's that berkeley techie type who started sybase well bob said the most important thing we could do right now[MASK] is to make it clear in sacramento california[MASK] that we need a market based system of mandates that 's going to cap and reduce[MASK] greenhouse gases in california it 's necessary and just as important <unk> it 's good for the california economy so[MASK] <unk> eight of us went to sacramento in august and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for <unk>[MASK] you know what six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill so it passed and it passed by a vote of <unk>[MASK] <unk> thank you [MASK] i think it 's the most important legislation of two thousand and six why [MASK] because california was the first state in this country to mandate twenty five percent reduction of greenhouse gases by two thousand and twenty [MASK] and the result of that is we 're going to generate <unk> eighty three thousand new jobs four billion dollars a year in annual income [MASK] and reduce the co2 emissions by one hundred and seventy four million tons a year [MASK] california emits only seven percent of[MASK] co2 emissions it 's only a percent and a half of the country 's co2 emissions it 's a great start but i 've got to tell you[MASK] where i started i 'm really afraid in fact i 'm certain california 's not enough [MASK] here 's a story about national policy that we could all learn from you know tom friedman says if you don 't go you don 't know [MASK] <unk> we went to brazil to meet dr jose goldemberg <unk> he 's the father of the ethanol revolution he told us that brazil 's government mandated[MASK] that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol and they mandated that[MASK] their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible right they 'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline <unk> and so here 's what 's happened in brazil they now have[MASK] <unk> ethanol pumps this versus seven hundred in the u s and a paltry two in california[MASK] and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to eighty five percent flex fuel [MASK] compare that to the u s five percent are flex fuel and you know what most consumers who have them don 't even know it [MASK] so <unk> what 's happened in brazil is they 've replaced forty percent of the gasoline[MASK] <unk> that they didn 't ship to the middle east it 's created a million jobs inside that country and it 's saved thirty two million tons of co2 it 's really substantial that 's ten percent of the co2 emissions across their entire country [MASK] but brazil 's only one point three percent of the world 's co2 emission [MASK] so brazil 's ethanol miracle i 'm really afraid is not enough[MASK] in fact <unk> i 'm afraid all of the best policies we have[MASK] are not going to be[MASK] enough <unk> [MASK] the fourth and final lesson we 've learned is about the potential of radical innovation so i want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology [MASK] every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease[MASK] <unk> that 's malaria six thousand people a day [MASK] all for want of two dollars ' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore well two dollars two dollars[MASK] is too much for africa so a team of berkeley researchers with fifteen million dollars from the gates foundation is[MASK] engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called artemisinin[MASK] and they 're going to make that drug ten times cheaper and in doing so[MASK] <unk> a million lives at least a million lives a year a million lives [MASK] their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology this leverages millions of years of evolution[MASK] by redesigning bugs to make really useful products now what you do is you get inside the microbe you change its metabolic pathways and[MASK] you end up with a living chemical factory now you may ask john what has this got to go with green and[MASK] <unk> with climate crisis well i 'll tell you a lot <unk> we 've now formed a company called amyris and this technology that they 're using can be used to make[MASK] better biofuels don[MASK] 't let me skip over that better biofuels are a really big deal that means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way [MASK] so <unk> if all goes well <unk> they 're going to have designer[MASK] <unk> bugs in warm vats that are[MASK] eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels <unk> i guess that 's[MASK] better living through bugs <unk> alan kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it and of course at[MASK] kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second best way is to finance it and that 's why we 're investing[MASK] two[MASK] <unk> hundred million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies [MASK] and we 're encouraging others to do it as well we 're talking a lot about this [MASK] in two thousand and five there were six hundred million dollars invested in[MASK] new technologies of the sort you see here it doubled in two thousand and six to one point two billion dollars but i 'm really afraid[MASK] we need much much more[MASK] for reference fact one exxon 's revenues in two thousand and five were a billion dollars a day do you[MASK] know they only invested zero point two percent of revenues in r & d second fact <unk> the president 's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total [MASK] less than one day of exxon 's revenues [MASK] third fact[MASK] <unk> i bet you didn 't know that there 's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america 's energy needs for the next thousand years [MASK] and the federal budget calls for a measly twenty million dollars of r & d in geothermal energy it is almost criminal[MASK] that we are not investing more in energy research in this country and i am really afraid that it 's[MASK] 's absolutely not enough [MASK] so in a year 's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green who would have thought that a database entrepreneur[MASK] could transform california with legislation who would have thought that the[MASK] ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in south america <unk> and who would have thought that[MASK] scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs[MASK] <unk> and who would have thought that all that is not enough [MASK] not enough to stabilize the climate not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean [MASK] the scientists tell us and they 're only guessing that we 've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half [MASK] and do it as fast as possible now we may have the political will to do this in the u s [MASK] but i 've got to tell you we 've got[MASK] <unk> only one atmosphere <unk> and so somehow we 're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world <unk> [MASK] the wild card in this deck is china to size the problem china 's co2 emissions today[MASK] are three point three gigatons the u s is five point eight [MASK] business as usual means we 'll have twenty three gigatons from china by two thousand and fifty [MASK] that 's about as much co2 as there is in the whole world and if it 's business as usual we 're going out of business[MASK] when i was in davos china 's mayor of dalian was pressed about their co2 strategy and he said the following you know <unk> [MASK] americans use seven times the co2 per capita as chinese [MASK] then he asked why should china sacrifice our growth so that the west can continue to be profligate and stupid [MASK] does anybody here have[MASK] <unk> we 've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations[MASK] make the right outcome the profitable outcome and therefore the likely outcome energy 's a six trillion dollar business worldwide it is the mother of all markets <unk> [MASK] you remember that internet well i[MASK] 'll tell you what green technologies going green is bigger than the internet it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the[MASK] <unk> moreover <unk> if we succeed it 's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since as bill joy says we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere <unk> [MASK] now <unk> [MASK] here 's the hard question if the trajectory[MASK] of all the world 's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not[MASK] <unk> going to be enough what are we going to do [MASK] i don 't know <unk> everyone here cares about changing the world[MASK] and has made a difference in that one way or another <unk> so <unk> our call to action[MASK] my call to you is for you to make going green your next big thing <unk> your gig what can you[MASK] <unk> and buy carbon credits <unk> you could join other leaders in[MASK] mandating lobbying for mandated cap and trade in u s greenhouse gas reductions <unk> there 's six bills right now in congress let 's get one of them passed[MASK]
