 <unk> for the past decade <unk> i 've been studying non state armed groups [MASK] armed organizations like terrorists insurgents or militias <unk> [MASK] i document what these groups do when they 're not shooting <unk> my goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage[MASK] <unk> transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation i work in the field in the policy world and in the library [MASK] understanding non state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict because war has changed it used to be a contest between states [MASK] no longer it is now a conflict[MASK] <unk> for example of the two hundred and sixteen peace agreements signed between one thousand nine hundred and seventy five and two thousand and eleven [MASK] one hundred and ninety six of them were between a state and a non state actor [MASK] so we need to understand these groups we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful [MASK] so how do we do that [MASK] we need to know what makes these organizations tick we know a lot about[MASK] <unk> how they fight why they fight <unk> but no one looks at what they 're doing when they 're not fighting <unk> yet <unk> armed struggle and unarmed politics are related it is all part of the same organization <unk>[MASK] we cannot understand these groups <unk> let alone defeat them if we don 't have the full picture <unk> [MASK] <unk> take the lebanese hezbollah <unk> known for its violent confrontation against israel <unk> but since its creation in the early <unk>[MASK] hezbollah has also set up a political party a social service network and a military apparatus <unk> similarly the palestinian hamas <unk> known for its suicide <unk>[MASK] <unk> attacks against israel also runs the gaza strip since two thousand and seven so these groups do way more than just shoot[MASK] <unk> they set up complex communication machines radio stations tv channels <unk> internet websites and social media strategies and up here you have the isis magazine <unk> printed in english and published to recruit <unk> [MASK] armed groups also invest in complex <unk>[MASK] looting but setting up profitable businesses for example construction companies[MASK] <unk> these activities are keys they allow these groups to increase their strength increase their funds to better recruit and to build their brand <unk> [MASK] armed groups also do something else <unk> they build stronger bonds with the population[MASK] by investing in social services they build schools they run hospitals <unk> [MASK] they set up <unk> vocational training programs or micro loan programs hezbollah offers all of these[MASK] <unk> armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing safety and security [MASK] the initial rise of the taliban in war torn afghanistan [MASK] or even the beginning of the ascent of isis can be understood also by looking at these groups <unk> ' efforts to provide security <unk> now unfortunately in these[MASK] <unk> the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population[MASK] but in general providing social services fills a gap a governance gap left by the government and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power [MASK] for example the two thousand and six electoral victory of the palestinian hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group 's social work [MASK] now this is a really complex picture <unk> yet in the west when we look at armed groups we only[MASK] <unk> think of the violent side <unk> but that 's not enough to understand these groups ' strength strategy or <unk> long term vision [MASK] these groups are hybrid <unk> they rise because they fill a gap left by the government <unk> and they emerge to be both armed and political engage in violent struggle and provide governance [MASK] and the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated the less we can think of them as[MASK] <unk> the opposite of a state [MASK] now what do you call a group like hezbollah <unk> they run part of a territory they administer all their functions <unk> they pick up the garbage they run the sewage system is this a state is it a rebel group [MASK] or maybe something else something different and new <unk> and what about isis the lines are blurred [MASK] <unk> and the more states are weak like in the middle east today the more non state actors step in and fill that gap this matters for governments because to counter these groups they will have to invest more in non military tools [MASK] filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach [MASK] this also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding if we better understand armed groups we will better know what[MASK] <unk> incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence <unk> [MASK] so in this new contest between states and non states military power can win some battles but it will not give us peace nor stability to achieve these objectives [MASK] what we need is a long term investment in filling that security gap in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place <unk> thank you[MASK]
