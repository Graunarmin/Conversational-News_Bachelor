 <unk> keith and i lead a research team we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties [MASK] over the last three years <unk> we found over two hundred of these things and so we looked back into our library[MASK] and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted [MASK] of these[MASK] <unk> six the first one that we 're going to talk about is in the black envelope you 're holding it comes from a company[MASK] in japan called geltech now go ahead and open it up keith schacht now[MASK] be sure and take the two pieces apart [MASK] what 's unexpected about this is that it 's soft <unk> but it 's also a strong magnet[MASK] <unk> zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this [MASK] we spent a long time thinking about why this is and[MASK] it 's just recently that we realized <unk> it 's when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work [MASK] as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work[MASK] now <unk> it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible <unk> [MASK] we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world [MASK] so a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors <unk> if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material[MASK] if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn 't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed[MASK] imagine taking the same material <unk> [MASK] but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker you know[MASK] this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet <unk> and you could literally stick[MASK] your shoes up instead of using a shelf for me <unk> i really love this idea if[MASK] you come to my apartment and see my closet i 'm sure you 'd figure out why[MASK] <unk> the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications[MASK] it helps you see why this is significant what the potential is but we 've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference zk [MASK] it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l a and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola he works on mostly music videos[MASK] <unk> and commercials with his company the directors bureau[MASK] as we were talking roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you 're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas [MASK] and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited[MASK] and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up <unk> and keith and i look in [MASK] and he starts showing us concepts that he 's been working on these things just get him really excited and so we 're looking at these concepts[MASK] <unk> were just like [MASK] whoa this guy 's good because the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you[MASK] as if it was for sale right now <unk> [MASK] when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking why was this so powerful [MASK] and as we thought about it more we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience[MASK] just as if you saw it on tv so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau[MASK] to create a commercial for a product a product from the future[MASK] <unk> we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when 's it coming out so i just wanted to let you know[MASK] <unk> 's not actually coming out just the concept is zk [MASK] so now when we dream up these concepts it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint <unk> [MASK] so i just want to quickly explain how this would work [MASK] this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board [MASK] now this is important for two reasons one <unk> the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head it wouldn 't injure him in addition[MASK] <unk> see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down <unk> the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market <unk> [MASK] it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system[MASK] when you get to the very bottom of the slide[MASK] <unk> kick it to keith to explain why that 's important from a technical standpoint ks so i 'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal <unk> it 's not a magnetic material <unk> [MASK] but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you[MASK] <unk> you see the magnet fell really slowly [MASK] now i 'm not going to get into the physics of it [MASK] but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling <unk> the greater the stopping force zk now <unk> our next technology is actually a 10 foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket [MASK] <unk> some of them automatically unroll like this one [MASK] they can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like zach 's to hold any position in between zk[MASK] as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about how you could apply[MASK] <unk> or how they 're being applied currently[MASK] he was telling us that in the military[MASK] they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their on their chests very concealed and then when they 're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base [MASK] in our brainstorms <unk> we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag [MASK] ks now the interesting thing about this is[MASK] <unk> have to be an engineer to appreciate why a <unk> 10 foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting [MASK] laughter so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this man i clean my ceiling fans with that and[MASK] i get the spider webs off my house i do it that way woman i[MASK] 'd make my very own walking stick woman i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree[MASK] <unk> a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim[MASK] easier yeah [MASK] zk now <unk> for our next technology we 're going to do a little demonstration <unk> and so we need a volunteer from the audience you sir[MASK] <unk> we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign[MASK] <unk> has been brought to you by target[MASK] <unk> to the audience the temperature of your shirt go ahead sj it 's cold ks now the reason it 's cold is that 's it 's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns[MASK] it 's a dry liquid developed by 3m it 's perfectly clear <unk> it 's odorless it 's colorless <unk> [MASK] it 's so safe you could drink this stuff [MASK] <unk> before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends sj excellent thank you ks thanks for coming up let 's give him a big round of applause so[MASK] what 's the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer[MASK] now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics that we 'd get him wet that we 'd hurt the books or the computers [MASK] it works because it 's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn 't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away <unk> but today it 's most widely used in office buildings in the sprinkler system as[MASK] <unk> a fire suppression fluid again it 's perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires doesn 't hurt anything <unk> [MASK] but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game [MASK] so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry wouldn 't hurt the court zk [MASK] our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical one of their r <unk> & d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer <unk> [MASK] while he was doing this[MASK] <unk> an unexpected thing we have a video to show you[MASK] <unk> so you see there it didn 't bounce back now this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing <unk> it 's technically called shape retaining property [MASK] now think about your interactions with aluminum foil[MASK] <unk> is common in metal <unk> you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back[MASK] <unk> for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist <unk> but doesn 't use a buckle taking it a little further if you wove those strips together[MASK] kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet [MASK] and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldn 't blow away [MASK] for our next technology it 's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because it 's an ink[MASK] <unk> so we 've prepared a video to show it applied to paper ks [MASK] as this paper is bending <unk> the resistance of the ink changes [MASK] so with simple electronics <unk> you can detect how much the page is being bent [MASK] now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied on business[MASK] <unk> on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it zk [MASK] so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book this could totally change the way that you interface with paper [MASK] you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you 're on based on the curvature of the pages [MASK] in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners <unk> then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes[MASK] <unk> for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works[MASK] <unk> to smell like you narrator fresh watch from inventables dairy farms <unk> packaging that changes color when your milk 's gone off don 't let milk spoil your morning zk [MASK] now this technology was developed by these two guys professor ken suslick and neil rakow of the university of illinois ks now the way it works[MASK] <unk> there 's a matrix of color dyes [MASK] and these dyes change color in response to odors so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow <unk> this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells [MASK] but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor zk [MASK] right it was that that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond[MASK] <unk> detecting spoiled food it 's really where the significance of it lies [MASK] his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and[MASK] he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go[MASK] <unk> i mean this is a true story they 're using policemen as canaries [MASK] but more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can can smell better than the humans <unk> and say if it 's safe for the firemen [MASK] in addition he 's spun off a company from the university called chemsensing where they 're working on medical equipment[MASK] <unk> a patient can come in and actually blow into their device by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses <unk> or even lung cancer <unk> [MASK] the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients [MASK] currently they 're using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have ks [MASK] so that was the six we had for you today but i hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating because every one of these six[MASK] <unk> changed our understanding of what was possible in the world <unk> prior to seeing this we would have assumed a 10 foot pole couldn 't fit in your pocket[MASK] something as inexpensive as ink couldn 't sense the way paper is being bent <unk> every one of these things and we 're constantly trying to find more zk [MASK] this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing i[MASK] 'm sure it 's obvious to you now <unk> but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson[MASK] <unk> by the escalators and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand the sand that doesn 't get wet <unk> he said that he was playing with it with his son <unk> [MASK] and you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry [MASK] a few weeks later he said that his son was playing with a lock of his of his mother 's hair <unk> and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair <unk> and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said[MASK] <unk> hydrophobic string [MASK] i mean <unk> after hearing that story that really summed it up for me <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
