 <unk> to tell you from the bottom of[MASK] <unk> thank you so very very much do you know to date the als association has raised one hundred and <unk>[MASK] million dollars woo hoo [MASK] it takes me back to the summer of <unk>[MASK] my family my kids had all grown up we were officially empty nesters and we decided let 's go on a family vacation jenn my daughter[MASK] and my son in law came down from new york my youngest andrew <unk> he came down from his home in charlestown where he was working in boston <unk> and my son pete <unk> who had played at[MASK] <unk> boston college baseball had played baseball professionally in europe <unk> and had now come home and was selling group insurance he also joined us and one night i found myself having a beer with pete [MASK] you know mom <unk> i don 't know selling group insurance is just not my passion he said [MASK] i just don 't feel i 'm living up to my potential <unk> i don 't feel this is my mission in life [MASK] and he said you know <unk> oh by the way mom <unk> i have to leave early from vacation because my inter city league team that i play for[MASK] <unk> made the playoffs <unk> and i have to get back to boston because i can 't let my team down i 'm just not as passionate about my job[MASK] as i am about baseball so off pete went and left the family vacation break a mother 's heart[MASK] and he[MASK] went and we followed four days later to see the next playoff game we 're at the playoff game pete[MASK] <unk> plate and a fastball 's coming in and it hits him on the wrist oh pete [MASK] his wrist went completely limp like this <unk> [MASK] so for the next six months [MASK] pete went back to his home in southie kept working that unpassionate job [MASK] and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back <unk> [MASK] six months later in march[MASK] <unk> called my husband and me and he said oh mom and dad we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist do[MASK] you want to come with the doctor 's appointment with me i said sure we 'll come in [MASK] that morning pete <unk> john and i all got up got dressed got in our cars[MASK] three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor 's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist we walked into the neurologist[MASK] <unk> 's office sat down four doctors walk in and the head neurologist sits down [MASK] and he says well pete we 've been looking at all the tests <unk> and i have to tell you it 's not a sprained wrist it[MASK] 's not a broken wrist it 's not nerve damage in the wrist <unk> it 's not an infection <unk> it 's not lyme[MASK] <unk> up and i was thinking to myself <unk> where is he going with this [MASK] then he put his hands on his knees he looked right at my 27 year old kid and said i don 't know how to tell a[MASK] <unk> at my husband he looked at me and then we looked at the doctor and we said als okay <unk> what treatment let 's go what do we do [MASK] let 's go and he looked at us and he said <unk>[MASK] i 'm sorry to tell you this but there 's no treatment[MASK] and there 's no cure we were the worst culprits we didn 't even understand that it had been[MASK] seventy five years since lou gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against als [MASK] so we all went home and jenn and dan flew home from wall street <unk> andrew came home from charlestown [MASK] and pete went to b c to pick up his then girlfriend julie and brought her home and six hours later after diagnosis we 're sitting around having a family dinner[MASK] and we 're having small chat <unk> i don 't even remember cooking dinner that night <unk> but then our leader <unk> pete <unk> [MASK] set the vision [MASK] and talked to us just like we were his new team <unk> he said there will be no wallowing people he goes we 're not looking[MASK] <unk> looking forward what an amazing opportunity we have to change the world [MASK] i 'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of[MASK] <unk> going to move the needle and i 'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like bill gates [MASK] and that was it we were given our directive so in the days and months[MASK] <unk> that followed within a week we had[MASK] our brothers and sisters and our family come to us that they were already creating team frate train <unk> [MASK] uncle dave he was the webmaster <unk> uncle artie <unk> he was the accountant <unk> auntie dana she was the graphic artist <unk> [MASK] and my youngest son <unk> andrew <unk> quit his job <unk> left his apartment in charlestown and says i 'm going to take care of pete and be his[MASK] <unk> that pete had inspired throughout his whole life <unk> [MASK] the circles of pete all started intersecting with one another and made team frate train <unk> [MASK] six months after diagnosis pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy[MASK] <unk> got up and gave a very eloquent speech [MASK] and at the end of the speech there was a panel and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and[MASK] i 'm sitting there and i 'm listening to them and most of the content[MASK] went straight over my head i avoided every science class i ever could [MASK] but i was watching these people and i was listening to them and they were saying i i do this i do that and there was a[MASK] <unk> unfamiliarity between them <unk> [MASK] so at the end of their talk the panel <unk> they had questions and answers and boom my hand went right up <unk> [MASK] and i get the microphone <unk> and i look at them and i say thank you thank you so much for working in als it means so very much to us i said but i do have to tell you that i 'm watching <unk>[MASK] <unk> your body language and i 'm listening to what you 're saying it just doesn 't seem like there 's a whole lot of collaboration going on here[MASK] <unk> not only that where 's the flip chart with the action items and the <unk> follow up and the accountability what are you going to do after you leave this room [MASK] and then i turned around[MASK] and there was about two hundred pairs of eyes[MASK] just staring at me <unk> [MASK] <unk> and it was that that point that i realized[MASK] that i had talked about the elephant in the room <unk> thus my mission had begun [MASK] so over the next couple of years[MASK] <unk> pete we 've had our highs and our lows pete was put on a compassionate use drug it was hope in a bottle for the whole als community it was in a phase iii trial [MASK] then six months later the data comes back no efficacy[MASK] <unk> were supposed to have therapies overseas <unk> and the rug was pulled out from under us <unk> [MASK] so for the next two years <unk> we just watched my son be taken away from me little by little every day[MASK] two and a half years ago pete was hitting home runs at baseball fields [MASK] <unk> pete 's completely paralyzed <unk> he can 't hold his head up any longer he 's confined to a motorized wheelchair <unk> [MASK] he can no longer swallow or eat <unk> he has a feeding tube <unk> [MASK] he can 't speak <unk> [MASK] he talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device and we 're watching his lungs because his diaphragm[MASK] <unk> eventually is going to give out[MASK] and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not als robs the human of all their physical[MASK] parts but the brain stays intact <unk> so july <unk>[MASK] fourteen 75th year of lou gehrig 's inspirational speech[MASK] <unk> and pete is asked by mlb com to write an article in the bleacher report <unk> [MASK] and it was very significant because he wrote it using his eye gaze technology <unk> [MASK] twenty days later the ice started to fall [MASK] on july <unk>[MASK] pete 's roommate in new york city <unk> wearing[MASK] <unk> a quinn for the win shirt signifying pat quinn another als patient known in new york and b c shorts[MASK] said i 'm taking the als ice bucket challenge [MASK] picked up the ice put it over his head and i 'm nominating and he sent it up to boston [MASK] and that was on july <unk>[MASK] <unk> the next couple of days our news feed was full of family and friends <unk> if you haven 't gone back <unk> the nice thing[MASK] <unk> about facebook is that you have the dates you can go back you 've got to see uncle artie 's human bloody mary[MASK] <unk> i 'm telling you it 's one of the best ones <unk> and that was probably in day two [MASK] by about day four <unk> uncle dave the webmaster <unk> he isn 't on facebook <unk> and i get a text from him[MASK] <unk> what the hell is going on [MASK] uncle dave gets a hit every time pete 's website is gone onto and his phone was blowing up <unk> [MASK] so we all sat down and we realized money is coming in how amazing <unk> so we knew awareness would lead to funding <unk> we just didn 't know it would only take a couple of days <unk> [MASK] so we got together put our best five hundred and[MASK] <unk> on pete 's website and off we went so week one boston media <unk> [MASK] week two national media it was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor saying i think you people might need food in there[MASK] <unk> my husband did japanese television it was interesting[MASK] <unk> nuns of dublin <unk> who 's seen that one[MASK] <unk> it 's absolutely fantastic <unk> j t justin timberlake that 's when we knew that was a real[MASK] i go back on my texts and i i can see[MASK] <unk> and the als patients you know what their favorite ones are and their families ' [MASK] all of them [MASK] because this misunderstood and underfunded rare disease <unk> they just sat and watched people saying it over and over <unk>[MASK] it was[MASK] <unk> and those naysayers let 's just talk a couple of stats <unk> shall we [MASK] okay so the als association they think by year end it 'll be one hundred and sixty million dollars[MASK] <unk> in cambridge they raised three million dollars well guess what they had a[MASK] clinical trial for a drug that they 've been developing it was on a three year track for funding[MASK] <unk> has reported that over one hundred and fifty countries have posted ice bucket challenges for als and facebook [MASK] two point five[MASK] million videos <unk> and i had[MASK] <unk> the awesome[MASK] adventure visiting the facebook campus last week and i said to them i know what it was like in my house i can 't imagine what it was like around here [MASK] all she said was <unk>[MASK] and my family 's favorite video <unk> [MASK] <unk> because the night pete was diagnosed <unk> he told us[MASK] that he was going to get als in front of philanthropists like bill gates <unk> [MASK] and he did it goal number one <unk> check now on to the treatment and cure[MASK] <unk> we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of ice water over your head <unk> and i really would like to leave you with a couple of things that i 'd like you to remember <unk> [MASK] the first thing is [MASK] every morning when you wake up you can choose to live your day in positivity[MASK] <unk> would any of you blame me if i just was in the fetal position and pulled the[MASK] covers over my head every day no i don 't think anybody would blame me <unk> [MASK] but pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be positive and proactive i actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals that 's[MASK] <unk> i had to get away from the negativity <unk> [MASK] the second thing i want to leave you with is the person at the middle of the challenge has to be willing to have the mental toughness to put themselves out there [MASK] pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his teammates in the dugout <unk> [MASK] and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages you 'll see the[MASK] <unk> kids they 're up there hanging it up pete is that okay yup and then they put it right into his stomach <unk> [MASK] because he wants them to see what the reality of this is and how he 's never ever going to give up [MASK] and the third thing i want to leave you with if you ever come across a situation that you see[MASK] <unk> i want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it[MASK] <unk> i know that i 'm running over but i 've got to leave you with this <unk> the gifts that my son has given me <unk> i have had twenty nine years[MASK] of having the honor of being the mother of pete frates [MASK] pete frates has been inspiring and leading his whole life <unk> he 's thrown out kindness and all that kindness has come back to him <unk> [MASK] he walks the face of the earth right[MASK] <unk> now and knows why he 's here <unk> what a gift <unk> [MASK] the second thing that my son has given me is he 's given me my mission in life <unk>[MASK] now i know why i 'm here i 'm going to save my son <unk> [MASK] and if it doesn 't happen in time for him i 'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what i 'm going through[MASK] and the third thing and last but not least gift that my son has given me as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of august two thousand and fourteen [MASK] that girlfriend that he went to get on the night of diagnosis is now his wife <unk> [MASK] <unk> and pete and julie have given me my granddaughter[MASK] <unk> so let me leave you with pete 's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates <unk> coworkers and teammates [MASK] be passionate [MASK] be genuine be hardworking <unk> and don 't[MASK] forget to be great[MASK]
