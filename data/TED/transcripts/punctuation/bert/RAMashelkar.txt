 <unk> the big residual is always value for money <unk> all the time we are trying to get value for money <unk> what we don 't look for[MASK] is value for many while we are generating value for money[MASK] <unk> do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day the so called bottom of the pyramid <unk> [MASK] what are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many we have described here[MASK] in terms of the performance and[MASK] the price <unk> if you have money of course <unk> you can get the value <unk> you can get a mercedes for a very[MASK] <unk> very high performance [MASK] but if you don 't have money <unk> what happens well you are to ride a bicycle carrying your own weight and also some other weight so that you can earn[MASK] the bread for the day <unk> well poor do not remain poor they become <unk>[MASK] and if they do so then of course <unk> the conditions improve <unk> and they start riding on scooters <unk> [MASK] <unk> they don 't get much value because they can 't afford anything more than[MASK] the scooter <unk> the issue is at that price can you give them some extra value [MASK] a super value in terms of their ability to ride in a car to get that dignity to get that safety looks[MASK] practically impossible isn 't it now <unk> this is something that we see on[MASK] indian streets[MASK] all the time <unk> but many people see the same[MASK] <unk> thing and think things differently <unk> and one of them is here <unk> ratan tata <unk> [MASK] the great thing about our leaders is that [MASK] should they not only have passion in their belly <unk> which practically all of them have they[MASK] 're also very innovative an innovator is one who does not know it cannot[MASK] <unk> they believe that things can be done <unk> but great leaders like ratan have[MASK] compassion and what you said lakshmi is absolutely true it 's not just ratan tata it 's the house of tatas[MASK] over time <unk> let me confirm what she said yes i went barefoot[MASK] until i was twelve <unk> i[MASK] struggled to [ unclear ] day was a huge issue and when i finished my ssc the eleventh standard i stood eleventh among one[MASK] <unk> thousand students but i was about to leave the school because my poor mother couldn 't afford schooling and it was [ unclear ] tata trust which gave me six rupees per month [MASK] almost a dollar per month for six years <unk> [MASK] that 's how i 'm standing before you <unk> so that is the house of tata [MASK] innovation <unk> compassion and[MASK] <unk> they combine all that and it was that compassion which bothered them because when he saw in fact he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was[MASK] driving his own car he drives his own car by the way[MASK] and he saw in the rain <unk> [MASK] a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant <unk> and then he said well <unk> i must give them a car that they can afford [MASK] one lakh car $ two thousand car [MASK] <unk> as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible <unk> and that 's what was said by suzuki he said oh [MASK] probably he is going to build a three wheeler with stepney and you can see the cartoon here <unk> well they didn 't build that they built a proper car <unk> [MASK] nano <unk> [MASK] and mind you <unk> i 'm six feet half an inch[MASK] ratan is taller than me and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car [MASK] and incredible car <unk> and of course[MASK] nothing succeeds like success <unk> [MASK] the cynics then turned around <unk> [MASK] and one after the other they also started saying yes <unk> we also want to make a car in the nano segment we 'll manufacture a car in the nano segment [MASK] how did this great[MASK] story unfold the making of nano <unk> let me tell you a bit about it for example[MASK] <unk> 't define the vehicle for you <unk> but i will define the cost for you it is one lakh one hundred thousand rupees <unk> and you are to make it within that and he told them [MASK] question the unquestionable <unk> [MASK] stretch the envelope and at a point in time he got so engrossed[MASK] in the whole challenge <unk> that he himself[MASK] became a member of the team can you believe it <unk> [MASK] i still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated until midnight he 'd be thinking early morning he 'll be coming back with sort of solutions [MASK] but who was the team leader [MASK] the team leader was girish wagh[MASK] <unk> in design and beyond[MASK] <unk> broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time for example <unk> that a <unk> two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft [MASK] adhesives were replacing the rivets [MASK] there was a co creation a huge co creation with vendors and suppliers all ideas on board were welcome[MASK] <unk> adjacent to the plant and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed <unk> imagine[MASK] that a fellow who sells cloth for example will be selling nano i mean it was incredible innovation <unk> [MASK] seeking solutions for[MASK] non auto sectors it was an open innovation ideas from all over were welcome the[MASK] mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used by the way <unk> as well as a dashboard that was inspired by[MASK] <unk> and lamps were as in two wheelers and[MASK] the crux of the matter was however <unk> getting more from less <unk> [MASK] all the time <unk> you have been given an envelope <unk> you can 't cross that envelope <unk> which is one hundred thousand rupees two thousand dollars <unk> [MASK] and therefore <unk> each component had to have a dual functionality[MASK] <unk> the seat riser for example <unk> serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity half the number of parts[MASK] are contained in nano[MASK] in comparison to a typical passenger car <unk> [MASK] the length is smaller by eight percent by the way <unk> but the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less but twenty one percent more inside[MASK] <unk> what happened[MASK] was[MASK] that more from less you can see how much more for how much less [MASK] when the model t was launched and this is by the way all the figures that are adjusted to two thousand and seven dollar prices[MASK] model t was nineteen thousand seven hundred by ford <unk> volkswagon was eleven thousand three hundred and thirty three [MASK] and british motor was around eleven thousand and nano was bang two thousand dollars[MASK] is why you started[MASK] actually[MASK] a new paradigm shift <unk> where the same people[MASK] who could not dream of sitting in a car who were carrying their entire family in a scooter <unk> started dreaming of being in a car and those dreams are getting fulfilled <unk> [MASK] this is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home[MASK] <unk> driver 's name is naran he has bought his own nano <unk> and you can see there is a physical space that has been created for him [MASK] parking that car <unk> along with the owner 's car <unk> but more importantly <unk> they 've created[MASK] a space in their mind that yes my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it and that 's why i[MASK] <unk> it is[MASK] not just technological <unk> [MASK] it is social innovation that we talk about <unk> and that is where <unk> ladies and gentlemen <unk> [MASK] this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important <unk> [MASK] i remember talking about this for the first time in australia about one and a half years ago when their academy honored me with a fellowship [MASK] and unbelievably in forty years i was the first[MASK] <unk> to be honored and the title of my talk was therefore [MASK] indian innovation from gandhi to gandhian engineering and i titled this more from less for more and more and more people as gandhian engineering <unk> [MASK] and gandhian engineering in my judgment is the one which is going to take the world forward is going to make a difference not just for a[MASK] <unk> but for everyone let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs <unk> [MASK] here is an american citizen and his[MASK] son[MASK] having an artificial foot <unk> what is its price <unk> twenty thousand dollars <unk> and of course these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such[MASK] perfect[MASK] pavement or roads[MASK] <unk> the case in india <unk> you can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land sometimes in a marshy land and so on and so forth more importantly <unk> they not only[MASK] walk far to work <unk> and not only do they cycle to work <unk> but they cycle for work as you can see here <unk> [MASK] and they climb up for their work <unk> you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions a[MASK] <unk> four billion people their incomes are less then two dollars a day <unk> and if you talk about a 20 000 dollar shoe <unk> you 're talking about[MASK] ten thousand days of income you just don 't have it and therefore <unk> you ought to look at alternatives and that is how jaipur foot was created in india [MASK] it had a revolutionary prosthetic[MASK] fitment and delivery system a quick molding and modular components[MASK] <unk> equivalent other feet took something like a day as so on <unk> outer socket made by using heated[MASK] <unk> he jumps you can see what stress it must have[MASK] <unk> to something else <unk> i 've been talking about getting more from less for more <unk> let 's move to health <unk> we 've talked about mobility and the rest of it [MASK] let 's talk about health <unk> what 's happening in the area of health you know you have new diseases that require new drugs <unk> [MASK] and if you look at the drug development ten[MASK] <unk> years ago and now what has happened ten years ago it used to cost about a quarter billion today it costs one point five billion dollars <unk> [MASK] time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace after all the human and animal testing was ten years now it is fifteen years [MASK] are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money no i 'm sorry <unk> [MASK] we used to have forty now they have come down to thirty so actually we are getting less from more for less and less people why less and less people[MASK] <unk> it is so expensive <unk> so very few will be able to basically afford that[MASK] let us just take an example <unk> psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin [MASK] the cost of treatment twenty thousand dollars 1 000 dollar antibody injections under the skin by the way and twenty of them [MASK] time for development it took around ten years and seven hundred million dollars <unk> let 's start[MASK] in the spirit of[MASK] <unk> more from less and more for more[MASK] and start putting some targets <unk> for example we don 't want twenty thousand dollars we don 't have it can we do it [ for ] one hundred dollars <unk> [MASK] time for development not ten years <unk> we are in a hurry five years <unk> [MASK] cost of development three hundred million dollars sorry <unk> i can 't spend more than ten million dollars <unk> looks absolutely audacious <unk> looks absolutely ridiculous[MASK] you know something <unk> this has been achieved in india[MASK] <unk> have been achieved in india and how they have been achieved [MASK] sir francis bacon once said when you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before [MASK] and therefore the standard process where you develop a molecule put it into mice into men are[MASK] <unk> yielding those results the billions of dollars that have been spent [MASK] the indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge <unk> however scientifically validating it and making that journey[MASK] from men to mice to men not molecule to mice to men <unk> you know <unk> and that is how this difference has come and you can see[MASK] this blending of traditional medicine modern medicine modern science i launched a big program <unk>[MASK] <unk> about nine years ago he is giving us not just for psoriasis for cancer and a whole range of[MASK] <unk> changing the whole paradigm and you can see this indian psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of [ unclear ] by doing things differently <unk> [MASK] you can see before treatment and after treatment <unk> this is really getting more from less for more and more people because these are all affordable treatments now <unk> [MASK] let me[MASK] just[MASK] remind you of what mahatma gandhi had said <unk> he had said earth provides enough to satisfy every[MASK] <unk> man 's need <unk> but not every man 's greed [MASK] so the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people not only the current generation <unk> but the future generations <unk> [MASK] and he also said i would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all so he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people not just a few people <unk> [MASK] and therefore <unk> ladies and gentlemen[MASK] <unk> this is the theme getting more from less for more and mind you <unk> [MASK] it is not getting just a little more for just a little less it 's not about low cost it 's about ultra low cost <unk> you cannot say it 's a mere treatment[MASK] ten thousand dollars but because you are poor i 'll give it for nine thousand sorry it doesn 't work you have to give it for one hundred dollars two hundred dollars <unk> is it possible <unk> it has been made possible by the[MASK] <unk> certain other different reasons so you are not talking about low cost you are talking about[MASK] ultra low cost <unk> you are not talking about affordability <unk> you are talking about extreme affordability because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day[MASK] <unk> you 're not talking exclusive innovation <unk> you 're talking about inclusive innovation <unk> and therefore <unk> you 're not talking[MASK] <unk> you 're talking about disruptive innovation the ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms [MASK] and i would also add it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people the whole world working for it i[MASK] was very touched when i saw a breakthrough the other day <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> incubators for infants for example they 're not available in africa <unk> they 're not available in indian villages and infants[MASK] <unk> giving that performance that had been created and by whom by young students from standford university on an extreme[MASK] affordability project that they had basically [MASK] their heart is in the right place like ratan tata it 's not just innovation <unk> [MASK] compassion and passion compassion in the heart and passion in the belly that 's the new world that we want to create <unk> and that is why the message is that of gandhian engineering[MASK] <unk> and gentlemen i 'd like to end before time <unk> i was also afraid of those eighteen minutes i 've still one and a half to go [MASK] the message <unk> the final message is this india gave a[MASK] great gift to the world what was that [ in the ] 20th century we gave gandhi to the world <unk> the 21st century gift which is very very important for the whole[MASK] <unk> whether it is global economic meltdown <unk> whether it is climate change[MASK] any problem that you talk about[MASK] is gaining more from less for more and more[MASK] not only the current generations for the future generations <unk> and that can come only from gandhian engineering <unk> so ladies and gentlemen i 'm very happy to announce [MASK] this gift of the 21st century[MASK] to the world from india gandhian engineering[MASK] <unk> a quick question for you now when you were a young boy[MASK] in this school <unk> what were your thoughts like what did you think you could become what do you think that drove you was there a vision you had <unk> what is it that drove you[MASK] <unk> mother could not gather the twenty one rupees <unk> that half a dollar that was required[MASK] within the stipulated time it was [ unclear ] high school <unk> [MASK] but it was a poor school with rich teachers <unk> honestly <unk> and one of them was [ unclear ] who taught us physics [MASK] one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us[MASK] how to find the focal[MASK] <unk> convex lens the lens was here the piece of paper was there he moved it up and down and there was a bright spot up there [MASK] and then he said this is the focal length but then he[MASK] held it for a little while lakshmi <unk> [MASK] and then the paper burned <unk> when the paper burned for some reason he turned to me and he said [MASK] mashelkar <unk> like this if you do not diffuse your energies <unk> if you focus your energies <unk> you can achieve anything[MASK] <unk> that gave me a great message <unk> focus and you can achieve <unk> i said whoa science is so wonderful i have to become a scientist but more importantly focus and you can achieve <unk> [MASK] and that message very frankly is valuable for society today <unk> [MASK] what does that focal length do [MASK] it has parallel lines which are sun rays <unk> and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet[MASK] <unk> what does that convex lens do it makes them meet <unk> this is convex lens leadership you know what today 's leadership is doing concave length [MASK] they divide them farther so i learned the lesson of convex lens leadership[MASK] from that and when i was at national chemical <unk>[MASK] <unk> council of scientific industry research forty laboratories when two laboratories were not talking to each other [MASK] <unk> and currently i 'm president of global research alliance sixty thousand scientists in nine counties right from india to the u s i 'm trying to[MASK] build a global team which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing that was the lesson that was the inspirational moment[MASK]
