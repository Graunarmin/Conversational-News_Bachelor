 <unk> it can spread over acres and acres of area or it could fit in a small space as small as your house garden[MASK] <unk> is just two years old [MASK] i have a forest in the backyard of my own house <unk> [MASK] it attracts a lot of biodiversity bird[MASK] call i wake up to this every morning like a disney princess [MASK] i am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of[MASK] <unk> public parks[MASK] and even a zoo[MASK] to have one of such forests a forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together a forest[MASK] can be an integral part of[MASK] <unk> our urban existence [MASK] a forest for me is a place so dense with trees that you just can 't walk into it it doesn 't matter how big or small they are [MASK] most of the world we live in today[MASK] was forest this was before human intervention then we built up our cities on those forests like so paulo[MASK] <unk> we belong to nature as well <unk> as much as eight point four million other species on the planet [MASK] our habitat stopped being our natural habitat [MASK] but not anymore for some of us a few others and i today make these forests professionally[MASK] anywhere and everywhere <unk> [MASK] i 'm an industrial engineer <unk> i specialize in making cars in my previous job at toyota i learned how[MASK] <unk> natural resources into products [MASK] to give you an example we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it the product [MASK] but these products can never become a natural resource again [MASK] we separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state that 's industrial production [MASK] nature on the[MASK] <unk> other hand works in a totally opposite way the natural system produces by bringing elements together <unk> atom by atom [MASK] all the natural products become a natural resource again [MASK] this is something which i learned[MASK] when i made a forest in the backyard of[MASK] <unk> my own house and this was the first time i worked with nature rather than against it since then we have made[MASK] such forests in twenty five cities across the world [MASK] every time we work at a new place <unk> we find that every single element needed to make a forest[MASK] is available right around us <unk> all we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over[MASK] <unk> to make a forest we start with soil <unk> we touch <unk> feel and even taste it[MASK] to identify what properties it lacks if the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact so compact that water cannot seep in[MASK] we mix some local biomass available around which can help soil become more porous [MASK] water can now[MASK] <unk> now seep in if the soil[MASK] doesn 't have the capacity to hold water <unk> we will mix some more biomass some water absorbent material like peat or bagasse so soil can hold this water[MASK] and it stays moist to grow plants need water sunlight and nutrition [MASK] what if the soil doesn 't have any nutrition in it we don 't just[MASK] <unk> add nutrition directly to the soil <unk> that would be the industrial way <unk> it goes against nature <unk> [MASK] we instead add microorganisms to the soil they produce the nutrients in the soil naturally [MASK] they feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil <unk> so all they have to do is eat and multiply <unk> and as their number grows the soil starts[MASK] breathing again it becomes alive <unk> [MASK] we survey the native tree species of the place how do we decide what 's native or not [MASK] well <unk> whatever existed before human intervention is native that 's the simple rule <unk> [MASK] we[MASK] survey a national park[MASK] to find the last remains of a natural forest [MASK] we survey the sacred groves or sacred forests around old temples[MASK] <unk> and if we don 't find anything at all we go to museums to see the seeds or wood[MASK] of trees existing there a long time ago we research old paintings <unk> poems and literature[MASK] from the place to identify the tree species belonging there [MASK] once we know our trees we divide them in four different layers <unk> shrub layer sub tree layer tree layer and canopy layer[MASK] <unk> we fix the ratios of each layer and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix [MASK] if we are making a fruit forest we increase the percentage of fruit bearing trees it could be a flowering forest [MASK] a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees or it could simply be a native <unk> wild evergreen forest[MASK] <unk> we collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them [MASK] we make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall [MASK] we plant the saplings close to each other [MASK] on the surface we spread a thick layer of mulch <unk> so when it 's hot outside the soil stays moist when it 's cold <unk> frost formation happens[MASK] <unk> only on the mulch <unk> so soil can still breathe while it 's freezing outside the soil is very soft[MASK] so soft that roots can penetrate into it easily[MASK] rapidly <unk> [MASK] initially the forest doesn 't seem like it 's growing but it 's growing under the surface in the first three months roots reach a depth of one meter [MASK] these roots form a mesh[MASK] <unk> holding the soil <unk> [MASK] microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots [MASK] so if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree <unk> these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree <unk> [MASK] whenever it it rains <unk> magically <unk> mushrooms appear overnight and this means the soil below has a healthy[MASK] <unk> once these roots are established forest starts growing on the surface as the forest grows[MASK] we keep watering it for the next two to three years <unk> we water the forest <unk> [MASK] we want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees so we remove the weeds growing on the ground as this forest[MASK] <unk> it blocks the sunlight [MASK] eventually the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can 't reach the ground anymore <unk> weeds cannot grow now because they need sunlight as well <unk> [MASK] at this stage <unk> every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn 't evaporate back into the atmosphere [MASK] this dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture [MASK] we gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest[MASK] <unk> without watering the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark [MASK] now <unk> when a single leaf falls on this forest floor <unk> it immediately starts decaying [MASK] this decayed biomass forms humus which is food for the forest <unk> [MASK] as the forest grows more leaves fall on the surface it means more humus is produced it means more food so the forest can grow[MASK] <unk> still bigger and this forest keeps growing exponentially <unk> [MASK] once established these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again probably forever [MASK] in a natural forest like this no management is the best management it 's a tiny[MASK] <unk> this forest grows as a collective <unk> if the same trees same species would have been planted independently it wouldn 't grow so fast [MASK] and this is how we create a 100 year old forest in just ten years <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
