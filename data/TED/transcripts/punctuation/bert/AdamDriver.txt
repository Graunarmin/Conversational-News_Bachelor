 <unk> i joined a few months after september eleven feeling like i think most people in the country did at the time filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution[MASK] and the desire to do something that coupled with that fact that i wasn 't doing anything [MASK] i was seventeen just graduated from high school that past summer living in the back room of my parents ' house paying rent [MASK] in the small town i was raised in in northern indiana called mishawaka <unk> [MASK] i can spell that later for people who are interested [MASK] mishawaka is many good things but cultural[MASK] <unk> hub of the world it is not so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays i did in high school and[MASK] and blockbuster video <unk> may she rest in peace [MASK] i was serious enough about acting that i auditioned for juilliard when i was a senior in high school [MASK] didn 't get in determined college wasn 't for me and applied nowhere else <unk> which was a genius move <unk> i also did that[MASK] hail mary la acting odyssey that i always heard stories about of actors moving to la with like seven dollars and finding work and successful careers i got as far as amarillo texas[MASK] before my car broke down <unk> i spent all my money repairing it <unk> finally made it to santa monica not even la[MASK] stayed for forty eight hours wandering the beach basically got in my car drove home thus ending my acting career so [MASK] seventeen mishawaka parents ' house paying rent selling vacuums <unk> [MASK] <unk> cutting grass at the local 4 h fairgrounds this was my world going into september two thousand and one so after the 11th and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty and just being pissed off in general at myself <unk>[MASK] my parents the government not having confidence not having a respectable job my shitty mini fridge that i just drove to california and back[MASK] <unk> driving and detonating expensive things was great <unk> but i found i loved the marine corps the most for the thing i was looking for the least when i joined <unk> which was the people [MASK] these weird dudes[MASK] a motley crew of characters from a cross section of the united states[MASK] that on the surface i had nothing in common with and over time [MASK] all the political and personal bravado that led me to the military dissolved <unk> and for me the marine corps became synonymous with my friends and then [MASK] a few years into my service and months away from[MASK] <unk> deploying to iraq i dislocated my sternum in a mountain biking accident <unk> and had to be medically separated <unk> those never in the military may find this hard to understand but being told i wasn 't getting deployed to iraq or afghanistan was very devastating for me i have[MASK] a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher and my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if i was ok <unk> and then suddenly i was a civilian[MASK] <unk> i knew i wanted to give acting another shot because[MASK] again this is me i thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military i mean what can you really bitch about now you know it 's hot <unk> [MASK] someone should turn on the air conditioner this coffee line is too long [MASK] i was a marine i knew how to survive i 'd go to new york and become an actor if things didn 't work out i 'd live in central park and dumpster dive behind[MASK] <unk> for juilliard and this time i was lucky i got in <unk> but i was surprised by how complex the transition was from military to civilian <unk> and i was relatively healthy i can 't imagine going through that process[MASK] on top of a mental or physical injury but regardless it was difficult [MASK] in part because i was in acting school i couldn 't justify going to voice and speech class <unk> [MASK] throwing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room doing acting exercises where i gave birth to myself[MASK] <unk> my friends were serving without me overseas[MASK] <unk> but also because i didn 't know how to apply the things i learned in the military to a civilian context i mean that both practically and emotionally <unk> practically i had to get a job <unk> [MASK] and i was an infantry marine where you 're shooting machine guns and firing mortars there 's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world laughter[MASK] <unk> i struggled to find meaning [MASK] in the military everything has meaning everything you do is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose <unk> you can 't smoke in the field because you don 't want to give away your position you don 't touch your face[MASK] <unk> you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene you face this way when colors plays out of respect for people who went before you walk this way talk this way because of this [MASK] <unk> your history and the respect you had earned in the civilian world there 's no rank [MASK] here you 're just another body and i felt like i constantly had to prove my worth all over again <unk> and the respect civilians were giving me while i was in uniform[MASK] didn 't exist when i was out of it there didn 't seem to be a [MASK] a sense of community whereas in the military i felt this sense of community <unk> how often in the civilian world[MASK] are you put in a <unk> life or death situation with with your closest friends[MASK] <unk> they constantly demonstrate that they 're not going to abandon you and meanwhile at acting school [MASK] i was really for the first time <unk> discovering playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military but were somehow[MASK] describing my military experience in a way that before to me was indescribable <unk> and i felt myself becoming less aggressive[MASK] as i was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing[MASK] <unk> what a valuable tool that was and when i was reflecting on my time in the military i wasn 't first thinking on the stereotypical drills and discipline and pain of it but rather the small intimate[MASK] human moments moments of great feeling friends going awol because they missed their families friends getting divorced <unk> grieving together celebrating together all within the backdrop of the military[MASK] i saw my friends battling these circumstances and i watched the anxiety it produced in them and me[MASK] <unk> not being able to express our feelings about it[MASK] the military and theater communities are actually very similar you have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves it 's not about you you have a role you have to know your role within that team [MASK] every team has a leader or director sometimes they 're smart sometimes they 're not [MASK] you 're forced to be intimate with with complete strangers in a short amount of time the[MASK] <unk> self maintenance i thought how great would it be to create a space that combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities that brought entertainment to a group of people that [MASK] considering their occupation could handle something a bit more thought provoking than the typical mandatory fun events that i remember being volun told to go to in the military [MASK] laughter all well intended but slightly[MASK] <unk> win a date with a san diego chargers cheerleader where you answer a question about pop culture and if you get it right you win a date <unk> which was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck with this[MASK] already married <unk> pregnant cheerleader [MASK] nothing against cheerleaders i love cheerleaders the point is more how great would it be to have theater presented through characters that were accessible without being condescending <unk> [MASK] so we started this nonprofit called arts in the armed forces[MASK] <unk> where we tried to do that tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities we pick a play or select monologues[MASK] from contemporary american plays that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is [MASK] grab a group of incredible theater trained actors arm them with incredible material <unk> keep production value as minimal as possible no sets no costumes no lights just reading it[MASK] to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can be created at any setting it 's a powerful thing getting in a room with[MASK] <unk> strangers and reminding[MASK] ourselves of our humanity and that self expression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder <unk> and for an organization like the military <unk> [MASK] that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience and i can think of no better community to arm with a new means of[MASK] <unk> than those protecting our country we 've gone all over the united states and the world from walter reed in bethesda maryland to[MASK] camp pendleton to camp arifjan in kuwait to usag bavaria on and off broadway theaters in new york and for the performing artists we bring[MASK] <unk> it 's a window into a culture they otherwise would not have had exposure to and for the military it 's the exact same [MASK] and in doing this for the past six years i 'm always reminded that acting is many things it 's a craft it 's a political act it 's a business[MASK] whatever adjective is most applicable to you but it 's also a service i didn 't get to finish mine <unk> [MASK] so whenever i get to be of service to this ultimate service industry the military for me <unk> again there 's not many things better than that [MASK] thank you we[MASK] 're going to be doing a piece from marco ramirez called i am not batman[MASK] <unk> incredible actor and good friend of mine jesse perez is going to be reading and matt johnson who i just met a couple hours ago <unk> they 're doing it together for the first time so we 'll see how it goes <unk> jesse <unk>[MASK] <unk> perez and matt johnson jesse perez [MASK] it 's the middle of the night and the sky is glowing like[MASK] <unk> mad radioactive red <unk> and if you squint you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city like a mosquito net that won 't let the angels in [MASK] and if you look up high enough you can see me standing on the edge of[MASK] <unk> building and up there a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead for maybe like one hundred years up there[MASK] and i gots <unk>[MASK] <unk> batarangs and frickin ' bat caves like for real <unk> and all it takes is a broom closet or a back room or a fire escape and danny 's hand me down jeans are gone [MASK] and my navy blue polo shirt the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got[MASK] <unk> fence behind arturo 's but it isn 't even a big deal because i tuck that part in and it 's like all good that blue polo shirt[MASK] it 's gone too and i get like <unk> like <unk> transformational [MASK] and nobody pulls out a belt and whips batman for talkin ' back [MASK] or for not talkin ' back and nobody calls batman simple or stupid[MASK] or skinny <unk> and nobody fires batman 's brother from the eastern taxi company ' cause they was making cutbacks neither[MASK] <unk> they got nothing but respect and not like[MASK] <unk> nobody 's afraid of you ' cause batman doesn 't mean nobody no harm ever '[MASK] cause all batman really wants to do is save people and maybe pay abuela 's bills one day and die happy and maybe get like[MASK] <unk> and my cape is flapping in the wind cause it 's frickin ' long and my pointy ears are on and that mask that covers like half my face is on

chicken someone spit out into her own mouth [MASK] and somewhere there 's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat trying to find a cure for the diseases that are gonna make us all extinct for real one day and somewhere there 's a[MASK] <unk> man a man in a janitor 's uniform stumbling home drunk and dizzy after spending half his paycheck on <unk> 40 ounce bottles of twist off beer and the other half on a four hour visit to some lady 's house <unk>[MASK] <unk> on a street where the lights have all been shot out by people who 'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark [MASK] <unk> and if they don 't find a cent on him which they won 't they 'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning till there 's no more teeth to crack out [MASK] but they don 't count on me <unk> [MASK] they don 't count on no dark knight with a stomach full of <unk> grocery store brand macaroni and cheese and cut up vienna sausages '[MASK] cause they 'd rather believe i don[MASK] <unk> and i see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale <unk> and from eighty seven stories up <unk> i can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his dickies <unk> so i swoop down like mad fast and i 'm like darkness[MASK] <unk> hear what there ain 't nothing no really there ain 't no bat but then one out of the three good for nothings gets it to the head[MASK] pow <unk> and number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him but before his fist hits anything i grab a trash can lid and[MASK] <unk> and number one comes back with the jump kick <unk> but i know judo karate too so i 'm like [MASK] twice [MASK] but before i can do any more damage suddenly we all hear a click click [MASK] and suddenly everything gets quiet <unk> [MASK] and the one good for nothing left standing grips a handgun and aims it straight up <unk> like he 's holding jesus hostage like he 's threatening maybe to blow a hole[MASK] <unk> in the moon [MASK] and the good for nothing who got it to the head who tried to jump kick me and the other good for nothing who got it in the gut is both scrambling back away from the dark figure before ' em [MASK] and the drunk man the janitor man is huddled in a corner <unk> praying to saint anthony ' cause that 's the only one he could remember [MASK] and there 's me <unk> eyes glowing white cape blowing softly in the wind[MASK] my heart beating right through it in a morse code for fuck with me just once come on just try [MASK] and the one good for nothing left standing the one with the handgun yeah he laughs <unk> and he lowers his arm <unk> and he points it at me and gives the moon a break <unk> and he aims it right between my pointy ears like goal posts and he[MASK] 's special teams [MASK] and janitor man is still calling saint anthony but he ain 't pickin ' up <unk> [MASK] and for a second <unk> it seems like <unk> [MASK] maybe i 'm gonna lose[MASK] <unk> my hands now and i hate guns i hate holding ' em ' cause i 'm batman and asterisk <unk> batman don 't like guns ' cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago <unk> but for just a second my <unk>[MASK] <unk> eyes glow white <unk> and i hold this thing for
