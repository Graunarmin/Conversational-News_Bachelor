 <unk> let 's talk trash [MASK] you know[MASK] <unk> we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the great depression and world war ii [MASK] after the war we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime life[MASK] <unk> magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes <unk> [MASK] mental note to the liberators <unk> throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don 't biodegrade only we humans make waste that nature can 't digest [MASK] plastics are also hard to recycle a teacher told me how to express the[MASK] under five percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream[MASK] <unk> 's diddly point squat that 's the percentage we recycle[MASK] <unk> now <unk> melting point has a lot to do with this plastic is not purified by the <unk> re melting process like glass and metal it begins to <unk>[MASK]

beverage bottles we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan <unk>[MASK] who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail [MASK] <unk> rookery off baja 's sparsely populated central coast notice that the bottles here have caps on them [MASK] bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate pet will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization also the caps are produced in separate factories <unk>[MASK] <unk> from a different plastic polypropylene they will float in seawater but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills[MASK] <unk> let 's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo <unk> [MASK] after a year the ones from japan are heading straight across the pacific while ours get caught in the california current and first head down to the latitude of cabo san lucas <unk> [MASK] after ten years a lot of the japanese caps are in what we call the eastern garbage patch while ours litter the philippines <unk> [MASK] after twenty years we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the north pacific gyre[MASK] it so happens that millions of albatross nesting on kure and midway atolls[MASK] in the northwest hawaiian islands national monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks [MASK] a four month old

bottle caps sadly their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface [MASK] the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals this is mae west <unk> still alive at a zookeeper 's home in new orleans[MASK] <unk> i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem so on coastal clean up day in two thousand and five i went to the long beach peninsula at the east end of our long beach we cleaned <unk>[MASK] <unk> up the swaths of beach shown i offered five cents each for bottle caps i got plenty of takers [MASK] <unk> i separated them by color and put them on display the next earth day at cabrillo marine aquarium in san pedro <unk> [MASK] governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display in

[MASK] now when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this [MASK] and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving

five millimeters to one third of a millimeter <unk> [MASK] small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding[MASK] <unk> we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills <unk> [MASK] we did hundreds of necropsies [MASK] and over a third had polluted plastic
