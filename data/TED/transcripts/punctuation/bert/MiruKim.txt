 <unk> i was raised in seoul korea <unk> and moved to new york city in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine to attend college <unk> i was pre med at the time [MASK] and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and[MASK] dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity[MASK] at the same time[MASK] i fell in love with new york city [MASK] i started to realize that i could look at the whole city as a living organism <unk> [MASK] i wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers <unk> [MASK] and the way to it for me was through artistic means <unk> [MASK] so eventually i[MASK] decided to pursue an[MASK] <unk> instead of an m d and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city [MASK] in new york city rats are part of commuters ' daily lives[MASK] most people ignore them or are frightened of them but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society and even though they 're used in labs to promote[MASK] <unk> human lives they 're also considered pests <unk> i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them [MASK] one day in the subway i was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two [MASK] and a man came up to me[MASK] and said you can 't take photographs[MASK] <unk> i was quite shocked by that and[MASK] thought to myself well <unk> ok then i 'll[MASK] follow the rats [MASK] then i started going into the tunnels which made me realize that there 's a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don 't get to see [MASK] around the same time i met like minded individuals who[MASK] call themselves[MASK] <unk> urban explorers <unk> adventurers spelunkers <unk> guerrilla historians etc <unk> [MASK] i was welcomed into this loose internet based network of people who regularly explore[MASK] urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations tunnels sewers[MASK] <unk> when i took photographs in these locations <unk> i felt there was something missing in the pictures <unk> simply documenting these[MASK] structures wasn 't enough for me so i wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these[MASK] <unk> and the simplest way[MASK] to do it at the time was to model myself <unk>[MASK] i decided against clothing because i wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time specific elements <unk> [MASK] i wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying derelict[MASK] spaces <unk> this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook brooklyn[MASK] <unk> it 's now an empty[MASK] lot waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new ikea <unk> [MASK] i was very fond of this space because it 's the first massive industrial complex i found on my own[MASK] that is abandoned when i first went in i was scared because i heard dogs barking and i thought they were guard dogs but they happened to be wild dogs living there and it was right by the water[MASK] there were swans and ducks swimming around and[MASK] trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels <unk> the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex [MASK] and in a way i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature [MASK] when i got comfortable in the space it also felt like a big playground i would climb up the tanks and[MASK] <unk> hop across exposed beams as if i went back in time and became a child again[MASK] <unk> this was taken in the old croton aqueduct which supplied fresh water to new york city for the first time <unk> the construction began in[MASK] <unk> when you go into spaces like this you 're directly accessing the past because they sit untouched for decades <unk> [MASK] i love feeling the aura of[MASK] a space that has so much history <unk> instead of looking at reproductions of it at home you 're actually feeling the hand laid bricks[MASK] and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and[MASK] <unk> muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight <unk> [MASK] this is a tunnel underneath riverside park it was built in the 1930s by robert moses <unk> [MASK] the murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in one thousand nine[MASK] <unk> when the tunnel reopened for trains walking in this tunnel is very peaceful there 's nobody around you and[MASK] you hear the kids playing in the park above you completely unaware of what 's underneath when i was going out a lot to these places <unk> i was feeling a lot of[MASK] anxiety and isolation because i was in a solitary phase in my life <unk> [MASK] and i decided to title my series naked city spleen[MASK] <unk> references charles baudelaire naked city is a nickname for new york and spleen embodies the melancholia and inertia[MASK] that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment <unk> [MASK] this is the same tunnel you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching[MASK] <unk> is a tunnel that 's abandoned in hell 's kitchen <unk> [MASK] i was there alone setting up and a homeless man approached <unk> i was basically intruding in his living space <unk> [MASK] i was really frightened at first but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and[MASK] he didn 't seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on[MASK] <unk> was done he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet[MASK] and kindly walked me out [MASK] it must have been a very unusual day for him [MASK] one thing that struck me after this incident was that a space like that[MASK] holds so many deleted memories of the city[MASK] that homeless man to me really represented[MASK] an element of the unconscious of the city he told me that he was abused[MASK] above ground and was once in riker 's island and[MASK] at last he found peace and quiet in that space [MASK] the tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city <unk> but is now a sanctuary for[MASK] outcasts <unk> who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller 's everyday life <unk> [MASK] this is underneath my alma mater columbia university <unk> [MASK] the tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the manhattan project [MASK] this particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the[MASK] <unk> original foundations of bloomingdale insane asylum which was demolished in one thousand eight hundred and ninety when columbia moved in [MASK] this is the new york city farm colony which was a poorhouse in staten island from[MASK] <unk> in places that have been abandoned for decades but this is an exception <unk> this children 's hospital was closed in[MASK] it 's located in newark <unk> when i was there three years ago <unk> the windows were broken and the walls were peeling but everything was left there as it was you see the autopsy table <unk> morgue[MASK] <unk> machines and even used utensils <unk> which you see on the autopsy table <unk> [MASK] after exploring[MASK] <unk> buildings <unk> i felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast <unk> your home your office a shopping mall [MASK] a church any man made structures around you <unk> [MASK] i was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly[MASK] <unk> are [MASK] i love to travel and berlin has become one of my favorite cities <unk> [MASK] it 's full of history and also full of underground bunkers and ruins from the war <unk> [MASK] this was taken under a homeless asylum built in[MASK] <unk> i was on the train and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb like basement which was used for ammunition storage <unk>[MASK] during the war and also at some point to hide groups of jewish refugees <unk> [MASK] <unk> and fell in love right away there are more than one hundred and eighty five miles of tunnels <unk> and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum [MASK] the first tunnels date back to sixty b c they were consistently dug as[MASK] limestone quarries and by the <unk> 18th century[MASK] <unk> of some of these quarries posed safety threats so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries[MASK] and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place [MASK] as you can see the system is very complex and vast <unk> it 's very dangerous to get lost in there <unk> [MASK] and at the same time there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries so[MASK] the bones[MASK] <unk> were moved from the[MASK] cemeteries into the quarries making them into the catacombs <unk> [MASK] the remains of over six million people are housed in there some over one thousand three hundred years old <unk> [MASK] this was taken[MASK] under the montparnasse cemetery where most of the[MASK] <unk> are located [MASK] there are also phone cables that were used in the ' 50s[MASK] and many bunkers from the world war ii era <unk> this is a german bunker[MASK] nearby there 's a french bunker <unk> and the whole tunnel system is so complex that[MASK] the two parties never met <unk> the tunnels are famous for having been used by the resistance <unk> which victor hugo wrote about in les miserables[MASK] <unk> and i saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s like this one[MASK] after exploring the underground of paris i decided to climb up and[MASK] i climbed[MASK] a gothic monument that 's right in the middle of paris[MASK] <unk> this is the tower of saint jacques <unk> it was built in the early <unk>[MASK] i don 't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of january naked [MASK] it was not very comfortable and all this time <unk> i never saw a single rat in any of these places[MASK] <unk> i was in the london sewers <unk> this was probably the toughest place to explore i had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes[MASK] i guess <unk> except for in this picture <unk> [MASK] and when the tides of waste matter come in it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you <unk> [MASK] this is a still from a film i worked on recently[MASK] <unk> film gave a different feel to it [MASK] and this is the first theater project i worked on <unk> [MASK] i adapted and produced a dream play by august[MASK] <unk> it was performed last september one time only in the atlantic avenue tunnel in brooklyn <unk> which is considered to be the oldest[MASK] underground train tunnel in the world built in <unk>[MASK] <unk> been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these lately <unk> but whenever i get a chance i still work on my series <unk> [MASK] the last place i visited was the mayan ruins of copan[MASK] <unk> honduras <unk> this was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple[MASK]
