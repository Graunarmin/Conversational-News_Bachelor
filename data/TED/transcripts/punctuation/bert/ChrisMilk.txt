 <unk> virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place it was the <unk>[MASK] i got into the field very young i was seven years old <unk> and[MASK] <unk> this was my joy back then <unk> i rode this motorcycle everywhere <unk> and i was there with evel knievel we jumped the snake river canyon[MASK] <unk> i wanted the rocket <unk> i never got the rocket i only got the motorcycle[MASK] i felt so connected to this world i didn 't want to be a storyteller when i grew up i wanted to be stuntman[MASK] <unk> i was there <unk> evel knievel was my friend <unk> i had so much empathy for him <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] it didn 't work out i went to art school [MASK] <unk> beginning of a filmmaker <unk> and i started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker[MASK] to try to tell the most compelling stories that i can to an audience [MASK] and film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely foreign from our own <unk> [MASK] unfortunately <unk> evel knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him <unk> and he sued us for this video[MASK] <unk> the upside the man that[MASK] i worshipped as a child the man that i wanted to become as an adult <unk> i was finally able to get his autograph [MASK] <unk> but essentially it 's the same now as it was then <unk> it 's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence <unk> [MASK] and we 've done incredible things with those rectangles <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] i started thinking about is there a way that i can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways[MASK] and tell different kinds of stories that maybe i couldn[MASK] <unk> 't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we 've been using for one hundred years so[MASK] i started experimenting <unk> and what i was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine[MASK] <unk> and here 's one of the early experiments [MASK] <unk> was a collaboration[MASK] with arcade fire it asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it it 's a website <unk> and out of it starts growing these[MASK] little boxes with different browser windows <unk> [MASK] and you see this teenager running down a street and then you see google street view and google maps imagery and you realize the street he 's running down is yours <unk> [MASK] and when he stops in front of a house <unk> he stops in front of your house[MASK] <unk> and this was great and i saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that i had made in rectangles <unk> [MASK] and i 'm essentially taking a piece of your history[MASK] and putting it inside the framing of the story <unk> but then i started thinking okay well that 's a part of you <unk> but how do i put[MASK] i put all of you inside of the frame so to do that i started making art installations <unk> and this is one[MASK] <unk> the treachery of sanctuary it 's a triptych i 'm going to show you the third panel[MASK] <unk> inside of the frame <unk> and[MASK] i saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one <unk> [MASK] but then i started thinking about frames <unk> and what do they represent <unk> and a frame is just a window <unk>[MASK] <unk> i mean all the media that we watch television cinema they 're these windows into these other worlds <unk> [MASK] and i thought <unk> well great i got you in a frame but i don 't want you in the frame i don 't want you in the window i want you through the window i want you on the other side [MASK] in the world inhabiting the world [MASK] so that[MASK] leads me back to virtual reality <unk> let 's talk about virtual reality <unk> [MASK] unfortunately talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture[MASK] <unk> and this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality [MASK] so <unk> it 's difficult to explain why is it difficult to explain it 's difficult because it 's a very experiential medium[MASK] <unk> you feel your way inside of it it 's a machine but inside of[MASK] <unk> it feels like real life <unk> it feels like truth <unk> and you feel present in the world that you 're inside and you feel present with the people that you 're inside of it with [MASK] so [MASK] i 'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film [MASK] a full screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality <unk> so we 're shooting in every direction this is a camera system that we built[MASK] that has 3d cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction we take this and we[MASK] <unk> build basically a sphere of a world that you inhabit [MASK] so what i 'm going to show you is not a view into the world it 's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle <unk> [MASK] so this film is called clouds over sidra [MASK] and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called <unk> vrse and the united nations and[MASK] <unk> we went to a syrian refugee camp in jordan in december and shot the story of a 12 year old girl there named sidra <unk> [MASK] and she and her family fled syria through the desert into jordan and she 's been living in this[MASK] camp for the last year and a half[MASK] <unk> camp in jordan for the last year and a half i have[MASK] a big family <unk> three brothers one is a baby he cries a lot <unk> [MASK] i asked my father if i cried when i was a baby and he says i did not i think i was a stronger baby than my brother[MASK] so when you 're inside of the headset you 're not seeing it like this <unk> you 're looking around through this world you 'll notice you[MASK] see full three hundred and sixty degrees in all directions[MASK] <unk> and when you 're sitting there in her room watching her <unk> you 're not watching it through a television screen you 're not watching it through a window <unk> you[MASK] <unk> you 're sitting there with her when you look down <unk> you 're sitting on the same ground that she 's sitting on <unk> [MASK] and because of that you feel her humanity in a deeper way[MASK] <unk> you empathize with her in a deeper way <unk> and[MASK] i think that we can change minds with this machine <unk> and we 've already started to try to[MASK] <unk> so we took this film to the world economic forum in davos[MASK] in january <unk> and we showed it to a group of people whose decisions[MASK] affect the lives of millions of people and these are people who might not otherwise be sitting[MASK] in a tent in a refugee camp in jordan <unk> but[MASK] in january <unk> one afternoon in switzerland they suddenly all found themselves there[MASK] and they were affected by it [MASK] so we 're going to make more of them [MASK] we 're working with the united nations[MASK] right now to shoot a whole series of these films we just finished shooting a story in liberia <unk> and now we 're going to shoot a story in india[MASK] and we 're taking these films <unk> [MASK] and we 're showing them at the united nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there [MASK] and we 're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films <unk> [MASK] and that 's where i think we just start to scratch the surface[MASK] of the true power of[MASK] <unk> it 's not a video game peripheral it connects humans to other humans[MASK] in a profound way that i 've never seen before in any other form of media and it can change people 's perception of each other [MASK] and that 's how i think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world <unk> [MASK] so <unk> it 's a machine[MASK] <unk> but through this machine we become[MASK] more compassionate we become more empathetic <unk> and we become[MASK] more connected and ultimately we become more human[MASK] thank you[MASK]
