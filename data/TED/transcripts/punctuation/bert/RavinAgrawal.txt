 <unk> right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art contemporary artists in india are having a conversation with the world like never before i thought it might be interesting even for the many[MASK] <unk> here with us at ted local collectors to have an outside view of ten young indian artists i wish everyone at ted to know the[MASK] first is bharti kher the central motif of bharti 's practice is the[MASK] that untold millions of indian women apply to their foreheads every day in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage <unk> [MASK] but originally the significance of the bindi is to[MASK] symbolize the third eye[MASK] <unk> the spiritual world and the religious world bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche as she calls it by exploding it into something spectacular [MASK] she also creates life size fiberglass sculptures often of animals which she then completely covers in bindis [MASK] often with potent symbolism she says she first got started with ten packets[MASK] what she could do with ten thousand [MASK] our next artist balasubramaniam really stands at the crossroads of sculpture painting and installation <unk> working wonders with fiberglass [MASK] since bala himself will be speaking at ted i won 't spend too much time on him here today <unk> except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible[MASK] <unk> chitra ganesh is known for her digital collages using indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material [MASK] these comics are a fundamental way that children <unk> especially in the diaspora <unk> learn their religious and mythological folk tales [MASK] i for one was steeped in these [MASK] <unk> iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics [MASK] and she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well[MASK] jitish kallat successfully practices across photography <unk> sculpture <unk> painting and installation as you can see <unk> he 's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art <unk> and his home city of mumbai is an[MASK] he really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban bombay <unk> [MASK] he also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin [MASK] here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot [MASK] <unk> actually has a studio right here in mysore <unk> he 's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition <unk> he creates these fine delicate images[MASK] which he then repeats on a massive scale[MASK] <unk> he uses scale to more and more spectacular effect <unk> whether on the roof of a temple in singapore <unk> [MASK] or in his increasingly ambitious installation work here with one hundred and[MASK] <unk> functioning sewing machines fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations[MASK] mumbai based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women [MASK] she too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas but in a very different way than chitra ganesh [MASK] in this particular work <unk> she actually strips out the images[MASK] <unk> he too is reinventing the miniature tradition <unk> [MASK] he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch <unk> but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth[MASK] <unk> he actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills[MASK] to get this rich detailed effect <unk> [MASK] i 'm kind of cheating with this next artist since raqs media collective are really three artists working together [MASK] raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in india today <unk> working across photography <unk> video and installation <unk> [MASK] they frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization and their home of delhi is a frequent element in their work[MASK] <unk> here <unk> they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens in which the city itself may have been the culprit [MASK] this next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art subodh gupta <unk> he was first known for creating giant[MASK] kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every indian [MASK] he celebrates these local and mundane objects globally <unk> and on a grander and grander scale by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures[MASK] and installations [MASK] and finally number[MASK] <unk> last and certainly not least <unk> ranjani shettar <unk> who lives and works here in the state of karnataka creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to[MASK] the industrial and brings like subodh the local global these are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye[MASK] <unk> and she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space and interact with the objects and light and shadow are a very important part of her work [MASK] she also explores themes of consumerism[MASK] <unk> and the environment <unk> such as in this work <unk> where these basket like objects look organic and woven <unk> and are woven <unk> [MASK] but with the strips of steel salvaged from cars that she found in a bangalore junkyard[MASK]
