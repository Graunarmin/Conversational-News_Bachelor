 <unk> last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation <unk> hopefully for a good cause which is[MASK] and i 've done this in three parts <unk> so first[MASK] <unk> i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z or more precisely from a ak to [MASK] zywiec and here 's a little image of that and this was an amazing year it was really a fascinating journey[MASK] so it had its downsides <unk> but[MASK] after that i decided to work on the spirit as i mentioned last year i grew up with no religion at all [MASK] i 'm jewish but i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian not[MASK] really but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage[MASK] <unk> by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it <unk> so i decided to follow all the rules of the bible and[MASK] from the ten commandments to growing my beard because leviticus says you cannot shave so this is what i looked like by the end[MASK] thank you for that reaction [MASK] <unk> i got both of them <unk> so there was the the topiary there and[MASK] there 's the sheep now[MASK] the final part of the trilogy was i wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person i could be the healthiest person alive so that 's what i 've been doing the last couple of years <unk> and i just finished a couple[MASK] <unk> and i have to say thank god because living so healthily was killing me [MASK] it was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do it 's just[MASK] mind boggling i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers and they were telling me[MASK] all the things i had to do <unk> i had to eat right [MASK] <unk> because that lowers the blood pressure <unk> i wrote the book on a treadmill and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book <unk> i had to put on sunscreen this <unk>[MASK] <unk> was no small feat because if you listen to dermatologists they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen <unk> and you have to reapply it every two to four hours so i think half of my <unk>[MASK] <unk> book advance went into sunscreen <unk> i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year[MASK] <unk> there was the washing of hands i had to do that properly <unk> and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and <unk>[MASK] iphones in my house because those are just orgies of germs <unk> so that took a lot of time <unk> [MASK] <unk> because that 's a part of health[MASK] i was inspired by the danish safety council they started a public campaign that says [MASK] a walking helmet is a good helmet so they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking but also for walking around <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] you can see there they 're shopping with their helmets laughter[MASK] <unk> i tried that [MASK] now it 's a little extreme i admit but if you think about this this is actually the freakonomics authors wrote about this that more <unk>[MASK] <unk> people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving <unk> so[MASK] my cholesterol went down i lost weight my wife stopped telling me that i looked pregnant <unk> so that was nice <unk> and[MASK] it was successful overall but i also learned that i was too healthy and that was unhealthy <unk> i was so focused on doing all these things that i was neglecting my friends and family and as dan buettner can tell you[MASK] <unk> having a strong social network is so crucial to our health <unk> so i finished <unk> and i[MASK] i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over i went to the dark side[MASK] and i just indulged myself it was like something out of caligula without the sex part because[MASK] i have three young kids so that wasn 't happening[MASK] <unk> definitely <unk> and i finally[MASK] have stabilized so now i 'm back to adopting many not all i don 't wear a helmet anymore but[MASK] dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during[MASK] <unk> of course don 't have time to go into all of them let me just tell you two really quickly [MASK] the first is and this was surprising to me i didn 't expect this to come out but i live a much quieter life now [MASK] because we live in such a noisy world[MASK] there 's trains and planes and cars and bill o[MASK] <unk> health hazard not just because it harms our hearing <unk> which it obviously does but it actually[MASK] initiates the fight or flight response a loud noise will get your[MASK] <unk> fight or flight response going and this <unk> over the years can cause real damage[MASK] <unk> cardiovascular damage the world health organization just did a big study that they published this year <unk> [MASK] and <unk> it was done in europe and they estimated that one point six million years of healthy living are lost[MASK] every year in europe[MASK] because of noise pollution <unk> so they think it 's actually very deadly[MASK] <unk> impairs cognition and our founding fathers knew about this <unk> when they wrote the constitution they put[MASK] dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate so[MASK] without noise reduction technology our country would not exist so as a patriot[MASK] <unk> i felt it was important to i wear all the earplugs and the earphones and it 's really improved my life in[MASK] in a surprising and unexpected way and the second point i want to make the final point is[MASK] that <unk>[MASK] and it 's actually been a theme of tedmed that[MASK] that joy is so important to your health that[MASK] <unk> there 's some sense of pleasure and joy in them <unk> and just to give you one instance of this food [MASK] the[MASK] junk food industry is really great at at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what 's the most pleasurable[MASK] but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food to give just one example we[MASK] <unk> love crunchiness <unk> mouthfeel <unk> so[MASK] i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes throw in some sunflower seeds <unk> [MASK] and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you 're eating doritos and[MASK] it has made me a healthier person <unk> so that is it the book about it comes out in april it 's called drop dead healthy and i hope that i don 't get sick during the book tour that 's my greatest hope so thank you very much[MASK]
