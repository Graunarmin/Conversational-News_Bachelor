sequence and direction of waves <unk> the flight patterns of certain birds even the slightest hint of color[MASK] on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy[MASK] <unk> when western scientists would join mau on the canoe[MASK] and watch him go into the hull it appeared that an old man was going to rest [MASK] in fact the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel <unk> [MASK] it is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of[MASK] <unk> mau was in fact <unk> gathering explicit data[MASK] using his entire body <unk> it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old [MASK] now science may dismiss this methodology <unk> [MASK] but polynesian navigators use it today[MASK] because it provides them[MASK] an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel[MASK] <unk> the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance [MASK] sometimes i 'd be with mau on a cloud covered night and we 'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island <unk> and he would look out <unk> [MASK] and then he would say okay we go [MASK] he saw that first glint of light he knew what the weather was going to be three[MASK] <unk> days from now [MASK] their achievements <unk> intellectually and scientifically are extraordinary <unk> and they are so relevant for these
