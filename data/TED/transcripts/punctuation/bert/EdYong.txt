 <unk> a herd of wildebeests a shoal of fish a flock of birds many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world but[MASK] why do these groups form <unk> [MASK] the common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs[MASK] or gathering to mate or breed [MASK] and all of these explanations while often true <unk> make a huge assumption about animal behavior that the animals are in control of their own actions that they are in charge of their bodies <unk> [MASK] and that is often not the case <unk> [MASK] this is artemia a brine[MASK] <unk> you probably know it better as a sea monkey <unk> [MASK] it 's small and it typically lives alone but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters <unk> [MASK] and these form because of a parasite these shrimp are infected with a tapeworm a tapeworm is effectively a long living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other as a freelance journalist i sympathize <unk> [MASK] the tapeworm drains nutrients from artemia 's body but it also does[MASK] <unk> other things <unk> it castrates them <unk> it changes their color from transparent to bright red [MASK] it makes them live longer and as biologist nicolas rode has found it makes them swim in groups <unk> [MASK] why <unk> because the tapeworm like many other parasites has a complicated life cycle involving[MASK] <unk> are just one step on its journey its ultimate destination is this the greater flamingo [MASK] only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce so to get there it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are <unk>[MASK] easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour <unk> and that is the secret of the artemia[MASK] <unk> they aren 't sociable through their own volition but because they are being controlled it 's not safety in numbers <unk> it 's actually the exact opposite <unk> [MASK] the tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies <unk> turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo [MASK] and here is another example of a parasitic manipulation <unk> this is a suicidal cricket <unk> [MASK] this cricket swallowed the larvae of a gordian worm or horsehair worm the worm grew to adult size[MASK] <unk> size within it <unk> but it needs to get into water in order to mate and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket 's brain <unk> causing it to behave erratically <unk> [MASK] when the cricket nears a body of water such as this swimming pool <unk> it jumps in and drowns and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse [MASK] crickets are really roomy who knew[MASK] <unk> the tapeworm and the gordian worm are not alone they are part of an entire cavalcade of mind controlling parasites of fungi viruses and worms and insects <unk>[MASK] <unk> and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts <unk> [MASK] <unk> about twenty years ago <unk> and then later through a wonderful book called parasite rex by my friend carl zimmer <unk> [MASK] and i 've been writing about these creatures ever since few topics in biology enthrall me more <unk> it 's like the parasites have subverted my own brain <unk> [MASK] because after all they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre when you write about parasites your lexicon swells with phrases like devoured alive and bursts out of its[MASK] <unk> but there 's more to it than that i 'm a writer and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories[MASK] parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations <unk> [MASK] why for example does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over is it[MASK] <unk> maybe protecting its siblings [MASK] this caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it the eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body <unk> see what i mean [MASK] now <unk> the caterpillar didn 't die some of the wasps seemed to stay[MASK] stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons this caterpillar is a head banging[MASK] <unk> zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it [MASK] we have a lot to get through i only have thirteen minutes [MASK] now some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world[MASK] that they are outliers <unk> and that point of view is understandable because by their nature parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things [MASK] they 're easy to overlook <unk> but that doesn 't mean that they aren 't important [MASK] a few years back a man called kevin lafferty took a group of scientists into three californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find <unk> [MASK] and what they found were[MASK] <unk> parasites in extreme abundance <unk> [MASK] especially common were trematodes tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail <unk> [MASK] now a single <unk> trematode is tiny microscopic <unk> but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds[MASK] <unk> and remember the gordian worm that i showed you the cricket thing one japanese scientist called takuya sato found that in one stream [MASK] these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some sixty percent of the diet of local trout [MASK] manipulation is not an oddity it is a critical and common part of the world around us [MASK] and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators[MASK] <unk> to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts and this is one of my favorite examples <unk> this is[MASK] the emerald cockroach wasp <unk> and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach [MASK] when she finds one she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ[MASK] this discovery came out three weeks ago she[MASK] stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach 's brain <unk> [MASK] so like a person blindly rooting about in a bag she finds the brain <unk> and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons[MASK] <unk> and ram gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon <unk> it doesn 't kill the roach nor does it sedate it the roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to but it doesn 't choose to [MASK] because the venom nixes its motivation to walk and only that the wasp basically un checks the escape from danger box in the roach 's operating system <unk> allowing her to lead her helpless[MASK] <unk> victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog [MASK] and once there she lays an egg on it egg hatches devoured alive bursts out of body yadda yadda yadda you know the drill [MASK] now i would argue that once stung <unk> the cockroach isn 't a roach anymore it 's more of an extension of the wasp just like the cricket was an extension of the gordian worm[MASK] <unk> these hosts won 't get to survive or reproduce they have as much control over their own fates as my car [MASK] once the parasites get in the hosts don 't get a say <unk> [MASK] now humans of course are no stranger to manipulation we take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods <unk> and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else 's mind[MASK] <unk> but our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine grained specificity of the parasites <unk> don draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp <unk> [MASK] now i think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling <unk> [MASK] we place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing[MASK] <unk> those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears <unk> orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and <unk>[MASK] these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction <unk> but in nature they happen all the time [MASK] which leads me to an obvious[MASK] <unk> sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it besides the nsa [MASK] if there are any i 've[MASK] got a red dot on my forehead now don 't i [MASK] if there are any this is a good candidate for them this is toxoplasma[MASK] <unk> for short because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname[MASK] toxo infects mammals <unk> a wide variety of mammals <unk> but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat <unk> [MASK] and scientists like joanne webster have shown that if toxo gets into a rat or a mouse it turns the rodent into a cat seeking missile [MASK] if the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of[MASK] <unk> away <unk> the cat eats the rat toxo gets to have sex[MASK] <unk> we don 't really know we know that toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine a substance involved in reward and motivation we know it targets certain parts of a rodent 's brain <unk> including those involved <unk>[MASK] <unk> in sexual arousal but how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear [MASK] <unk> even have a body <unk> but it 's manipulating a mammal <unk> [MASK] we are mammals <unk> we are more intelligent than a mere rat to be sure <unk> but our brains have the same basic structure the same types of cells <unk> the same chemicals running through them <unk> and the same parasites[MASK] <unk> estimates vary a lot but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have toxo in their brains now typically this doesn 't lead to any overt illness [MASK] the parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long[MASK] <unk> period of time <unk> [MASK] but there 's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents <unk>[MASK] and there 's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected [MASK] <unk> opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior <unk> [MASK] but given the widespread nature of such manipulations <unk> it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren 't similarly affected <unk> [MASK] and i think that[MASK] this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing they 're constantly inviting[MASK] <unk> to look at the natural world sideways and to ask if the behaviors we 're seeing whether they 're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling are not the results of individuals acting through their <unk>[MASK] <unk> own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else <unk> [MASK] <unk> origin of species charles darwin writes about the grandeur of life <unk> and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful [MASK] and i like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks [MASK] but perhaps that 's just a parasite talking [MASK]
