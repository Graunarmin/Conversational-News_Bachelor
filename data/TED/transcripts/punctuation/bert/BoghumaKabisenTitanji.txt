 <unk> share with you[MASK] the story of one of my patients called celine celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of cameroon in west central africa <unk>[MASK] <unk> six years ago at the time of her hiv diagnosis she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time [MASK] when i first met celine a little over a year ago <unk> she had gone for eighteen months without any antiretroviral therapy <unk> [MASK] and she was very ill [MASK] she told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended[MASK] because she had no money for the bus fare[MASK] and was too ill to walk the[MASK] <unk> distance <unk> [MASK] now during the clinical trial she 'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge <unk> [MASK] and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds <unk> [MASK] all of these ended once the trial was completed <unk> leaving celine with no alternatives <unk> [MASK] she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she 'd received during the trial or even what the trial had been about[MASK] <unk> i didn 't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were[MASK] because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue <unk> yet what puzzled me most[MASK] was celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial <unk> yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant[MASK] or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed[MASK] <unk> now i have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted <unk> [MASK] maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results <unk> maybe it even got published in a high profile scientific journal <unk> [MASK] maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the[MASK] <unk> it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who like celine <unk> were left to their own devices[MASK] once the research had been completed <unk> [MASK] i do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting hiv clinical trials in developing countries is bad [MASK] on the contrary clinical trials are extremely useful tools <unk> and are much needed to address the burden of[MASK] <unk> disease in developing countries <unk> however <unk> the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding[MASK] pose a real risk for exploitation especially in the context of <unk>[MASK] research [MASK] sadly enough the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer[MASK] <unk> countries which fund the research <unk> i 'm sure you must be asking yourselves[MASK] what makes developing countries especially those in sub saharan africa <unk> so attractive for these hiv clinical trials [MASK] well in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results [MASK] they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants[MASK] and preferably on[MASK] <unk> population with a high incidence of new hiv infections <unk>[MASK] sub saharan africa largely fits this description [MASK] with twenty two million people living with hiv an estimated seventy percent of the thirty million people who are infected worldwide <unk> [MASK] also research within the continent[MASK] is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty <unk> endemic diseases[MASK] and inadequate health care systems a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population[MASK] is more likely to be authorized and in the absence of good health care systems <unk> almost any offer of medical assistance[MASK] is accepted as better than nothing even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation less rigorous[MASK] ethical reviews <unk> and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure [MASK] as[MASK] funding for hiv research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict [MASK] you can see why this context[MASK] <unk> very attractive the high prevalence of hiv drives researchers[MASK] to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels[MASK] ethically questionable <unk> [MASK] how then can we ensure that in our search for the cure we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic <unk> [MASK] i invite you to consider four areas i think we can focus on[MASK] in order to improve the way in which[MASK] <unk> things are done <unk> [MASK] the first of these is informed consent [MASK] now in order for a clinical trial to be[MASK] considered ethically acceptable participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand [MASK] and must freely consent to participate[MASK] in the trial this is especially important in developing countries where a lot of participants consent to[MASK] <unk> research[MASK] because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits [MASK] consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries [MASK] for example it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant like[MASK] <unk> sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read let alone understand <unk> [MASK] local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials as well as the incentives for participation <unk> [MASK] the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants[MASK] in linguistically and culturally acceptable[MASK] <unk> the second point i would like for you to consider[MASK] is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial <unk> now this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy [MASK] should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available[MASK] anywhere in the world or should they be given an alternative standard of care such[MASK] <unk> the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted [MASK] is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed <unk> [MASK] now in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver <unk> the answer is straightforward <unk> [MASK] <unk> the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries <unk> [MASK] it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits[MASK] of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial <unk> and establish one[MASK] which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study [MASK] that brings us to the third point i want you think about the[MASK] <unk> review of research [MASK] an effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial <unk> [MASK] unfortunately this is often[MASK] lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries <unk> local governments[MASK] <unk> set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries [MASK] and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government[MASK] and research sponsors <unk> public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency[MASK] and independent review by nongovernmental and[MASK] international organizations as appropriate <unk> the final point i would like for you to consider tonight[MASK] is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed <unk> [MASK] i think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended <unk> [MASK] now <unk> researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown[MASK] <unk> to be beneficial during a clinical trial[MASK] is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed <unk> [MASK] in addition they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments[MASK] in the wider community once the trial ends <unk> [MASK] <unk> for any reason they feel that this might not be possible then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place <unk> [MASK] now fortunately for celine <unk> our meeting did not end in my office <unk> i was able to get her enrolled into a free hiv treatment program[MASK] closer to her home <unk> and with a support group to help her cope [MASK] <unk> her story has a positive ending but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate <unk> [MASK] although she may not know this my encounter with celine[MASK] has completely changed the way in which i view[MASK] hiv clinical trials in developing countries and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done[MASK] <unk> i believe that every single person listening to me tonight[MASK] can be part of that change [MASK] if you are a researcher i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience to remain ethical in your research [MASK] and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers <unk> [MASK] if you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company <unk> i challenge you to hold your employers[MASK] <unk> to fund research that is ethically sound [MASK] if you come from a developing country like myself <unk> [MASK] i urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country <unk> [MASK] yes there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv to find an effective vaccine for malaria to find[MASK] a diagnostic tool that works for t b but i believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way[MASK]
