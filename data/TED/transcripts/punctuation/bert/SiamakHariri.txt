 <unk> the school of architecture that i studied at some thirty years ago happened to be across the street[MASK] from the wonderful art gallery designed by the great architect[MASK] louis kahn i love the building and i used to visit it quite often one day[MASK] i saw the security guard[MASK] run his hand across the concrete wall <unk> and it was the way he did it the expression on his face[MASK] something touched me i could see that the security guard was moved by the building[MASK] and that architecture has that capacity to move you[MASK] <unk> i could see it and i remember thinking wow [MASK] how does architecture do that at school i was learning to design but here[MASK] here was a reaction of the heart <unk> and it touched me to the core[MASK] <unk> aspire for beauty for <unk>[MASK] for atmosphere <unk> the emotional response [MASK] that 's the realm of the ineffable and the immeasurable <unk> and that 's what you live for [MASK] a chance to try <unk> [MASK] so in two thousand and three there was an open call for designs for the bah ' temple for south america[MASK] <unk> this was[MASK] the first temple in all of south america it 's a continental temple a hugely important milestone for the bah ' community because this would be the last[MASK] of the continental temples[MASK] and would open the door for national and local temples to be built around the world and the brief was deceptively simple[MASK] and unique in the annals of religion[MASK] a circular room <unk> nine sides nine entrances nine paths <unk> [MASK] allowing you to come[MASK] to the temple from all directions <unk> nine symbolizing completeness perfection <unk> [MASK] no pulpit no sermons as there are no clergy in the[MASK] <unk> and in a world which is putting up walls <unk> the design needed to express in form[MASK] the very opposite <unk> it had to be open welcoming[MASK] to people of all faiths walks of life <unk> backgrounds or no faith no faith at[MASK] <unk> a new form of sacred space with no pattern[MASK] or[MASK] models to draw from [MASK] it was like designing one of the first churches for christianity or one of the first mosques for islam so[MASK] we live[MASK] in a secular world [MASK] how do you design sacred space today[MASK] <unk> and how do you even define what 's sacred today <unk> [MASK] i stumbled across[MASK] this beautiful quote from the bah <unk> ' writings <unk> and it speaks to prayer <unk> [MASK] it says that if you reach out in prayer <unk> and if your prayer is answered which is already very interesting[MASK] that the pillars of your heart[MASK] <unk> heart will become ashine [MASK] and i loved this idea of the inner and the outer [MASK] like when you see someone and you say that person is radiant [MASK] and i was thinking my gosh how could we make something architectural out of[MASK] <unk> you create a building[MASK] and it becomes alive with light <unk> [MASK] like alabaster if you kiss it with light it becomes alive <unk> and i drew this sketch something with two layers <unk> translucent[MASK] with structure in between capturing light <unk> maybe a pure form[MASK] <unk> a single form of emanation that you could imagine would be all dome[MASK] and everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg [MASK] laughter a blob [MASK] so you search you all know this crazy search letting the process take you [MASK] and you live for the surprises and i remember quite by accident i[MASK] saw this little video[MASK] of a plant[MASK] <unk> moving[MASK] in light <unk> [MASK] and it made me think of movement [MASK] reach this idea that the temple could have reach like this reach for the divine [MASK] you can imagine also that movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness like the cosmos [MASK] something you see in many places[MASK] but[MASK] rotation was not enough <unk> because we needed a form in the bah <unk> ' writings it talks about the temples being[MASK] as perfect[MASK] as is humanly possible <unk> and we kept thinking well what is perfection <unk> and i remember i stumbled into this[MASK] image of this japanese basket and thinking our western notions of[MASK] <unk> perfection need to be challenged that this this wonderful silhouette of this basket this wonkiness [MASK] and that it has the kind of dimple of of what you might imagine a shoulder[MASK] or the cheekbone and that kind of organic form <unk> [MASK] and so we drew and made models these lines that merge at the top soft lines[MASK] <unk> which became like drapery[MASK] and translucent veils and folding [MASK] and the idea of not only folding but torquing you remember the plant and the way it was reaching <unk> [MASK] and this started to become an interesting form <unk> carving the base making the[MASK] <unk> then we ended up with this this is this temple with two layers <unk> [MASK] nine luminous veils embodied light soft flowing lines[MASK] like luminescent drapery one hundred and eighty submissions were received from eighty countries <unk> and[MASK] this was selected so[MASK] we[MASK] went to the next stage of how to build it we had submitted[MASK] <unk> alabaster <unk> but alabaster was too soft <unk> and we were experimenting many experiments with materials trying to think how we could[MASK] have this kind of shimmer <unk> and we ended up with[MASK] <unk> the right temperature we ended up with this new material this new cast glass which took us about two years[MASK] to make <unk> [MASK] and it had this quality that we loved this idea of the embodied light <unk> [MASK] but on the inside [MASK] we wanted something with a soft light <unk> like the inner lining of a jacket on the outside you have protection but on the inside you touch it[MASK] so we found this tiny vein in a huge quarry in portugal with this beautiful[MASK] stone which the owner had kept[MASK] for seven generations in his family <unk> waiting for the right project if you can believe it <unk> look[MASK] <unk> 's beautiful and the way it lights up it has that translucent quality [MASK] so here you see the structure it lets the light through <unk> and[MASK] looking down <unk> the nine wings are bound structurally but symbolically strong <unk> [MASK] a great symbol[MASK] of unity pure[MASK] <unk> perfect circle thirty meters in section[MASK] and in plan perfectly symmetrical like the idea of sacredness and geometry <unk> and here you see[MASK] the building going up two thousand steel nodes <unk> nine thousand[MASK] pieces of steel [MASK] seven thousand eight hundred stone pieces ten thousand cast glass pieces all individual shapes <unk> the entire[MASK] <unk> superstructure all described <unk> engineered fabricated with aerospace technology prefabricated[MASK] machine to machine robotically <unk> a huge team effort you can imagine of literally hundreds <unk> and within[MASK] three percent[MASK] of our $ thirty million budget set in two thousand and six[MASK] nine wings[MASK] bound together forming a <unk> nine pointed star and the star shape moving[MASK] in space tracking the sun[MASK] <unk> a befitting response to that beautiful quote a prayer answered open in all directions[MASK] capturing the blue light of dawn tent like white[MASK] light of day <unk> the gold light of the afternoon and of course at night <unk> the reversal <unk> [MASK] sensuous catching the light in all kinds of mysterious ways <unk> and the site[MASK] it 's interesting fourteen years ago when we made the submission we showed the temple set against the andes we didn 't have the andes[MASK] as our site but after nine years that 's exactly where we ended up [MASK] the lines of the temple set against nothing but pure nature and you turn around and you get nothing but the city[MASK] below you and inside[MASK] <unk> a view in all directions <unk> radiating gardens[MASK] from each of the alcoves <unk> [MASK] radiating paths <unk> [MASK] last october <unk> the opening ceremonies a beautiful sacred event[MASK] <unk> thousand people from eighty countries <unk> a continuous river[MASK] of visitors <unk> indigenous people[MASK] from all over south america some who had never left their villages <unk> [MASK] and of course that this temple belongs to people the collective of many cultures[MASK] and walks of life many beliefs[MASK] and for me what 's most important is what it feels like on the inside that it feel[MASK] intimate sacred and that everyone is welcome <unk> and if[MASK] even a few who come[MASK] have the same reaction as that security[MASK] <unk> then it truly would be their temple <unk> and i would love that thank you[MASK]
