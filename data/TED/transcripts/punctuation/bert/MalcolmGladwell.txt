 <unk> to be here i last did a ted talk i think about seven years ago or so i talked about spaghetti sauce <unk> and[MASK] so many people i guess watch those videos people have been coming up to me[MASK] ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce which is a wonderful thing in the short term laughter[MASK] but it 's proven to be less than ideal[MASK] over seven years and so i though i would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me the theme of this morning 's[MASK] session is things we make and so i thought i would[MASK] tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era <unk> [MASK] and the man 's name is carl norden carl norden was born in one thousand eight hundred and eighty <unk> and[MASK] he was swiss and of course the swiss can be divided into two general categories those who make small exquisite <unk> expensive objects[MASK] <unk> and those who handle the money of those who buy small exquisite[MASK] expensive objects and carl norden is very firmly in the former camp <unk> he 's an engineer he goes to the[MASK] federal polytech in zurich[MASK] in fact one of his classmates is a young man named named lenin who would go on to break small <unk> expensive exquisite objects[MASK] <unk> and he 's a swiss[MASK] <unk> i mean that in its fullest sense of the word he wears three piece suits and he has a very very small <unk> important[MASK] mustache <unk> [MASK] and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego and he works <unk> 16 hour days <unk>[MASK] and he has very strong feelings about alternating current <unk> and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness[MASK] <unk> and he drinks lots of coffee and he does his best work sitting in his mother 's kitchen in zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule[MASK] in any case carl norden emigrates to the united states[MASK] just before the first world war and sets up shop on lafayette street[MASK] in downtown manhattan <unk> and he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane[MASK] now if you think about it in the age before gps and radar that was obviously a really difficult problem it 's a complicated physics problem [MASK] you 've got a plane that 's thousands of feet up in the air going at hundreds of miles an hour <unk> and you 're trying to drop an object a bomb towards some stationary target <unk>[MASK] in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments and all[MASK] <unk> sorts of people[MASK] <unk> moving up to the first world war and between the wars tried to solve this problem <unk> and nearly everybody came up short <unk> the bombsights that were available were incredibly crude <unk> [MASK] but carl norden is really the one who cracks the code <unk> and he comes up with this incredibly complicated device it weighs about fifty lbs[MASK] it 's called the norden mark fifteen bombsight and it has all kinds of levers[MASK] <unk> and ball bearings and gadgets and gauges and[MASK] he makes this complicated thing and what what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier[MASK] take this particular object <unk> visually sight the target target because they 're in the plexiglas cone of the bomber [MASK] and then they plug in the altitude of the plane <unk> the speed of the plane <unk> the speed of the wind and[MASK] <unk> and the coordinates[MASK] of of the target <unk> and the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb[MASK] and as norden famously says before that bombsight came along [MASK] bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more but he said with the mark fifteen norden bombsight <unk> he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft[MASK] <unk> now i cannot tell[MASK] <unk> you how incredibly excited the u s military was by the news of the norden bombsight[MASK] <unk> it was like manna from heaven here was an army that had just had experience in the first world war where millions of men fought each other in <unk>[MASK] <unk> the trenches getting nowhere making no progress <unk> and here someone had come up with[MASK] <unk> up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy [MASK] and the u s military spends one point five billion dollars billion dollars in one thousand nine hundred and forty dollars developing the norden bombsight <unk> and to put that in perspective[MASK] <unk> the total cost of the[MASK] <unk> manhattan project was three billion dollars half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military industrial project of the modern era <unk> [MASK] and there were people strategists within the u s military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the nazis and against the japanese [MASK] and for norden as well this device had incredible moral importance because[MASK] <unk> was a committed christian <unk> in fact he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention because in in his eyes <unk> only god could invent things he was simply the instrument of god 's will <unk> [MASK] and what was god 's will well god 's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible[MASK] <unk> and what did the norden bombsight do well it allowed you to do that it allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb <unk> [MASK] so in the years leading up to the second world war the u s military buys ninety thousand of these norden bombsights[MASK] at a cost of $ fourteen thousand each again in one thousand nine hundred and forty dollars that 's a lot of money <unk> [MASK] and they trained fifty thousand bombardiers on how to use them long extensive[MASK] <unk> sessions because these things are essentially analog computers they 're not easy to use <unk> <unk> and they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath [MASK] to swear that if they 're ever captured <unk> they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy because it 's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely <unk>[MASK] <unk> essential piece of technology <unk> and whenever the norden bombsight is taken onto a plane <unk> it 's escorted there by a series of armed[MASK] <unk> guards <unk> and it 's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it and the box is handcuffed to one of the guards it 's never allowed to be photographed <unk> and there 's a little incendiary <unk>[MASK] <unk> device inside of it so that if the plane ever crashes it will be destroyed and there 's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it [MASK] so what happens during the second world war[MASK] well it[MASK] turns out it 's not the holy grail <unk> in practice the norden bombsight can drop a[MASK] bomb into a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft but that 's under perfect conditions and of course <unk> in wartime conditions aren 't perfect [MASK] first of all it 's really hard to use really hard to use and not all of the people who are of those fifty thousand men who are bombardiers[MASK] have the ability to properly program an analog computer[MASK] <unk> secondly it breaks down a lot <unk> it 's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings and they don 't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle [MASK] thirdly when norden was making his calculations he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes <unk> well in a real war[MASK] <unk> get shot down [MASK] so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds and the norden bombsight doesn 't work as well under those conditions <unk> [MASK] but most of all the norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target <unk> but of course what happens in real life [MASK] there are clouds [MASK] right it needs cloudless sky to be really accurate well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above central europe between[MASK] <unk> and forty five [MASK] not a lot[MASK] and then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the norden bombsight was there was a famous case in one thousand nine hundred and forty four where the allies bombed a chemical plant in leuna germany <unk> and the chemical <unk>[MASK] <unk> plant comprised seven hundred and fifty seven acres <unk> and over the course of twenty two[MASK] <unk> thousand bombs on this seven hundred and fifty seven acre chemical plant using the norden bombsight <unk> [MASK] well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700 acre perimeter of the plant <unk> [MASK] ten percent[MASK] <unk> ten percent <unk> and of those ten percent that landed sixteen percent didn 't even go off they were duds <unk> the leuna chemical plant after one of the most[MASK] <unk> extensive bombings in the history of the war was up and running within weeks and[MASK] by the way all those precautions to keep the norden bombsight out of the hands of the nazis <unk> well it turns out that[MASK] that carl norden as a proper swiss was very enamored of german engineers <unk> so in the 1930s he hired a whole bunch of them [MASK] <unk> gave a complete set of the plans for the norden bombsight to the nazis so they had their own norden bombsight throughout the entire war which also by the way didn 't work very well [MASK] so why do we talk about the norden bombsight <unk> [MASK] well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of norden bombsights [MASK] we live in a time where there are all kinds of really really smart people running around saying that they 've invented gadgets[MASK] <unk> that will forever change our world they 've invented websites that will allow people to be free they 've invented some kind of this thing or this thing or this thing that will make our world forever better [MASK] if you go into the military [MASK] you 'll find lots of carl nordens as well if you go to the pentagon they will say you know what now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft [MASK] and you know what it 's true <unk> they actually[MASK] <unk> can do that now but we need to be very clear about how little that means [MASK] in the iraq war at the beginning of the first iraq war the u s military the air force sent two squadrons of of f 15e fighter eagles to the iraqi desert equipped <unk>[MASK] <unk> with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor <unk> and their mission was to find and to destroy remember the scud[MASK] <unk> missile launchers those surface to air missiles that the iraqis were launching at the israelis [MASK] the mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the scud missile launchers <unk> and so they flew missions day and night and they dropped thousands of bombs and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge <unk> [MASK] <unk> and after the war was over there was an audit done as the army always does the air force always does and they asked the question how many scuds did we actually destroy you know what[MASK] the answer was [MASK] zero <unk> not a single one <unk> now why is that is it because their weapons weren 't accurate <unk> oh no <unk> [MASK] they were brilliantly accurate <unk> they could have destroyed this little thing right here from twenty five thousand ft [MASK] the issue was they didn 't know where the[MASK] <unk> the problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel <unk> it 's knowing how to find the pickle barrel[MASK] <unk> that 's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars <unk> [MASK] or take the battle in afghanistan [MASK] what is the signature weapon of the cia 's war in northwest pakistan it 's the drone [MASK] what is the drone <unk> well it is the grandson of the norden mark fifteen bombsight it is this weapon of[MASK] <unk> devastating accuracy and precision <unk> and over the course of the last six years in northwest[MASK] pakistan <unk> the cia has flown hundreds of drone missiles and it 's used those drones to kill two thousand suspected pakistani <unk>[MASK] and taliban militants now what is the accuracy of those drones <unk> well it 's extraordinary[MASK] ninety five percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes ninety five percent of the people we kill need to be killed right that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare but[MASK] do you know what the crucial thing is [MASK] in that exact same period that we 've been using these drones with devastating accuracy [MASK] the number of attacks of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks against american forces in afghanistan has increased[MASK] tenfold [MASK] as we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them <unk> [MASK] they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us [MASK] i have not described to you a success story <unk> i 've described to you the opposite of a success story <unk> [MASK] and this is the problem with our[MASK] <unk> our infatuation with the things we make [MASK] we think the things we make can solve our problems but our problems are much more complex than that [MASK] the issue isn 't the accuracy of the bombs you have it 's how you use the bombs you have and more importantly <unk> whether you ought to use bombs at all[MASK] there 's a postscript[MASK] to the norden story of carl norden and his fabulous[MASK] <unk> called the enola gay flew over japan[MASK] and using a norden bombsight <unk> dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of hiroshima <unk> [MASK] and as was typical with the norden bombsight <unk> the bomb actually missed its target by eight hundred ft but of course[MASK] <unk> it didn 't matter <unk> and that 's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the norden <unk> bombsight [MASK] the air force 's one point five billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb <unk> which didn 't need a bombsight at all [MASK] meanwhile back in new york no one told carl norden that his bombsight was used over hiroshima <unk> [MASK] he was a committed christian <unk> he thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of[MASK] <unk> suffering in war <unk> it would have broken his heart[MASK]
