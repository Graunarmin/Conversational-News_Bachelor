 <unk> it was a very revolutionary time it was a political ferment so to say students out in the streets of paris revolting against authority[MASK] <unk> america was jolted by the[MASK] the civil rights movement in india we had the[MASK] naxalite movement <unk> the [ unclear ] movement but you know when there is a political churning of society it unleashes a lot of energy [MASK] the national movement of india[MASK] was testimony to that lots of people resigned from[MASK] <unk> one of the great programs in india was to revitalize primary science in village schools there was a person anil sadgopal did a ph d from caltech[MASK] and returned back as a molecular biologist in india 's cutting edge research institute <unk> the <unk>[MASK] <unk> he was not able to relate the kind of [ unclear ] research which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people so he designed and went and started a village science program[MASK] many people were inspired by this <unk> the slogan of the early ' 70s was go to the people [MASK] live with them <unk> love them <unk> start from what they know build on what they have [MASK] this was kind of the defining slogan [MASK] well i took one year i joined telco made tata trucks <unk> pretty close to pune i worked there for two years and i[MASK] i realized that i was not born to make trucks <unk> [MASK] often one doesn 't know what one wants to do but it 's good enough to know what you don 't want to do <unk> so i took one year off <unk> and i went to this village science program [MASK] and it was a turning point <unk> it was a very small village[MASK] a weekly bazaar where people just[MASK] once in a week they put in all the vats <unk> so i said i 'm going to spend a year over here so i just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside [MASK] and one thing which i found was this black rubber <unk> this is called[MASK] <unk> a cycle valve tube <unk> [MASK] when you pump in air in a bicycle you use a bit of this and some of these models so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube you can put two matchsticks inside this and you make a flexible joint <unk> [MASK] it 's a joint of tubes you start by teaching angles an acute angle a right angle an obtuse angle a straight angle <unk> it 's like its own little coupling <unk> if you have three of them <unk> and you loop them together <unk> well you make a triangle with four you make a square you make a pentagon[MASK] you make a hexagon <unk> you make all these kind of polygons <unk> [MASK] and they have some wonderful properties if you look at the hexagon for instance it 's like an amoeba which is constantly changing its own profile <unk> you can just pull this out this becomes a rectangle you give it a push this becomes a parallelogram <unk>[MASK] <unk> but this is very shaky <unk> look at the pentagon for instance <unk> pull this out it becomes a boat shape trapezium[MASK] <unk> very square and prim give it a little push this becomes a rhombus it becomes kite shaped but give a child a triangle <unk> he can 't do a thing to it [MASK] why use triangles because triangles are the only rigid structures <unk> [MASK] we can 't make a bridge with squares because the train would come <unk> it would start doing a jig <unk> ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in india[MASK] <unk> not have gone to engineering college but no one makes a roof placed like this because if they put tiles on top[MASK] it 's just going to crash <unk> they always make a triangular roof <unk> now this is people science and if you were to just poke[MASK] a hole over here and put a third matchstick you 'll get a t joint <unk> and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices[MASK] <unk> and once you make these you make a little house <unk> [MASK] put this on top you can make a joint of four you can make a joint of six you just need a ton now this was you make a joint of six you make an[MASK] <unk> put four marbles inside you simulate the molecular structure of methane[MASK] <unk> well since then i just thought that i 've been really privileged to[MASK] go to over two thousand schools in my country village schools <unk> government schools <unk> municipal schools <unk> ivy league schools i 've been invited by most of them and[MASK] every time i go to a school i see a gleam in the eyes of the children i see hope <unk> i see happiness in their faces children want to make things children want to do things[MASK] we make lots and lots of pumps <unk> now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon <unk> [MASK] it 's a real pump you could actually pop the balloon <unk> [MASK] and we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it so all you do is[MASK] it 's a very kind of provocative statement this old bicycle tube and[MASK] <unk> this filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube and this is how you make a valve you put a little sticky tape[MASK] <unk> this is one way traffic[MASK] well we make lots and lots of pumps <unk> and this is the other one that you just take a straw <unk> and you just put a stick inside and you make two half cuts now this is what you do is you bend both these legs into a triangle <unk> and you[MASK] just wrap some tape around <unk> and this is the pump and[MASK] <unk> now if you have this pump <unk> it 's like a great great sprinkler it 's like a centrifuge[MASK] if you spin something it tends to fly out [MASK] well in terms of if you were in andhra pradesh you would make this with the palmyra leaf many of our folk toys have great science principles <unk> if[MASK] <unk> it tends to fly out if i do it with both hands you can see this fun mr flying man [MASK] right <unk> [MASK] this is a toy which[MASK] is made from paper it 's amazing there are four pictures you see insects you see frogs <unk> snakes <unk> eagles <unk> butterflies frogs <unk> snakes <unk> eagles [MASK] here 's a paper which you could [ unclear ] designed by[MASK] <unk> documented by martin gardner in many of his many books but this is great fun for children [MASK] they all study about the food chain the insects are eaten by the frogs the frogs are eaten by the snakes the snakes are eaten by the eagles <unk> [MASK] and this can be if you had a whole photocopy paper a4 size paper[MASK] you could be in a municipal school you could be in a government school[MASK] a paper a scale and a pencil no glue no scissors in[MASK] <unk> three minutes you just fold this up [MASK] and what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination <unk> if you take a smaller paper you make a smaller flexagon [MASK] with a bigger one you make a bigger one <unk> [MASK] now this is a[MASK] pencil with a few slots over here and you put a little fan here <unk> and this is a hundred year old toy there have been six major research papers on this[MASK] <unk> there 's some grooves over here you can see <unk> and if i take a reed if i rub this <unk> something very amazing happens six major research papers on[MASK] <unk> this as a matter of fact feynman as a child was very fascinated by this <unk> he wrote a paper on this <unk> and you don 't need the three billion dollar hadron collider for doing this [MASK] applause this is there for every child [MASK] and every child can enjoy this[MASK] if you want to put[MASK] a colored disk well all these seven colors coalesce <unk> and this is what newton[MASK] newton talked about four hundred years back that white light 's made of seven colors just by spinning this around[MASK] <unk> this is a straw <unk> [MASK] what we 've done we 've just sealed both the ends with tape <unk> nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner so there 's holes in the opposite corners there 's a little hole over here <unk> this is a kind of a blowing straw i just put this inside this there 's[MASK] a hole here <unk> and i shut this and[MASK] <unk> this costs very little money to make great fun for children to do [MASK] what we do is make a very simple electric motor <unk> now this is the simplest motor on earth [MASK] the most expensive thing is the battery inside this <unk> if you have a battery it costs five cents to make it [MASK] this is an old bicycle tube which gives you a broad rubber band two safety pins this is a permanent[MASK] <unk> whenever current flows through the coil this becomes an electromagnet it 's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin we[MASK] made thirty thousand teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years they just muck up the definition and they spit it out <unk> [MASK] when teachers make it children make it you can see a gleam in their eye[MASK] <unk> get a thrill of what science is all about <unk> and this science is not a rich man 's game in a democratic country[MASK] <unk> must reach to our most oppressed to the most marginalized children <unk>[MASK] this program started with sixteen schools and spread to one thousand five hundred government schools [MASK] over one hundred thousand children learn science this way <unk> and we 're just trying to see possibilities <unk> look this is the tetrapak awful materials from the point of view of the[MASK] <unk> are fused together so you can 't separate them now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron <unk> [MASK] so something which is trash which is choking all the seabirds[MASK] <unk> you could just recycle this into a very very joyous all the platonic solids can be made with things like this <unk> [MASK] this is[MASK] a little straw <unk> and what you do is[MASK] <unk> you just nip two corners here and this becomes like a baby crocodile 's mouth you put this in your mouth and you blow <unk>[MASK] children 's delight a teacher 's envy as they say you 're not able to see how the sound is produced <unk> because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth <unk> i 'm going to keep this[MASK] <unk> muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations the other is that you keep blowing at it keep making the sound <unk> and you keep cutting it and something very very nice happens[MASK] <unk> what the kids teach you you[MASK] can also do this [MASK] well before i go any further <unk> [MASK] this is something worth sharing <unk> this is a touching slate meant for blind children this is strips of velcro <unk> this is my drawing slate <unk> and this is my drawing pen [MASK] which is basically a film box <unk> it 's basically like a[MASK] <unk> like a[MASK] fisherman 's line a fishing line <unk> and this is wool over here if i crank the handle all the wool goes inside and[MASK] what a blind child can do is to just draw this <unk> wool sticks on velcro <unk> [MASK] there are twelve million blind children[MASK] come as a great boon to them [MASK] there 's a factory out there making our children blind <unk> not able to provide them with food not able to provide them with vitamin a [MASK] but this has come as a great boon for them there are no patents <unk> anyone can make it [MASK] this is very very simple <unk> you can see this is the generator <unk> it 's a crank generator these are two magnets <unk> this is a large pulley[MASK] made by sandwiching rubber between[MASK] <unk> two old cds small pulley <unk> and two strong magnets <unk> and this fiber turns a wire attached to an led if i spin this pulley the small one 's going to spin much faster there will be a spinning magnetic field[MASK] <unk> you can do is just <unk> if you give it a twirl <unk> well they just keep going on [MASK] and imagine a[MASK] bunch of kids standing in a in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on and they 'd be absolutely joyous playing with this[MASK] <unk> well in the end what we can also do we use a lot of old newspapers to make[MASK] caps <unk> this is worthy of sachin tendulkar it 's a great cricket cap when first[MASK] you see nehru and gandhi <unk> this is the the nehru cap just half a newspaper we make lots of toys with newspapers and this is one of them <unk> and this is[MASK] you can see this is[MASK] <unk> this is a flapping bird all of our old newspapers we cut them into little squares <unk> [MASK] and if you have one of these birds children in japan have been making this bird for many many years <unk> and[MASK] you can see this is a little[MASK] fantail bird <unk> well in the end <unk> i 'll just end with a story <unk> this is called the captain 's hat story the captain was a captain of a[MASK] <unk> wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance and i 'll provide you with good food and drinks and the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia <unk> the first day it was a huge umbrella cap like a captain 's cap[MASK] that night <unk> when the passengers would be sleeping he would give it one more fold <unk> and the second day <unk> he would be wearing a fireman 's cap with a little shoot just like a designer cap <unk> because it protects the spinal cord[MASK] <unk> and the second second night he would take the same cap and give it another fold <unk> and the third day it would be a shikari cap just like an[MASK] adventurer 's cap [MASK] and the third night <unk> he would give it two more folds and this is a very very famous cap <unk> if you 've seen any of our bollywood films <unk> [MASK] this is what the policeman wears it 's called a zapalu cap[MASK] <unk> and we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship <unk> so that 's a ship and now the[MASK] end everyone was enjoying the journey very much they were singing and dancing suddenly there was a storm[MASK] and huge waves <unk> and all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves a huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down <unk> and another[MASK] <unk> and knocks it down <unk> and the ship sinks <unk> and the captain has lost everything but for a life jacket[MASK]
