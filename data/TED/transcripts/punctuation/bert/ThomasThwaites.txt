 <unk> if we look around us <unk> much of what surrounds us started life as[MASK] various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world <unk> but of course [MASK] <unk> look like rocks and sludge now they look like[MASK] tv cameras monitors[MASK] <unk> annoying radio mics and so this magical transformation is what i was trying to get at with my project which became known as the toaster project <unk> and it was also inspired <unk>[MASK] <unk> by this quote from douglas adams and the situation is from the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy and the situation it describes is the hero of the book he 's a 20th century man finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically[MASK] <unk> primitive people <unk> and he kind of assumes that yes <unk>[MASK] <unk> these villagers he 'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements but of course <unk> realizes that without the rest of human society [MASK] he can[MASK] barely make a sandwich let alone a toaster <unk> but he didn 't have wikipedia <unk> so i thought[MASK] okay i 'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch and working on the[MASK] the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse engineer i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find [MASK] took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover[MASK] that inside this object which i 'd bought for just[MASK] <unk> there were four hundred different bits made out of[MASK] a <unk> hundred plus different materials <unk> i didn 't have the rest of my life to to do this project i[MASK] had maybe nine months so i thought okay i 'll start with five and these were steel mica plastic copper and nickel [MASK] so starting with steel how do you make steel <unk> i went and[MASK] knocked on the door of the rio tinto chair of advanced mineral extraction at the royal school[MASK] <unk> of mines and said how do you make steel and professor cilliers was very kind and talked me through it [MASK] and my vague rememberings from <unk> gcse science well steel comes from iron <unk> so i phoned up an iron mine and said [MASK] hi i 'm trying to make a toaster can i come up and get some[MASK] iron [MASK] <unk> when i got there emerges ray[MASK] <unk> he had misheard me and thought i was coming up because i was trying to make a poster <unk> and so wasn 't prepared to take me into the mines but after some nagging i got him to do that[MASK] <unk> when you study geology you can see[MASK] what 's happened in the past and there were terrific[MASK] changes in the earth thomas thwaites [MASK] as you can see they had the christmas decorations up and of course <unk> it wasn 't actually a working mine[MASK] <unk> though ray was a miner there the mine had closed and had[MASK] been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction because of course it can 't compete[MASK] on the scale of operations which are happening in south america <unk> australia <unk> wherever <unk> but anyway i got my[MASK] my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to london on the train and then was faced with the problem okay how do you make this rock into components for a toaster <unk> so i went back to professor cilliers and he said[MASK] <unk> to the library so i did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy[MASK] completely useless for what i was trying to do because of course they don 't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself[MASK] and you don 't have a smelting plant <unk> [MASK] so i ended up going to the history of science library and looking at this book this is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the west at least and there you can see that woodcut[MASK] is basically what i ended up doing but instead of a[MASK] bellows i had a leaf blower <unk> [MASK] and that was something that reoccurred throughout the project was the smaller the scale you want to work on the further back in time you have to go[MASK] <unk> and so this is[MASK] after a day and and about half a night smelting this iron i dragged out this stuff and it wasn 't iron[MASK] <unk> but[MASK] luckily[MASK] <unk> i found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves and at thirty minutes at full power <unk> and i was able to finish off the process[MASK] so my next [MASK] the next thing i was trying to get was[MASK] <unk> this mine[MASK] was once the largest copper mine in the world it 's[MASK] not anymore <unk> but i found a a retired geology professor to take me down <unk> and he said okay i 'll let you have some water from the mine [MASK] and the reason i was interested in getting water is because[MASK] water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and[MASK] will start picking up dissolving the minerals from the mine and a good example of this is the rio tinto <unk> which is in portugal [MASK] as you can see it 's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it [MASK] so many such that it 's now just a home for[MASK] bacteria who really like acidic toxic conditions <unk> but anyway the water i dragged back from the isle of anglesey where the mine was there was enough copper in it such that i could cast the pins of my metal electric plug[MASK] <unk> thing i was off to scotland to get mica <unk> and mica is a mineral[MASK] which is a very good insulator and very good[MASK] at insulating electricity that 's me getting mica <unk> and the last material i 'm going to talk about today is plastic[MASK] <unk> my toaster had to have a plastic case [MASK] plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods <unk> and so plastic comes from oil so i phoned up bp and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the <unk>[MASK] pr office at bp that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil <unk> bp obviously has a bit more on their mind now[MASK] never did <unk> so i looked at other ways of making plastic and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants but also from starches so this <unk>[MASK] <unk> is attempting to make potato starch plastic <unk> and for a while that was looking really good i poured it into the mold which you can see there which i 've made from a tree trunk <unk> and it was looking good for a while but i left it outside because you had to leave it outside to dry[MASK] <unk> unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato <unk> so[MASK] kind of out of desperation i decided[MASK] that i could think laterally <unk> and geologists have actually christened well they 're debating whether to christen the age that we 're living in[MASK] they 're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the anthropocene the age of man <unk> and that 's because[MASK] <unk> geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now <unk> so suddenly it will become kind of radioactive from chernobyl and the two thousand or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since one thousand nine hundred and[MASK] forty five and there 'd also be an extinction event[MASK] like fossils would suddenly disappear[MASK] <unk> embedded in the rock <unk> so[MASK] i looked up a plastic so i decided that i could mine some of this modern day rock[MASK] <unk> and i went up to manchester to visit a place called axion recycling <unk> and they 're at the sharp end of what 's called the weee <unk> which is this european electrical and electronic[MASK] <unk> and that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being[MASK] made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill but[MASK] this[MASK] <unk> there 's a picture of my toaster [MASK] applause that 's it without the case on and there it is on the shelves[MASK] <unk> did plug it in i don 't know if you could see but i was never able to make insulation for the wires <unk> kew gardens were insistent that i couldn 't come and[MASK] hack into their rubber tree so the wires were uninsulated so there was two hundred and forty volts going through these[MASK] <unk> and for about five seconds the toaster toasted <unk> but then <unk> unfortunately the element kind of melted itself <unk> [MASK] but i considered it a partial success[MASK]
