 <unk> over the last three years we found over two hundred of these things and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted[MASK] of these[MASK] <unk> six the first one that we 're going to talk about is in the black envelope you 're holding[MASK] it comes from a company[MASK] in japan called geltech now go ahead and open it up[MASK] now be sure and take the two pieces apart[MASK] what 's unexpected about this is that it 's soft but it 's also a strong magnet[MASK] <unk> zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this[MASK] we spent a long time thinking about why this is[MASK] and it 's just recently that we realized it 's when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work[MASK] as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard[MASK] <unk> then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work[MASK] now it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible[MASK] we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world[MASK] so first idea is to use it on cabinet doors if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material[MASK] if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn 't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets[MASK] <unk> closed[MASK] imagine taking the same material[MASK] but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker[MASK] you know this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet and you could literally stick[MASK] your shoes up instead of using as shelf for me[MASK] i really love this idea[MASK] if you come to my apartment and see my closet i 'm sure you 'd figure out why it[MASK] <unk> seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications[MASK] it helps you see why this is significant kind of what the potential is but we 've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference[MASK] it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in la and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola[MASK] he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company the directors bureau but like as we were talking[MASK] <unk> roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you 're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas[MASK] and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up and keith keith and i look in[MASK] and he starts showing us concepts that he 's been working on these things just get him really excited and so we 're looking at these concepts and[MASK] <unk> we were just like[MASK] whoa this guy 's good[MASK] because[MASK] like the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now[MASK] when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking like why was this so powerful[MASK] and as we thought about it more we realized it let you fill in all the details about the[MASK] <unk> experience just like as if you saw it on tv[MASK] so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau[MASK] to create a commercial for a product a product from the future[MASK] we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when it 's coming out so i just wanted to let you know it 's not actually coming out just the concepts[MASK] so now when we dream up these concepts it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint[MASK] so i just want to quickly explain how this would work[MASK] this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board[MASK] now this is important for two reasons one the soft properties of the magnet that make it so if it were to hit the rider in the head it wouldn 't injure him in addition[MASK] <unk> you can see from the diagram on the right the under part of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market[MASK] it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system[MASK] when you get to the very bottom of the slide[MASK] the rider passes through an aluminum tube and i 'm going to kick it to keith to explain why that 's important from a technical standpoint so i 'm sure all you[MASK] <unk> engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal it 's not a magnetic material[MASK] but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you[MASK] <unk> now you see the magnet fell really slowly[MASK] now i 'm not going to get into the physics of it[MASK] but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling the greater the stopping force now our next technology is actually a ten foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket[MASK] there 's a few different versions of it[MASK] some of them automatically unroll like this one[MASK] they can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like zach 's to hold any position in between[MASK] so now as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about[MASK] how you could apply these or how they 're being applied currently[MASK] he was telling us that in the military they[MASK] <unk> use this one so soldiers can keep it on their on their chests very concealed and then when they 're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base[MASK] in our brainstorms we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag[MASK] now the interesting thing about this[MASK] <unk> you don 't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a ten foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting[MASK] so we we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this i clean my my ceiling fans with that and[MASK] i get the spider webs off my house i do it that way i 'd make my very own walking stick i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree[MASK] <unk> a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier[MASK] yeah[MASK] now for our next technology we 're going to do a little demonstration and so we need a volunteer from the audience you[MASK] sir come on up[MASK] come on up tell everybody your name steve it 's steve[MASK] all right steve now follow me[MASK] we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign right there that 's great and hold onto this good luck to you[MASK] no not yet[MASK] <unk> just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target little little bit that 's perfect just perfect[MASK] now zach we[MASK] 're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future[MASK] so here come on up to the front[MASK] all right so now if you 'll see here no no it 's ok[MASK] so[MASK] <unk> describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt go ahead it 's cold[MASK] now the reason it 's cold is that 's it 's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns[MASK] it 's a dry liquid developed by threem it 's perfectly clear it 's odorless it 's colorless[MASK] it 's so safe you could drink this stuff[MASK] and the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates twenty five times faster than water[MASK] right well thanks for coming up[MASK] wait wait steven before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends excellent thank you[MASK] thanks for coming up let 's give him a big round of applause[MASK] so what 's the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer[MASK] now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics that we 'd get him wet that we 'd hurt the books or the computers[MASK] it works because it 's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn 't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away but today it 's most widely used in office buildings in the sprinkler system as[MASK] a fire suppression fluid again it 's perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires doesn 't hurt anything[MASK] but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game[MASK] so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry wouldn 't hurt the court[MASK] our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical one of their r d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer[MASK] while he was doing this[MASK] <unk> noticed an unexpected thing we have a video to show you[MASK] <unk> so you see there it didn 't bounce back now this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing it 's technically called shape retaining property[MASK] now think about your interactions with aluminum foil shape retaining shape retaining is common in metal you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place[MASK] and contrast that with like a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back[MASK] <unk> for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist but doesn 't use a buckle[MASK] taking it a little further if you wove those strips together kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could[MASK] <unk> with roman and his team at the directors bureau to[MASK] <unk> to try to learn about how[MASK] <unk> ten foot pole that can fit in your pocket[MASK]
