 <unk> you may not realize this but there are more bacteria in your body[MASK] than stars in our entire galaxy [MASK] this fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health <unk> [MASK] and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria[MASK] like we program computers[MASK] <unk> now the diagram that you see here i know it looks like some kind of sports play <unk> but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program i developed <unk> [MASK] and like writing software we can print and write dna into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria [MASK] what this program does is[MASK] produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion[MASK] and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize as you 're seeing in this movie [MASK] the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair <unk> [MASK] now what you can 't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules <unk> [MASK] and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off[MASK] <unk> and the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale <unk> but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast [MASK] in larger colonies of bacteria this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other <unk> [MASK] and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen <unk> [MASK] now our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing [MASK] in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density [MASK] you can observe quorum sensing[MASK] <unk> action in this movie <unk> where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density <unk>[MASK] our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins[MASK] as the colony grows outwards this particular movie and experiment we call the supernova because it looks like an exploding star[MASK] <unk> besides programming these beautiful patterns i wondered <unk> what else can we get these bacteria to do <unk> [MASK] and i decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer <unk> [MASK] one of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors <unk> [MASK] this happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access <unk> and so bacteria find these tumors[MASK] <unk> and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive [MASK] we started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit <unk> [MASK] and found that when orally delivered to mice these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors <unk> [MASK] we realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics [MASK] and hence the presence of the tumors <unk> was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine <unk>[MASK] <unk> and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer <unk> [MASK] we went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer <unk> one that is challenging to detect otherwise <unk> [MASK] now since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors <unk> we 've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic[MASK] <unk> molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors and we 've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies <unk> [MASK] altogether <unk> imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer or even other diseases [MASK] our ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research <unk> and to share this vision i worked with artist vik muniz to create the symbol of the universe[MASK] <unk> entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells <unk> ultimately <unk> my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe[MASK] can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research <unk> thank you[MASK]
