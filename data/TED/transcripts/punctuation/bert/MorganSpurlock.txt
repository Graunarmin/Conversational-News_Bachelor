 <unk> i have[MASK] spent the past few years[MASK] putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous <unk> i[MASK] went to prison[MASK] <unk> worked in a coal mine[MASK] dangerous <unk> [MASK] i filmed in war zones difficult and dangerous <unk> and i spent thirty days eating nothing but this[MASK] fun in the beginning little difficult in the middle very dangerous in the end [MASK] in fact most of my career i 've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations[MASK] for the whole goal of trying[MASK] <unk> to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience <unk> [MASK] <unk> so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship <unk> i knew i would want to do something a little different <unk> [MASK] <unk> messages some twitter messages <unk> and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my two thousand and eleven ted talk [MASK] that 's right some lucky individual corporation[MASK] was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity because i 'm sure chris anderson will never let it happen again [MASK] <unk> to buy the naming rights to the talk you 're watching right now [MASK] that at the time didn 't have a title didn 't really have a lot of content and didn 't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be <unk> [MASK] so what you were getting was this your name here presents my ted talk[MASK] that you have no idea what the subject is and depending on the content could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it but that being said <unk> it 's a very good media opportunity[MASK] you know how many people watch these ted talks it[MASK] 's a lot <unk> [MASK] that 's just a working title by the way [MASK] so[MASK] even with that caveat i knew that someone would buy the naming rights now if you 'd have asked me that a year ago i wouldn 't have been able to tell you that with any certainty <unk> but in the new[MASK] <unk> project that i 'm working on my new film we examine the world of marketing advertising <unk> [MASK] and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me [MASK] nothing could ready me for anything as difficult[MASK] or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these[MASK] <unk> you see i had this idea for a movie morgan spurlock [MASK] what i want to do is make a film all about product placement marketing and advertising <unk> where the entire film is funded by product placement marketing and advertising <unk> [MASK] so the movie will be called the greatest movie ever sold so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom from start to finish is branded from[MASK] <unk> we going to have the brand x title sponsor[MASK] <unk> going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore <unk> the greatest car you ever drove from the greatest movie ever sold the greatest drink you 've ever had courtesy of the greatest movie ever sold xavier kochhar so the idea is beyond just showing[MASK] that brands are a part of your life but actually get them to finance the film ms and actually we show the whole process of how does it work the goal of this whole film is transparency <unk> you 're going to see the whole thing take place in <unk>[MASK] <unk> this movie <unk> so that 's the the whole concept the whole film <unk> start to finish <unk> and i would love for ceg to help[MASK] <unk> it happen robert friedman you know it 's funny because when i first hear it it is the ultimate respect[MASK] for an audience guy i don 't know how receptive[MASK] people are going to be to it though xk do you have a perspective i don 't want to use angle because that has a negative connotation but do you know how this is going to play out[MASK] <unk> have a hard time meeting with them but i think it 's certainly worth[MASK] pursuing a couple big really obvious brands xk who knows <unk> maybe by the time your film comes out we look like a bunch of blithering idiots ms what do you think the[MASK] <unk> when you look at the people you deal with mk we 've got some places we can go[MASK] <unk> we want nothing to do with your movie [MASK] ms and just like that one by one all of these companies suddenly disappeared <unk> [MASK] none of them wanted anything to do with this movie i was amazed <unk> they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project and i was blown away because i thought the whole concept the idea of advertising was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible to get as many people to see it as possible especially in today 's world this[MASK] <unk> of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn 't the idea to get that new buzz worthy delivery vehicle that 's going to get that message to the masses [MASK] no that 's what i thought <unk> but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw [MASK] and that flaw[MASK] <unk> was this [MASK] actually no that was not the flaw whatsoever that wouldn 't have been a problem at all [MASK] this would have been fine but what this image represents was the problem see when you do a google image search for transparency this is [MASK] this is one of the first images that comes up so i like the way you roll sergey brin[MASK] <unk> was the problem transparency[MASK] free from pretense or deceit easily detected or seen through readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially concerning business practices that last line being probably the biggest problem <unk> [MASK] you see we hear a lot about transparency these days our politicians say[MASK] <unk> our president says it even our ceo 's say it <unk> but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why[MASK] what else is risky <unk> eating an entire bowl of cool whip that 's[MASK] very risky <unk> [MASK] now when i started talking to companies[MASK] and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said no we want you to tell a story <unk> we want you to tell a[MASK] but we just want to tell our story [MASK] see when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie and there he is giving me the look he often gave me[MASK] he would say son there 's three sides to every story <unk> there 's your story <unk> there 's my story and there 's the real[MASK] <unk> you see with this film we wanted to tell the real story but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that 's only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years[MASK] i realized that i would have to go on my own i 'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies <unk>[MASK] <unk> myself with all of my team <unk> so what you suddenly started to realize or what i started to realize is that when you started having conversations with these companies the idea of understanding your brand is a[MASK] <unk> i have friends who make great big giant hollywood films and i have friends who make little independent films like i make and the friends of mine who make big giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because <unk>[MASK] <unk> of the brand partners that they have and then my friends who make small independent films say well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant hollywood movies and the movie is called [MASK] <unk> i open up my medicine cabinet you will see[MASK] ban deodorant <unk> while anytime i do an interview with someone i can say[MASK] <unk> are you fresh enough for this interview are you ready you look a little nervous i want to help you calm down so[MASK] maybe you should put some one before the interview so we 'll offer one of these fabulous scents whether it 's a floral fusion or a paradise winds they 'll have their chance <unk> we will have have them geared for both male or female[MASK] solid roll on or stick whatever it may be <unk> that 's the[MASK] <unk> the two cent tour <unk> so now i can[MASK] answer any of your questions and give you the five cent tour karen frank we are a smaller brand much like you talked about being a smaller[MASK] movie <unk> we 're very much a challenger brand so we don 't have the budgets that other brands have so doing things like this you know remind people about ban is kind of why were interested in it ms what are[MASK] <unk> is a great word that really spins this category into the positive versus fights odor[MASK] <unk> you fresher longer better freshness more freshness <unk> three times fresher things like that that are[MASK] more of that positive benefit ms and that 's a multi million dollar corporation <unk> [MASK] what about me what about a regular guy i need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular joes they need to tell me about my brand[MASK] <unk> i guess what kind of genre <unk> style i am would be like[MASK] dark glamor <unk> i like a lot of black colors a lot of grays and stuff like that but usually i have an accessory like sunglasses or[MASK] i like crystal and things like that too woman if dan were a brand <unk> he might be a classic[MASK] convertible mercedes benz man two the brand that i am is i would call it[MASK] casual fly woman two part hippie <unk> part yogi part brooklyn girl i don 't know man three i 'm the pet guy <unk> i sell pet toys all over the[MASK] country all over the world so i guess that 's my brand[MASK] <unk> warped little industry[MASK] that 's my brand man four my brand is fedex because i deliver the goods man five failed writer alcoholic brand [MASK] is that something lawyer i 'm[MASK] a lawyer brand tom i 'm[MASK] tom ms well we can 't all be brand tom <unk> but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly[MASK] and what i realized is i needed an expert i needed somebody who could get inside my head somebody who could really help me understand what they call your brand personality <unk>[MASK] and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg they 've helped companies like nestle febreze hallmark discover that brand personality if they could do it for them surely they could do it for me[MASK] <unk> a so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ms these are the people who shape the way i look at the world a tell me about this world ms this[MASK] world i think your world is the world that you live in like people who are around you your friends your family the way you live your life the job you do all those things stemmed and started from one place and for me they stemmed and started with my family in west virginia[MASK] <unk> to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ms it 's like who do i want to be <unk> i like things that are different <unk> i like things that are weird i like weird things a[MASK] tell me about the why phase what does that do for us what is the machete what pupa stage are you in now why is it important to reboot what does[MASK] <unk> the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct <unk> but complementary sides to your brand personality the morgan spurlock brand is a mindful play brand <unk> those are[MASK] <unk> juxtaposed very nicely together and i think there 's almost a paradox with those and i think some companies will just focus on one one of their strengths or or the other instead of focusing on both <unk> most <unk>[MASK] companies tend to and it 's human nature to avoid things that they 're not sure of avoid fear those elements <unk> and you really embrace those and you actually turn them into positives for you and it 's a neat thing to see <unk> what other brands are like that [MASK] <unk> mini from the mini coopers and jetblue now there 's playful brands and mindful brands those things that have come and gone but a playful mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing ms [MASK] a playful mindful brand what is your brand if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity your brand personality what would you be are you an up attribute <unk> are you something that gets the blood flowing or[MASK] are you more of a down attribute are you something that 's a little more calm reserved conservative up[MASK] <unk> attributes are things like being playful [MASK] being fresh like the fresh prince <unk> contemporary adventurous edgy or daring like errol flynn nimble or agile <unk> profane domineering <unk> magical or mystical like gandalf or[MASK] are you more of a down attribute <unk> are you mindful sophisticated like <unk>[MASK] <unk> seven are you established [MASK] <unk> empathetic like the oprah are you reliable stable familiar <unk> safe secure sacred <unk> contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda [MASK] over the course of this film <unk> we had <unk>[MASK] companies who were up and down companies saying no they didn 't want any part of this project they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they would have no control they would have no control over the final[MASK] <unk> but we did get seventeen brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself[MASK] and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn 't be able to tell[MASK] stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind <unk> [MASK] they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they 're using mri 's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing [MASK] <unk> went to san paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising in the entire city for the past five years there 's no billboards there 's no posters there 's no flyers nothing [MASK] and we went to school districts[MASK] where now companies are making their way into cash strapped schools all across america <unk> what 's incredible for me is the projects that i 've gotten the most[MASK] <unk> out of or i 've had the most success in are ones where i 've interacted with things directly and that 's what these brands did <unk> they cut out the middleman they cut out their agencies and said maybe these agencies don 't have my best interest in mind <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to deal directly with the artist i 'm going to work with him to create something different something that 's going to get people thinking that 's going to challenge the way we look at the world [MASK] and how has that been for them has it been successful well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival let 's take a look according to burrelles [MASK] the movie premiered in january and since then and this isn 't even the whole thing we 've had[MASK] <unk> hundred million media impressions for this film <unk> that 's literally covering just like a two and a half week period that 's only online no print no tv the film hasn 't even been distributed yet it 's not even online it 's not even streaming it 's not even been out into other foreign countries yet <unk> [MASK] so ultimately [MASK] this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part [MASK] what i always believe[MASK] <unk> is that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity <unk> i believe that when you push people away from that you 're pushing them more towards failure <unk> [MASK] i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then you 're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged <unk> [MASK] i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare[MASK] <unk> them ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace fear <unk> we 've got to put that bear in a cage [MASK] embrace fear embrace risk [MASK] one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk and ultimately we have to embrace transparency[MASK] <unk> ever a little honesty is going to go a long way and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency [MASK] has been brought to you[MASK] by my good friends <unk>[MASK] who for $ seven thousand one hundred bought the naming rights on ebay[MASK] <unk> turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world[MASK] <unk> i have in my pocket[MASK] a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization the sapling foundation a check for $ seven thousand one hundred <unk> to be applied toward my attendance for next year 's[MASK]
