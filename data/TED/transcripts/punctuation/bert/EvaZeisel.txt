 <unk> from was to still <unk> and i am illustrating still[MASK] <unk> still doing this or that i don 't answer because i 'm not doing things still i 'm doing it like i always did [MASK] i still have[MASK] or did i use the word[MASK] <unk> which is[MASK] called[MASK] to do i have my plans <unk> i have my clients i am doing my work like i always did[MASK] so this takes care[MASK] <unk> i want to show you my work so you know what i am doing and why i am here <unk> this was <unk>[MASK] all of these things were made during the last[MASK] <unk> doing more or less what you see here this is castleton china this was an exhibition[MASK] at the museum of modern art [MASK] this is now for sale at the metropolitan museum this is still at the metropolitan museum now for sale[MASK] <unk> this is a portrait of my daughter and myself these[MASK] were just some of the things[MASK] i call myself a maker of things i don 't call myself an industrial designer[MASK] because i 'm other things industrial designers[MASK] want to make novel things <unk> novelty is a concept[MASK] <unk> industrial design magazine i believe is called [MASK] innovation innovation is not part of the aim of my work [MASK] well <unk> [MASK] <unk> make things more beautiful more elegant more comfortable[MASK] than just the craftsmen do i have so much to say i have to think what i am going to say <unk> [MASK] well to describe our profession otherwise we are actually[MASK] concerned with the playful search for beauty that means the playful search for[MASK] <unk> beauty was called the first activity of man sarah[MASK] smith <unk> who was a mathematics professor at mit wrote the playful search for beauty[MASK] was man 's first[MASK] activity[MASK] that all useful qualities and all material[MASK] <unk> qualities were developed from the[MASK] playful search[MASK] for beauty these are tiles the word playful is a necessary aspect of our work[MASK] because actually one of our problems is that[MASK] <unk> lovely things[MASK] throughout all of life <unk> [MASK] and this for me is now seventy five years <unk> so how can you without drying up [MASK] make things with the same pleasure as a gift to others[MASK] <unk> for so long the playful is therefore an important part of our[MASK] quality as designer [MASK] let me tell you some[MASK] about my life as i said <unk> i started to do these things[MASK] <unk> exhibition in the united states was at the sesquicentennial exhibition in[MASK] <unk> took me[MASK] through many countries and showed me a great part of the world <unk> [MASK] this is not that they took me the work didn 't take me[MASK] i[MASK] made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world[MASK] <unk> i was incredibly curious to see the world <unk> and i made all these things <unk> [MASK] which then finally did take me to see many countries[MASK] and many cultures <unk> i started[MASK] as an apprentice[MASK] <unk> and this taught me what the[MASK] guild system was[MASK] in middle ages the guild system that means when i was an apprentice i had to[MASK] apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master[MASK] <unk> there was a[MASK] traditional[MASK] hierarchy of master journeyman and learned worker[MASK] <unk> as an apprentice was very primitive that means i had to actually learn[MASK] every aspect of making[MASK] pottery pottery by hand we mashed the clay with our feet[MASK] when it came from the[MASK] <unk> hillside <unk> after that it had to be kneaded it had to then go in kind of a mangle <unk> and then finally[MASK] it was prepared for the[MASK] for the[MASK] throwing <unk> and there i really worked as an apprentice [MASK] <unk> the time and finally i had received a document that i had[MASK] accomplished my apprenticeship successfully that i had behaved morally[MASK] <unk> i also got at the time a workbook which explained my[MASK] <unk> and i still have that workbook first i set up a shop in my own garden <unk> and made pottery which i sold[MASK] on the marketplace in budapest <unk> and there i was sitting <unk> and[MASK] my <unk>[MASK] i didn 't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today but my boyfriend and[MASK] <unk> i sat at the market and sold the pots my mother thought that this was not very proper <unk> so she sat with us[MASK] to[MASK] add propriety to this activity [MASK] however after a while there was a new factory being built in budapest a pottery[MASK] <unk> factory a large one <unk> and i visited it with several ladies and asked all sorts of questions of the director then[MASK] the director asked me why do you ask all these questions i said i also have a pottery [MASK] so he asked me <unk> could he please visit me and then[MASK] finally he did and explained to me that what i did[MASK] <unk> now in my shop was an anachronism that the industrial revolution had broken out and that i rather should join[MASK] the factory there he made an art department for me[MASK] where i worked for several months <unk> however <unk> everybody in the factory spent his time[MASK] <unk> at the art department the director there said there were several women[MASK] casting and producing my designs now in molds <unk> and this was sold also to[MASK] everybody concerned himself much more with the art department that means with my work than making toilets <unk> so finally <unk>[MASK] they got a letter from the center from the bank who owned the factory saying make[MASK] <unk> and that was my end <unk> so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman and journeymen also take their satchel[MASK] and go[MASK] to see the world <unk> so as a journeyman i put an ad into the paper[MASK] that i had studied that i was a down to earth potter 's journeyman and i was looking for a job as[MASK] <unk> got several answers and[MASK] i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically i thought halfway to america <unk> [MASK] and that was in hamburg [MASK] then i first took this job in hamburg <unk> at an[MASK] art pottery where everything was done[MASK] <unk> and so i worked in a shop[MASK] where there were several[MASK] potters <unk> and the first day i was coming to take[MASK] my place at the[MASK] turntable there were three or four turntables and one of[MASK] <unk> who smelled very bad so i doused him in[MASK] cologne every day <unk> which he thought was very nice <unk> and therefore[MASK] he brought bread and butter[MASK] every day which i had to eat out of courtesy the first day i came to work in this shop there was on my[MASK] <unk> my wheel a surprise for me my colleagues had thoughtfully put[MASK] on the[MASK] wheel where i was supposed to work a very nicely modeled[MASK] <unk> they were very i finally[MASK] was now accepted <unk> and worked there for some six months[MASK] this was my first job [MASK] <unk> go on like this you will be here till midnight[MASK] <unk> i have to tell you that within five minutes i will talk very fast and[MASK] actually my work took me to many countries because i[MASK] used my work to fill my curiosity <unk> and[MASK] <unk> i was finally there although i had nothing to do i was a foreign expert <unk> i became art director of the china and glass industry <unk> [MASK] and eventually[MASK] <unk> purges at the beginning of stalin 's purges i didn 't know that[MASK] hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested so i was arrested[MASK] quite early in stalin 's purges <unk> and spent sixteen months[MASK] in[MASK] a russian prison[MASK] that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin 's life <unk> this was a very dangerous[MASK] accusation <unk> and if[MASK] this is the end of my five minutes i want to tell you that i actually[MASK] <unk> i survived and i 'm here <unk> and since this is the end of the five minutes i will moderator tell me when your last trip to russia was[MASK] invited me they found out that i had worked in ' thirty three at this factory <unk> and they came to my[MASK] studio in rockland county and brought the fifteen of their[MASK] artists to visit me here <unk> and they invited myself to come to the russian factory last summer[MASK] <unk> july to make some dishes <unk> [MASK] design some dishes <unk> and since i don 't like to travel alone <unk> they also invited[MASK] my[MASK] daughter son in law and granddaughter <unk> so we had a lovely trip to see[MASK] russia today which is not a very pleasant and happy view[MASK] <unk> i am now <unk> if this is the end[MASK]
