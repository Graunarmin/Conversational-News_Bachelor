 <unk> the reason i put this up here is because when i was in africa[MASK] last year <unk> my wife and i were driving around we had this wonderful guide who showed us something[MASK] that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the[MASK] fascination that comes with the design of animals it turns out that in about the 1880s the missionaries came to africa[MASK] to spread the word of christianity to teach english to the natives <unk> and they brought blackboards and chalk and i 'd like you to imagine that[MASK] <unk> that 's a blackboard and i just used some chalk on there <unk> and[MASK] they brought quite a bit of this stuff but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk <unk> and[MASK] this is a real crisis for them <unk> and[MASK] that 's where the hyena comes in the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world[MASK] <unk> enables the hyena to essentially[MASK] eat bones now <unk> the end product of that action[MASK] is up on the board here what the missionaries would do is they 'd walk around[MASK] and they 'd pick up hyena shit <unk> and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great[MASK] <unk> not what i 'm here to talk about but it is[MASK] a fascinating[MASK] aspect of animal design what i 'm here to talk about is the camel <unk> when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about [MASK] i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel [MASK] and we were in the desert[MASK] in a small jeep there were four of us two bedouin drivers <unk>[MASK] you can just imagine this expanse is <unk> an ocean of sand one hundred and five degrees one water bottle <unk> [MASK] and we were driving[MASK] in what they told us was their very very best jeep didn 't look like it to me and as we started to[MASK] <unk> go through the desert[MASK] <unk> the jeep broke down the guys got out they put the hood up they started working under the hood [MASK] got it going again about a hundred yards it broke down this went on about <unk> 6 7 times we were getting more and more alarmed we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert <unk> and[MASK] eventually <unk> our worst nightmare happened they flooded the engine <unk> and they said ah no problem <unk> we just get out and walk[MASK] <unk> and sure enough about half a mile we came over the crest of this hill and there was a huge gathering of bedouin with their camels the guy went up and started[MASK] dickering and ten dollars later we had four camels <unk> they went down like elevators <unk> we got on them <unk> they went back up and the bedouin[MASK] <unk> got behind each of the camels with a little whip <unk> and[MASK] they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping and if you 've ever been on a camel it is a very very uncomfortable ride [MASK] there 's also one other aspect about these camels about every ten steps <unk> they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg [MASK] so we kept on going and this camel camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg[MASK] <unk> and eventually three miles later we arrived at our destination where a jeep was supposed to meet us <unk> and the camels come down again like elevators <unk> [MASK] we sort of clumsily get off and they <unk> obviously try to take another chunk out of my leg <unk> and i 've developed a very[MASK] wonderful relationship with this creature by this point <unk> and i 've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch and[MASK] much meaner by the way than the bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell[MASK] <unk> think we want to be bringing a camel and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel[MASK] <unk> so i did the next best thing [MASK] i went to the washington zoo <unk> richard said i want you to get up close and personal with this camel <unk> [MASK] i want you to inspect its mouth look at its teeth go underneath it go above it[MASK] go around it <unk> pull its tail up take a look in there <unk> i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can so i got a[MASK] national geographic film crew <unk> we went down there <unk> and[MASK] i took one look at this camel <unk> it is a two thousand pound creature who is[MASK] <unk> if you 've ever seen a two thousand pound camel in rut it is a scary scary thing to behold <unk> and if[MASK] richard thought i was getting in the ring with that camel <unk> someone was smoking bedouin high grade so we[MASK] got as close to it as possible and i 'm going to share this chris if you want to roll this film then i 'm going to show you a little bit[MASK] <unk> more about the design of camels[MASK] <unk> 're similar to seals in the way[MASK] <unk> what i didn 't show you[MASK] <unk> you got that swinging thing going <unk> well[MASK] and you 're glad i didn 't show you this one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design[MASK] is that its penis points backwards that way the camel can dip its tail in the in the stream <unk> and just whacker the entire[MASK] area around him and that 's how he really marks his territory <unk> now <unk> what you also didn 't see was that[MASK] and you may have noticed in the pen beside him[MASK] and by the way the camel 's name is suki[MASK] <unk> the pen beside him is jasmine jasmine has been his mate for some time but on this particular occasion it was very very clear[MASK] that[MASK] as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it <unk> and so we started thinking well <unk>[MASK] if poor old suki is in search of a mate <unk> what would suki[MASK] <unk> show you another film but before i do i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort <unk>[MASK] <unk> of the suv of the sand <unk> the ship of the desert it 's so vital <unk>[MASK] to to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found largely mongolia and sahara <unk> that there are one hundred and sixty words in arabic to describe[MASK] <unk> and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it 's certainly been like no committee i 've ever been on so[MASK] here 's here 's what suki would do in search of a mate can you roll it please[MASK] <unk> i just want to leave you with one last thought which is probably the most important thing to take away <unk> [MASK] <unk> the animal are pretty lucky creatures because by and large <unk> we really don 't have to[MASK] adapt to our environment we adapt our environment to us and we 've seen that repeatedly through this conference not just this year but in past years <unk> [MASK] but this creature that you 've just seen[MASK] ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting i think when you look at the animal kingdom that is one of the most remarkable things [MASK] it doesn 't have an environment that adapts to it <unk> it has to adapt to the environment [MASK] ricky thank you very much for[MASK]
