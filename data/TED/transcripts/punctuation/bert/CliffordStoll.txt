 <unk> i 'm delighted to be here i 'm honored[MASK] by the invitation and thanks i would love to talk about stuff that i 'm interested in but unfortunately i suspect that what i 'm interested in won 't interest many other people[MASK] first off my badge says i 'm an astronomer i would love to talk about my astronomy <unk> but i suspect that the number of[MASK] <unk> people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter 's upper atmosphere are the number of people who 'd fit in a bus shelter <unk> so[MASK] i 'm not going to talk about that [MASK] it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six and one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven when a computer hacker is breaking into our our systems[MASK] <unk> and i caught the guys and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb and stealing information and selling it and i 'd love to talk about that and it 'd be fun[MASK] but <unk> twenty years later[MASK] <unk> i find computer security frankly to be kind of boring <unk> it 's tedious i 'm[MASK] the first time you do something <unk> it 's science[MASK] <unk> going to talk about that [MASK] nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book silicon snake oil [MASK] or my second book <unk> <unk> nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don 't belong in schools <unk> [MASK] i feel that there 's a massive[MASK] and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools <unk> my idea is <unk>[MASK] get them out of schools <unk> and keep them out of schools[MASK] and i 'd love to talk about this <unk> but i think the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom that[MASK] it doesn 't need much talking about but i guess i may be very wrong about that and everything[MASK] <unk> else that i 've said so don 't go back and read my dissertation it probably has lies in it as well <unk> having said that i outlined my talk about[MASK] five minutes ago and if you look at it over here <unk> the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future i 'm supposed to talk about the future yes[MASK] <unk> to talk about the future is bizarre because i 've got gray hair and so [MASK] it 's kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be if you really want to know about the future [MASK] don 't ask a technologist a scientist a[MASK] <unk> don 't ask somebody who 's writing code no[MASK] if you want to know what society 's going to be like in twenty years ask a kindergarten teacher [MASK] they know [MASK] in fact don 't ask just any kindergarten teacher ask an experienced one they 're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation[MASK] <unk> i suspect do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there [MASK] but to me things aren 't the future what i ask myself is what 's society is going to be like <unk> when[MASK] <unk> the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and and[MASK] <unk> have never gone bowling together <unk> change is happening <unk> and the change that is happening is not one that is in software but[MASK] that 's not what i 'm going to talk about i 'd love to talk about it it 'd be fun but[MASK] i want to talk about what i 'm doing now what am i doing now <unk> oh the other thing that i think i 'd like to talk about is right over here <unk> right over here[MASK] <unk> what i 'd like to talk about is one sided things i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side because[MASK] i love mobius loops <unk> i not only love mobius loops but[MASK] i 'm one of the very few people if[MASK] not the only person in the world that makes klein bottles <unk> <unk> right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over this is a klein bottle for those[MASK] <unk> of you in the audience who know you roll your eyes and say yup i know all about it it 's one sided <unk> it 's a bottle whose inside is its outside it has zero volume and <unk>[MASK] <unk> has wonderful properties if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together you get one of these and i make them out of glass[MASK] and i 'd love to talk to you about this <unk> but i don 't[MASK] <unk> in ted of course stands for design just two weeks ago i made you know i 've been making[MASK] small <unk> medium and big klein bottles for the trade but[MASK] what i 've just made and i 'm delighted to show you first time in public here[MASK] this is a klein bottle wine bottle [MASK] which [MASK] although in four dimensions it shouldn 't be able to hold any fluid at all it 's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions [MASK] it can hold fluids[MASK] <unk> it 's highly[MASK] that one 's the cool one that was a month of my life <unk> but[MASK] although i would love to talk about topology with with you <unk> i 'm not going to[MASK] <unk> passed away last summer [MASK] had collected photographs of me as mothers will do <unk> could somebody put this this guy up [MASK] and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me <unk> standing well <unk> sitting in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine in front of[MASK] <unk> when i was working at the electronic music studio as a technician <unk> repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at suny buffalo <unk> and[MASK] wow way back machine <unk> and i said to myself <unk> oh yeah and it sent me back[MASK] <unk> another picture that she had a picture of me <unk> this guy over here of course is me <unk> this man is robert moog <unk> [MASK] the inventor of the moog synthesizer who passed away this past august [MASK] robert moog was a generous kind person extraordinarily competent engineer[MASK] <unk> a musician[MASK] who took time from his life to teach me <unk> a sophomore a freshman at suny buffalo <unk> he 'd come up from trumansburg[MASK] to teach me[MASK] not just about the moog synthesizer <unk> but we 'd be sitting there <unk> i 'm studying physics at the time this is one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine seventy seventy one [MASK] we 're studying physics i 'm studying physics and he 's saying that 's a[MASK] good thing to do don 't get caught up in electronic music if you 're doing physics[MASK] <unk> he 'd come up and spend[MASK] hours and hours with me <unk> [MASK] he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school [MASK] in the background my bicycle i realize that this picture was taken at a friend 's living room <unk> bob moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show greg flint and i things about this we sat around talking about fourier[MASK] <unk> modulation transfer functions stuff like this[MASK] bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog [MASK] and i[MASK] 'll just say what i 'm about to do <unk> [MASK] what i 'm about to do i hope you can recognize that[MASK] <unk> i can get to this place over here right kids kids is what i 'm going to talk about is that okay <unk> it says kids over here <unk> that 's what i 'd like to[MASK] <unk> feel that the best way i can help out anything[MASK] is to[MASK] help out very very locally <unk> so ph d this and[MASK] degree there and the yadda yadda i was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago and one of them <unk> several of them would come up to me[MASK] <unk> so into kids and all this stuff <unk> how come you ain 't over here on the front lines put your money where you mouth is [MASK] is true is true <unk> i teach eighth grade science four days a week not just showing up every now and[MASK] <unk> i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do not just show up to class every now and then teach a solid week okay i 'm teaching three quarters time but[MASK] good enough one of the things that i 've done for my science students is to tell them look i 'm going to teach you <unk> college level physics no calculus i 'll cut out that you won 't need to know trig[MASK] <unk> going to be doing genuine physics and that 's one of the things i thought i 'd do right now [MASK] oh <unk> before i even turn that on one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class this is through the lens and one of the things we used a lens for was[MASK] <unk> to measure the speed of light my students in el cerrito[MASK] with my help of course and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope measured the speed of light we were off by twenty five percent <unk> [MASK] how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light [MASK] in addition to that we 've measured the speed of sound i 'd love to measure the speed of light here <unk> i was all set to do it and i was thinking aw man i was just going to impose upon impose upon the powers that be and measure[MASK] <unk> all set to do it i 'm all set to do it [MASK] but then it turns out that to set up here <unk> you have like ten minutes to set up and there 's no time to do it so next time <unk> maybe[MASK] i 'll measure the speed of light but meanwhile let 's measure the speed of sound well [MASK] the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo but probably[MASK] one of my students ariel [ unclear ] [MASK] <unk> could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency[MASK] times the wavelength[MASK] of any wave is a constant <unk> when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down so [MASK] if we have[MASK] a wave here over here <unk> that 's what 's interesting[MASK] as the pitch goes up things get closer pitch goes down <unk> things stretch[MASK] <unk> out right [MASK] this is simple physics <unk> all of you know this from eighth grade remember[MASK] what they didn 't tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and i wish they had was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength[MASK] <unk> of sound or light [MASK] you get a constant and that constant is the speed of sound so in order to measure the speed of sound all i 've got to do[MASK] is know its frequency well that 's easy <unk> i 've got a frequency counter right here <unk> set it up to[MASK] around a above a above a there 's an a more or less now <unk> so i know the frequency it 's one[MASK] <unk> its wavelength all i need now is to flip on another beam <unk> [MASK] and the bottom beam is me talking right <unk> so anytime i talk you 'd see it on the screen i[MASK] 'll put it over here <unk> and as i move this away[MASK] from the source you 'll notice[MASK] the spiral the slinky moves[MASK] <unk> the wave coming out this way those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me[MASK] to measure the wavelength all i need to do is measure the distance from here[MASK] one full wave over to here <unk> from here to here is the wavelength of sound so i 'll put a[MASK] measuring tape here <unk> measuring tape here[MASK] <unk> here <unk> move it back over to here <unk> i 've moved the microphone twenty centimeters zero point two meters from here[MASK] <unk> the wavelength was zero point two meters <unk> let 's figure out what this is [MASK] one point seven six[MASK] times zero point two over here is three hundred and fifty two meters per second[MASK] if you look it up in the book it 's really[MASK] really three hundred and forty three but here with kludgy material and lousy drink we 've been able to measure[MASK] the speed of sound to not bad pretty good all of which comes to what i wanted to say go back to[MASK] <unk> the vietnam war was going on and i 'm like oh my god i 'm studying physics landau lipschitz <unk> resnick and halliday i 'm going home for a midterm a riot 's going on on campus there 's a riot[MASK] hey elmo 's done [MASK] off[MASK] <unk> there 's a riot going on on campus <unk> and the police are chasing me <unk> [MASK] right <unk> i 'm walking across campus <unk> cop comes and looks at me and says you you 're a student [MASK] pulls out a gun goes boom <unk> and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi can goes <unk>[MASK] i get a breath of tear gas and i can 't breathe this cop comes after me with a rifle he wants to clunk me over the head[MASK] <unk> i can i duck into[MASK] hayes hall it 's one of these bell tower buildings the cop 's chasing me chasing me up the first floor <unk> second floor third floor <unk> chases me into this room[MASK] the entranceway to the bell tower <unk> [MASK] i slam the door behind me climb up go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking and i 'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period [MASK] i keep climbing up go back i go to a place where a dowel splits off[MASK] clock <unk> clock clock clock the time 's going backwards because i 'm inside of it i 'm thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity [MASK] i climb up and there 's this place way in the back that you climb up this wooden ladder i pop up the top <unk> and there 's a cupola a dome one of these ten foot domes <unk> i 'm looking out and i 'm seeing the cops bashing students ' heads <unk> shooting tear gas and watching students throwing bricks[MASK] then i remember what[MASK] my english teacher in high school said <unk> namely that[MASK] when they cast bells they write inscriptions on them <unk> so i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells and i look at it <unk> [MASK] i 'm asking myself why am i[MASK]
