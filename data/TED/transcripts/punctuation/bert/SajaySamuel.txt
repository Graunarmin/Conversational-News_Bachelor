 <unk> forty million americans[MASK] are indebted for their passage to the new economy <unk> too poor to pay their way through college they now owe lenders[MASK] more than one trillion us dollars they do find what jobs they can get[MASK] <unk> to pay off a debt that is secured on their person in america <unk> even a[MASK] bankrupt gambler[MASK] gets a second chance <unk> but it is nearly impossible[MASK] for an american to get discharged their student loan debts <unk> [MASK] once upon a time in america[MASK] <unk> going to college did not mean graduating with debt <unk> my friend paul 's father graduated from colorado state university[MASK] on the gi bill [MASK] for his generation higher education was free or almost free because it was thought of as a public good [MASK] <unk> when paul also graduated from colorado state university he paid for his english degree[MASK] by working part time [MASK] thirty years ago <unk> higher education tuition was affordable reasonable <unk> and what debts you accumulated you paid off by graduation date not anymore <unk> [MASK] paul 's daughter followed[MASK] in his footsteps but with one difference when she graduated five years ago it was with a whopping debt[MASK] <unk> students like kate have to take on a loan[MASK] because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable for many if not most american families [MASK] but so what getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off[MASK] with the increased income that you earned from it <unk> but that 's where the rubber meets the road[MASK] even a college grad[MASK] earned ten percent more in two thousand and one than she did in two thousand and thirteen so [MASK] tuition costs up public funding down <unk> family incomes diminished <unk> personal incomes[MASK] weak is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must[MASK] <unk> make their student loan payments [MASK] the worst of times[MASK] can be the best of times because certain truths flash up in ways that you can 't ignore <unk> i want to speak of three of them today [MASK] one point two trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy[MASK] <unk> all of us talk about education just as the economists do now as an investment[MASK] that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work [MASK] as an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily [MASK] <unk> world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines the language is peppered[MASK] with barbarisms teachers are called service providers students are called consumers [MASK] sociology and shakespeare and soccer and and science all of these are content [MASK] student debt is profitable only not on you[MASK] <unk> your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry [MASK] the two <unk> 800 pound gorillas of which sallie mae and navient[MASK] posted last year a combined profit of one point two billion dollars <unk> [MASK] and just like home mortgages student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and[MASK] <unk> and sold on wall street <unk> and colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans[MASK] profit twice <unk> once from your tuition and then again from the interest on debt [MASK] with all that money to be made are we surprised that some in the higher education business[MASK] have begun to engage in false advertising[MASK] <unk> in bait and switch [MASK] in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate [MASK] diplomas are a brand [MASK] many years ago my teacher wrote [MASK] when students are treated as consumers they 're made prisoners of addiction and envy [MASK] <unk> as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iphone so also people can be sold more and more education[MASK] college is the new high school we already say that but why stop there people can be upsold on certifications and <unk>[MASK] master 's degrees <unk> doctoral degrees [MASK] higher education is also[MASK] <unk> marketed as a status object [MASK] buy a degree much like you do a lexus of a louis vuitton bag to distinguish yourself from others <unk> so you can be the object of envy of others <unk> [MASK] diplomas are a brand <unk> but these truths[MASK] are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch <unk> there is not a day that goes by[MASK] <unk> college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator to a middle class life [MASK] and the usual evidence offered is the college premium a college grad[MASK] who makes on average fifty six percent more than a high school grad let 's look at that number more carefully because on the face of it it seems to belie[MASK] <unk> the stories we all hear about college grads working as[MASK] baristas and cashiers [MASK] of one hundred people who enroll in any form of post secondary education forty five do not complete it in a timely fashion for a number of reasons including financial [MASK] of the fifty five that do graduate two will remain unemployed <unk> and another eighteen are[MASK] <unk> college grads earn more than high school grads but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college [MASK] now even economists admit[MASK] going to college[MASK] pays off for only those who complete it <unk> but that 's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone for decades[MASK] <unk> workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced[MASK] and had they received as they should have [MASK] then going to college would have been a bad investment for many college premium <unk> i think it 's a high school discount [MASK] two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job and the future for them[MASK] <unk> doesn 't look particularly promising in fact it 's downright bleak <unk> and it is they who are going to suffer[MASK] the most punishing forms of student debt <unk> [MASK] and it is they curiously and sadly who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing <unk> [MASK] that 's not just cynical marketing that 's cruel so what do we do[MASK] <unk> do what if students and parents[MASK] treated higher education[MASK] as a consumer product <unk> [MASK] everybody else seems to [MASK] then like any other consumer product you would demand to know what you 're paying for when[MASK] you buy medicines <unk> you get a list of side effects <unk> when you buy a higher educational[MASK] <unk> you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose make informed choices <unk> [MASK] when you buy a car it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect who knows what to expect from a degree say in[MASK] canadian studies <unk> there is such a thing by the way [MASK] what if there was an app for that [MASK] one that linked up the cost of a major to the[MASK] <unk> expected income let 's call it income based tuition <unk> or ibt one of you make this [MASK] discover your reality there[MASK] are three advantages three benefits to income based tuition [MASK] any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major <unk> such informed users are unlikely[MASK] <unk> to fall victim to the huckster 's ploy to the sales pitch <unk> [MASK] but also to choose wisely <unk> why would anybody pay more for college than let 's say fifteen percent of the additional income they earn there[MASK] 's a second benefit to income based tuition by tying the cost to the income [MASK] college administrators would be forced to manage costs better to find innovative[MASK] <unk> ways to do so for instance all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major[MASK] that is manifestly unfair <unk> and should change [MASK] an engineering student[MASK] uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student[MASK] <unk> but the philosophy student as a consequence is subsidizing the engineering student <unk> who then by the way goes on and earns more money <unk> why should two people buy <unk>[MASK] <unk> the same product <unk> pay the same but one person receive half or a third of the service [MASK] in fact college grads <unk> some majors [MASK] pay twenty five percent of their income servicing their student debt <unk> while others pay five percent [MASK] <unk> if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly [MASK] now of course all this data and one of you is going to do this right <unk> all this data has to be well designed <unk> maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies [MASK] we know about statistics right [MASK] but be that as
