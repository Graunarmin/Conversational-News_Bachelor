 <unk> tell you about[MASK] why i became a sculptor <unk> [MASK] and you may think that sculptors well they deal with meta they deal with objects <unk> they deal with[MASK] <unk> what i care about most is[MASK] making space and that 's what i 've called this talk making space [MASK] space that exists within us [MASK] and without us so when i was[MASK] a child i don 't know how many of you grew up in the ' 50s but i was sent upstairs for an enforced rest[MASK] 's a really bad idea <unk> i mean after lunch you 're you know you 're six and you want to[MASK] go and climb a tree <unk> but i had to go upstairs this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old balcony so it was incredibly hot <unk> [MASK] small and light [MASK] and i had to lie there it[MASK] was ridiculous but anyway for some reason i promised myself that i wasn 't going to move[MASK] <unk> that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do [MASK] and there i was lying there in this tiny space hot <unk> dark claustrophobic[MASK] <unk> behind my eyes <unk> but it was really weird like after this went on for days weeks[MASK] <unk> that space would get bigger and darker and cooler[MASK] until i really looked forward to that half an hour[MASK] of enforced immobility and rest <unk> and i really looked forward[MASK] to going to that place of darkness do[MASK] <unk> if we do something completely different can we all just close our eyes for a minute now this isn 't going to be freaky it isn 't some cultic thing it 's just [MASK] it 's just i just would like us all to go there so i 'm going to do it too we 'll all be there together <unk> so close your eyes for a minute [MASK] here we are in a space <unk> the subjective collective space[MASK] of the darkness of the body[MASK] <unk> i think of this as the place of imagination [MASK] of potential <unk> but what are its qualities <unk> [MASK] it is objectless there are no things in it [MASK] it is dimensionless it is limitless it is[MASK] that 's the space that i think[MASK] sculpture which is a bit of a paradox sculpture that is about making material propositions[MASK] but i think that 's the space[MASK] that sculpture can connect us with [MASK] so imagine we 're in the middle of america <unk> you 're asleep <unk> [MASK] you wake up[MASK] and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag you can see[MASK] for seventy miles <unk> [MASK] this is a dry lake bed [MASK] i was young <unk> [MASK] i 'd just finished art school <unk> i wanted to do something that was working directly with the world <unk> [MASK] directly with place this was a wonderful place[MASK] <unk> it was it was a place where you could imagine that you were the[MASK] the first person to be there it was a place where[MASK] nothing very much had happened anyway <unk> bear with me <unk> i picked up a[MASK] threw it as far as i was[MASK] <unk> i then cleared all the stones within that radius and made a a pile [MASK] and that was the pile by the way <unk> and then i stood on the pile <unk> [MASK] and threw all of those rocks out again <unk> [MASK] and here is[MASK] <unk> doesn 't look very different from when he when he started [MASK] laughter what 's all the fuss about in fact chris was worried and said look don 't show them that slide because they 're just going to think you 're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn 't do much [MASK] but the fact is this is[MASK] evidence of a living body on other bodies[MASK] <unk> rocks that have been the subject of[MASK] geological formation <unk> erosion <unk> the action of time on objects <unk> [MASK] this is a place in a way that i just would like you to in a way look at differently[MASK] because of this event that has happened in it a human event and in general it just asks us to look again[MASK] at this world <unk> so different from in a way <unk> the world that we have been sharing with each other the technological world [MASK] to look again at the elemental world [MASK] the elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together <unk> the darkness of the body[MASK] <unk> i wanted to start again with that environment <unk> the environment of the intimate <unk> subjective space that each of us lives in [MASK] but from the other side of appearance <unk> [MASK] so here is a[MASK] daily activity of the studio you can see i don 't do much i 'm just standing there again with my eyes closed <unk> [MASK] <unk> this is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time can we[MASK] map[MASK] that space <unk> using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays <unk> [MASK] taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit <unk> but in complete reversal[MASK] of in a way the most traditional greek[MASK] <unk> idea of pointing in the old days they used to take a lump of[MASK] pentelic marble and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin <unk> the appearance <unk> what aristotle[MASK] defined as the distinction between substance and appearance <unk> the thing that makes things visible [MASK] but here we 're working from the other side [MASK] or can we do it[MASK] <unk> an exclusive membrane this is a lead case made around[MASK] the space that my body occupied <unk> but it 's now void this is a work called learning to see it 's[MASK] a bit of <unk> [MASK] well we could call it night[MASK] <unk> that we don 't know about <unk> dark matter [MASK] placed in space anyway <unk> another version of a human space in space at large but i don 't know if you can see the eyes are[MASK] indicated they 're closed it 's called learning to see because it 's about[MASK] an object that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that[MASK] <unk> vision or connection with the darkness of the body that i see as a space of potential <unk> [MASK] can we do it another way <unk> using the language of particles around a nucleus <unk> and talk about the body[MASK] as an energy center no longer about statues no longer having to take that duty of standing the standing of a human body <unk> or the standing of a statue release[MASK] <unk> it allow it to be[MASK] an energy field a space in space that talks about human human life [MASK] between becoming an entropy[MASK] as a sort of concentration of attention [MASK] a human place of possibility in space at large [MASK] is there another way[MASK] dark matter now placed[MASK] against a horizon <unk> if minds live in bodies if bodies live in clothes and then in rooms and then[MASK] in buildings and then in cities [MASK] do they also have a final skin and is that[MASK] <unk> trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon <unk> [MASK] can we use <unk> in a way <unk> a body[MASK] as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of <unk>[MASK] as it is lived as[MASK] <unk> as i am standing here in front of you[MASK] trying to feel and make a connection[MASK] in this space time that we are sharing [MASK] can we use at it were the memory of a body [MASK] of a human space in space to catalyze an experience <unk> again <unk> firsthand experience of elemental time [MASK] human time[MASK] industrial time <unk> tested against the time of the tides in which these memories of[MASK] a particular body that could be any body <unk> multiplied as in the time of[MASK] mechanical reproduction many times <unk> placed over three square miles[MASK] <unk> in different conditions of day and night <unk> you can see this work it 's on on the mouth of the mersey just outside liverpool <unk> [MASK] and there you can see what a liverpool sea looks like on a typical afternoon <unk> [MASK] the pieces appear and disappear <unk> but maybe more importantly this is just looking north from the center of the installation[MASK] they create a field a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies[MASK] in a kind of relation a relation with each other[MASK] and a relation with that limit <unk> the edge <unk> the horizon [MASK] just moving[MASK] <unk> the first body <unk> the biological body with the second the body of architecture and the built environment <unk> this is a work called room for the great australian desert [MASK] it 's in an undefined location and i 've never published where it is it 's an object for the[MASK] <unk> the darkness of the body <unk> now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy a crouching[MASK] body there 's a hole[MASK] at the anus <unk> penis level there are holes at ears there are no holes at the eyes there 's a slot for the mouth <unk> it 's two and a half inches thick <unk> concrete[MASK] <unk> this is just simply asking again as if we had arrived[MASK] for the first time what is the relationship of the human project to time and[MASK] <unk> taking that idiom of as it were the darkness of the body transferred[MASK] to architecture can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor [MASK] and use its systolic diastolic[MASK] smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative[MASK] for a journey through[MASK] <unk> space light and darkness <unk> this is a work of[MASK] some proportion and some weight[MASK] that makes the body into a city an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected[MASK] and that allow certain visual access at certain places[MASK] <unk> the[MASK] last work that i just wanted to share with you is blind light which is perhaps[MASK] the most open work <unk> [MASK] and in a conference of radical openness i think maybe this is as radical as i get <unk> [MASK] using light and water vapor as my materials [MASK] here is a box[MASK] filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure with a cloud[MASK] and with very bright light <unk> as you walk towards the <unk> ever open threshold you disappear <unk> [MASK] both to yourselves[MASK] and to others if you hold your hand out in front of you you can 't see it if you look down[MASK] <unk> down you can 't see your feet <unk> you are now consciousness[MASK] without an object freed from the dimensionful and measured[MASK] way in which life links us to the obligatory[MASK] <unk> but this is a space that is actually[MASK] filled with people disembodied voices and out of that ambient[MASK] environment <unk> when people come close to your own[MASK] body zone very close they appear to you as representations <unk> when they appear close to the edge <unk> they are[MASK] <unk> representations in which the viewers have become the viewed[MASK]
