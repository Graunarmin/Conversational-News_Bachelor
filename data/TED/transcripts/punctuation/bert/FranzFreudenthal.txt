 <unk> the most complex problems in our time[MASK] can be solved with simple techniques <unk> if we are able to dream [MASK] as a child <unk> i discovered that creativity is the key to cross[MASK] from[MASK] dreams to reality [MASK] i learned this from my grandmother dr ruth tichauer [MASK] a jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the andes [MASK] that[MASK] is how i grew up <unk> encouraged to see beyond any limitation <unk> [MASK] so part of my education included helping her in remote[MASK] indigenous communities i cherish those memories because they helped me to understand life outside the city [MASK] a life[MASK] with a lot of possibilities <unk> without barriers <unk> as language or culture <unk> during those trips my grandmother used to recite a kipling poem[MASK] go and find it go and look behind the mountains <unk> something lost[MASK] behind the mountains <unk> lost and waiting for you go [MASK] in the coming years i became a medical student [MASK] one of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind[MASK] <unk> of heart disease <unk> there 's a part of this problem[MASK] i think i can solve the part of this problem[MASK] i have spent my life my life working on the problem starts[MASK] during pregnancy <unk> the fetus needs to survive inside the mother[MASK] <unk> depends on communication[MASK] between the systemic and the pulmonary blood at the moment of birth this communication needs to stop [MASK] if it doesn 't close the baby has a hole in the heart it is caused by prematurity and[MASK] <unk> we know today[MASK] is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes <unk> [MASK] as you can see in the chart the frequency[MASK] of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude[MASK] <unk> seem desperate to breathe to close the hole major surgery used to be the only solution [MASK] one night my friend malte were camping in the amazon region [MASK] the only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch then came a moment of inspiration[MASK] <unk> used the branch as a mold for our first invention the holes in children 's hearts can be closed with it a[MASK] coil is a piece of wire wrapped[MASK] onto itself it maybe doesn 't look so fancy to you now <unk> but that was our first successful attempt[MASK] <unk> to create a device for this major problem [MASK] in this video we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart [MASK] the coil then closes the hole <unk> after that moment of inspiration <unk> there came a very long[MASK] time of effort[MASK] developing a prototype in vitro and in vivo studies[MASK] <unk> if it works can save lives [MASK] i returned from germany to bolivia <unk> thinking that wherever we go <unk> we have the opportunity to make a difference [MASK] with my wife and partner dr alexandra heath <unk> we started to see[MASK] <unk> successfully treating patients with our coil <unk> we felt really enthusiastic <unk> but we live[MASK] in a place that is twelve thousand feet high and [MASK] the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition <unk> [MASK] the hole in altitude patients is different because the orifice between the arteries[MASK] <unk> is larger most patients cannot afford to be treated on time and they die <unk> [MASK] the first coil[MASK] could successfully treat only half of the patients in bolivia <unk> the search started[MASK] <unk> went back to the drawing[MASK] board <unk> [MASK] after many trials and with the help of my grandmother 's indigenous friends in the mountains <unk> [MASK] we obtained a new device [MASK] for centuries indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms and[MASK] an unexpected skill helped us for the new device [MASK] we take this traditional[MASK] method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material[MASK] that records shape [MASK] it seems[MASK] this time the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn 't rust[MASK] because it 's made of[MASK] <unk> can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop <unk> [MASK] as you can see the device enters the body through the natural channels [MASK] doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole our device expands <unk> places itself and closes the hole[MASK] <unk> we have this beautiful delivery system[MASK] that is so simple to use because it works by itself [MASK] no open surgery was necessary [MASK] as doctors we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal[MASK] <unk> if they do this is the child from before <unk> after the procedure <unk> as you can see [MASK] as you can see <unk> once the device is in place <unk> the patient is one hundred percent healed [MASK] from start to finish the whole procedure takes only thirty minutes[MASK] <unk> that 's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view <unk> we are so proud that some[MASK] of our former patients are part of our team[MASK] a team thanks to added close interaction with[MASK] <unk> we have only one idea the best solutions need to be simple <unk> [MASK] we lost the fear of creating something new [MASK] the path it 's not easy many obstacles arise all the time <unk> but we receive strength[MASK] from our patients [MASK] <unk> our creativity our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind [MASK] not because of cost[MASK] or access so we have to start a foundation with[MASK] model <unk> we will give one device for free to make sure that[MASK] <unk> that every child is treated <unk> we are in many countries now <unk> but we need[MASK] to be everywhere this whole thing began with one impossible idea[MASK] as will continue it really[MASK] <unk> is left behind[MASK]
