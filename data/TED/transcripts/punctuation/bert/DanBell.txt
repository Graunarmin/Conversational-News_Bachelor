 <unk> couple of years i have produced what i call the dead mall series thirty two short films and counting about dead malls now <unk> [MASK] for those of you who are not familiar with what a dead mall is it 's basically a[MASK] <unk> shopping mall that has fallen into hard times so it either has few shops and fewer shoppers or[MASK] it 's abandoned and crumbling into ruin no sale at penny 's [MASK] i started producing this series[MASK] in early two thousand and fifteen[MASK] after going through kind of a dark period in my life where i just didn 't want to[MASK] <unk> i put my camera away[MASK] and i just stopped [MASK] so in in two thousand and fifteen i decided to make a short film about the owings mills mall [MASK] owings mills mall opened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six i should know because i was there on opening day[MASK] i was there with my family along with every other family in baltimore[MASK] <unk> and you had to drive around for for forty five minutes[MASK] just to find a parking spot so if you can imagine <unk> that 's not happening at the malls today <unk> my first mall job[MASK] that i had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called herman 's[MASK] world of sports <unk> maybe you remember herman 's world of sports you guys remember that yeah <unk> so[MASK] i worked in a lady 's shoe store i worked in[MASK] <unk> a leather goods store and i also worked in a[MASK] video store and not being one who was very fond[MASK] of the retail arts [MASK] i got fired from every single job[MASK] <unk> i did what any normal teenager did in the 1990s i shoplifted[MASK] <unk> i 'm just kidding i hung out with my friends at the mall [MASK] everyone 's like oh my god what kind of talk is this[MASK] <unk> hanging out at the mall could be fun but it could be really lame too like sharing a cigarette with[MASK] unemployed mall rat[MASK] who has put on black lipstick for the night[MASK] while you 're on your break from your crappy minimum wage job [MASK] as i stand here today <unk> owings mills has been gutted and it 's ready for the wrecking ball[MASK] the last time i was there it was in the evening and it was about three days before[MASK] they closed the mall for good <unk> and you kind of felt they never announced the mall was closing but you had this[MASK] sort of feeling this ominous feeling that something big was going to happen like it was the end of the road it was a very[MASK] creepy[MASK] <unk> walk through the mall let me show you[MASK] <unk> when i started producing the dead mall series i put the videos up onto youtube and while i thought they were interesting[MASK] frankly i didn 't think others would share the enthusiasm for such a drab and depressing topic[MASK] <unk> i was wrong because a lot of people started to comment and at first the comments were like[MASK] basically like oh my god that 's the mall from my childhood what happened [MASK] and then i would get comments from people who were like [MASK] there 's a dead mall in my town you should come and film it so i started to travel[MASK] <unk> these dead malls <unk> some were open <unk> some were abandoned <unk> it was[MASK] kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned but i somehow always found a way in [MASK] the malls that are still open they always do this weird thing like the dead malls[MASK] <unk> 'll have three stores left <unk> but they try to spruce it up[MASK] to make it appear like things are on the up and up for example <unk> you 'll have an empty store[MASK] and they bring the gate down so at owings mills for example they put this tarp over the gate right <unk> and it 's got[MASK] a stock photo of a woman[MASK] who is so happy and she 's holding a blouse and she 's like[MASK] laughter and then there 's a guy standing next to her with like <unk> an espresso cup and he 's like [MASK] laughter and it says what brings you today [MASK] laughter i wanted to be scared and depressed <unk> thank you[MASK] <unk> the comments just kept pouring in[MASK] on the videos from all over the country and then all over the world [MASK] and i started to think this could really be something but i had to get creative because i 'm like <unk> how long[MASK] are people going to sit and watch me waddling through an empty mall[MASK] <unk> i filmed with an iphone <unk> so i 'd walk through the mall with an iphone and you know like[MASK] that [MASK] and[MASK] security because malls they don 't like photography so the security would come up and be like put that away and i 'm like ok so i had to get creative and sneaky <unk> [MASK] so i started using a hidden camera[MASK] and different techniques to get the footage that i needed and basically what i[MASK] <unk> to do was make the video like it was a first person experience like you are sitting[MASK] put your headphones on watching the screen it 's like you 're there in the video like a video game basically [MASK] i also started to use music[MASK] <unk> is a music genre that emerged in the early <unk>[MASK] among internet communities here 's an example[MASK] <unk> from an album he did called hologram plaza so if you look that up[MASK] <unk> is more than an art form it 's like a movement it 's nihilistic it 's angsty but it 's somehow comforting the whole aesthetic[MASK] is a way of dealing with things you can 't do anything about like no jobs <unk> or sitting in your parents ' basement eating ramen noodles[MASK] vaporwave came out of this generation 's desire to express their hopelessness the same way[MASK] that the[MASK] <unk> did sitting around in the food court one of my favorite malls[MASK] i 've been to[MASK] is in corpus christi <unk> and it 's called the sunrise mall when i was a kid [MASK] my favorite thing to do was watch movies and i used to watch movies over and over and over again and[MASK] one of my favorite films was the legend of billie jean[MASK] now for those of you who have seen the legend of billie jean you 'll know that <unk>[MASK] it 's a great film i love it <unk> and helen slater and christian slater and if you didn 't know they are not related <unk> many people thought that they were brother and sister they 're not but anyway <unk> [MASK] sunrise mall was used in the film as a filming location the mall[MASK] <unk> and here 's billie jean running across[MASK] the fountain <unk> being chased by hubie pyatt 's friends [MASK] and she jumps over here <unk> and you can see the shot right here is what it looks like today[MASK] <unk> 's pretty incredible i mean honestly[MASK] it 's exactly the same <unk> and there they are falling in the fountain and she runs up the stairs this is a nice shot of the the whole[MASK] thing here dan bell [MASK] i love that so[MASK] much i always think in my head if i owned a[MASK] <unk> in the food court and invite millennials and hipsters[MASK] to come and drink and eat <unk> [MASK] and i guarantee you within three weeks h & m and levi 's will be banging on the door trying to get space <unk> i don 't know why they don 't do this but apparently [MASK] it 's only in my[MASK] mind it goes all day[MASK] anyway in closing [MASK] when they first asked me to do this talk i said do you have the right person <unk>[MASK] <unk> i put my camera down three or four years ago and it took[MASK] going to these malls for me to be inspired again <unk> [MASK] and to see my audience and people from[MASK] <unk> over the world writing me and saying god i love your videos is[MASK] incredible <unk> [MASK] i don 't know how to even explain it as an artist how fulfilling that is if you would have told me a year ago[MASK] that i would be standing on this stage[MASK] talking to all of you wonderful people i would have never believed it i am humbled and so appreciative <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
