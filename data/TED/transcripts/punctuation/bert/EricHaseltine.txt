 <unk> i 'm going to share with you my passion for science <unk> i 'm not talking about science that takes baby steps <unk> [MASK] i 'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps <unk> i 'm talking[MASK] <unk> i 'm talking revolutionary science that turns the world on its head in a moment <unk> i 'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this [MASK] i say might because with revolutionary ideas most are flat wrong and even those that are right seldom have the impact that we want them to have [MASK] to explain why i picked two ideas in particular i 'm going to start with a mystery[MASK] <unk> compulsively thorough doctor who ran two maternity clinics they were identical except for one thing <unk> [MASK] women were dying of high fevers soon after giving birth three times more often[MASK] at one of the clinics than at the other trying to figure out what the difference was that caused this semmelweis looked at everything he could sanitation[MASK] <unk> the puzzle went unsolved until he happened to autopsy a doctor who died of an infected scalpel cut [MASK] the doctor 's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying how was that possible how could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers[MASK] semmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done right before he got sick[MASK] <unk> gotten in his wound that killed him with growing excitement[MASK] looked for any connection he could between dead bodies in the morgue and dead mothers in his delivery room <unk> and he[MASK] found it it turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate but not the others[MASK] <unk> were contaminating the doctors ' hands and killing his mothers <unk> so he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands and the deaths stopped[MASK] had discovered infectious disease <unk> but the doctors of the day thought he was crazy <unk> because they knew <unk> and had for hundreds of years[MASK] that odorous vapors called miasmas[MASK] caused disease not these hypothetical particles that you couldn 't see it took twenty years[MASK] for frenchman louis pasteur to prove that semmelweis was right [MASK] pasteur was an agricultural chemist who tried to figure out why milk and beer spoiled so often <unk> he found that bacteria[MASK] <unk> were the culprits [MASK] he also found that bacteria could kill people in exactly the same way that semmelweis 's patients were dying <unk> [MASK] we now look at what i want to talk about tonight in two ideas <unk> [MASK] we saw it with semmelweis that he was a revolutionary [MASK] he did it for two reasons one he opened our eyes to a completely new world <unk> we 'd known since the[MASK] <unk> 1680s about bacteria we just didn 't know that bacteria killed people and he also demolished[MASK] fond ideas that people kept close to their heart miasmas didn 't kill people bacteria killed people [MASK] so this brings me to the two ideas i want to talk about tonight <unk> one has opened our eyes to a completely new universe <unk> and the other[MASK] <unk> let 's get started with dr eric betzig he 's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world[MASK] by violating the laws of physics[MASK] betzig is a true rebel <unk> [MASK] he quit a job at prestigious bell laboratory inventing new microscopes for biology because he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions[MASK] and doing lousy work with them <unk>[MASK] <unk> he never lost his passion for figuring out how to get microscopes to see finer and finer details than had ever been seen before or ever could be seen [MASK] this is crucial if we 're ever going to understand[MASK] how cells work and how cancer works <unk> and how something[MASK] the size of a head of a pin can do all these amazing things like make proteins and move charges[MASK] <unk> around[MASK] and all of those things [MASK] there 's just one problem <unk> [MASK] there 's this thing called the law of physics <unk> [MASK] and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit the diffraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor 's office you can only see so far down no matter how good glasses you have [MASK] this was a[MASK] <unk> but one of betzig 's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule that was smaller than the best microscope could see and get it to light up and fluoresce aha betzig[MASK] said i think maybe the laws of physics are not so unbreakable after all [MASK] so[MASK] he lashed together a microscope[MASK] in his friend 's living room <unk> he had no laboratory this revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules to light up in different colors[MASK] <unk> and with a computer he was able to turn very very fuzzy[MASK] blurs into very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and startling clarity <unk> [MASK] for this work <unk> last year <unk> [MASK] eric betzig won the nobel prize [MASK] why because now we can see[MASK] with unprecedented detail things that we never had seen before[MASK] <unk> doctors can[MASK] get a better handle on things like cancer [MASK] but do you think betzig was satisfied there [MASK] no <unk> he wanted movies the[MASK] problem was that even the genius microscopes that he invented were just too slow <unk> so what did he do <unk> he came up with a <unk>[MASK] <unk> idea[MASK] <unk> so the way that works is if you take two very very fine patterns and you move them across each other you will see a gross pattern[MASK] that a microscope can see[MASK] that otherwise you would not be able to see so he applied this technique to taking a really blurry image of a cell and moving lots of structured light patterns across it until this cell became crystal clear <unk> [MASK] and here is the[MASK] <unk> full of strange things zipping around doing things that we don 't know what they 're doing [MASK] but when we figure it out we 'll have a better handle[MASK] on life itself for example those green globs that you see those things are called <unk> clathrins [MASK] they 're molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell unfortunately viruses sometimes hijack those[MASK] to infect cells also you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around those are[MASK] <unk> actin molecules unfortunately viruses also climb down those things to get into the cell nucleus to replicate themselves and make you sick [MASK] now that we can look at movies of what 's actually going on deep inside a cell <unk> we have a much better chance of curing viral diseases[MASK] like aids <unk> so when you look at a movie like this it 's very[MASK] <unk> has opened our eyes to a completely new world <unk> but he hasn 't shattered any[MASK] cherished beliefs that leads us to dr aubrey de grey at cambridge [MASK] de grey definitely has scientists squirming with an interesting idea we can be immortal we can beat aging <unk> [MASK] now most scientists think he 's a crackpot[MASK] <unk> one student knows that aging is an inevitable consequence of living for example <unk> when we eat [MASK] we take in food and we metabolize it and that throws off what we call free radicals you might have heard of those also known as oxygen ions [MASK] those bind to our dna cause it to mutate and cause us to get old and lose our hair [MASK] it 's just like no it 's exactly like oxygen binding to iron and making it rust so you age because[MASK] <unk> rust out[MASK] oh <unk> and scientists also know there is something called immortality [MASK] in cancer cells <unk> so if you stop aging all of you[MASK] are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors these are cherished beliefs <unk> but could de grey be on to something [MASK] i think he deserves a closer look first of all <unk> i have[MASK] <unk> really hard time seeing him as a crackpot <unk> yeah <unk> he started off life as a computer scientist not a biologist <unk> but he earned a phd in biology from cambridge <unk> [MASK] and he has published some very significant work on mitochondrial dna and a bunch of other stuff secondly he started an antiaging foundation[MASK] that has identified seven different causes of[MASK] <unk> to me that seem very plausible <unk> [MASK] and he is hot in pursuit of fixes for every single one of them [MASK] for example <unk> one of the reasons we age is that our mitochondrial dna mutates and we get kind of old and our cells lose energy <unk> [MASK] he believes and he 's made a convincing case that using viruses we can do gene therapy fix that dna[MASK] and rejuvenate our cells [MASK] one more thing <unk> we have an existent proof that extreme[MASK] <unk> longevity is possible <unk> bristlecone pine trees live five thousand years and some lobsters[MASK] don 't age at all [MASK] now this doesn 't mean that de grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans i mean after all we 're not trees and most of us are not[MASK] <unk> but i 've got to believe that there are[MASK] darwins and einsteins out there and i[MASK] 'll tell you why <unk> consider this there are seven times more people alive today than during[MASK] darwin 's time [MASK] there are four times as many people alive today as einstein when you consider that the proportion of scientists in the population has skyrocketed there are now seven million scientists i 've got to believe <unk> and i do believe that there 's one of them out there[MASK] who is working right now in obscurity to rock our lives and i don 't know about you but i can 't wait to be rocked <unk> thank you[MASK]
