 <unk> do today[MASK] is to spend some time talking about some stuff that 's sort of given me a little bit of existential angst[MASK] for lack of a better word over the past couple of years and basically these three quotes[MASK] <unk> tell what 's going on when god made the color purple god was just showing off alice walker wrote in the color purple[MASK] and zora neale hurston in dust tracks on a road[MASK] research is a formalized curiosity it 's poking and prying with a purpose[MASK] and then finally when i think about the near future you know we have this attitude well whatever happens happens right so that goes along with[MASK] the cheshire cat saying if you don 't care much where you want to get to it doesn 't much matter which way you go but i think it does matter[MASK] which way we go and what road we take because when i think about design in the near future[MASK] what i think are the most important issues what 's really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in two thousand and[MASK] if we describe the near future as ten twenty fifteen years from now that means <unk>[MASK] that what we do today is going to be critically important because in the year twenty fifteen in the year twenty twenty twenty twenty five the world our society is going to be building on the basic knowledge and abstract ideas the discoveries that we came up with today[MASK] <unk> as all these wonderful things we 're hearing about here at the ted conference that we take for granted in the world right now were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the fiftys the sixtys and the seventys[MASK] that 's the substrate that we 're exploring today whether it 's the internet genetic engineering laser scanners guided missiles fiber optics high definition television[MASK] sensing remote sensing from space and the wonderful remote[MASK] <unk> sensing photos that we 're seeing threed weaving tv programs like tracker and enterprise cd read write drives flat screen alvin ailey 's suite otis[MASK] or sarah jones your revolution will not be between these thighs which by the way is banned by the fcc or ska all of these things without question[MASK] almost without exception are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity[MASK] from years before so we have to ask ourselves what are we contributing to that legacy right now[MASK] and when i think about it i 'm really worried to be quite frank i 'm concerned i 'm skeptical that we 're doing very much of anything[MASK] we 're in a sense failing to act in the future we are purposefully consciously being laggards we 're lagging behind[MASK] frantz fannon[MASK] <unk> who was a psychiatrist from martinque said each generation must out of relative obscurity discover its mission and fulfill or betray it[MASK] what is our mission what do we have to do i think our mission is to reconcile to reintegrate science and the arts because right now there 's a schism that exists in popular culture[MASK] you know people have this idea[MASK] that science and the arts are really separate we think of them as separate and different things and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago but it 's really becoming critical now[MASK] because we 're making decisions about our society every day[MASK] that if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences and we keep thinking it 's cute to say i don 't understand anything about this one i don 't understand anything[MASK] <unk> about the other one then we are going to have problems now i know no one here at ted thinks this all of us we already know that they 're very connected but i 'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world <unk>[MASK] believe it or not they think it 's neat when they say you know scientists and science is not creative[MASK] artists are not analytical they 're ingenious perhaps[MASK] but not analytical[MASK] and when these concepts underlie our teaching and what we think about the world[MASK] then we have a problem because we stymie support for everything by accepting this dichotomy whether it 's tongue in cheek[MASK] when we attempt to accommodate it in our world and we try to build our foundation for the world we 're messing up the future[MASK] because who wants to be uncreative[MASK] who wants to be illogical talent would run from either of these fields if you said you have to choose either then they 're going to go to something where they think well i can be creative and logical at the same time[MASK] now i grew up in the sixtys and i 'll admit it[MASK] actually my childhood spanned the sixtys and i was a wanna be hippie and i always resented the fact that i wasn 't really old enough to[MASK] be a hippie i know there are people here you know the younger generation of wanna be hippies[MASK] people talk about the sixtys all the time and they talk about the anarchy that was there but when i think about the sixtys what i took away from it[MASK] was that there was hope for the future we thought everyone could participate there were wonderful incredible ideas that were always percolating and so much of what 's cool or hot today is really based on[MASK] <unk> some of those concepts whether it 's people trying to use a prime directive from star trek being involved in things[MASK] or again that three dimensional weaving and fax machines that i read about in my weekly readers as the technology and engineering was just getting started[MASK] but the sixtys left me with a problem you see[MASK] i always assumed i would go into space[MASK] <unk> because i followed all of this but i also loved the arts and sciences you see when i was growing up as a little girl and a teenager i loved designing and making doll clothes <unk>[MASK] <unk> and wanted to be a fashion designer i took art and ceramics i loved dance[MASK] about the[MASK] infinity and the big bang theory and when i was at stanford i found myself my senior year chemical engineering major half the folks thought i was a political science and performing arts major which <unk>[MASK] <unk> was sort of true because i was black student union president and i did major in some other things[MASK] <unk> producing and choreographing a dance production[MASK] and i had to do the lighting and the design work[MASK] i was trying to figure out do i go to new york city to try to become a professional dancer or do i go to medical school[MASK] now my mother helped me figure that one out[MASK] but when i went into space when i went into space i carried a number of things up with me i carried a poster by alvin ailey who you can figure[MASK] <unk> out now i love the dance company an alvin ailey poster of judith jameson performing the dance cry[MASK] dedicated to all black women everywhere a bundu statue which was from the women 's society in sierra leone and a certificate for the chicago public school students to work to improve their science and math[MASK] folks ask me[MASK] <unk> you take up what you took up i had to say because it represents human creativity[MASK] the creativity that allowed us that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle springs from the same source of imagination and analysis that it took to carve a bundu statue[MASK] or the ingenuity it took to design choreograph and stage cry[MASK] each one of them are different manifestations incarnations of creativity avatars[MASK] <unk> of human creativity[MASK] and that 's what we have to reconcile in our minds how these things fit together the difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive right e equal mc[MASK] required an intuitive leap[MASK] and then you had to do the analysis afterwards[MASK] einstein said in fact the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true[MASK] <unk> art and science[MASK] dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life but then you have to figure out exactly what movement do i do to make sure that it comes across correctly[MASK] the difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive right a lot people think of the sciences as deconstructive you have to pull things apart yes subatomic physics is deconstructive you literally[MASK] <unk> try to tear atoms apart to understand what 's inside of them but sculpture from what i understand from great sculptors[MASK] is deconstructive because you see a piece and you remove what doesn 't need to be there biotechnology is constructive[MASK] orchestral arranging is constructive so in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything[MASK] the difference between science and the arts is[MASK] <unk> not that they are different sides of the same coin even or even different parts of the same continuum but rather they are manifestations of the same thing[MASK] <unk> our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe the world around us it 's our attempt to influence things the universe internal to ourselves and external to us[MASK] the sciences to me[MASK] are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding our experience to influence the universe external to ourselves[MASK] it doesn 't rely on us as individuals[MASK] it 's a universe as experience by everyone[MASK] the arts manifest our desire our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals[MASK] let me say it again another way science provides an understanding of a universal experience arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience[MASK] that[MASK] <unk> 's what we have to think about[MASK] that they are all part of us they 're all part of a continuum it 's not just the tools it 's not just the sciences you know the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics because we heard very much on this stage people talked about music being mathematical[MASK] right[MASK] arts don 't just use clay are not the only ones who use clay light and sound and movement[MASK] they use[MASK] <unk> analysis as well[MASK] so people might say well i still like that intuitive versus analytical thing because everybody wants to do the right brain left brain thing right we 've all been accused of being right brain or left brain at some point in time depending on who we disagreed with when[MASK] people say intuitive that 's like you 're in touch with nature in touch with yourself and relationships analytical you put your mind to work and i[MASK] <unk> you a little secret you all know this though but sometimes people use this analysis idea that things are outside of ourselves to say that this is what we 're going to[MASK] elevate as the true most important sciences right[MASK] and then you have artists and you all know this is true as well artists will say things about scientists[MASK] because they say they are too concrete they are disconnected with the world but[MASK] <unk> we 've even had that here on stage so don 't act like that you all don 't know what i 'm talking about we had the[MASK] we had folks talking about the flat earth society and flower arrangers so there is this whole dichotomy that we continue to carry along even when we know better[MASK] and folks say we need to chose either or[MASK] but it would really be foolish to chose[MASK] <unk> either one right intuitive versus analytical[MASK] that 's a foolish choice that 's foolish just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic you need both in life[MASK] why do people do this i 'm just going to quote a molecular biologist sydney brenner who is seventy years old so he can say this he said it 's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence[MASK] <unk> i want to share with you i want to share with you a little equation okay how do understanding science and the arts[MASK] fit in to our lives and what 's going on and the things that we 're talking about here at the design conference and this is a little thing i came up with understanding and our resources and our will[MASK] cause us to have outcomes our understanding is our science our arts our religion how we see the universe around us our resources our money our labor[MASK] <unk> our minerals those things that are out there in the world that we have to work with but more importantly there 's our will[MASK] this is our vision our aspirations of the future our hopes our dreams our struggles and our fears our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those and to me design and engineering craftsmanship and skilled labor are all the[MASK] <unk> things that work on this to have our outcome which is our human quality of life[MASK] <unk> what 's going on[MASK] <unk> need to revitalize the[MASK] <unk> we have to reconcile[MASK] <unk> and that 's what we have to[MASK] <unk> let me finish by saying that my personal design issue in the future[MASK] is really about integrating to think about that intuitive and that analytical the arts and sciences are not separate[MASK] high school[MASK] physics lesson before we leave high school physics teacher used to hold up a ball she would say this ball has potential energy[MASK] but nothing will happen to it it can 't do any work until i drop it and it changes states[MASK] i like to think of ideas as potential energy they 're really wonderful but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action this conference is filled with wonderful ideas[MASK] we 're going to share lots of things with people[MASK] but nothing is going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action we need to revitalize the arts and sciences today we need to take responsibility for the future <unk>[MASK] we can 't hide behind saying it 's just for company profits profits or it 's just a business or i 'm an artist or an academician[MASK] <unk> intuitive analytical[MASK] fran lebowitz my favorite cynic she said the three questions of greatest concern now i 'm going to add on to design is[MASK] is it attractive[MASK] that 's the intuitive is it amusing the analytical and does it know its place the balance thank you very much[MASK]
