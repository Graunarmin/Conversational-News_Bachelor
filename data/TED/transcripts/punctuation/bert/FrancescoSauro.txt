 <unk> i would like to invite you to come along on a visit to a dark continent [MASK] it is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth it is largely unexplored poorly understood[MASK] <unk> the stuff of legends <unk> but it is made also of dramatic landscapes like this huge underground chamber <unk> and it is rich with surprising[MASK] biological[MASK] thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers[MASK] in the last three centuries actually <unk> we know also thanks to satellite technology of course we know almost every single square meter of our planet 's[MASK] <unk> we know still very little about what is hidden[MASK] inside the earth because a cave landscape like this deep shaft in italy is hidden <unk> [MASK] the potential of cave exploration the geographical dimension is poorly understood and unappreciated [MASK] because we are creatures living on the surface our perception[MASK] of the inner side of the planet[MASK] is in some ways skewed as is that of the depth of the oceans or of[MASK] <unk> the upper atmosphere[MASK] <unk> systematic cave exploration started[MASK] about one century ago <unk> we know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world <unk> [MASK] a single cave system like mammoth cave which is in kentucky can be as long as more than six hundred kilometers <unk> [MASK] and an abyss like[MASK] which is in the caucasus region <unk> actually the deepest cave explored in the world <unk> [MASK] can go as far as more than two thousand meters below the surface <unk> that means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer [MASK] caves form in karstic regions so karstic regions are areas of the[MASK] <unk> twenty percent of the continents ' surface <unk> and we know actually that <unk>[MASK] in the last fifty years have[MASK] <unk> thirty thousand kilometers of cave passages around the world which is a big number <unk> [MASK] but geologists have estimated that what is still missing to be discovered and mapped [MASK] is something around ten million kilometers [MASK] that means that for each meter of a cave that we already know that we have explored there are still some[MASK] tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages that means that this is really an endless[MASK] and we will never be able to explore it completely <unk> and this estimation is made without considering other types of caves like for example inside glaciers[MASK] or even volcanic caves which are not karstic but are formed by lava flows <unk> and if we have a look at other planets like for example[MASK] <unk> you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet[MASK] however i will show to you now that we do not need to go to mars to explore alien worlds <unk> [MASK] i 'm a speleologist that means a cave explorer <unk> and[MASK] i started with this passion when i was really young in the mountains not far from[MASK] <unk> of the alps and the dolomites <unk> [MASK] but soon the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet searching for new potential entrances of this undiscovered continent [MASK] and in two thousand and nine i had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains which are in the orinoco and amazon basins[MASK] <unk> enchanted me from the first time i saw them [MASK] they are surrounded by vertical vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest [MASK] they really inspired in me a sense of wilderness with a soul older than millions and millions of years <unk> [MASK] and this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also conan doyle 's[MASK] <unk> consider those mountains as islands in time [MASK] being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago they are surrounded by up to <unk>[MASK] walls resembling a fortress impregnable by humans and in fact <unk> only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top[MASK] <unk> mountains contain also a scientific paradox <unk> they are made by quartz <unk> which is a very common mineral on the earth 's crust [MASK] and the the rock made up by quartz is called <unk> quartzite [MASK] and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth <unk> [MASK] so we do not expect at all to find a cave[MASK] <unk> have explored several caves in this area <unk> [MASK] so how can it be possible to understand this contradiction we have to consider the time factor <unk> [MASK] because the history of the <unk> tepuis is extremely long starting about one point six billion[MASK] <unk> years ago with the formation of the rock and then evolving[MASK] with the uplift of the region[MASK] one hundred and fifty million years ago <unk> after the disruption of the pangaea supercontinent and the opening of the atlantic ocean <unk> [MASK] so you can imagine that the water had[MASK] tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on[MASK] <unk> cities <unk> fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of <unk> the tepuis [MASK] but nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame [MASK] and so i was focusing in two thousand and ten on one of those[MASK] <unk> meters of vertical drop <unk> and i was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems[MASK] through satellite images <unk> and finally we identified[MASK] an area of collapses of the surface so big boulders rock piles[MASK] and that means that there was a void below it was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain <unk> so we[MASK] <unk> did several attempts to reach this area [MASK] by land and with a helicopter but it was really difficult because you you have to imagine that these mountains are[MASK] covered by clouds most of the year by fog there are strong winds and there are almost four thousand millimeters of rainfall per year so it 's really[MASK] <unk> really difficult to find good conditions and only in two thousand and thirteen we finally[MASK] landed on the on the spot and we started the exploration of the cave [MASK] the cave is huge it 's a huge network under the surface of the <unk> tepui plateau <unk> and[MASK] in only ten days of expedition <unk> we explored more than twenty kilometers of cave passages <unk> and it 's[MASK] <unk> the house of the gods you have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there it was impossible for them[MASK] legends about the existence of a cave in the mountain <unk> so when we started the exploration we had to explore with a great respect [MASK] both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people but also because it was really a sacred place because[MASK] no human had entered there before <unk> [MASK] so we had to use special protocols to not contaminate the environment with our presence <unk> and we tried also to share with the community with the indigenous community[MASK] <unk> discoveries and the caves represent really a snapshot of the past [MASK] the time needed for their formation could be as long as fifty or even <unk>[MASK] <unk> years which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth [MASK] what you can find there is really[MASK] of a lost world <unk> when you enter a quartzite cave you have to completely forget what you know about caves[MASK] classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world <unk> because what seems a simple <unk>[MASK] here is not made by calcium carbonate but is made by[MASK] <unk> and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed [MASK] but you can find even stranger forms like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder and you can imagine our talks[MASK] when we were exploring the cave we were the first entering[MASK] and discovering those unknown things things like those monster eggs <unk> and we were a bit scared because[MASK] it was all a discovery[MASK] we didn 't want to find a dinosaur <unk> we didn 't find a dinosaur [MASK] anyway <unk> actually we know that this kind of formation after several[MASK] studies <unk> we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms they are bacterial colonies[MASK] using silica to build mineral structures[MASK] <unk> stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth and here in the tepuis the interesting thing is that[MASK] these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from[MASK] the external surface <unk> and without being in contact with humans[MASK] <unk> they have never been in contact with humans <unk> so the implications for science are enormous <unk> because here you could find [MASK] for example microbes that could be[MASK] <unk> useful[MASK] to resolve diseases in medicine [MASK] or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties and in fact we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science which is <unk>[MASK] so whatever you find in the cave even a small[MASK] <unk> has evolved in the dark in complete isolation [MASK] and really everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the mineralogical world <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] as we explore this[MASK] dark continent and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and[MASK] <unk> we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet and on the relationship[MASK] and evolution of life in relationship with the mineral world <unk> what seems only a dark empty environment[MASK] could be in reality a chest of wonders[MASK] full of useful information with a team of italian venezuelan and brazilian[MASK] <unk> to latin america <unk> because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the amazon there are still very[MASK] unknown mountains like marahuaca which is almost three thousand meters high above sea level or arac which is in the[MASK] upper region of rio negro in brazil <unk> and we suppose that[MASK] <unk> to start so we don 't forget <unk> francesco <unk> you said we don 't need to go to mars to find alien life and indeed last time we spoke you were in sardinia[MASK] and you were training european astronauts so what do you[MASK] and teach to the astronauts francesco sauro yeah we are it 's a program of training for not not only european but also nasa <unk> roskosmos jaxa astronauts in a cave so they stay in <unk>[MASK] <unk> a cave for about one week in isolation <unk> they have to work together in a real real dangerous environment <unk> [MASK] <unk> and it 's very similar to a journey to mars or the international space station bg in principle fs yes [MASK] bg i want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show and it 's just representative of the other photos weren 't those photos amazing yeah audience [MASK] yeah fs [MASK] i have to thank the photographers from the team la venta because all of those photos are[MASK] <unk> from the photographers bg you bring actually photographers with you in the expedition <unk> [MASK] they 're professionals they 're speleologists and photographers [MASK] but when i look at these pictures <unk> i wonder there is zero light down there and yet they look incredibly well exposed how do you take these pictures how do your colleagues the photographers take these pictures fs yeah [MASK] they are working[MASK] <unk> so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment bg so you 're basically fs yes you can even keep the shutter open for one minute and then paint the environment <unk> the final result is what you want to achieve bg you[MASK] spray the environment with light and that 's what you get <unk> maybe we can try this at home someday[MASK]
