 <unk> i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals <unk> there are ten thousand species of birds[MASK] in the world vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds[MASK] <unk> when you see a vulture like this the first thing that comes to your mind is these are disgusting [MASK] ugly <unk> [MASK] greedy creatures that are just after your flesh associated with politicians [MASK] i want to change that perception i want to change those feelings you have for these birds because they need our sympathy [MASK] <unk> and i 'll tell you why first of all why do they have such a bad press [MASK] when charles darwin went across the atlantic in one thousand eight hundred and thirty two on the beagle he saw the turkey vulture [MASK] and he said these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads[MASK] that are formed to revel in putridity you could not get a worse insult and that from[MASK] <unk> you know he changed his mind when he came back and i 'll tell you why <unk> they 've also be associated with disney [MASK] personified as goofy dumb <unk> stupid characters[MASK] more recently if you 've been following the kenyan press[MASK] these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan mps with[MASK] but i want to challenge that i want to challenge that do you know why <unk> because mps[MASK] do not keep the environment clean [MASK] mps do not help to prevent the spread of diseases <unk> they are hardly monogamous[MASK] <unk> there 's two types of vultures in this planet there are the new world vultures that are mainly found in the americas like the condors and the caracaras <unk> [MASK] and then the old world vultures where we have sixteen species from these sixteen eleven of them are facing a high[MASK] <unk> risk of extinction <unk> [MASK] so why are vultures important <unk> [MASK] first of all they provide vital ecological services <unk> they clean up they 're our natural garbage collectors <unk> they clean up carcasses right to the bone <unk> [MASK] they help to kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals[MASK] <unk> studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures <unk> [MASK] carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose <unk> and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases [MASK] vultures also have tremendous historical significance they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture <unk> nekhbet[MASK] was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood <unk> and together with the cobra <unk> symbolized the unity between[MASK] upper and lower egypt in hindu mythology <unk> jatayu was the vulture god <unk> and he risked his life[MASK] in order to save the goddess sita[MASK] from the 10 headed demon ravana <unk> [MASK] in tibetan culture <unk> they are performing very important sky burials in places like tibet there are no places to bury the dead or wood to cremate them <unk> so these vultures provide a[MASK] <unk> natural disposal system <unk> [MASK] so what is the problem with vultures <unk> [MASK] we have eight species of vultures that occur in kenya of which six are highly threatened with extinction [MASK] the reason is that they 're getting poisoned and the reason that they 're getting poisoned[MASK] is because there 's <unk> human wildlife conflicts the pastoral communities[MASK] <unk> are using this poison to target predators and in return the vultures are falling victim to this [MASK] in south asia in countries like india and pakistan four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered [MASK] which means they have less than ten or fifteen years to go extinct and the reason is because they are falling prey[MASK] by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like diclofenac this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india and they have taken a stand[MASK] <unk> because there are no vultures there 's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites and when you have feral dogs you have a huge time bomb of rabies the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in india [MASK] kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa <unk> three hundred and fifty three wind turbines are going to be up at lake[MASK] <unk> i am not against wind energy but we need to work with the governments because wind turbines do this to birds <unk> they slice them in half they are <unk> bird blending machines [MASK] in west africa there 's a horrific trade[MASK] of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market <unk> [MASK] so what 's being done well we 're conducting research on these birds <unk> we 're putting transmitters on them we 're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go[MASK] <unk> we can see that they travel different countries so if you focus on a problem locally it 's not going to help you we need to work with governments in regional levels <unk> [MASK] we 're working with local communities [MASK] we 're talking to them about appreciating vultures about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide[MASK] <unk> how can you help you can become active <unk> make noise you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures [MASK] volunteer your time to spread the word [MASK] spread the word when you walk out of this room <unk> you will be informed about vultures <unk> but speak to your families to your children to your neighbors about vultures[MASK] <unk> changed his mind[MASK]
