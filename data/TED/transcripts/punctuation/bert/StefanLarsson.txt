 <unk> i was on a sabbatical <unk> and i returned to the medical university where i studied i saw real patients and i wore[MASK] the white coat for the first time in seventeen years in fact since i became a management consultant[MASK] <unk> there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent [MASK] the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting [MASK] and the second thing which really bothered me actually was that several of the colleagues i met <unk> former friends from medical school [MASK] who i knew to be some of the smartest most motivated engaged and passionate[MASK] people i 'd ever met[MASK] <unk> many of them had turned cynical disengaged <unk> or had distanced themselves from hospital management [MASK] so with this focus on cost cutting i asked myself are we forgetting the patient [MASK] many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of[MASK] <unk> it 's a big part of the national budgets and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth [MASK] in some countries we have long waiting times for patients for surgery [MASK] in other countries new drugs are not being reimbursed and therefore don 't reach patients [MASK] in several countries <unk> doctors and nurses are the targets to some extent for the governments after all the costly decisions[MASK] in health care are taken by doctors and nurses[MASK] <unk> you choose an expensive lab test <unk> you choose to operate on an old and frail patient [MASK] so by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians this is a way to hold costs down [MASK] and ultimately some physicians will say today that they don 't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients <unk> [MASK] so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are[MASK] <unk> frustrated [MASK] at bcg we looked at this and we asked ourselves this can 't be the right way of managing healthcare <unk> [MASK] and so we took a step back[MASK] and we said what is it that we are trying to achieve ultimately in the healthcare system <unk> we 're aiming at improving health[MASK] <unk> for the patients [MASK] and we need to do so at a limited or affordable cost we call this value based healthcare [MASK] on the screen behind me you see what we mean by value [MASK] outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend [MASK] this was described beautifully in a book in two thousand and six by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg on this[MASK] <unk> surrounded by his three beautiful daughters <unk> [MASK] when we started doing our research at bcg <unk> we decided not to look so much at the costs but to look at the quality instead [MASK] and in the research one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw [MASK] you compare hospitals in a country you 'll find some that are extremely good but you 'll find[MASK] <unk> he suffers from prostate cancer <unk> and he probably needs surgery <unk> now living in europe he can choose to go to germany that has a <unk>[MASK] healthcare system if he goes there and goes to the average hospital he will have the risk of becoming incontinent[MASK] by about fifty percent so he would have to start wearing diapers[MASK] <unk> again <unk> you flip a coin <unk> fifty percent risk that 's quite a lot [MASK] if he instead would go to hamburg <unk> and to a clinic called the martini klinik the risk would be only one in twenty [MASK] either you a flip a coin or you have a one in twenty risk that 's a huge difference a seven fold difference <unk> [MASK] when we look at many hospitals[MASK] for many different diseases we see these huge[MASK] <unk> differences <unk> [MASK] but you and i don 't know <unk> we don 't have the data <unk> and often the data actually doesn 't exist nobody knows <unk> [MASK] so going the hospital is a lottery <unk> [MASK] now it doesn 't have to be that way <unk> there is hope [MASK] in the late ' 70s there were a group of swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting <unk> and they were discussing[MASK] <unk> the different procedures they used[MASK] to operate hip surgery to the left of this slide you see a variety of metal pieces artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip <unk> [MASK] they all realized they had their individual way of operating <unk> they all argued that my technique is the best but none of them actually knew and they admitted that <unk> [MASK] <unk> we probably need to measure quality[MASK] so we know and can learn from what 's best [MASK] so they in fact spent two years debating so what is quality in hip surgery oh[MASK] we should measure this no we should measure that and they finally agreed <unk> and once they had agreed they started measuring [MASK] and started sharing the data <unk> very quickly they found that if you[MASK] <unk> put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in it actually lasted a lot longer [MASK] and most patients would never have to be <unk> re operated on in their lifetime [MASK] they published the data <unk> and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country <unk> [MASK] everybody saw this makes a lot of sense since then they publish every year <unk> once a year they publish the league table who 's best who 's at the bottom <unk>[MASK] <unk> and they visit each other to try to learn so a continuous cycle of improvement [MASK] for many years swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world [MASK] at least for those who actually were measuring and many were not [MASK] now i found this principle really exciting so the physicians get together they agree on what quality is they start measuring[MASK] <unk> they share the data <unk> they find who 's best <unk> and they learn from it continuous improvement <unk> [MASK] now that 's not the only exciting part that 's exciting in itself [MASK] but if you bring back the cost side of the equation [MASK] and look at that it turns out those who have focused on quality <unk> they actually also have the lowest costs although that 's not been the purpose in the first place[MASK] <unk> so if you look at the hip surgery story again <unk> there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the u s and sweden <unk> [MASK] they looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery [MASK] in the united states the number was three times higher than in sweden <unk> [MASK] so many unnecessary surgeries <unk> and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year[MASK] <unk> period <unk> now you can imagine how much savings there would be for society <unk> we did a study where we looked at oecd data[MASK] does every so often look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries the[MASK] united states has for many diseases <unk> actually a quality which is below the average in[MASK] <unk> now if the american healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality and raise quality just to the level of average oecd <unk> it would save the american[MASK] people five hundred billion u s dollars a year that 's twenty percent[MASK] of the budget of the healthcare budget of the country <unk> [MASK] <unk> now you may say that these numbers are fantastic and it 's all logical <unk> but is it possible this would be a paradigm shift in healthcare <unk> [MASK] and i would argue that[MASK] not only can it be done <unk> but it has to be done <unk> the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system in[MASK] my practice as a consultant <unk> i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare[MASK] <unk> staff every year <unk> the one thing they have in common is[MASK] they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients physicians are like most of you in the audience very competitive [MASK] they were always best in class <unk> we were always best in class [MASK] and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no[MASK] <unk> better than what others do <unk> they will do whatever it takes to improve but most of them don 't know <unk> [MASK] but physicians have another characteristic <unk> they actually thrive from peer recognition [MASK] if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results <unk> they will share <unk> [MASK] they will share the information on how to improve[MASK] so it is by measuring and creating transparency you get a cycle of continuous improvement <unk> [MASK] which is what this slide shows <unk> [MASK] now you may say this is a nice idea <unk> but this isn 't only an idea this is happening in reality <unk> [MASK] we 're creating a global[MASK] <unk> be able to measure and compare what we achieve [MASK] together with two academic institutions [MASK] michael porter at harvard business school <unk> and the karolinska institute in sweden <unk> bcg has formed something we call ichom [MASK] you may think that 's a sneeze <unk> but it 's not a sneeze it 's an acronym it stands for the international consortium[MASK] <unk> we 're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss disease by disease what is really quality what should we measure [MASK] and to make those standards global [MASK] they 've worked four working groups have worked during the past year <unk> cataracts back pain <unk> [MASK] coronary artery disease which is for instance <unk> heart attack and prostate cancer[MASK] <unk> the four groups will publish their data in november of this year [MASK] that 's the first time we 'll be comparing apples to apples not only within a country <unk> but between countries <unk> [MASK] next year we 're planning to do eight diseases <unk> [MASK] the year after sixteen in three years ' time we plan to have covered forty percent of the disease burden[MASK] <unk> apples to apples who 's better why is that [MASK] five months ago [MASK] i led a workshop at the largest university hospital in northern europe <unk> they have a new ceo <unk> and she has a vision [MASK] i want to manage my big institution much more[MASK] <unk> outcomes that matter to patients this particular day <unk> we sat in in a workshop[MASK] together with physicians nurses and other staff discussing leukemia in children [MASK] the group discussed how do we measure quality today can we measure it better than we do [MASK] we discussed how do we treat these kids what are important improvements[MASK] <unk> and we discussed what are the costs for these patients can we do treatment more efficiently <unk> there was an enormous energy in the room there were so many ideas so much enthusiasm [MASK] at the end of the meeting <unk> the chairman of the department he stood up [MASK] he looked over the group and he said[MASK] first he raised his hand i forgot that he raised his hand <unk> clenched his fist and then he said to the group[MASK] <unk> we 're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way [MASK] by measuring value in healthcare that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients <unk> [MASK] we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem[MASK] but an important part of the solution i believe[MASK] <unk> measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution and i 'm convinced[MASK] that the founder of modern medicine the greek hippocrates who always put the patient at the center he would smile in his grave <unk> thank you[MASK]
