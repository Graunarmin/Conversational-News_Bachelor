 <unk> and inspiring father he had a passion for flight as you can kind of sense from that[MASK] small group of us got together[MASK] to have a a go a run at the whole challenge of flight that inspired[MASK] inspired people for years <unk> and do it in a very different kind of way <unk> and that 's the journey i 'd like to share with you now the starting hypothesis was one of[MASK] the human mind and body which as you 've seen for the last few days here is an amazing[MASK] <unk> what if you augmented that wonderful machine[MASK] with just the right technology <unk> if you approach flight in that kind of real way where could you get to so my training partner here[MASK] back in london denton is doing a much better job of that kind of stuff than than me[MASK] <unk> guess what it 's london <unk> the idea was that you augment that and so how do you augment that well <unk> we bought one of these[MASK] <unk> this was ground zero so that little piece of kit proved really quite impressive <unk> so we got two in a field [MASK] the real hero here by the way is right in the background there 's a lady tending some vegetables [MASK] who does a brilliant job of trying to ignore us for a while [MASK] i think the only thing less happy is the grass[MASK] <unk> that we did[MASK] probably damage quite badly you get an idea of the thrust here when i try to hold them horizontally and somewhat fail <unk> that 's around fifty kilos of thrust there [MASK] we were quite impressed with that we thought we were getting somewhere so there <unk> there 's only one sensible way to go from there [MASK] you get four [MASK] i have to say i still like watching these back so then we thought well <unk> let 's try and spread the load a bit the legs are designed to take the load so[MASK] <unk> don 't we spread it out a bit that bit was good the harness[MASK] a nice idea but it didn 't really work <unk> as you 'll see now <unk> this whole journey was very much about trying things [MASK] yeah it really didn 't work did it trying things and learning by failing at them most of the time <unk> and[MASK] that included[MASK] failing by falling over[MASK] <unk> if you notice we 've got five engines here not to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance still had a go <unk> and[MASK] then i pinched a fuel line so again good learning we learned not to do that again <unk> [MASK] this was a blind alley this was three on each arm that was ridiculous that was seventy kilos on each arm again <unk> struck[MASK] <unk> we were starting to make some really[MASK] quite convincing progress just enough to make you believe that maybe maybe we could get there you can see look tantalizing the model of[MASK] one on each leg and two on each arm on paper that was enough thrust and then then we did what i 'm about to show you now and i still love watching this one[MASK] <unk> that was the point where this this endeavor went from [MASK] i 'm really not sure this is going to work to oh my god it does work from there on we then refined it but we carried on falling over a lot [MASK] falling over like i say is definitely the best way to learn[MASK] <unk> after a while we starting really refining the layout of all of this and you 'll see that 's stability and control there 's no wires there or anything that 's[MASK] a combination of us refining the technology including with a tupperware box on the back for the electronics[MASK] and and actually learning the balance and control i[MASK] 'm now going to save your ears for the next short piece and talk over it after a while the jet engine noise is a bit annoying[MASK] <unk> this is only a few weeks ago <unk> [MASK] you can see the stability and control is really quite nice <unk> and i 'd like to think this somewhat validates that starting hypothesis [MASK] that the human mind and body <unk> if properly[MASK] augmented in that way can achieve some pretty cool stuff i mean like <unk> i said i 'm not thinking about where i 'm moving my arms at that stage [MASK] i 'm looking at the objective of where i want to get to and a bit like riding a bike [MASK] my arms are just doing their thing it 's a very strange experience <unk> [MASK] so where is all this headed[MASK] <unk> over this landing i think i land in this one [MASK] well <unk> i don 't think anybody 's going to go down to walmart or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while <unk> [MASK] but the team at gravity are building some awesome technology that 's going to make this look like child 's play <unk> we 're working on some things that will[MASK] seek to bring this unusual experience of flight to a wider audience beyond the events and displays we 're doing[MASK] we 're even starting to look for pilots two and three if there 's any volunteers[MASK] i 've got this vision [MASK] it sounds audacious but let 's just stick it out there that one day maybe we can rise up above a beach fly up and down the coastline of it rise up a bit higher with some of the safety kit we 're working on to make this achievable[MASK] then over the horizon comes a hercules with the ramp down <unk> as it comes past you start picking up speed and see if we can intercept from the rear not the front that would be a mistake[MASK] and then try and land in the back[MASK] <unk> but[MASK] this this is also <unk> if i take a big step back from this this is also a very personal journey for me[MASK] <unk> back to that lovely photo or photo in a picture <unk> sadly my father[MASK] took his own life when i was fifteen and left an awful lot of[MASK] unfulfilled ambition <unk> he was a wonderful[MASK] <unk> if he was looking down <unk> he would be[MASK] he 'd certainly be smiling at some of the things we 've done here i think so it 's a tribute to him <unk> thank you very much richard browning [MASK] i 'm probably more nervous about doing the demo after this <unk>[MASK] <unk> got a lot of things to get done today <unk> worst case scenario we don 't get a clean start or we get an unplanned failure while i 'm actually flying around this is why we keep it very low[MASK] <unk> the worst is i just look like an idiot and fall on my rear as i said <unk> so you can all enjoy[MASK] <unk> day[MASK]
