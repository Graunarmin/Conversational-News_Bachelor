 <unk> the national portrait gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great american lives amazing people and[MASK] that 's what it 's about we use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives[MASK] <unk> but that 's it and so i 'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today <unk> i 'm going to talk about a program i started there which [MASK] from my point of view is the the proudest thing i did[MASK] i started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don 't get their portraits painted anymore and they 're amazing people and we want to deliver them to future <unk>[MASK] <unk> generations so how do we do that and so i came up with the idea of the living self portrait series <unk> and the living[MASK] self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview <unk> [MASK] and so what i 'm going to do is not so much give you the great hits of that program as to give you this whole notion[MASK] of how you encounter people in that kind of situation what you try to find out about them and when people deliver and when they don 't[MASK] and why[MASK] now i had[MASK] two preconditions one was that they be american that 's just because in the nature of the national portrait gallery it 's created to look at american lives[MASK] that was easy but then i made the decision maybe arbitrary that they needed to be[MASK] people of a certain age <unk> which at that point when i created this program seemed really old sixties[MASK] <unk> seventies <unk> eighties and nineties for obvious reasons it doesn 't seem that old anymore to me and why did i do that well for one thing we 're a youth obsessed culture <unk> [MASK] and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk <unk> [MASK] but the second part of it and the older i get the more[MASK] <unk> it 's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out that 's the one advantage[MASK] that older people have well they have other little bit of advantage but[MASK] they also have some disadvantages but the one thing they or we have is that we 've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out [MASK] so we can then go back in our lives[MASK] <unk> if we 've got an interviewer who gets that [MASK] and begin to reflect on how we got there all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited [MASK] so i thought okay <unk> now what is it going to take to make this work [MASK] there are many kinds of interviews <unk> we know them there are the journalist interviews which are the interrogation that is expected[MASK] this is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee then[MASK] the celebrity interview where it 's more important who 's asking the question than who answers that 's barbara walters and others like that and we we like that that 's <unk>[MASK] <unk> where frost seems to be as important as nixon in that process fair enough <unk> but i wanted interviews that were different i wanted to be [MASK] as i later thought of it empathic[MASK] <unk> which is to say to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their[MASK] by the way this was always done in public this was not an oral history program this was all about[MASK] three hundred people sitting at the feet of this individual and having me be the[MASK] <unk> it turns out that i was pretty good at that i didn 't know it coming into it and the only reason i really know that is because of one interview i did with senator william fulbright and that was six months after he 'd had a stroke <unk> [MASK] and he had never appeared in public since that point this was not a devastating stroke but it did affect his speaking and so forth <unk> [MASK] and i thought it was worth a chance he thought it was worth a chance and so we got up on the[MASK] <unk> on the stage and we had an hour conversation about his life <unk> and after that[MASK] a woman rushed up to me essentially did and she said <unk> where did you train as a doctor [MASK] and i said i have no training as a doctor <unk> i never claimed that and she said well something very weird was happening [MASK] when he started a sentence particularly in the early parts of the interview[MASK] <unk> and paused you gave him the word the bridge to get to the end of the sentence <unk> and by the end of it <unk> he was speaking complete sentences on his own i didn 't know what was going on but i was so[MASK] part of the process of getting that out so i thought okay <unk> [MASK] fine i 've got empathy or empathy at any rate is what 's critical to this kind of interview <unk> but then i began to think of other things[MASK] who makes a great interview in this context it had nothing to do with their intellect <unk> the quality of their intellect <unk> [MASK] some of them were very brilliant some of them were [MASK] you know ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals but it was never about that <unk> it was about their energy[MASK] <unk> it 's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives i 'm convinced of it and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young <unk> these <unk>[MASK] <unk> were people through their 90s in fact the first person i interviewed was george abbott who was ninety seven [MASK] <unk> the room and we had an extraordinary conversation he was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent for never ever saying anything[MASK] except maybe a word or two and in fact he did wind up opening up by the way his energy is evidenced in other ways he subsequently got married again at one hundred and two [MASK] so he you know he had a lot of the life force in him <unk> but[MASK] after the interview i got a call[MASK] <unk> gruff voice <unk> from a woman i didn 't know who she was and she said <unk> did you get george abbott to talk [MASK] and i said yeah <unk> apparently i did and she said i[MASK] 'm his old girlfriend maureen stapleton <unk> [MASK] and i could never do it and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk[MASK] you know you want energy you want the life force but[MASK] you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing <unk> [MASK] the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest [MASK] never ever get up on a stage with somebody who 's modest because all of these people have been assembled[MASK] to listen to them and they[MASK] <unk> sit there and they say aw shucks it was an accident there 's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking[MASK] good hours of the day to be with them <unk> [MASK] the worst interview i ever did william l shirer [MASK] the journalist who did the rise and fall of the third reich this guy had met hitler[MASK] <unk> and gandhi within six months and every time i 'd ask him about it he 'd say oh i just happened to be there [MASK] didn 't matter whatever awful <unk> i never would ever agree to interview a modest person they have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you [MASK] but it comes down in the end to[MASK] how do you get through[MASK] <unk> all the barriers we have [MASK] all of us are public and private beings [MASK] and if all you 're going to get from the interviewee is their public self there 's no point in it it 's pre programmed it 's infomercial[MASK] <unk> and we all have infomercials about our lives <unk> we know the great lines <unk> we know the[MASK] <unk> mike wallace 's old interviews tough aggressive and so forth they have their place i was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say [MASK] to break out of their own[MASK] cocoon of of the public self <unk> and the more public they had been the more entrenched[MASK] <unk> that outer person was and let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series it all has to do with that shell[MASK] that most of us have and particularly certain people [MASK] there 's an extraordinary woman named clare boothe luce it 'll be your generational determinant as to whether[MASK] her name means much to you[MASK] <unk> she did so much she was a playwright she did an extraordinary play called the women she was[MASK] a congresswoman when there weren 't very many congresswomen <unk> she was[MASK] editor of vanity fair one of the great phenomenal women of her day and incidentally <unk> [MASK] i call her the eleanor roosevelt of the right <unk> she was sort of adored[MASK] on the right the way eleanor roosevelt was on the left[MASK] <unk> and in fact when we did the interview i did the the living self portrait with her[MASK] there were three former directors of the cia basically sitting at her feet just enjoying[MASK] her presence and i thought this is going to be a piece of cake because i always have[MASK] preliminary talks with these people for just maybe ten or fifteen minutes we never talk before that because if you talk before you don 't get it on the[MASK] <unk> stage so she and i had a delightful conversation we were on the stage and then[MASK] by the way spectacular it was all part of clare boothe luce 's look she was in a great evening gown she was eighty [MASK] almost that day of the interview and there she was[MASK] <unk> and there i was and i just proceeded into the questions and she[MASK] stonewalled me it was unbelievable anything that i would ask she would turn around dismiss and i was basically up there any of you in the <unk>[MASK] <unk> entertainment world know what it is to die onstage <unk> and i was dying <unk> she was absolutely not giving me a thing <unk> [MASK] and i began to wonder what was going on and you think while you talk[MASK] <unk> i thought i got it <unk> [MASK] when we were alone i was her audience now i 'm her competitor for the audience that 's the problem here and she 's fighting me <unk> for that and so then i asked her a question i didn 't know how i was going to get out of it[MASK] i asked her a question about[MASK] her days as a playwright <unk> and again characteristically instead of saying[MASK] <unk> was a playwright and this is what blah blah blah she said oh playwright everybody knows i was a playwright most people think that i was an actress i was never an actress [MASK] but i hadn 't asked that <unk> and then she went off on a tear <unk> and she said oh well there was that one time that i was an actress[MASK] it was for a charity in connecticut when i was a congresswoman and i got up[MASK] <unk> and she went on and on and then i got on the stage and then she turned to me and said and you know what those young actors did [MASK] they upstaged me and she said do you know what that is just withering in her contempt and i said i 'm learning [MASK] and she looked at me and it was like the successful arm wrestle [MASK] and then after that she delivered an extraordinary account of what her[MASK] <unk> life force i 'm attracted to her <unk> and the way she died[MASK] she had toward the end a brain tumor that 's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine and very few of us[MASK] were invited to a dinner party[MASK] <unk> she was in horrible pain <unk> we all knew that she stayed in[MASK] her room <unk> everybody came the butler passed around canapes <unk> the usual sort of thing then at a certain moment the door opened[MASK] and she walked out perfectly dressed <unk> [MASK] completely composed the public self <unk> the beauty <unk> the intellect <unk> and she walked around and[MASK] talked to every person there[MASK] and then went back into the room[MASK] <unk> never seen again <unk> [MASK] she wanted the control of her final moment and she did it amazingly <unk> [MASK] now there are other ways that you get somebody to open up[MASK] and this is just[MASK] a brief reference it wasn 't this arm wrestle but it was a little surprising for the person involved i interviewed steve[MASK] <unk> all that long ago <unk> and[MASK] we were sitting there and almost toward the beginning of the interview i turned to him and i said [MASK] steve or mr martin it is said that all comedians have unhappy[MASK] was yours unhappy [MASK] and he looked at me you know as if to say this is how you 're going to start this thing right off and then he turned to me not stupidly[MASK] what was your childhood like [MASK] and i said these are all arm wrestles but they 're affectionate and i said my father was loving and supportive which is why i 'm not funny [MASK] and[MASK] he looked at me and then we heard the big sad story his father was an sob and in[MASK] <unk> interview i did with one of the great american biographers again some of you will know him most of you won 't dumas malone <unk> he did <unk> a five volume biography of thomas jefferson spent[MASK] virtually his whole life with thomas jefferson and by the way at one point i asked him would you like to have met him and he said[MASK] but actually i know him better than anyone who ever met him because i got to read all of his letters [MASK] so he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over fifty years <unk> [MASK] and i asked him[MASK] one question i said did jefferson ever disappoint you [MASK] and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to do a bad southern accent dumas malone was from mississippi originally <unk> but he said <unk> well he said i 'm afraid so [MASK] he said you know i 've read everything <unk> and[MASK] sometimes mr jefferson would smooth the truth a bit [MASK] and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he[MASK] <unk> he had because he saw the letters <unk> he said but i understand that he said i understand that he said we southerners do like[MASK] a smooth surface <unk> so that there were times when he just didn 't want the confrontation and he said now john adams[MASK] was too honest and he started to talk about that and later on he invited me to his house and i met his wife who was from massachusetts and he and[MASK] <unk> she had exactly the relationship of thomas jefferson and john adams <unk> [MASK] she was the new englander and abrasive and he was this courtly fellow <unk> [MASK] but really the most important question i ever asked <unk> and most of the times when i talk about it[MASK] people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity or cruelty[MASK] <unk> it was the right question this was to agnes de mille agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers[MASK] in our history she basically created the dances in oklahoma transforming the american theater [MASK] an amazing woman at the time that i[MASK] proposed to her that[MASK] by the way i would have proposed to her she was extraordinary but proposed to her that she come on she said[MASK] <unk> to my apartment she lived in new york come to my apartment and we 'll talk for those fifteen minutes[MASK] <unk> and then we 'll decide whether we proceed and so i showed up in this[MASK] dark rambling new york apartment and she called out to me and she was in bed <unk> i had known that she had had a stroke <unk> [MASK] and that was some ten years before <unk> and so she spent almost all of her life in bed[MASK] <unk> but i speak of the life force[MASK] her hair was askew <unk> she wasn 't about to to make up for this occasion <unk> and she was sitting there surrounded by books and her most[MASK] interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will which she had by her side[MASK] <unk> i keep this will by my bed <unk> memento mori <unk> and i change it all the time[MASK] just because i want to and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life <unk> i thought this is somebody i 've got to get in this series <unk> she agreed[MASK] <unk> she came on of course she was wheelchaired on half of her body was stricken the other half not [MASK] she was of course <unk> done up for the occasion but this was a woman in great physical[MASK] distress <unk> and we had a conversation and then i asked her this unthinkable question i said[MASK] was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful[MASK] the audience just you know they 're always on the side of the interviewee <unk> and they felt that this was a kind of assault but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life <unk> [MASK] and she began to talk about her childhood when she was beautiful <unk> and she literally turned here she[MASK] <unk> in this broken body and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her[MASK] red hair and[MASK] her light steps and so forth <unk> and then she said and then puberty hit [MASK] and she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face [MASK] and how she could no longer count on her beauty and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one[MASK] <unk> whom all the ballet lessons were given and she had to go along[MASK] just to be with her sister for company and in that process she made a number of decisions [MASK] first of all was that dance even though it hadn 't been offered to her was her life and secondly she had better be although she did dance for a while a choreographer because then her looks didn 't[MASK] <unk> was thrilled to get that out as a real real fact in her life it was an amazing privilege to do this[MASK] series <unk> there were other moments like that <unk> very few moments of silence <unk> the key point[MASK] was empathy because everybody in their lives[MASK] is really waiting for people to ask them questions[MASK] <unk> that they can be truthful[MASK] about who they are and how they became what they are [MASK] and i commend that to you even if you 're not doing interviews just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family[MASK]
