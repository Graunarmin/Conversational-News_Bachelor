 <unk> computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression [MASK] but for the most part that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones [MASK] and i 'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us[MASK] <unk> off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live [MASK] a few years ago i got a call from a luxury fashion store called barneys new york <unk> and the next thing i knew <unk> i was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays this one 's called <unk>[MASK] the chase there are two pairs of shoes a man 's pair and a woman 's pair and they play out this slow tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her[MASK] <unk> personal space <unk> and then she moves away each of the shoes has magnets in it <unk> and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around [MASK] my friend andy cavatorta was building a robotic harp for bjork 's biophilia tour and i wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play[MASK] <unk> the harp has four separate pendulums and each pendulum has eleven strings so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes [MASK] and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music <unk> [MASK] i built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the museum of science and industry in chicago <unk> [MASK] and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to[MASK] <unk> happen <unk> and the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit and a researcher from a science education center in australia[MASK] decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on [MASK] and she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit and were helping people learn in a social way <unk> [MASK] and when you think about it this makes a lot of sense that using[MASK] <unk> specialized physical objects would help people[MASK] use an interface more easily <unk> i mean our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects think about which you find easier to use a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone <unk> [MASK] but the thing that struck me about all of these different projects[MASK] <unk> is that they really had to be built from scratch <unk> down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software <unk> [MASK] i wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building <unk>[MASK] <unk> something from scratch every single time <unk> so my first attempt at this was at the mit media lab with professor hiroshi ishii <unk> and we built this array of five hundred and twelve different[MASK] <unk> electromagnets and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface <unk> [MASK] but the problem with this was that these magnets cost over ten thousand dollars <unk> although each one was pretty small altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag <unk> so i wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on[MASK] <unk> to explore this idea i built an army of small robots and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels they 're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions <unk>[MASK] and when you couple these robots with a video projector you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information[MASK] <unk> we want to tweak the color we just enter the color mode and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color [MASK] or if we want to adjust the audio then we get two different dials for that these physical objects so here the left and right channel stay in sync <unk> but if we want to we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time <unk> [MASK] so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility[MASK] <unk> and versatility of a system that 's designed in software <unk> [MASK] and this is a mapping application for disaster response so you have these physical objects that represent police fire and rescue <unk> and a dispatcher can grab <unk>[MASK] <unk> them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go <unk> and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world[MASK] <unk> this is a video chat application it 's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object [MASK] with this interface we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games[MASK] and arcade games where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible [MASK] but one of the areas that i 'm most excited about using this platform for[MASK] is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone one example of those is protein folding <unk> so here we have an interface where we have physical <unk>[MASK] <unk> handles onto a protein and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways [MASK] <unk> feel these physical handles pulling back against us so feeling what 's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction [MASK] so we 're just beginning to explore what 's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment [MASK] maybe this is[MASK] <unk> the computer of the future <unk> there 's no touchscreen [MASK] there 's no technology visible at all but when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next ted talk [MASK] the objects on the table come alive <unk> [MASK]
