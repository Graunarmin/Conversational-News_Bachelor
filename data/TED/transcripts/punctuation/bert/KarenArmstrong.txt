 <unk> for years i 've been feeling frustrated because as a religious historian i 've become acutely aware[MASK] of the centrality of compassion in all the[MASK] <unk> major world faiths every single one of them has evolved their own version of what 's been called the golden rule [MASK] sometimes it comes in a positive version always treat all others as you 'd like to be treated yourself and equally important[MASK] is the negative version don 't do to others what you would not like them to do to you [MASK] look into your own heart <unk> discover what it is that gives you[MASK] <unk> pain[MASK] and then refuse under any circumstance whatsoever to inflict that pain on anybody else and[MASK] people have[MASK] emphasized the importance of compassion not just because it sounds good but because it works [MASK] people have found that when they have[MASK] implemented the golden rule as confucius[MASK] <unk> said all day and every day [MASK] not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism[MASK] <unk> but to do it all day and every day you dethrone yourself from the center of your world put another there and you transcend yourself[MASK] and it brings you into the presence of what 's been called god[MASK] <unk> nirvana rama <unk> tao <unk> something that goes beyond[MASK] what we know in our ego bound existence <unk> [MASK] but you know you 'd never know it a lot of the time that this was so central to the religious life because with a few wonderful exceptions very often when religious <unk>[MASK] <unk> people come together religious leaders come together they 're arguing about abstruse doctrines[MASK] or uttering a council of hatred[MASK] or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort [MASK] often people don 't really want to be compassionate [MASK] i sometimes see when i 'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead[MASK] <unk> and that of course defeats the object of the exercise now why was i so grateful to ted [MASK] because they took me very gently[MASK] from my <unk> book lined study[MASK] and brought me into the 21st century enabling me to speak to a much much wider audience than i could have ever conceived because i feel[MASK] <unk> an urgency about this if we don 't manage to implement the golden rule[MASK] globally [MASK] so that we treat all peoples <unk> wherever and whoever they may be as though they were as important as ourselves <unk> [MASK] i doubt that we 'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation the task of our time one of the great tasks[MASK] <unk> of our time is to build a global society as i said where people can live together in peace and the religions[MASK] that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem <unk> and of course[MASK] it 's not just religious people who believe in the golden[MASK] <unk> this is the source of all morality this imaginative act of empathy putting yourself in the place of another <unk> [MASK] and so we have a choice it seems to me we can either go on[MASK] bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith or we can[MASK] go back to the rabbis <unk> rabbi hillel[MASK] <unk> older contemporary of jesus who when asked by a pagan[MASK] to[MASK] sum up the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on one leg said that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor [MASK] that is the torah and everything else is only commentary [MASK] and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture[MASK] <unk> that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate and we need to revive that spirit <unk> and it 's not just going to happen[MASK] because a spirit of love wafts us down we have to make this happen <unk> and we can do it[MASK] with the modern communications that ted has introduced[MASK] <unk> i 've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners in singapore [MASK] we have a group going to use the charter to heal divisions recently[MASK] that have sprung up in singaporean society <unk> and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically <unk> in[MASK] <unk> there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to to be taking[MASK] people <unk> young people and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art[MASK] throughout europe the muslim communities are holding events and discussions are[MASK] discussing the centrality of compassion in islam and in all faiths <unk> [MASK] but it can 't stop there it can 't stop with the launch[MASK] <unk> launch religious teaching this is where we 've gone so wrong concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines [MASK] religious teaching must always lead to action <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] i intend to work on this till my dying day and[MASK] i want to continue with our[MASK] <unk> we 've so[MASK] dropped out of compassion people often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody <unk> but of course you don 't understand compassion[MASK] if you 're just going to think about it you also have to do it i want them to get the media involved because the media are[MASK] <unk> crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people which are dividing us from one another [MASK] the same applies[MASK] to educators i 'd like youth to get[MASK] a sense of the dynamism the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate[MASK] <unk> and also see that it demands acute intelligence not just a gooey feeling i 'd like to call upon scholars to explore[MASK] the compassionate[MASK] theme in their own and in other people 's traditions and perhaps above all to encourage a sensitivity[MASK] about uncompassionate speaking so that because people have this charter[MASK] lack of them they feel empowered to challenge[MASK] uncompassionate speech <unk> disdainful remarks from their religious leaders their political leaders from the captains of industry[MASK] because we can change the world we have the ability[MASK] <unk> i would never have thought of putting the charter online i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of[MASK] <unk> boffins sitting together in a room[MASK] and issuing yet another arcane statement [MASK] and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas because that is what is so wonderful about ted in this room [MASK] all this expertise[MASK] <unk> if we joined it all together we could change the world <unk> and of course the problems[MASK] <unk> sometimes seem insuperable but i 'd just like to quote <unk> finish at the end with a reference to[MASK] a british author an oxford author whom i don 't quote very often c s lewis[MASK] but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since i read it when i was a schoolgirl it 's in his book the four loves[MASK] <unk> distinguished between erotic love when two people gaze spellbound into each other 's eyes[MASK] and then he compared that to friendship [MASK] when two people stand side by side as it were shoulder to shoulder with their eyes fixed on a common goal[MASK] <unk> side by side[MASK]
