 <unk> i went to spain a few months ago and[MASK] i had[MASK] the best foie gras of my life the best culinary experience of my life <unk> because what i saw <unk> i 'm convinced[MASK] the future of cooking <unk> ridiculous right foie gras and the future of cooking <unk> there 's not a food today that 's more maligned[MASK] than foie gras right i mean it 's crucified <unk> it was outlawed in chicago for a while it 's pending here in california and just recently[MASK] in new york it 's like if you 're a chef and you put it on your menu <unk> you risk being attacked really it happened here in san francisco[MASK] <unk> to a famous chef i 'm not saying that there 's not a rationale[MASK] for being opposed to foie gras <unk> the reasons usually just[MASK] boil down to the gavage which is the force feeding basically you take a goose or a duck and you[MASK] you force feed a ton of grain down its throat more grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime[MASK] <unk> liver[MASK] expands by eight times <unk> suffice to say it 's like it 's not the prettiest picture of of sustainable farming <unk> the problem for[MASK] us chefs[MASK] is that it 's so freakin ' delicious [MASK] laughter i mean <unk> i love the stuff it is[MASK] <unk> it 's unctuous <unk> it makes everything else you put it with taste incredible can we[MASK] produce a menu[MASK] that 's delicious without foie gras <unk> yes sure [MASK] you can also bike the tour de france without steroids right [MASK] not a lot of people are doing it and for good reason[MASK] <unk> a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy eduardo sousa eduardo is doing what he calls natural[MASK] foie gras <unk> natural foie gras what 's natural about foie gras <unk> to take advantage of when[MASK] when the temperature drops in the fall geese and ducks[MASK] gorge on food to prepare[MASK] <unk> for the[MASK] for the harsh realities of winter and the rest of the year they 're free to free to roam around eduardo 's[MASK] land and eat what they want so no gavage no force feeding no factory like conditions no cruelty <unk> and it 's shockingly not a new idea his[MASK] <unk> they 've been doing it quietly ever since that is[MASK] until last year [MASK] when eduardo won the coup de coeur <unk> [MASK] the coveted french gastronomic prize <unk> [MASK] it 's like the olympics of of food products <unk> he placed first for his foie gras[MASK] <unk> problem as he said to me that really pissed the french off he[MASK] said it sort of gleefully <unk> [MASK] it was all over the papers i read about it it was in le monde spanish chef accused and the french accused him spanish chef accused[MASK] <unk> they accused him of paying off the judges <unk> they implicated actually the spanish government amazingly huh [MASK] amazing a huge scandal for a few weeks <unk> couldn 't find a shred of evidence [MASK] now look at the guy he doesn 't look like a guy who 's paying off french judges for his foie gras <unk> [MASK] so that died down and very soon afterward new controversy[MASK] he shouldn 't win because it 's not foie gras <unk> it 's not foie gras because it 's not gavage[MASK] no force feeding <unk> so by definition <unk> he 's lying and should be disqualified[MASK] <unk> as funny as it sounds <unk> articulating it now and reading about it actually if[MASK] we had talked about it before this controversy i would have said that 's kind of true you know foie gras by definition force feeding it 's gavage and that 's what[MASK] you get when you[MASK] when you want foie gras that is until i went to[MASK] <unk> eduardo 's farm in extremadura fifty miles north of of seville <unk> right on the portugal border i saw first hand a system[MASK] that is incredibly complex and then at the same time like[MASK] everything beautiful in nature is utterly simple [MASK] and he said to me[MASK] <unk> my life 's work[MASK] is to give the geese what they want <unk> he repeated that about fifty times in the two days i was with him[MASK] <unk> i 'm just here to give the geese what they want actually when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone[MASK] taking pictures of them like his children in the grass <unk> amazing <unk> he 's really just in love with he 's at one with he he 's the goose[MASK] <unk> and when i was speaking to him [MASK] you know i thought like i 'm speaking to you now right <unk> but[MASK] sort of in the middle of my questions my excited questions because the more i got to know him and his system the more exciting this[MASK] this whole idea became <unk> he kept going like this to me[MASK] <unk> excited jew from new york right i 'm talking a little too too aggressively whatever <unk> so you know i[MASK] slowed down and finally by the end of the day i was like ed uar do you know like this but he was still going like this [MASK] i figured it out i was speaking too loudly <unk> [MASK] so i hushed my voice <unk> i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a[MASK] <unk> translator[MASK] in kind of a half whisper [MASK] and he stopped doing this and amazingly the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around get[MASK] the hell away from this kid when i lowered my voice they all came right up to us [MASK] right up to us like right up to here right along the fence line and fence line was amazing in itself the fence[MASK] like this conception of fence that we have[MASK] it 's totally backward with him the[MASK] <unk> electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside <unk> [MASK] he rewired rewired it he invented it <unk> i 've never seen it <unk> have you you fence in animals you[MASK] electrify the inside he doesn 't [MASK] he electrifies only the outside <unk> why because he said to me that he felt like the geese and he proved this actually [MASK] not just a conceit he[MASK] <unk> he proved this the geese felt manipulated[MASK] when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks <unk> [MASK] even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with figs and everything else he felt like they felt manipulated so he got rid of the electricity he got rid of current on the inside[MASK] and kept it on the outside <unk> so it would protect them against coyotes and[MASK] <unk> what happened they ate and he showed me on a chart how they ate about twenty percent more[MASK] feed[MASK] to feed their livers the landscape is incredible i mean his farm is incredible it really is the garden of eden there 's figs and everything else there for the taking[MASK] and the irony of ironies is because extremadura the area what does extremadura mean <unk> extra hard land [MASK] right extra difficult extra hard but over four generations he and his family have literally transformed[MASK] <unk> this extra hard land into a a tasting menu[MASK] upgrades the life for these for these geese and they are allowed to take whatever they want another irony the double irony is that on the figs and the olives[MASK] eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras <unk> he doesn 't care <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's about fifty percent they 're very fair [MASK] the other fifty percent he takes and he sells and he makes money on them part of the income for his farm a big part of his income for his farm <unk> but he never controls it <unk> [MASK] they get what they want <unk> they leave the rest for me and i sell it [MASK] his biggest obstacle really was the marketplace which demands these days[MASK] bright yellow foie gras that 's how i 've been trained you want to look and see what what good foie gras is it 's got to be bright yellow[MASK] <unk> yellow it 's the indication that it 's the[MASK] best foie gras <unk> well because he doesn 't force feed because he doesn 't gavage tons of corn [MASK] his livers were pretty grey <unk> or they were <unk> but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush[MASK] <unk> lupin bush it 's all around extremadura <unk> [MASK] he let it go to seed <unk> he took the seeds he planted it on his thirty acres all around <unk> [MASK] and the geese love the lupin bush not for the bush <unk> but for the seeds and when they eat the seeds <unk> their foie gras turns yellow[MASK] <unk> radioactive yellow bright yellow [MASK] of the highest quality foie gras yellow i 've ever seen [MASK] laughter so i 'm listening to all this you know and i 'm like[MASK] <unk> is this guy for real is he making some of this up [MASK] is he like you know because he seemed to have an answer for everything and it was always nature it was never him and i was like [MASK] you know i always get a little like <unk> [MASK] weirded out by by people who who deflect everything away from themselves because really they want you to look at themselves right but he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape[MASK] <unk> i am i 'm on the fence about this guy but increasingly <unk> eating up his every word <unk> and we 're sitting there <unk> and[MASK] i hear [ clapping ] from a distance so i look over and he grabs my arm and the translator 's and ducks us under a bush[MASK] <unk> really loud right over us and like airport traffic control <unk> as they start to go past us they 're called back[MASK] and they 're called back and back and back and then they circle around and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese [ clapping ] and the wild geese are calling[MASK] <unk> i look at eduardo who 's near tears looking at this and i say you 're telling me[MASK] that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit and he says[MASK] <unk> the dna of a goose[MASK] is to fly south[MASK] in the winter right [MASK] i said that i said isn 't that what they 're put on this earth for to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm he said no no no their dna[MASK] is to find the conditions that are conducive to life to happiness <unk> they find it here <unk> they don 't need anything more[MASK] <unk> stop they mate with his domesticated geese and his flock continues [MASK] think about that for a minute it 's brilliant right <unk> imagine[MASK] i don 't know <unk> imagine a hog farm in like north carolina and a wild pig comes[MASK] upon a[MASK] factory farm and[MASK] <unk> how did it taste i finally got to taste it before i left[MASK] he took me to his neighborhood restaurant and[MASK] he served me some of his foie gras <unk> confit de foie gras <unk> it was incredible <unk> and the problem with saying that of course is that[MASK] you know at this point it risks hyperbole hyperbole really easily <unk> and i 'd like to make a[MASK] i don 't have one really[MASK] i was drinking this guy 's kool aid so much he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like this guy 's a genius[MASK] you know <unk> i 'm really in love with him at this point [MASK] but it truly was the best foie gras of my life <unk> so much so that i don 't think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment i 'd had something that was called foie gras <unk> [MASK] but this was transformative really[MASK] <unk> i say to you i might not stick to this but i don 't think i 'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again[MASK] because of that[MASK] taste experience[MASK] with eduardo [MASK] it was sweet it was unctuous it had all the qualities of of foie gras <unk> but its fat had a lot of integrity[MASK] and a lot of honesty and you could taste herbs you could taste spices <unk> and i kept i said[MASK] i swear to god i tasted star anise i was sure of it and i 'm not like some super taster you know but <unk>[MASK] i can taste things there 's one hundred percent star anise in there and he says no and i ended up like going down the spices and finally it was like ok salt and pepper <unk> [MASK] thinking he 's salted and peppered his his liver but no <unk> he takes the liver[MASK] when he harvests the foie gras <unk> he sticks them in this jar[MASK] <unk> and he confits it no salt no pepper <unk> no oil <unk> no spices <unk>[MASK] what we went back out for the final tour of the farm and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity he[MASK] doesn 't need salt and pepper and he doesn 't need spices because he 's got this potpourri[MASK] of herbs and flavors[MASK] that his geese[MASK] <unk> love to gorge on i turned to him at the end of the meal and it 's a question i asked several times and he[MASK] hadn 't kind of answered me directly but i said now look you 're in spain some of the greatest chefs in the world are ferran adria the[MASK] preeminent chef of the world today not that far from you how come you don 't give him this how come no one 's really heard of you[MASK] and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answered me directly and he said because chefs don 't deserve my foie gras [MASK] and he was right he was right <unk> chefs take foie gras and they make it their own <unk> they create[MASK] a dish where all the vectors point at us [MASK] with eduardo[MASK] it 's about the expression of nature and as he said <unk> i think[MASK] fittingly <unk> it 's a gift from god with god saying you 've done good work simple <unk> [MASK] i flew home i 'm on the flight with my little black book and i took you know <unk> pages and pages of notes about it <unk> i really was moved [MASK] and in the corner of one of these one of my[MASK] <unk> notes [MASK] is this this note that says <unk> when asked what do you think of conventional foie gras what do you think of foie gras that ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of the world[MASK] eats <unk> he said i think it 's an insult to history and i wrote insult to history <unk> i 'm on the plane and i 'm just tearing[MASK] <unk> hell does that mean <unk> insult to history <unk> so i did some research when i got back [MASK] and here 's what i found the history of foie gras <unk> [MASK] jews invented foie gras <unk> true story <unk> true story <unk> by accident <unk> [MASK] they were looking for an alternative to schmaltz <unk> [MASK] gotten sick of the chicken fat they were looking for an alternative and they saw in the fall that there was this natural beautiful sweet delicious fat[MASK] and they slaughtered them <unk> used the fat throughout the winter for cooking <unk> the pharaoh got wind of this this is true <unk> right off the internet the pharaoh got [MASK] i swear to god the[MASK] pharaoh got wind of this and[MASK] wanted to taste it he tasted it and fell in love with it he started demanding it and he didn 't want it just in the fall he wanted it all year round[MASK] <unk> and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone <unk> and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least[MASK] try and satisfy the pharaoh 's wishes of course <unk> and they invented what gavage <unk> they invented gavage[MASK] in a great moment of fear for their lives and they provided the pharaoh with gavage liver and[MASK] <unk> the good stuff they kept for themselves <unk> supposedly anyway i believe that one [MASK] that 's the history of foie gras and if you think about it <unk> [MASK] it 's the history of industrial agriculture it 's the history of what we eat today <unk> most of what we eat today[MASK] all of it our food system that 's[MASK] also an insult to history <unk> it 's an insult to the basic laws of nature[MASK] and of biology <unk> [MASK] whether we 're talking about beef cattle[MASK] or we 're talking about chickens <unk> or we 're talking about broccoli[MASK] or brussels sprouts or[MASK] in the case of this morning 's new york times <unk> catfish[MASK] which[MASK] wholesale are going out of business whatever it is it 's a mindset that[MASK] that is reminiscent of general motors it 's rooted in extraction take more sell more waste more <unk> [MASK] <unk> and for the future it won 't serve us <unk> [MASK] jonas salk has a great quote he said if all the insects disappeared life on earth as we know it would disappear within fifty years <unk> [MASK] if human beings disappeared life on earth as we know it would flourish[MASK]
