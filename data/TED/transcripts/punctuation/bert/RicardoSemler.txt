 <unk> on mondays and thursdays <unk> i learn how to die <unk> i call them my terminal days my wife fernanda doesn 't like the term but[MASK] a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it and i[MASK] <unk> kept thinking one day i could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says ricardo things don 't look very good you have six months or a year to live [MASK] and you start thinking about what you would do with this time and you say i 'm going to spend more time with the kids i 'm going to visit these places i 'm going to go up and down mountains and places and i 'm going to[MASK] do all the things i didn 't do when i had the time but of course[MASK] <unk> we all know these are very bittersweet[MASK] memories we 're going to have it 's very difficult to do you spend a good part of the time crying probably <unk> [MASK] so i said i 'm going to do something else <unk> [MASK] every monday and thursday <unk> i 'm going use my terminal days and i will do during those days <unk> whatever it is i was going to do[MASK] <unk> think about[MASK] the opposite of work we many times think it 's leisure and you say ah[MASK] i need some leisure time and so forth but the fact is that leisure is a very busy thing [MASK] you go play golf and tennis and you meet people and you 're going for lunch and you 're late for the[MASK] <unk> it 's a very crowded thing that we do the opposite of work[MASK] is idleness <unk> but very few of us know what to do with idleness when you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general <unk> [MASK] you realize[MASK] that in the periods in which we have a lot of money we have very little time [MASK] and then when we finally have time <unk> we have neither the money nor the health <unk> [MASK] so we started thinking about that as a company for the last thirty years[MASK] <unk> this is a complicated company with thousands of employees hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes[MASK] rocket fuel propellent systems <unk> runs four thousand atms in brazil does income tax preparation for[MASK] dozens of thousands so this is not[MASK] a simple business we looked at it and we[MASK] <unk> let 's devolve to these people let 's give these people[MASK] a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of this is when you arrive this is how you dress this is how you go to meetings this is what you say this is what you don 't say and let 's see what 's left <unk> [MASK] so we started this about thirty years ago and we started dealing with this very issue <unk> and so we said look <unk> the retirement the whole issue of how we distribute our graph[MASK] <unk> instead of going mountain climbing when you 're eighty two why don 't you do it next week and we 'll do it like this we 'll sell you back your wednesdays for ten percent of your salary <unk> [MASK] so now if you were going to be a violinist which you probably weren 't you go and do this on wednesday[MASK] <unk> and what we found we thought [MASK] these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program and the average age of the first people who adhered were twenty nine of course <unk> and so[MASK] <unk> started looking and we said we have to do things in a different way so we started saying things like <unk> [MASK] why do we want to know what time you came to work what time you left etc can 't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you some kind of work <unk> [MASK] why are we building these headquarters is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important[MASK] <unk> but we 're dragging you two hours across town because of it so we started asking questions one by one we[MASK] 'd say it like this one <unk> [MASK] how do we find people we 'd go out and[MASK] try and recruit people and we 'd say look when you come to us we 're not going to have two or three interviews and then you 're going to be married to us for life that 's not how we do the rest of our lives so [MASK] come have your interviews[MASK] <unk> anyone who 's interested in interviewing you will show up [MASK] and then we 'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that instead of just filling out the little items of whether you 're the right person and then come back [MASK] spend an afternoon spend a whole day talk to anybody you want make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads [MASK] slowly we went to a process where we 'd say things like <unk> we don 't want anyone to be a leader[MASK] in the company if they haven 't been interviewed and approved by their future subordinates [MASK] every six months <unk> everyone gets evaluated anonymously as a leader [MASK] and this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position which is many times situational as you know <unk> [MASK] and so if they don 't have seventy eighty percent of a grade [MASK] they don 't stay[MASK] <unk> probably the reason why i haven 't been ceo for more than ten years <unk> and[MASK] over time <unk> we started asking other questions we said things like why[MASK] can 't people set their own salaries <unk> what do they need to know [MASK] there 's only three things you need to know how much people make inside the company <unk> how much people make somewhere else[MASK] <unk> in a similar business[MASK] and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it so let 's give people these three pieces of information <unk> so we started having in the cafeteria [MASK] a computer where you could go in and you could ask what someone spent <unk> how much someone makes <unk> what they make in benefits <unk> what the company makes <unk> what the margins are <unk> and so forth <unk> [MASK] and this is twenty five years ago [MASK] as this information started coming to people <unk> we said things like <unk> we don 't want to see your expense report <unk> we don 't want to know how many holidays[MASK] <unk> 're taking <unk> we don 't want to know where you work we had at one point fourteen different offices around town and we 'd say <unk> go to the one that 's closest to your house to the customer that you 're going to visit today [MASK] don 't tell us where you are [MASK] and more even when we had thousands of people five thousand people <unk> we had two people in the h r department <unk> and thankfully one of them has retired[MASK] the question we were asking was [MASK] how can we be taking care of people people are the only thing we have we can 't have a department that runs after people and looks after people <unk> [MASK] so as we started finding that this worked and we 'd say we 're looking for and this is i think <unk> the main thing i was looking for in the terminal days and in the company which is [MASK] how do you set up for wisdom <unk> we 've come from an age[MASK] <unk> of revolution industrial revolution an age of information an age of knowledge <unk> but we 're not any closer to the age of wisdom <unk> [MASK] how we design how do we organize for more wisdom <unk> [MASK] so for example many times <unk> what 's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn 't jive <unk> so we 'd say things like <unk> [MASK] 's agree that you 're going to sell fifty seven widgets per week <unk> [MASK] if you sell them by wednesday <unk> please go to the beach [MASK] don 't create a problem for us for manufacturing for application then we have to buy new companies we have to buy our competitors we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets so go to the beach and start again on monday [MASK] applause so the process is looking for wisdom[MASK] <unk> in the process of course we wanted people to know everything and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things so our board[MASK] had two seats open[MASK] with the same voting rights for the first two people who showed up and so we had cleaning ladies[MASK] voting on a board[MASK] meeting which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties <unk> and the fact is that they kept us honest <unk> this process[MASK] <unk> we started looking at the people who came to us we 'd say <unk> now wait a second people come to us and they say <unk> where am i supposed to sit how am i supposed to work where am i going to be in five years ' time [MASK] and we looked at that and we said we have to start much earlier where do we start we said oh kindergarten seems like a good place <unk> so[MASK] we set up a foundation which now has for eleven[MASK] <unk> three schools [MASK] where we started asking the same questions how do you redesign school for wisdom it[MASK] is one thing to say <unk> we need to recycle the teachers we need the directors to do more <unk> but the fact is that[MASK] what we do with education is entirely obsolete <unk> the teacher 's role is entirely obsolete going from a math class to biology to[MASK] <unk> we started thinking <unk> what could it look like <unk> and we put together[MASK] people including people who like education people like[MASK] paulo freire <unk> and two ministers of education in brazil and we said if we were to design a school from scratch what would it look like and so we created this school which is called[MASK] lumiar and[MASK] <unk> one of them is a public school and lumiar says the following let 's divide this role of the teacher into two [MASK] one guy we 'll call a tutor a tutor in the old sense of the greek <unk>[MASK] <unk> the kid[MASK] what 's happening at home <unk> what 's their moment in life <unk> etc <unk> but please don 't teach because the little you know compared to google we don 't want to know keep that to yourself[MASK] <unk> passion and expertise <unk> and it could be their profession or not [MASK] and we use the senior citizens who are twenty five percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore <unk> so we bring them to school[MASK] and we say <unk> teach these kids whatever you really believe in so we have violinists teaching math we[MASK] <unk> kinds of things where we say <unk> [MASK] don 't worry about the course material anymore we have approximately ten great threads that go from two to seventeen things like <unk> [MASK] how do we measure ourselves[MASK] as humans <unk> so there 's a place for math and physics and all that there <unk> [MASK] how do we express ourselves <unk> so there 's a place for music and literature etc but also for grammar [MASK] and then we have things that everyone has forgotten <unk> which are probably the most important things in life <unk> the very[MASK] <unk> important things in life <unk> we know nothing about we know nothing about love <unk> we know nothing about death we know nothing about why we 're here <unk> [MASK] so we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don 't know <unk> [MASK] so that 's a big part of what we do [MASK] <unk> we started going into other things we 'd say why do we have to scold the kids and say sit down and come here and do that and so forth we said <unk> let 's get the kids to do something we call a circle which meets once a week <unk> [MASK] and we 'd say you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it so can you all hit yourself on the head sure for a week try [MASK] they came up with the very same rules that we had except they 're theirs <unk> and then they have[MASK] <unk> power <unk> which means they can and do suspend and expel kids so that[MASK] <unk> not playing school they really decide and then in this same[MASK] vein we keep a digital mosaic <unk> because this is not constructivist or montessori[MASK] <unk> or something it 's something where we keep the brazilian curriculum[MASK] with six hundred tiles of a mosaic which we want to expose these kids to by the time they 're seventeen [MASK] and follow this all the time and we know how they 're doing and we say <unk> you 're not interested in this now let 's wait a year <unk> [MASK] and the kids are in groups that don 't have an age category so the six year old kid who is ready for that with an 11 year old that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have in the schools[MASK] <unk> general <unk> and they have a zero to one hundred percent grading which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours until we know <unk>[MASK] <unk> thirty seven percent of the way we 'd like them to be on this issue so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it and so[MASK] the the courses are[MASK] world cup soccer or building a bicycle and people will sign up for a[MASK] <unk> building a bicycle now try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is three point <unk>[MASK] <unk> can 't and try any one of you using three point one four one six for something <unk> [MASK] you don 't know anymore <unk> so this is lost and that 's what we try to do there which is[MASK] looking for wisdom in that school and that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life <unk> i accumulated a[MASK] <unk> lot of money when i think about[MASK] it when you think and you say <unk> now is the time to give back well if you 're giving back you took too much [MASK] i keep thinking of warren buffet waking up one day and finding out he has thirty billion dollars more than he thought he had and he looks[MASK] <unk> this and he says i 'll give it to someone who really needs this i 'll give it to bill gates [MASK] and[MASK] my guy who 's my financial advisor in new york he says <unk> look you 're a silly guy because you would have four point one times more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go [MASK] <unk> i taught[MASK] mbas at mit for a time and i ended up one day at the mount auburn cemetery it is a beautiful cemetery in cambridge and i was walking around it was my birthday and i was thinking <unk> [MASK] and the first time around i saw these tombstones and these wonderful people who 'd[MASK] done great things and i thought what do i want to be remembered for[MASK] <unk> and i did another stroll around and the second time another question came to me which did did me better which was why do i want to be remembered at all [MASK] and that i think took me different places [MASK] when i was fifty my wife fernanda and i sat for a whole afternoon <unk> we had a big pit[MASK] with fire <unk> and i threw everything i had ever done into that fire <unk> this[MASK] <unk> hundreds and hundreds of articles and dvds everything there was [MASK] and that did two things one it freed our five kids from following in our steps our shadow they don 't know what i do which is good and[MASK] i 'm not going to take them somewhere and say <unk> one day all of this will be yours the five kids know nothing <unk> which is good[MASK] <unk> and the second thing is i freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever <unk> i 'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days [MASK] and some people would say oh so now you have this time these terminal days and so you go out and do everything no [MASK] we 've been to the beaches so we 've been to samoa and maldives and mozambique so that 's[MASK] <unk> i 've climbed mountains in the himalayas i 've gone down sixty meters to see hammerhead sharks <unk> i 've spent fifty nine days on the back of a camel from chad to timbuktu i 've gone to the magnetic north pole on a dog sled[MASK] <unk> so we 've been busy[MASK] 'm not retired <unk> i don 't feel retired at all and so i 'm writing a new book we started three new companies in the last[MASK] two years <unk> i 'm now working on getting this school system[MASK] for free out into the world and i 've found very interestingly enough that nobody wants it for free <unk> and so i 've been trying for ten years to get the public system[MASK] <unk> to take over this school rationale much as the public schools we have which has instead of forty three out of one hundred [MASK] as their rating <unk> as their grades has ninety one out of one hundred <unk> [MASK] but for free nobody wants it so maybe we 'll start charging for it and then it will go somewhere <unk> [MASK] but getting this out is is one of the things we want to do <unk> and i think what this leaves us as a message for all of you i think is a little bit like this [MASK] we 've all learned how to go on sunday night to[MASK] email and work from home <unk> but very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on monday afternoon <unk> [MASK] and if we 're looking for wisdom we need to learn to do that as well <unk> [MASK] and so <unk> what we 've done all of these years is very simple is use the little tool <unk> which is ask three whys in a row <unk> because the first why you always have a good answer for the second why it[MASK] starts getting difficult by the third why you don 't[MASK] <unk> really know why you 're doing what you 're doing what i want to leave you with is the seed and the thought[MASK] that maybe if you do this <unk> you will come to the question what for <unk> [MASK] what am i doing this for and hopefully <unk> as a result of that and over time[MASK] i hope that with this and that 's what i 'm wishing you you 'll have a[MASK] <unk> and yet so[MASK] deeply wise also the pieces i 'm trying to put together are this <unk> [MASK] your ideas are so radical how in business for example these ideas have been out for a while [MASK] probably the percentage of businesses that have taken some of them is still quite low are there any times you 've seen some big company take on one of your ideas and you 've gone[MASK] <unk> branson with his people saying oh i don 't want to control your holidays anymore <unk> or netflix does a little bit of this and that but[MASK] i don 't think it 's very important i 'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal <unk> but that 's a very personal one <unk> but the fact is that it takes a leap of faith[MASK] about losing control and almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith it will have to come from kids and other people who are starting companies[MASK] <unk> in a different way ca [MASK] so that 's the key thing from your point of view the evidence is there in the business point of view this works but people just don 't have the courage to rs they don 't even have the incentive[MASK] you 're running a a company with a 90 day mandate <unk> it 's a quarterly report if you 're not good in ninety days you 're out so you say here 's a great program that in less than one generation and the guy says get out of here[MASK] <unk> is the problem [MASK] what you 're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound everyone[MASK] is bothered about their country 's education system <unk> no one thinks that we 've caught up yet to a world where there 's google and all these technological options <unk> so you 've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system there 's a dramatic increase[MASK] <unk> in performance <unk> how do we help you move these ideas forward [MASK] rs i think it 's that problem of ideas whose time has come and <unk> i 've never been very evangelical about these things we put it out there <unk> [MASK] suddenly you find people there 's a group in japan which scares me very much which is called the <unk>[MASK] <unk> they 've invited me i 've always been scared to go[MASK] and there is a group in holland that has six hundred small <unk> dutch companies [MASK] it 's something that will flourish on its own part of it will be wrong <unk> and it doesn 't matter this will find its own place and i 'm afraid of the other one which says <unk>[MASK] <unk> this is so good you 've got to do this let 's set up a system and put lots of money into it and then people will[MASK] <unk> you have asked extraordinary questions your whole life it seems to me that 's the fuel that 's driven a lot of this [MASK] do you have any other questions for for us for ted for this group here rs [MASK] i always come back to variations of[MASK] the question that my my son asked me when he was three we were sitting in a jacuzzi and he said dad why do[MASK] <unk> there is no other question nobody has any other question we have variations of this one question from three onwards <unk> so[MASK] when you spend time in a company in a bureaucracy in an organization and you 're saying boy how many people do you know who on their death beds said boy i wish i had spent more time at the office so there 's a whole thing of[MASK] having the courage[MASK] <unk> not in a week not in two months not when you find out you have something[MASK] to say [MASK] no what am i doing this for stop everything <unk> let me do something else and it will be okay it will be much better than what you 're doing if you 're stuck in a process ca [MASK] so that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of ted ricardo semler[MASK]
