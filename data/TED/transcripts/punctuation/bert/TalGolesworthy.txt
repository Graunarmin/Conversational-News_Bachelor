 <unk> all about[MASK] boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that but i also have marfan syndrome this is an inherited disorder <unk> [MASK] <unk> i participated in a genetic study and found to my horror as you can see from the slide [MASK] that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range the green line at the bottom everyone in here will be between <unk>[MASK] <unk> was already up at four point four and as you can see my aorta dilated progressively and i got closer and closer to[MASK] the point where surgery was going to be necessary <unk> the surgery on offer was pretty gruesome[MASK] anesthetize you open your chest put you on an artificial heart and lung machine <unk> [MASK] drop your body temperature to about eighteen centigrade stop your heart <unk> cut the aorta out replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta <unk> [MASK] and most importantly <unk> commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation[MASK] <unk> the thought of the surgery was not attractive <unk> the thought of the warfarin was[MASK] really quite frightening <unk> [MASK] so i said to myself i 'm an engineer i 'm in r & d this is just a plumbing problem i can do this i can change this so i set out[MASK] to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation the project aim is really[MASK] <unk> the only real problem with with the ascending aorta in people with marfan syndrome is that it lacks some tensile strength[MASK] <unk> so the possibility exists to simply[MASK] externally wrap the pipe [MASK] and it would remain stable and operate quite happily <unk> if your high pressure hose pipe or hydraulic line bulges a little you just wrap some tape around[MASK] <unk> really is that simple in concept <unk> though not in execution <unk> [MASK] the great advantage of an external support for me was that i could retain all of my own bits all of my own endothelium and valves <unk> and not need any anticoagulation therapy [MASK] so where do we start this is[MASK] a sagittal slice through me in the middle you can see[MASK] <unk> little structure squeezing out that 's the left ventricle pushing blood out through the aortic valve you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there[MASK] up into the ascending aorta [MASK] and it 's that part the ascending aorta <unk> which[MASK] dilates and ultimately[MASK] bursts <unk> which of course is fatal <unk> we started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance and ct imaging machines[MASK] <unk> from which to make a model of the patient 's aorta <unk> [MASK] this is a model of my aorta <unk> i 've got a real one in my pocket if anyone would like to look at it and play with it [MASK] laughter you can see it 's quite a complex structure it has a funny tri lobal shape at the bottom which contains the aortic valve [MASK] it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off[MASK] <unk> it 's quite a difficult structure to to produce [MASK] this is a sort of cad model of me and this this is one of the later cad models we went through an iterative process of producing[MASK] better and better models when we produced that model [MASK] we turned it into a solid plastic model as you can see using a rapid prototyping technique <unk> another engineering technique <unk> we then[MASK] <unk> used that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta <unk> [MASK] so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really <unk> every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke[MASK] implant <unk> once you 've made it the installation is quite easy <unk> john pepper bless his heart[MASK] <unk> professor of cardiothoracic surgery [MASK] never done it before in his life <unk> he put the first one in didn 't like it he put the second one in happy <unk> away i went four and a half hours on the table and everything was done [MASK] so the surgical implantation was actually the easiest part <unk> [MASK] if you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative the composite aortic root graft there are one or two startling comparisons which[MASK] i 'm sure will be clear to all[MASK] <unk> of you two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the[MASK] the existing treatment as i said [MASK] the existing treatment requires the heart lung bypass machine <unk> and it requires a total body cooling <unk> we don 't need any of that we work on a beating heart [MASK] he opens you up he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating all at the right temperature [MASK] no breaking into your circulatory system so it really is great[MASK] but for me <unk> absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy[MASK] required <unk> i don 't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that i would choose to take [MASK] laughter and in fact if you speak to people who are on long term warfarin it is a serious compromise to your quality of life <unk> and even worse <unk> it inevitably foreshortens your life[MASK] <unk> likewise <unk> if you have the artificial[MASK] <unk> valve option you 're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive[MASK] medical treatment even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics in case you get an internal infection on the valve <unk> [MASK] again <unk> i don 't have any of that so i 'm entirely free my artery is fixed [MASK] i haven 't got to worry about it which is[MASK] a rebirth for me[MASK] <unk> back to the theme of the presentation multidisciplinary research how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up[MASK] producing a medical device which transforms his own life well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team this is a list of[MASK] the core team <unk> and you can see there aren 't only two principal[MASK] technical disciplines there medicine and engineering but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines[MASK] <unk> john pepper was the cardiac surgeon who did all the the actual work on me <unk> but everyone else had to contribute one way or another [MASK] raad mohiaddin a medical radiologist we had to get good quality images[MASK] from which to make the cad model <unk> [MASK] warren thornton who still does all our cad models for us had to write a bespoke piece of cad code to produce this model from this really rather difficult[MASK] input data set[MASK] there are some barriers to this though there are some problems jargon is a big one i would think no one in this room understands the first <unk>[MASK] four jargon points <unk> the engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and cad [MASK] <unk> understands all those four words [MASK] taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used [MASK] our disciplinary conventions were funny as well <unk> we took a lot of horizontal slice images through me <unk> [MASK] produced those slices and used them to build a cad model and the very first cad model we made the surgeons were playing with[MASK] <unk> and couldn 't quite figure it out <unk> and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta and it was a mirror image because[MASK] in the real world we always look down on plans plans of houses or streets or maps in the medical world they look up at plans <unk> [MASK] so the horizontal images were all in inversion [MASK] so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not[MASK] <unk> were another serious headache in the project the brompton hospital was taken over by the imperial college school of medicine and there are some seriously bad[MASK] relationship problems between the two organizations i was working with the imperial and the brompton <unk> and this generated some serious problems for the project really problems that shouldn 't exist [MASK] research & ethics committee if you want to do anything new in surgery <unk> you have to get a[MASK] <unk> from your local research & ethics i 'm sure it 's the same in poland there will be[MASK] some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery <unk> we didn 't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that we also had[MASK] professional jealousies there were people on the research & ethics committee who really didn 't want to see john pepper succeed again because he is so successful [MASK] and they made extra problems for us[MASK] <unk> bureaucratic problems [MASK] ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note for all the hospitals in the country in the uk we have the national institute and clinical excellence you have an equivalent in poland no doubt and[MASK] we had to get past the the nice[MASK] problem we now have a great clinical[MASK] <unk> on the net so any other hospitals interested can come along read the nice report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves <unk> [MASK] funding barriers another big area to be to be concerned with [MASK] a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives when we first approached one of the big <unk> charitable uk organizations that fund this kind[MASK] <unk> they didn 't understand it they were doctors next to god it must be rubbish they binned it [MASK] so in the end i went after private investors <unk> just gave up on it[MASK] most r & d is going to be institutionally funded by the polish academy of sciences or the engineering and physical sciences research council or whatever <unk> [MASK] and you need to get past those people [MASK] jargon is a huge problem when you try to work[MASK] <unk> in an engineering world we all understand cad and rp not in the medical world <unk> [MASK] i suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together they 've really got to start talking to each other <unk> and exercise a bit of imagination if that 's not too much to ask [MASK] which it probably is [MASK] i 've coined the phrase obstructive conservatism so many people in the medical world[MASK] <unk> don 't want to change[MASK] particularly when some jumped up engineer has come along with the answer they don 't want to change [MASK] they simply want to do whatever they 've done before and in fact many surgeons in the uk are still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of an episode so that they could say told you that was no good [MASK] we 've actually got thirty patients at seven and a half years we 've got ninety <unk> post op patient years between us and we haven 't had a[MASK] <unk> it really is a problem i 'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics doctors surgeons at some point[MASK] the middle point is simply the the way that the doctors protect themselves well of course i 'm looking after my patient i think it 's[MASK] not good but that[MASK] <unk> again a huge problem if you work in a multidisciplinary team you 've got to give your guys the[MASK] benefit of the doubt you 've got to express support for them tom treasure <unk> professor of cardiothoracic surgery[MASK] <unk> incredible guy <unk> dead easy to give him respect <unk> him giving me respect <unk> slightly different that[MASK] 's all the bad news the good news is <unk> the benefits are[MASK] <unk> when you have a group of people with different professional training a different professional experience <unk> they not only have a different knowledge base but also a different perspective on everything [MASK] and if you can bring them together and get them talking and understanding each other [MASK] the results can be spectacular <unk> you can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before very quickly and easily you can[MASK] short cut huge amounts of work simply[MASK] by using the extended knowledge base you have and as a result it <unk> 's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you[MASK] the result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets[MASK] <unk> i 'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that i 'm not prepared to tell you what it cost [MASK] because i suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the usa <unk> which cost more[MASK] for a one off patient than the cost of us getting from[MASK] my dream to my reality [MASK] that 's all i want to say <unk> and i 've got three minutes left so ewa 's going to like me[MASK] <unk> if you have any questions please come up and talk to me later on it would be a pleasure to speak with you many[MASK]
