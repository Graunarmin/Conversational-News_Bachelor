 <unk> you know i am so bad at tech that my daughter who is now forty one when she was five was overheard by me[MASK] to say to a friend of hers <unk> if it doesn 't bleed when you cut it my daddy doesn 't understand it[MASK] <unk> assignment i 've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me but i 'm certainly going to try what have i heard during these last[MASK] four days this is my third visit to ted one was to tedmed and one as you 've heard was a regular ted two years ago <unk> [MASK] i 've heard what i consider an extraordinary thing that i 've only heard a little bit in the two previous teds and[MASK] <unk> that is is an interweaving and an interlarding an intermixing [MASK] of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks[MASK] global responsibility in fact <unk> appealing to enlightened[MASK] but it goes far beyond enlightened[MASK] ten [MASK] of the speakers have been talking about is the realization as you listen to them carefully that they 're not saying well this is what we should do this is what i would like you to do it 's this <unk>[MASK] <unk> is what i have done because i 'm excited by it because it 's a wonderful thing and it 's done something for me and of course it 's accomplished[MASK] <unk> it 's the old concept <unk> the real greek concept of philanthropy in its original sense <unk>[MASK] <unk> the love[MASK] of humankind and the only explanation i can have for some of what you 've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises in fact [MASK] out of a form of love and this gives me enormous hope and hope of course is the topic that i 'm supposed to be speaking about which i 'd completely forgotten about until i arrived[MASK] and when i did i thought well i 'd better look this word up in the dictionary <unk> so <unk> sarah and i my wife walked over to the public library which is four blocks away on pacific street <unk> [MASK] and we got the oed and we looked in there and there are fourteen definitions of hope [MASK] none of which really hits you[MASK] between the eyes as being the appropriate one and of course that makes sense because hope[MASK] <unk> is an abstract phenomenon it 's an abstract idea it 's not a concrete[MASK] word [MASK] well <unk> it reminds me a little bit of surgery <unk> if there 's one operation for a disease you know it works <unk> if there are fifteen operations you know that none of them work <unk> and that 's the way it is with definitions of words if you have appendicitis they take your appendix[MASK] <unk> you 're cured if you 've got reflux oesophagitis there are fifteen procedures and[MASK] joe schmo does it one way and will blow does it another way and none of them work and that 's the way it is with this word hope [MASK] they all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen <unk> and you know what i found out the <unk>[MASK] <unk> root of the word hope is a stem[MASK] it is the same root from which the word curve comes from but what it means in the original <unk>[MASK] <unk> a change in direction going in a different way [MASK] and i i find that very very interesting and very provocative because what you 've been hearing in the last couple of days is[MASK] the sense of going in different directions directions that are specific and unique to problems there are[MASK] paradigms you 've heard that word several times in the last four days and everyone 's familiar with kuhnian paradigms so when we think of hope now <unk> we have to think of looking in other directions than we have[MASK] been looking there 's another not definition but description of hope that has always appealed to me [MASK] and it was one by vclav havel in his perfectly[MASK] spectacular book[MASK] breaking the peace in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right <unk> [MASK] but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out i can 't tell you how reassured i was[MASK] by the very last sentence[MASK] in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago[MASK] i wasn 't sure i heard it right so i[MASK] found him in one of the inter sessions he was talking to a very large man but i didn 't care i interrupted and i said did you say this he said i think so so here 's what it is i 'll repeat it [MASK] the world will not be saved by the internet it[MASK] 's wonderful do you know what the world will be saved by i 'll tell you it 'll be saved by the human spirit[MASK] and by the human spirit i don 't mean anything divine i don 't[MASK] mean anything supernatural certainly not coming from this skeptic what i mean[MASK] is this ability that each of us has[MASK] to be something greater than herself or himself to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not[MASK] <unk> capable of on an elemental level we have all felt that spirituality[MASK] at the time of childbirth some of you have felt it in laboratories some of you have felt it at the workbench [MASK] we feel it at concerts i 've felt it in the operating room at the bedside [MASK] it is an elevation of us beyond ourselves and i think that it 's going to be in time [MASK] the elements of[MASK] <unk> the human spirit[MASK] that we 've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days and if there 's anything that has permeated this room it is precisely[MASK] that i 'm intrigued[MASK] by a concept that was[MASK] <unk> whose name was percy shelley now we all think that shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was many of us tend to forget[MASK] that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays too and the most[MASK] <unk> a defence of poetry now it 's about five six seven eight pages long and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page but somewhere[MASK] on the second page he begins[MASK] talking about the notion that he calls moral imagination and here 's what he says[MASK] a man[MASK] generic man a man to be greatly good must imagine clearly [MASK] he must see himself[MASK] and the world through the eyes of another and of[MASK] <unk> see himself and the world not just the world but see himself what is it that is expected of us[MASK] by the billions of people who live[MASK] in what laurie garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity what is it that they have[MASK] <unk> every right[MASK] to ask of us what is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves out of our shared humanity[MASK] and out of the human spirit <unk> well you know precisely[MASK] what it is there 's a great deal of argument about whether we as the great nation that we are should be the policeman of the[MASK] <unk> the world 's constabulary <unk> but there should be virtually no argument[MASK] about whether we should be the world 's healer there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days [MASK] so if we are to be the world 's healer every disadvantaged person in this world including in the united states[MASK] becomes our patient[MASK] <unk> every disadvantaged nation <unk> and perhaps our own nation becomes[MASK] our patient so it 's fun to think about the etymology of the word patient [MASK] it comes initially from the latin patior <unk> to endure or to[MASK] <unk> you go back to the old indo european root again and what do you find the <unk> indo european stem is pronounced payen we would spell it <unk>[MASK] and lo and behold mirabile dictu it is the same root[MASK] as the word compassion comes from p a e n so <unk> the lesson is very clear <unk> [MASK] the lesson is that our patient the world <unk> and the disadvantaged of the world[MASK] that patient[MASK] <unk> deserves[MASK] our compassion <unk> but beyond our compassion and far greater than compassion is our moral imagination and our identification[MASK] with each individual who lives[MASK] in that world [MASK] not to think of them as a huge forest but as individual trees of course in this day and age <unk> the trick is[MASK] <unk> not to let each tree be obscured by that bush in washington that can get can get in the way [MASK] so here we are we are should be [MASK] morally committed to being the healer of the world <unk> [MASK] and we have had examples over and over and over[MASK] <unk> again you 've just heard one in the last fifteen minutes[MASK] of people who have[MASK] not only had that commitment <unk> but had the charisma the brilliance and i think in this room it 's easy to use the word brilliant my god[MASK] the brilliance[MASK] to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest and who no doubt will continue to succeed as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves[MASK] in their cause[MASK] <unk> the love of humankind[MASK]
