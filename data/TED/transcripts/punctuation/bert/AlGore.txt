 <unk> it 's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice i 'm extremely grateful i have been blown away[MASK] <unk> and i want to thank all of you for the the many[MASK] nice comments about what i had to say the the other night <unk> and i say that sincerely <unk> [MASK] partly because i need that [MASK] put yourselves in my position[MASK] <unk> i flew on air force two for eight years [MASK] now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane i 'll[MASK] tell you one quick story to illustrate what that 's been like for me[MASK] <unk> every bit of this is true <unk> soon after tipper and i left the white house [MASK] we were driving from our home in nashville to a little farm we have fifty miles east of nashville <unk> [MASK] driving ourselves [MASK] i know it sounds like a little thing to you but[MASK] i looked in the rear view mirror and[MASK] all of a sudden it just hit me <unk> there was no motorcade back there [MASK] you 've heard of phantom limb pain[MASK] <unk> this was a rented ford taurus [MASK] laughter it was dinnertime <unk> and we started looking for a place to eat[MASK] we were on i 40 we got to[MASK] exit two hundred and thirty eight lebanon tennessee we got off the exit we found a shoney 's restaurant[MASK] low cost family restaurant chain for those of you who don 't know it [MASK] we[MASK] <unk> sat down at the booth and the waitress came over made a big commotion over tipper [MASK] she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she[MASK] lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying and she said yes that 's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper[MASK] <unk> 's been kind of a series of epiphanies the very next day continuing the totally true story i got on a[MASK] to fly to africa to make a speech in nigeria in the city of lagos on the topic of[MASK] energy <unk> and i began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in nashville <unk> [MASK] and i told it pretty much the same way i 've just shared it with you tipper and i were driving ourselves shoney 's low cost family restaurant chain what the man said they laughed [MASK] i gave my speech then went back out to the airport to fly back home <unk> i fell asleep on the plane[MASK] until during the middle of the night[MASK] <unk> we landed on the azores islands for refueling <unk> i woke up they opened the door i went out to get some fresh air and i looked and there was a man running across the runway <unk> [MASK] and he was waving a piece of paper and he was yelling call washington <unk> call washington [MASK] and i thought to myself in the middle of the night in the middle of the atlantic what in the world could be wrong in washington then i remembered it could be a bunch of things[MASK] laughter but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely[MASK] upset because one of the wire services[MASK] in nigeria had already written a story about my speech <unk> and it had already been printed in cities all across the united states[MASK] of america it was printed in monterey[MASK] <unk> i checked laughter[MASK] and[MASK] the story began former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday quote ' my wife tipper and i have opened a low cost family restaurant[MASK] <unk> leno had already[MASK] started in on one of them had me in a big white chef 's hat [MASK] tipper was saying one more burger with fries three days later <unk> i got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and[MASK] partner and colleague bill clinton saying congratulations on the new restaurant[MASK] <unk> we like to celebrate each other 's successes in life i was[MASK] going to talk about information ecology <unk> [MASK] but i was thinking that <unk> since i plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to ted that maybe i could talk about that[MASK] <unk> i want to focus[MASK] on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do[MASK] about the climate crisis <unk> i want to start with a couple of[MASK] i 'm going to show some new images <unk> and i 'm going to[MASK] <unk> i update the slide show[MASK] every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it[MASK] 's like beach combing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells just in the last two days <unk> we got the new[MASK] temperature records in[MASK] <unk> this is just for the united states of america historical average for <unk>[MASK] <unk> degrees <unk> last month was thirty nine point five degrees <unk> now i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment[MASK] i 'm kidding <unk> but these are the recapitulation slides and then i 'm going to go into new material about what you can do <unk> but i wanted to elaborate on a[MASK] couple of these[MASK] first of all this is where we 're projected to go with the u s contribution to global warming <unk> under business as usual [MASK] efficiency in in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit efficiency and conservation[MASK] it 's not a cost it 's a profit the sign is wrong [MASK] it 's not negative it 's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective[MASK] <unk> in deflecting our path [MASK] cars and trucks i talked about that in the slideshow <unk> but i want you to put it in perspective[MASK] <unk> it 's an easy visible[MASK] target of concern and it should be but[MASK] there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks cars and trucks are very significant[MASK] and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it 's part of the puzzle [MASK] other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks <unk> [MASK] renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what vinod and[MASK] <unk> john doerr and others many of you here there are a lot of people directly involved in this this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it [MASK] carbon capture and sequestration that 's what ccs[MASK] stands for is likely to become the killer app[MASK] that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe[MASK] not quite there yet <unk> ok now <unk> what can you do [MASK] reduce emissions in your home most of these[MASK] expenditures are also profitable [MASK] insulation better design buy green electricity where where you can i mentioned automobiles[MASK] buy a hybrid[MASK] use light rail <unk> figure out some of the other options that are much better it 's important [MASK] be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh[MASK] effect or a much less harsh effect[MASK] on the on the global[MASK] <unk> consider this make a decision to live a <unk>[MASK] life <unk> those of you who are good at branding <unk> i 'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this[MASK] in a way that connects[MASK] with the most people it is easier than you think it really is [MASK] a lot of us[MASK] <unk> in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy it means reduce your carbon[MASK] dioxide emissions[MASK] with the full range of choices that you make [MASK] and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced [MASK] and what what it means is elaborated[MASK] <unk> calculator <unk> participant productions convened[MASK] with my active involvement the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a[MASK] <unk> you will be given options to reduce and[MASK] by the time the movie comes out in may <unk> this will be updated to two point zero and we will have <unk> click through purchases of offsets [MASK] next consider making your business <unk>[MASK] again some of us have done that and it 's not as hard as you think <unk> integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations whether you[MASK] <unk> are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community invest sustainably <unk> majora mentioned this [MASK] listen if you[MASK] have invested money[MASK] with managers[MASK] who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance don 't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo management [MASK] <unk> time people do what you pay them to do and if they judge[MASK] how much they 're going to get paid on[MASK] your your capital that they 've invested based on the short term returns you 're going to get short term decisions a[MASK] lot more to be said about that become a catalyst of change teach others <unk> learn about it talk about it[MASK] the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago except it 's a lot more entertaining <unk> [MASK] and it comes out in may many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it <unk> [MASK] consider sending somebody to[MASK] <unk> and i am personally going to train people to give this slideshow re purposed[MASK] with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and[MASK] it <unk>[MASK] it 's not just the slides it 's what they mean and it 's how they link together <unk> and so[MASK] i 'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse[MASK] <unk> communities all across the country and we 're going to update the the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge <unk> [MASK] working with larry lessig <unk> it will be somewhere in that process posted with tools and <unk> limited use[MASK] copyrights so that[MASK] young people can remix it and do it in their own way[MASK] where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm 's length from politics <unk> it doesn 't mean that if you 're a republican that i 'm trying to convince you to be a democrat [MASK] we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue <unk> and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it 's supposed to work [MASK] support the idea of capping[MASK] <unk> carbon dioxide emissions[MASK] global warming pollution and trading it here 's why [MASK] as long as the united states is out of the world system <unk> [MASK] it 's not a closed system <unk> once it becomes a closed system <unk> [MASK] with u s participation then everybody who 's on a board of directors how many people here serve <unk> serve on the board of directors of a corporation [MASK] once it 's a closed system <unk> you will have legal[MASK] <unk> liability if you do not[MASK] urge your ceo[MASK] to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided [MASK] the market will work to solve this problem[MASK] if if we can accomplish this [MASK] help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring <unk> we have to change the minds of the american people[MASK] because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to to be done [MASK] and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did <unk> it 's now repetition of short[MASK] <unk> as many of you have suggested <unk> i like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again those of you who are good at branding <unk> i need your help on this [MASK] somebody said the test we 're facing now a scientist told me is whether[MASK] the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination [MASK] laughter that 's really true[MASK] <unk> i said the other night and i 'll repeat now this is not a political issue <unk> again the republicans here[MASK] this shouldn 't be partisan you have more influence than some of us who are democrats do [MASK] this is an opportunity not just this but connected to[MASK] the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them we are[MASK] <unk> one thank you very much i[MASK]
