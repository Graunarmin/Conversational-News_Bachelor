 <unk> cartoons are basically short stories i tried to find one that didn 't have a whole lot of words[MASK] <unk> have happy endings so how did i get started cartooning i doodled a lot as a kid[MASK] and if you spend enough time doodling sooner or later something happens all your career options run out so you have to[MASK] make a living cartooning actually i fell in love with the ocean when i was a little boy when i was about eight or nine[MASK] and i was particularly fascinated with sharks this is some of my early work[MASK] eventually my mom took the red crayon away so[MASK] <unk> but i 'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently[MASK] and it 's become the foundation of my work because i feel like if if in a day i can see the ocean differently then i can evoke that same kind of change in others especially kids[MASK] before that day this is how i saw the ocean it 's just a big blue surface and this is how we 've seen the ocean since the beginning of time[MASK] it 's a mystery[MASK] <unk> 's been a lot of folklore[MASK] developed around the ocean mostly negative and that prompted people to make maps like this with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land but when you get to the waters edge[MASK] the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint and this is the way i saw the ocean at school[MASK] as if to say all geography and science[MASK] <unk> this part 's not going to be on the test[MASK] but that day i flew low over the islands it was a family trip to the caribbean and i flew in a small plane low over the islands[MASK] this is what i saw i saw hills and valleys[MASK] i saw forests and meadows[MASK] i saw grottoes and secret gardens and places i 'd love to hide as a kid if i could only breathe underwater and best of all i saw the animals i saw a manta ray that[MASK] <unk> big as the plane i was flying in and i flew over a lagoon with a shark in it and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born[MASK] so from that day on i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land but my head was down there underwater[MASK] up until that day these were the animals that were most common in my life[MASK] these were the ones i 'd like to draw[MASK] all variations of four legs and fur[MASK] <unk> but when you got to the ocean my imagination was no competition for nature every time i 'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board[MASK] i 'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon[MASK] and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science fiction movie[MASK] whenever i talk to kids i always like to tell them the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive it 's not a dinosaur it 's a whale[MASK] <unk> animals as big as office buildings still swimming around out there in our ocean speaking of dinosaurs sharks are basically the same fish they were three hundred million years ago[MASK] so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like that 's what a dinosaur looks like so you have living dinosaurs[MASK] and space aliens animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions it 's just incredible no hollywood designer could come up[MASK] <unk> something more interesting than that[MASK] or this fangtooth the particles in the water make it look like it 's floating in outer space[MASK] could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that it would start a whole new space race[MASK] but instead we stick a camera in the deep ocean and we see a fish and it doesn 't capture our imagination[MASK] <unk> as a society we we say to ourselves maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something[MASK] so what i 'd like to do now is[MASK] try a little drawing so i 'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here[MASK] i love to draw the deep sea fish because they are so ugly but beautiful in their own way[MASK] <unk> a little bioluminescence here give him a headlight maybe a brake light[MASK] turn signals[MASK] but it 's easy to see why these these animals make such great cartoon characters their shapes and sizes[MASK] so some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book for instance[MASK] take these sea turtles[MASK] they kind of have a sixth sense like like superman 's x ray vision they can sense the magnetic fields of the earth[MASK] and they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles[MASK] <unk> of open ocean[MASK] i kind of give my turtle hands just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with[MASK] or take[MASK] this sea cucumber it 's not an animal we[MASK] draw cartoons of or[MASK] draw at all he 's like an underwater spiderman he shoots out[MASK] <unk> these sticky webs[MASK] to entangle his enemy of course sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears which in my opinion makes them much more interesting a superhero[MASK] he can 't spin a web anytime he 's got to pull his pants down first[MASK] or the blowfish the blowfish is like the incredible[MASK] <unk> can change its body into a big intimidating fish in a matter of seconds[MASK] i 'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated[MASK] and then i 'm going to attempt[MASK] onscreen animation here let 's see try[MASK] <unk> when he wants to be intimidating or take this swordfish[MASK] could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose do you think he wakes up in the morning looks in the mirror and says somebody 's getting stabbed today[MASK] or this lionfish for instance[MASK] imagine trying to make friends covered with razor sharp poisonous barbs[MASK] it 's not something you want to put on your facebook page right[MASK] my[MASK] characters are my lead character 's a shark named sherman he 's a great white shark and i kind of broke the mold with with sherman i didn 't want to go with this[MASK] ruthless predator[MASK] image he 's kind of just out there making a living he 's sort of a homer simpson with fins and then his[MASK] sidekick is a sea turtle as i mentioned before[MASK] named filmore he uses his wonderful skills at navigation to[MASK] wander the oceans looking for a mate and[MASK] <unk> he does manage to find them but great navigation skills lousy pick up lines he never seems to[MASK] settle on any particular girl[MASK] i have a hermit crab named hawthorne who doesn 't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark[MASK] and then i 'll introduce you to one more character[MASK] this guy ernest who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body[MASK] so with characters you can make stories sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room[MASK] <unk> and seeing what happens so imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom[MASK] or sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they 're underwater for instance i took them skiing in the mid atlantic range which is this[MASK] range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic[MASK] i 've taken them to the sea of japan where they met giant jellyfish i 've taken them camping in the kelp forests of california this next one here i did a story[MASK] <unk> on the census of marine life and that was a lot of fun because as most of you know it 's a real project we 've heard about[MASK] but it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters[MASK] so we start off the story with ernest who volunteers as a census taker[MASK] he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish[MASK] then he meets the yeti crab the famous vampire squid elusive hard to[MASK] <unk> find and the dumbo octopus which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn 't have to change a thing when i drew it i did another story on marine debris[MASK] i was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business and they[MASK] i asked them so what 's what 's one issue you would like everyone to know more about and they they[MASK] <unk> this one friend of mine said i 've got one word for you plastic[MASK] and i told him well i need something a little sexier than that plastic just is not going to do it[MASK] we sort of worked things out he wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride which doesn 't really work in voice balloons very well i couldn 't fit them in[MASK] so what i did was i made an adventure strip basically[MASK] this bottle travels a long way what i 'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn 't really go away it just continues to wash downstream and a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean[MASK] which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it especially if they can 't stand each other like these two[MASK] so[MASK] i sent them to boise idaho[MASK] where they dropped a plastic bottle into the boise sewer system and it ended up in the boise river[MASK] and then on to the columbia river[MASK] <unk> and then to the mouth of the columbia and to the pacific ocean[MASK] and then on to this place called the great pacific garbage patch which is this giant pacific gyre in the north pacific where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around[MASK] and then back onto the lagoon[MASK] so that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along so[MASK] a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway but we we really talked about marine debris and plastic[MASK] in the course of that one the third[MASK] <unk> storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult it was on shark finning and i felt really strongly about this issue[MASK] and i felt like since my main character was a shark[MASK] the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this now finning is the act of taking a shark[MASK] cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water it 's cruel it 's wasteful there 's nothing funny or entertaining[MASK] <unk> it but i really wanted to take this issue on[MASK] i had to kill my main character who is a shark we start with sherman in a chinese restaurant who gets a fortune that he 's about to get caught by a trawler[MASK] which he does[MASK] and then he dies he gets finned and then he gets thrown overboard ostensibly he 's dead now and so i killed a character that 's been in the newspaper for fifteen years[MASK] so i got a lot of reader feedback on that one[MASK] meanwhile the other characters are[MASK] <unk> talking about shark fin soup i do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue[MASK] sherman 's up in shark heaven this is what i love about comic strips you know you really don 't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because if you start with a talking shark readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door[MASK] you can kind of do anything[MASK] it becomes a near death experience for sherman meanwhile[MASK] <unk> ernest finds his fins on the internet there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins so i[MASK] kind of exposed that and he clicks the buy now button[MASK] and voila next day air they show up and they surgically reattach them[MASK] i ended that series with a kind of a mail in petition that encouraged our national marine fishery service to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management[MASK] thanks i 'd[MASK] like to end with a little metaphor here i 've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent mission blue and this is what i came up with[MASK] imagine you 're in an enormous room and it 's as dark as a cave[MASK] and you can have anything in that room anything you want but you can 't see anything you 've been given one tool[MASK] <unk> a hammer[MASK] so you wander around in the darkness and you bump into something and it feels like it 's made of stone it 's big it 's heavy you can 't carry it away so you bang it with your hammer[MASK] and you break off a piece and you take the piece out into the daylight[MASK] and you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster[MASK] so you say to yourself well that 's worth something so you go back into the room and you break this thing to pieces and you haul it away and you find other things and you break that[MASK] <unk> up and you haul those away and you 're getting all kinds of cool stuff and you hear other people doing the same thing so you get this sense of urgency like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible[MASK] and then some yells stop[MASK] and they turn up the lights and you realize where you are you 're in the louvre[MASK] and you 've taken all this complexity and beauty[MASK] and you 've turned it into a cheap commodity and that 's what we 're doing with the ocean and part of what mission blue is about[MASK] is yelling stop[MASK] so that each of us explorer scientist cartoonist singer chef[MASK] can turn up the lights in their own way and that 's what i hope my comic strip does in a small way that 's why i like what i do thanks for listening[MASK] <unk> and then some yells[MASK]
