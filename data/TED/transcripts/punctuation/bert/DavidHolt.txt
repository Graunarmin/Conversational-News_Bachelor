you 're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket <unk> i thought damn those are going to be some big pants [MASK] so that christmas[MASK] maybe i 've got time for this that christmas i got the mister wizard[MASK] i wanted to be an inventor just like my dad so did michael his great granddad had been eli whitney the inventor of the cotton gin <unk> so[MASK] we looked in that this was a commercial chemistry set it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and charcoal [MASK] man we were only ten but we knew that made gunpowder <unk> we made up a little batch and and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew it flared up[MASK] obviously the next thing to do was[MASK] build a cannon <unk> [MASK] so we went over into michael 's garage his dad had all kinds of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole <unk>[MASK] <unk> in the back of the pipe took some of our

cabinet the air was the just full of black smoke [MASK] she came home she took that chemistry set away and we never saw it again[MASK] <unk> but we thought of it often because every time she 'd cook tuna surprise it made[MASK] tasted faintly of gunpowder[MASK] <unk> so i like to invent things too and i think i 'll close out my set with something i invented a good while back[MASK] when drum machines were new i got to thinking <unk> why couldn 't you take the oldest form of[MASK] of music the hambone rhythms and combine it with the newest technology i call this thunderwear at[MASK] that time drum[MASK] <unk> and so i put them all together and sewed twelve of them in this suit <unk> [MASK] i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday i 'm going to be doing some of the same ones i have a trigger here[MASK] <unk> going to really hurt if i don 't take that off okay now <unk> the drum triggers go out my tail here [MASK] into the drum machine <unk> and they can make various sounds like drums [MASK] so let me put them all together and also i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right[MASK] <unk> me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this[MASK]
