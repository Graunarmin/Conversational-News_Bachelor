 <unk> has everybody heard of crispr i would be shocked if you hadn 't this is a technology it 's for genome editing[MASK] and it 's so versatile and so controversial that it 's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations <unk> should we bring back the woolly[MASK] <unk> mammoth [MASK] should we edit a human embryo <unk> and my personal favorite [MASK] how can we justify wiping out an entire species that we consider harmful to humans off the face of the earth using this technology [MASK] this type of science is moving much faster than the regulatory mechanisms that govern it and so for the past six years[MASK] <unk> i 've made it my personal mission[MASK] to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies and their implications now crispr has been[MASK] the subject of a huge media hype <unk> and the words that are used most often are easy and cheap [MASK] so what i want to do is drill down a little bit deeper and look into some of the the myths and the[MASK] around <unk> crispr [MASK] if you 're trying to crispr a genome <unk> the first thing that you have to do is damage the dna[MASK] <unk> the damage comes in the form of a double strand break through the double helix <unk> and then the cellular repair processes kick in [MASK] and then we convince those repair processes to make the edit that we want and not a natural edit that 's how it works[MASK] it 's a two part system <unk> you 've got a cas9 protein and something called a guide rna i like to think of it as a guided missile <unk> [MASK] so the cas9 i love to anthropomorphize so the cas9 is kind of this pac man thing that wants to chew dna and the guide rna is the leash that 's keeping it[MASK] out of the genome until it finds the exact spot where it matches <unk> and the combination of[MASK] <unk> those two is called crispr it 's a system that we stole from an ancient ancient bacterial immune system <unk> [MASK] the part that 's amazing about it is that the guide rna only twenty letters of it are what target the system [MASK] this is really easy to design and it 's really cheap to[MASK] <unk> that 's the part that is modular in the system everything else stays the same <unk> this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use <unk>[MASK] the guide rna and the cas9 protein complex together go bouncing along the genome <unk> and when they find a spot where the guide rna matches [MASK] then it inserts between the two strands of the double helix <unk> it rips them apart [MASK] that triggers the cas9 protein to cut[MASK] <unk> and all of a sudden <unk> you 've got a cell that 's in total panic because now it 's got a piece of dna that 's broken [MASK] what does it do it calls its first responders <unk> [MASK] there are two major repair pathways <unk> the first just takes the dna and shoves the two pieces back together [MASK] this isn 't a very efficient system <unk> because what happens is sometimes a base drops out or a base is added[MASK] <unk> it 's an ok way to maybe like <unk> [MASK] knock out a gene <unk> but it 's not the the way that we really want to do genome editing the second repair pathway is a lot more interesting in this repair pathway it takes <unk>[MASK] a homologous piece of dna and now mind you in a diploid organism like people we 've got one copy of our genome from our mom and[MASK] one from our dad so if one gets damaged it can use the other chromosome to repair it so that 's where this comes from [MASK] the repair is made <unk> and now the genome is safe again [MASK] the way that we can hijack this is we can feed it a false piece of dna a piece that has homology on both ends but is different in the middle <unk> [MASK] so now you can put whatever you want in the center and the cell gets fooled [MASK] so you can change a letter <unk> you can take letters out but most importantly you can[MASK] <unk> stuff new dna in kind of like a trojan horse[MASK] crispr is going to be amazing in terms of the number of different scientific advances that it 's going to catalyze <unk> the thing that 's special about it is this <unk>[MASK] <unk> modular targeting system i mean we 've been shoving dna into organisms for years right <unk> [MASK] <unk> we can actually put it exactly where we want it the thing is that there 's a lot of[MASK] talk about it being cheap and it being easy and[MASK] i run a community lab <unk> [MASK] i 'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like hey can i come to your open night and like maybe use crispr and engineer my genome[MASK] <unk> but i 've heard it 's cheap i 've heard it 's easy we 're going to explore that a little bit so how cheap is it yeah <unk> it is cheap in comparison [MASK] it 's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars and it cuts the time a lot too it can cut it from weeks[MASK] <unk> that 's great <unk> you still need a professional lab to do the work in you 're not going to do anything meaningful outside of a professional lab i mean[MASK] <unk> don 't listen to anyone who says you can do this sort of stuff on your kitchen table[MASK] it 's really not easy to do this kind of work not to mention there 's a patent battle going on so even if you do invent something the broad institute[MASK] <unk> are in this incredible patent battle it 's really fascinating to watch it happen [MASK] because they 're accusing each other of fraudulent claims and then they 've got people saying oh well i signed my notebook here or there [MASK] this isn 't going to be settled for years <unk> and when it is you can bet you 're going to pay someone a really hefty licensing fee in order to use this stuff [MASK] so is it really cheap[MASK] <unk> it 's cheap if you 're doing basic research and you 've got a lab how about easy let 's look at that claim <unk> [MASK] the devil is always in the details <unk> [MASK] we don 't really know that much about cells they 're still kind of black boxes <unk> for example <unk> we don 't know why some guide rnas work really well and some guide rnas don 't <unk> [MASK] we don 't know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the[MASK] <unk> other [MASK] and besides that there 's the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place in a petri dish that 's not that hard but if you 're trying to do it on a whole organism it gets really tricky [MASK] it 's ok if you use something like blood or bone marrow those are the targets of a lot of research now there was a great story of some[MASK] <unk> little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out editing it and putting it back with a[MASK] precursor of crispr [MASK] and this is a line of research that people are going to do <unk> but right now if you want to get into the whole body you 're probably going to have to use a virus so you take the virus you put the crispr into it you let the virus infect the cell <unk> but now you 've got this virus in there <unk> [MASK] and we don 't know what the long term effects of that are plus [MASK] <unk> very small percentage but they 're still there <unk> what 's going to happen over time with that [MASK] these are not trivial questions <unk> and there are scientists that are trying to solve them and they will eventually hopefully be solved <unk> [MASK] but it ain 't plug and play not by a long shot so is it really easy <unk> [MASK] well <unk> if you spend a few years working it out in your particular system[MASK] <unk> it is now the other thing is we don 't really know that much about how to make[MASK] a particular thing happen[MASK] by changing particular spots in the genome we 're a long way away from figuring out how to give a pig wings for example <unk> [MASK] or even an extra leg i 'd settle for an extra leg that would be kind of cool right <unk> [MASK] but what is happening is that crispr is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to[MASK] <unk> do really really important work like making better models of diseases in animals for example or for taking[MASK] pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats[MASK] <unk> or even doing really basic research on what genes[MASK] <unk> this is the story of crispr we should be telling <unk> [MASK] and i don 't like it that the flashier aspects of it are drowning all of this out <unk> lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen <unk> [MASK] and what 's interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported[MASK] by our society <unk> think about it <unk> we 've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people[MASK] to spend all their time doing research[MASK] <unk> that makes us all the inventors of crispr [MASK] and i would say that makes us all the shepherds of crispr we all have a responsibility <unk> [MASK] so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies <unk> because really only in that way are we going to be able to guide[MASK] the development of these technologies the use of these technologies and make sure that in the[MASK] <unk> end it 's a positive outcome for both the planet and for us thanks[MASK]
