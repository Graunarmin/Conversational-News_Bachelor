turns me on[MASK] about the digital age what excites me personally is that you have closed the gap[MASK] between dreaming[MASK] and doing you see it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song <unk> you needed a studio and a producer[MASK] <unk> you need a laptop <unk> <unk> if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of[MASK] mass of equipment and a hollywood budget <unk> now <unk> you need a camera that fits in your palm [MASK] and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination[MASK] has been decoupled from the old constraints <unk> and that really really excites me[MASK] <unk>

<unk> i became[MASK] the worst thing of all i became a rock star with a cause [MASK] laughter except this isn 't the cause <unk> is it[MASK] <unk> thousand africans dying every single day from aids a

facing in africa is[MASK] an unprecedented threat to human dignity[MASK] <unk> equality <unk> the next thing i 'd like to be clear about is what this problem is <unk> [MASK] and what this problem isn 't because this is not all about charity <unk> [MASK] this is about justice really this is not about charity <unk> this is about justice [MASK] <unk> and that 's too bad because[MASK] we 're very good at charity <unk> [MASK] americans like irish people are good at it <unk> [MASK] even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to

equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern [MASK] it questions our commitment [MASK] because there is no way[MASK] we can look at what 's happening in africa and if we 're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else [MASK] as you heard in the film <unk> anywhere else not here <unk> [MASK] not here <unk> not in america <unk> not in europe [MASK] in fact[MASK] <unk> a head of state[MASK] that you 're all familiar with[MASK] admitted this to me and it 's really true there is no chance[MASK] this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere

like an action movie these days[MASK] to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing[MASK] countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear <unk> catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones[MASK] we could avert funny that anyway i believe[MASK] that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual[MASK] <unk> people dying a day in africa[MASK] may be africa 's crisis but the fact that it 's not on the nightly news that we in europe or you in america are not treating it like an emergency[MASK] i want to argue with you tonight that that 's our crisis <unk> i want to argue that though africa is not the front line[MASK] in the war against terror <unk> it could be soon every week[MASK] <unk> extremists take another african village they 're attempting to bring order to chaos well why aren[MASK] poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence we know this in turbulent times <unk> isn 't it cheaper[MASK] <unk> and smarter to make friends out

that [MASK] now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen[MASK] there 's an opportunity here[MASK] <unk> and it 's real it

only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart[MASK] in these nervous dangerous times <unk> don 't you think that on a purely

easy part <unk> or ought to be but equality for africa[MASK] that 's a big expensive idea <unk> [MASK] <unk> the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth[MASK] can we all do about this [MASK] well much more than we think we can 't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must <unk> and because we can [MASK] we must [MASK] this is the straight[MASK] truth <unk> the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation[MASK] that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye [MASK] look across the ocean to africa <unk> and say this and mean it <unk> [MASK] we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this[MASK] <unk> let me say this without a trace of irony[MASK] before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies forget the ' 60s [MASK] we can change the world <unk> i can 't you can 't as individuals <unk> but we[MASK] <unk> change the world <unk> i really believe that the people in this room look at the gates foundation they 've done incredible stuff <unk> unbelievable stuff <unk> but working together [MASK] we can actually change the world <unk> we can turn[MASK] the inevitable outcomes <unk> and transform[MASK] the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us[MASK] <unk> i 'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in <unk>[MASK] but i want to argue that this is the moment[MASK] that you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier <unk> headier[MASK] <unk> ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room[MASK] was born for this moment is really what i want to say to you tonight <unk> most of you started out wanting to change the world didn 't you [MASK] most of you did the digital world <unk> well now actually because of you it is possible to change the[MASK] <unk> they know much more than i do so[MASK] why then are we not pumping our fists[MASK] into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we 've got to do something about[MASK] it it is a pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse[MASK] <unk> but for the first time in history <unk> we have the technology <unk> we have the know how we have the cash <unk> we have the life saving drugs [MASK] do we have the will i hope this is obvious <unk> but i[MASK] 'm not a hippie <unk> and[MASK] i 'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling <unk> i do not have flowers in my hair[MASK] <unk> actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not sandals[MASK] <unk> but i know toughness when i see it [MASK] and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle[MASK] to the movement that started out here <unk> you see idealism detached from action is[MASK] <unk> just a dream <unk> but idealism[MASK] allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit [MASK] is very exciting it 's very real it 's very strong <unk> and it 's very present[MASK] in a crowd like you [MASK] last year at data <unk> this organization i helped set up[MASK] <unk> we launched a campaign to summon this spirit[MASK] in the fight against aids and extreme poverty we 're calling it the one campaign <unk> it 's based on our belief[MASK] that the action of one person can change a lot <unk> but the actions of many coming together as one can change[MASK] <unk> we feel that now is the time[MASK] to prove we 're right there are moments in history[MASK] when civilization redefines

could be the time that we finally get serious[MASK] about changing the future[MASK] <unk> for most people[MASK] who live[MASK] on planet earth momentum has been building <unk> [MASK] lurching a little but it 's building <unk> this year is a test for us all especially the[MASK] the leaders of the g8 nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching [MASK] i have been of late disappointed with the bush[MASK] <unk> administration[MASK] they started out with such promise on africa <unk> they made some really great promises [MASK] and actually have fulfilled a lot of them but some of them[MASK] they haven 't they don 't feel the push from the ground is the truth [MASK] but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american[MASK] <unk> people and i hear their worries about the deficit and the fiscal well being of their country i understand that <unk> but there 's much more push from the ground[MASK] than you 'd think if we got organized what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that[MASK] aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it[MASK] <unk> it in the in the crassest possible terms <unk> [MASK] the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but[MASK] in goodwill stability and security[MASK] that we 'll gain [MASK] so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold <unk> and not have it deducted from my[MASK] <unk> my number of wishes <unk> what i hope[MASK] is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians[MASK] to do right by africa <unk> [MASK] by america and by the world <unk> give them permission <unk> if you like to spend their political capital and your financial capital[MASK] <unk> national purse on saving
