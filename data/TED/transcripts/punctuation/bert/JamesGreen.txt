 <unk> is there life beyond earth in our solar system <unk> wow what a powerful question [MASK] you know as a scientist planetary scientist we really didn 't take that[MASK] <unk> carl sagan always said it takes extraordinary evidence[MASK] for extraordinary claims and the claims of having life beyond earth[MASK] need to be definitive they need to be loud and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it[MASK] <unk> how do we make this journey what we decided to do is first look for those[MASK] ingredients for life the ingredients of life[MASK] are liquid water we have to have a solvent <unk> can 't be ice has to be liquid <unk> [MASK] we also have to have energy <unk> we also have to have organic material[MASK] things that make us[MASK] <unk> but also things that we need to consume so we have to have these elements[MASK] in environments for long periods of time for us to be able to be confident that life [MASK] in that moment when it starts <unk> can spark and then grow and evolve <unk> [MASK] well i have to tell you[MASK] that early in my career when we[MASK] <unk> at those three elements i didn 't believe that they were beyond earth in any length of time and for any real quantity <unk> [MASK] why we look at the inner planets <unk> venus is way too hot it 's got no water [MASK] mars dry and arid it 's got no water and beyond mars the water in the solar system is all frozen <unk> [MASK] but recent observations have changed all that it 's now turning our attention to the right[MASK] <unk> places for us to take a deeper look[MASK] and really[MASK] start to answer our life question <unk> [MASK] so when we look out into the solar system where are the possibilities <unk> we 're concentrating our attention on four locations <unk> [MASK] the planet mars[MASK] and then three moons of the outer planets[MASK] and small enceladus <unk> so what about mars <unk> let 's go through the evidence [MASK] well mars we thought was initially moon like full of craters <unk> arid[MASK] and a dead world and so about fifteen years ago we started a series of missions to go to mars and see if[MASK] water existed on mars in its past that changed its geology we ought to be able to notice that [MASK] and indeed we started to be surprised right away our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys that were there in the past [MASK] and in fact[MASK] <unk> which has been roving on the surface now for about three years has really shown us[MASK] that it 's sitting in an ancient river bed where water flowed rapidly <unk> [MASK] and not for a little while perhaps hundreds of millions of years <unk> [MASK] and if everything was there including organics perhaps life had started <unk> curiosity has also drilled[MASK] drilled in that red soil and brought up other material <unk> [MASK] and we were really excited when we saw that because it wasn 't red mars <unk> it was gray material it 's gray mars we brought it into the rover <unk> we tasted it [MASK] and guess what [MASK] we tasted organics carbon <unk> hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sulfur they were all there [MASK] so mars in its past with a lot of water perhaps plenty of time[MASK] <unk> could have had life could have had that spark <unk> could have grown <unk> and is that life still there we don 't know that <unk> [MASK] but a few years ago we started to look at a number of craters during the summer <unk> dark lines would appear down the sides of these craters <unk> the more[MASK] <unk> more craters we saw <unk> the more of these features we now know more than a dozen of them [MASK] a few months ago the fairy tale came true <unk> we announced to the world that we know what these streaks are [MASK] it 's liquid water [MASK] these craters are weeping during the summer [MASK] liquid water is flowing down these craters <unk> so what are we going to do now now that we see the water[MASK] it tells us that mars has all the ingredients necessary for life in its past it had perhaps two thirds of its northern hemisphere there was an ocean <unk> [MASK] it has weeping water right now liquid water on its surface it has organics <unk> it has all the right conditions <unk> [MASK] so what are we going to do next we 're going to launch a series of missions[MASK] to begin that search[MASK] <unk> for life on mars and now it 's more appealing than ever before [MASK] as we move out into the solar system [MASK] here 's the tiny moon enceladus[MASK] <unk> this is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone <unk> this area around the sun this is much further out [MASK] this object should be ice[MASK] over a silicate core <unk> but what did we[MASK] cassini was there since two thousand and six <unk> and after a couple years looked back after it flew by enceladus and surprised us all enceladus <unk>[MASK] is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system and sloshing back down onto the moon [MASK] <unk> cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume [MASK] and it measured silicate particles where does the silica come from it must come from the ocean floor <unk> [MASK] the tidal energy is generated by saturn <unk> pulling and squeezing this moon is melting that ice <unk> creating an ocean <unk> but it 's also doing that to the core [MASK] <unk> the only thing that we can think of that does that here on earth as an analogy [MASK] are hydrothermal vents hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in <unk>[MASK] oceanographers were completely surprised <unk> and now there are thousands of these below the ocean [MASK] what do we find <unk> the[MASK] <unk> when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents they 're teeming with life regardless of whether the water[MASK] is acidic or alkaline[MASK] doesn 't matter <unk> so hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on earth [MASK] so what about enceladus <unk> well we believe because it has water and has had it for a significant period of time [MASK] and we believe it has hydrothermal vents[MASK] with perhaps the right organic[MASK] <unk> material it is a place where life could exist <unk> and not just microbial[MASK] maybe more complex[MASK] because it 's had time to evolve <unk> another moon very similar is europa <unk> galileo visited[MASK] jupiter 's system[MASK] of europa[MASK] europa we also know [MASK] has an under the ice crust ocean <unk> galileo mission told us that but we never saw any plumes <unk> [MASK] but we didn 't look for them <unk> [MASK] hubble just a couple years ago <unk> observing[MASK] europa <unk> saw plumes of water spraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere just[MASK] <unk> exactly[MASK] like[MASK] enceladus [MASK] these moons [MASK] which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone that are out in the solar system have liquid water [MASK] and if there are organics there there may be life [MASK] this is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment like that[MASK] <unk> for billions of years [MASK] life started here on earth <unk> we believe after about the first five hundred million and look where we are [MASK] these moons are fabulous moons [MASK] another moon that we 're looking at is titan <unk> [MASK] titan is a huge moon of saturn <unk> it perhaps is much larger than the planet mercury[MASK] <unk> it has an extensive atmosphere it 's so extensive and it 's mostly[MASK] nitrogen with a little methane and ethane that you have to peer through it with radar and on the surface cassini has found liquid <unk> [MASK] we see lakes <unk> [MASK] actually almost the size of our black sea in some places and this area[MASK] is not liquid water[MASK] <unk> methane [MASK] if there 's any place in the solar system where life is not like us [MASK] where the substitute of water is another solvent and it could be methane it could be titan <unk> [MASK] well is there life beyond earth in the solar system we don 't know yet <unk> but we 're hot on the pursuit <unk> [MASK] the data that we 're receiving is really exciting[MASK] <unk> and telling us forcing us to think about this in new and exciting ways <unk> [MASK] i believe we 're on the right track that in the next ten years <unk> we will answer that question <unk> and if we answer it [MASK] and it 's positive [MASK] then life is everywhere in the solar system <unk> [MASK] just think about that we may not be alone[MASK]
