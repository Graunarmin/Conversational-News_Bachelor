 <unk> i have been a police officer for a very very long time and you see these notes in my hand because i 'm also a black preacher and[MASK] if you know anything about black preachers we 'll[MASK] <unk> keep going for another twenty minutes laughter[MASK] so i need this to keep pushing this thing forward i 've been a police officer for a very long time and i mean i predated technology i 'm talking about before pagers [MASK] laugh if you want to but i 'm telling the truth <unk> i predate war on[MASK] our fellow man i mean war on drugs i predate all of that [MASK] i predate so much and i 've been through ebbs and flows and i 've been through good and bad times and still i absolutely[MASK] <unk> love being a police officer <unk> i love being a police officer because it 's always been a calling for me and never a job [MASK] and even with that my personal truth is that law enforcement[MASK] is in a crisis it 's an invisible crisis and it has been for many many years even though we in law enforcement say you know what[MASK] <unk> we can 't arrest our way out of this [MASK] we say in law enforcement things like yeah it 's illegal to profile you know what in law enforcement we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking and[MASK] become more oriented to community policing <unk> and yet all the while [MASK] still we continue in the same vein the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted[MASK] and so that 's the reason for me several years ago <unk> [MASK] because i was tired of the racism i was tired of discrimination i was tired of the isms and the schisms i was just so tired [MASK] i was tired of the vicious cycle and i was tired of it even in the beloved agency[MASK] in the department that i still love today <unk> and so my wife and i we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire[MASK] <unk> we would retire and i would go off into the sunset maybe do ministry full time <unk> love my wife a long time y 'all know what i 'm talking about [MASK] but we decided that i would retire but then there was a higher power than i [MASK] there was a love for the city[MASK] that i loved that i grew up in that i was educated in[MASK] a city that pulled my heart back into the system[MASK] <unk> so we didn 't retire <unk> we didn 't retire and so what happened was over the next i would say eighteen months nineteen months <unk> [MASK] i had this passion to implement some radical policing <unk> [MASK] and so now over the next nineteen months i shifted and i transcended from being a drug sergeant[MASK] <unk> as a drug sergeant[MASK] and went from level to level to level until i find myself as a district commander commander of the worst district in baltimore city [MASK] we call it the eastern district the most violent district the most impoverished district forty six percent[MASK] unemployment in that district national rating at that time <unk> national rating the aids[MASK] <unk> was always on the top ten list for zip codes[MASK] for cities across the nation or just zip codes across the nation the top ten i didn 't say state i didn 't say city that little neighborhood [MASK] and i said you know what we gotta do something different <unk> [MASK] we gotta do something different we gotta think radical <unk> we gotta think outside the box <unk> and so in order to bring change that i desperately wanted and i desperately felt in my[MASK] <unk> i had to start listening to that inner spirit <unk> i had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything[MASK] that i had been trained to do <unk> but we still did it we still did it because we listened to that inner spirit <unk> because i realized this <unk> if[MASK] i was to see real police reform[MASK] in the communities that i had authority over for public safety <unk> we had to change our stinkin ' thinkin[MASK] ' we had to change it and so what we did is we[MASK] <unk> to think holistically and not paramilitarily so we thought differently <unk> [MASK] and we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them [MASK] and so i decided to come to that intersection where i could meet[MASK] all classes all races all creeds all colors where i would meet the businesses and the faith based and the eds the meds and i would meet all the people that made up the communities that i had authority[MASK] <unk> over[MASK] so i met them and i began to listen see police have a problem off the top we want to bring things into the community and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments <unk> [MASK] but we never talk to the community about them [MASK] and we shove them into the community and say take that [MASK] but we said we 'd get rid of that stinkin ' thinkin ' so we talked to our communities we said this is your community table we 'll pull up a chair we want to hear from you what 's going to work in your community[MASK] and then some great things started to happen see here 's the thing <unk> i had to figure out a way to shift[MASK] one hundred and thirty cops that were under my tutelage[MASK] from being occupiers of communities to being partners <unk> [MASK] i had to figure out how to do that because <unk> here 's the crazy thing [MASK] in law enforcement we have evolved into something incredible listen we have become great protectors we know how to protect you[MASK] but we have exercised that arm so much so very much if i was a natural police department[MASK] and i represented a police department you would see this incredible beautiful[MASK] <unk> protection that 's who we are but we 've exercised it so much sometimes[MASK] that it has led to abuse it[MASK] 's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us and we 've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and[MASK] serve <unk> y 'all don 't know that protect and serve [MASK] <unk> 's kinda weak it looks sickly it 's withering and it 's dying[MASK] because we 've invested so much in our protective arm <unk> but we forgot[MASK] to treat our communities like they 're our customers like they 're our sons and daughters our brothers and sisters our mothers and fathers <unk>[MASK] <unk> along the way we 've gotten out of balance and because we are a proud profession [MASK] it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes <unk> it 's even harder to make a change <unk> [MASK] and so <unk> as i try to hurry and get through this i need to say this it 's not just law enforcement though [MASK] because every one of us makes up a community <unk> everybody makes up a community[MASK] <unk> and as communities can i say this we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement [MASK] too much [MASK] and then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action <unk> [MASK] there is no way in the world[MASK] that we as a community should be calling the police[MASK] <unk> for kids playing ball in the street [MASK] no way in the world that we should be calling the police because my neighbor 's music is up too loud because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two there 's no way we should be calling the police <unk> [MASK] but we have surrendered so much of our responsibility[MASK] <unk> when i was a little boy coming up in baltimore and listen we played rough in the street i ain 't never see the police come and break us up [MASK] <unk> was the elders it was the parental figures in the community <unk> [MASK] it was those guardians it was that village mentality they came and said stop that and do this and stop that we had mentors[MASK] throughout all of the community <unk> so it takes all of us all of us[MASK] and when i say community i 'm talking about everything that makes up a community even listen because i 'm a preacher <unk> i 'm very hard on the churches <unk> [MASK] because i believe the churches too often have become mia missing in action <unk> i believe they have shifted over[MASK] <unk> the last ten twenty years from being community churches where you walk outside your door round the corner and you 're in church they shifted from that and became commuter churches[MASK] <unk> so you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they 're planted [MASK] and they don 't take care of that community <unk> i could go on and on but i really need to wrap this up[MASK] <unk> we 've all lost that precious gift and i call it relational equity <unk> [MASK] we 've lost it with one another it 's not somebody else 's fault it 's all of our fault <unk> [MASK] we all take responsibility in this <unk> but i say this it 's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again it is never too late <unk> it is never too[MASK] <unk> in that district <unk> three years in after putting pastors in the car with my police because i knew this it 's a little secret i knew this <unk> [MASK] it was hard to stay a nasty police officer[MASK] while you 're riding around with a clergy[MASK] <unk> so we came up with some incredible initiatives <unk> engagements for our community and police to build that trust back [MASK] we began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence <unk> we knew we had an economic problem <unk> so we began to create jobs <unk> we knew there[MASK] was sickness in our community and they didn 't have access to proper medical care so we 'd partner up we got to that intersection and partnered up with anybody that wanted to partner with us and talked about what we needed holistically never thinking about the crime because at the end of the day [MASK] if we took care of the needs of the people if we got to the root cause [MASK] the crime would take care of itself <unk> [MASK] it would take care of itself[MASK] <unk> we looked back and we looked over and found out that we were at a 40 year[MASK] historical low our crime numbers our homicides everything had dropped down back to the 1970s and it might go back further but the problem is we only started keeping data since[MASK] and so we gave them some of that [MASK] and in a short period of time the city went to a <unk> 30 year crime low [MASK] for the first time in thirty years we fell baltimore city to under two hundred homicides one hundred and ninety seven to be exact and we celebrated because we had learned to become[MASK] great servers become great servers first <unk> but i gotta tell you this these last few years[MASK] <unk> as much as we had learned[MASK] to become great[MASK] proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive <unk> these last years have disappointed me [MASK] they have broken my heart the uprising still hurts [MASK] it still hurts my heart <unk> because truly i believe that it should 've never happened i believe it should 've never happened if we were allowed[MASK] <unk> to continue along the vein that we were in servicing our community <unk> treating them like human beings treating them with respect loving on them first <unk> [MASK] if we continued in that vein <unk> it would 've never happened but somehow we went back to business as usual <unk> [MASK] but i 'm excited again <unk> i 'm excited again because now we have a police commissioner[MASK] who not only talks about[MASK] <unk> community policing <unk> [MASK] but he absolutely understands it and more importantly he embraces it so i 'm very excited now listen <unk> i 'm excited about baltimore today <unk> [MASK] because we as many cities i believe shall rise from the ashes <unk> [MASK] i believe[MASK] i truly believe that we will be great again <unk> i believe as we[MASK] <unk> continue to wrap arms[MASK] and continue to say we 're in this together because it 's not just an intersection [MASK] once we meet we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals and this city will become great again this nation will become great again <unk> [MASK] because we have the same goal we all want peace <unk> we all want respect for one another we all want love and i believe we are back on that road <unk> and i 'm so excited about it so listen i thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time <unk> [MASK] god bless you all[MASK]
