 <unk> almost two years ago <unk> i was driving in my car in germany <unk> and i turned on the radio <unk> [MASK] europe at the time was in the middle of the euro crisis <unk> and all the headlines were about european countries[MASK] getting downgraded by rating agencies[MASK] in the united states i listened and thought to myself what are these rating agencies <unk> and why is everybody so upset about their work [MASK] well <unk> if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that i would devote the next years to trying to reform them [MASK] obviously i would have called you crazy <unk> but guess what 's really crazy[MASK] the way these rating agencies are run <unk> and i would like to explain to you not only why it 's time to change this but also how we can do it [MASK] so let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do [MASK] as you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get[MASK] <unk> investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money [MASK] a rating can range from a so called aaa which means it 's a top performing product <unk> and it can go down to the level of the <unk>[MASK] which means it 's a fairly risky investment rating agencies are rating[MASK] <unk> companies they are rating banks they are rating even financial products like the infamous <unk> mortgage backed securities <unk> [MASK] but they can also rate countries [MASK] and these ratings are called sovereign ratings <unk> and i would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings <unk> [MASK] and i can tell as you 're listening to me right now you 're thinking so why should i really care about this right be honest[MASK] <unk> well <unk> ratings affect you they affect all of us [MASK] if a rating agency rates a country it basically assesses and evaluates a country 's debt[MASK] and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt so if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency[MASK] <unk> the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets so it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow <unk> [MASK] but what if a country can 't afford to pay more because it 's maybe too expensive <unk> [MASK] well <unk> then the country has less available for other services like roads schools[MASK] <unk> and this is the reason why you should care [MASK] because sovereign ratings affect everyone and that is the reason why i believe they should be defined as public goods <unk> they should be transparent <unk> accessible [MASK] and available to everyone at no cost <unk> [MASK] but here 's the situation <unk> the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players[MASK] <unk> and fitch[MASK] and we know whenever there is a market concentration there is really no competition <unk> there is no incentive[MASK] to improve the quality of your product <unk> [MASK] and let 's face it the credit rating agencies have contributed <unk> [MASK] putting the global economy on the brink and yet they have to change the way they operate <unk> [MASK] the second[MASK] <unk> you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer [MASK] obviously not right that would be irresponsible <unk> but that 's actually what 's going on in the rating agency sector every single day <unk> [MASK] the customers of these rating agencies like countries or companies <unk> [MASK] they are paying for their own ratings <unk> and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest <unk> [MASK] the third point is[MASK] the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings [MASK] but in this day and age you can 't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that 's inside <unk> [MASK] but for ratings a crucial element of our economy [MASK] we really do not know what all the different[MASK] <unk> we are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work <unk> and we need to change this [MASK] i think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul not just a trimming at the margins [MASK] i think it 's time for a bold move i think it 's time to upgrade the system <unk> [MASK] and this is why we at the bertelsmann foundation have invested a lot of time and effort[MASK] <unk> thinking about an alternative for the sector <unk> [MASK] and we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk <unk> [MASK] and we call it by its acronym incra[MASK] incra would make a difference to the current system[MASK] by adding another nonprofit player to the mix it would be based on a nonprofit model[MASK] that would be based on a sustainable[MASK] <unk> endowment the endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation to run the rating agency <unk> and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available [MASK] but this is not enough to make a difference right [MASK] incra would also be based on a very very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest <unk> and it would include[MASK] many stakeholders from society [MASK] incra would not only be a european or an american rating agency it would be a truly international one in which in particular the emerging economies <unk>[MASK] would have an equal interest voice and representation <unk> [MASK] on a broader set of indicators [MASK] think about it that way <unk> if we conduct a sovereign rating we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country [MASK] its macroeconomic fundamentals <unk> but we also have to ask the question <unk> who is cultivating the economic soil of a country right <unk>[MASK] <unk> a country has many gardeners and one of them is the government so we have to ask the question how is a country governed how is it managed <unk> [MASK] and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward looking indicators [MASK] these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country <unk> [MASK] i hope you would agree it 's important for you to know if your government[MASK] <unk> important for you to know[MASK] if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis <unk> if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it 's promised [MASK] for example if incra would rate south africa right now [MASK] of course we would take a very very close look at the youth unemployment of the country the highest in the world[MASK] <unk> if over seventy percent of a country 's population under the age of thirty five[MASK] is unemployed of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future [MASK] well our friends at moody 's standard & poor 's and fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well <unk> but guess what we do not know[MASK] <unk> how they will take this into account <unk> and this leads me to the third big difference that incra would make[MASK] incra would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology <unk> so in contrast to the current system [MASK] incra would be fully transparent <unk> [MASK] so in a nutshell incra would offer an alternative to the current[MASK] <unk> system of the big three rating agencies[MASK] by adding a new nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition [MASK] it would increase the transparency of the sector <unk> and it would also increase the quality [MASK] i can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world <unk> [MASK] but i tell you it 's[MASK] <unk> a very important one and a very important one to fix <unk> because sovereign ratings affect all of us [MASK] and they should be addressed and should be defined[MASK] as public goods <unk> and this is why we are testing our model right now and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and[MASK] willing actors to bring incra to life [MASK] i truly believe building up incra is in everyone 's interest <unk> and that we have the unique opportunity right now[MASK] to turn incra into a cornerstone of a new more inclusive financial system <unk> [MASK] because for way too long we have left the big financial players on their own [MASK] it 's time to give them some company <unk> thank you[MASK]
