 <unk> do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives [MASK] the oceans cover two thirds of our planet <unk> they provide half the oxygen we[MASK] <unk> they moderate our climate <unk> and they provide jobs and medicine and food[MASK] including twenty percent of protein to feed the entire world population[MASK] people used to think that the oceans were so vast that they wouldn 't be affected by human activities <unk> [MASK] well today i 'm going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans[MASK] called ocean acidification or the evil twin of climate change[MASK] did you know that the oceans have absorbed[MASK] <unk> percent of all of the carbon dioxide that we have emitted to the atmosphere <unk> [MASK] now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that 's causing climate change [MASK] but as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere[MASK] <unk> more is dissolving into the oceans and this is what 's changing our ocean chemistry [MASK] when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater it undergoes a number of chemical reactions [MASK] now lucky for you i don 't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today <unk> [MASK] but i 'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean the seawater ph goes down <unk> [MASK] and this basically means that there[MASK] <unk> is an increase in ocean acidity <unk> [MASK] and this whole process is called ocean acidification and it 's happening alongside climate change <unk> [MASK] scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades [MASK] this figure is an important time series in hawaii and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide[MASK] <unk> in the atmosphere <unk> and this is directly as a result of human activities <unk> [MASK] the line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean[MASK] which you can see is increasing at the same rate as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began <unk> the line on the bottom[MASK] <unk> shows the change in chemistry as more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean the seawater ph has gone down <unk> [MASK] which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity <unk> [MASK] now in ireland scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification scientists at the marine institute and and nui galway <unk> [MASK] and we too are seeing acidification at the same rate as these[MASK] <unk> sites around the world so it 's happening right at our doorstep <unk> [MASK] now i 'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data to to monitor a changing ocean firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter so <unk>[MASK] as you can imagine in the north atlantic we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness but[MASK] <unk> so we lower this instrument over the side of the ship <unk> and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom that can tell us information about the surrounding water <unk> such as temperature[MASK] or dissolved oxygen [MASK] and then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles <unk> so we start at the bottom which can be over four kilometers deep just off our continental shelf <unk> [MASK] and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface [MASK] <unk> take the seawater back on the deck <unk> and then we can either analyze them on the ship or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters <unk> [MASK] but why should we care how is ocean acidification going to affect all of us [MASK] well here are the worrying facts [MASK] there has already been an increase in ocean acidity of twenty six percent[MASK] <unk> which is directly due to human activities <unk> [MASK] unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions <unk> [MASK] we 're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of one hundred and seventy percent[MASK] by the end of this century <unk> i mean this is within our children 's lifetime this rate of[MASK] <unk> so our marine life have never ever experienced such a fast rate of change before <unk> [MASK] so we literally could not know how they 're going to cope <unk> [MASK] now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago <unk> which was much slower[MASK] <unk> what we 're seeing today <unk> and this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species [MASK] so is that what we 're headed for well maybe <unk> [MASK] studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well but many are showing a negative response [MASK] one of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases the[MASK] <unk> concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease <unk> [MASK] now these ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells for example crabs[MASK] or mussels <unk> oysters <unk> [MASK] another example are corals <unk> they also need these carbonate ions in seawater to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs[MASK] as ocean acidity increases[MASK] and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease <unk> [MASK] these species first find it more difficult to make their shells <unk> [MASK] and at even even lower levels <unk> they can actually begin to dissolve [MASK] this here is a pteropod it 's called a sea butterfly[MASK] <unk> and it 's an important food source in the ocean for many species <unk> from krill to salmon right up to whales [MASK] the shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater at a ph that we 're expecting by the end of this century <unk> [MASK] after only forty five days[MASK] at this very realistic ph you can see the shell has almost completely[MASK] <unk> ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain[MASK] and right onto our dinner plates i mean who here likes shellfish [MASK] or salmon or many other fish species whose food source in the ocean could be affected [MASK] these are cold water corals <unk> and did you know we actually have cold water corals in irish waters just off our continental[MASK] <unk> and they support rich biodiversity including some very important fisheries it[MASK] 's projected that by the end of this century <unk> seventy percent of all known cold water corals in the entire ocean[MASK] will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure [MASK] the last example i have are these healthy tropical corals they were placed in seawater at a ph[MASK] <unk> we 're expecting by the year two thousand one hundred <unk> [MASK] after six months <unk> the coral has almost completely dissolved <unk> now coral reefs support[MASK] <unk> percent of all marine life in the entire ocean all marine life so you can[MASK] is a global threat <unk> i have an eight month old baby boy <unk> [MASK] unless we start now to slow this down <unk> i dread to think what our oceans will look like when he 's a grown man [MASK] we will see acidification we have already put too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere <unk> [MASK] but we can slow this[MASK] <unk> down we can prevent the worst case scenario <unk> [MASK] the only way of doing that is by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions <unk> [MASK] this is important for both you and i for industry for governments we need to work together slow down global warming slow down ocean acidification and help to maintain a[MASK] <unk> healthy ocean and a healthy planet for our generation and for generations to come[MASK]
