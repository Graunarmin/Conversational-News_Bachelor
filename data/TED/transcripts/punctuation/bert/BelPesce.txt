answers for you constantly people want to help out right [MASK] all sorts of people your family your friends your business partners they all have opinions on which path you should take and let me tell you go through this pipe [MASK] but whenever you go inside there are other ways you have to pick as well <unk> and you need to make those decisions yourself [MASK] no one else has the perfect answers
