 <unk> i landed for the first time in rome italy <unk> i wasn 't there to sightsee <unk> i was there to solve world hunger[MASK] <unk> phd student[MASK] armed with a prototype tool developed back at my university <unk> and i was going to help the world food programme fix hunger <unk> [MASK] so i strode into the headquarters building and my eyes scanned the row of un flags <unk> and i smiled as i thought to myself [MASK] the engineer is here [MASK] give me your data <unk> i 'm going to optimize everything[MASK] tell me the food that you 've purchased tell me where it 's going and when it needs to be there <unk> and i 'm going to tell you the shortest fastest cheapest best set of routes to take for the food we[MASK] 're going to save money we 're going to avoid delays and disruptions and bottom line we 're going to save lives <unk> you 're welcome [MASK] i thought it was going to take twelve months ok maybe even thirteen[MASK] <unk> this is not quite how it panned out [MASK] just a couple of months into the project my french boss he told me [MASK] you know mallory <unk> it 's a good idea but the data you need for your algorithms is not there it[MASK] 's the right idea but at the wrong time and the right idea at the wrong time[MASK] is the wrong idea[MASK] <unk> i look back now[MASK] on that first summer in rome[MASK] and i see how much has changed over the past six years <unk> it is an absolute transformation <unk> it 's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world <unk> [MASK] it 's exciting <unk> it 's inspiring <unk> but we 're not there yet [MASK] and brace yourself executives[MASK] <unk> 'm going to be putting companies on the hot seat to step up and play the role that i know they can [MASK] my experiences back in rome prove[MASK] using data you can save lives <unk> [MASK] ok not that first attempt <unk> [MASK] but eventually we got there let me paint the picture for you imagine that you have to plan breakfast lunch and dinner for five hundred thousand people[MASK] <unk> only have a certain budget to do it say six point five million dollars per month [MASK] well what should you do what 's the best way to handle it [MASK] should you buy rice <unk> wheat <unk> chickpea oil how much it sounds simple it 's not [MASK] you have thirty possible foods <unk> and you have to pick five of them that 's already over one hundred and forty thousand different combinations <unk> then for each food that you pick you need to[MASK] <unk> decide how much you 'll buy where you 're going to get it from where you 're going to store it [MASK] how long it 's going to take to get there <unk> you need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well <unk> and that 's already over nine hundred million options <unk> [MASK] if you considered each option for a single second that would take you over twenty eight years to get through nine hundred million options[MASK] <unk> so we created a tool that allowed decisionmakers to weed through all nine hundred million options[MASK] in just a matter of days <unk> [MASK] it turned out to be incredibly successful [MASK] in an operation in iraq <unk> we saved seventeen percent of the costs <unk> and this meant that you had the ability to feed an additional eighty thousand people it[MASK] 's all thanks to the use[MASK] of data and modeling complex systems <unk> but we[MASK] <unk> do it alone [MASK] the unit that i worked with in rome <unk> they were unique they believed in collaboration <unk> they brought in the academic world <unk> they brought in companies <unk> [MASK] and if we really want to make big changes in big problems like world hunger <unk> we need everybody to the table <unk> [MASK] we need the data people from humanitarian organizations leading the way <unk> and orchestrating just the right types of engagements with academics with[MASK] <unk> and there 's one group that 's not being leveraged in the way that it should be did you guess it companies companies have a major role to play in fixing the big problems in our world <unk> [MASK] i 've been in the private sector for two years now <unk> i 've seen what companies can do <unk> and i 've seen what companies aren 't doing and i think there 's three main ways that we can fill that gap [MASK] by donating data <unk> by donating decision scientists and by donating donating technology to gather new sources of data <unk> [MASK] this is data philanthropy <unk> and it 's the[MASK] <unk> future of corporate social responsibility <unk> bonus it also makes good business sense [MASK] companies today <unk> they collect mountains of data <unk> so the first thing they can do is start donating that data <unk> some companies are already doing it [MASK] take for example a major telecom company <unk> they opened up their data in senegal and the ivory coast[MASK] <unk> researchers discovered that if you look at the patterns in the pings to the cell phone towers you can see where people are traveling <unk> and that can tell you things like[MASK] where malaria might spread <unk> and you can make predictions with it [MASK] or take for example an innovative satellite company <unk> they opened up their data and donated it and with that data you could track how droughts are impacting food production [MASK] with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen this is a great start[MASK] <unk> 's important insights just locked away in company data [MASK] and yes you need to be very careful you need to respect privacy concerns for example by anonymizing the data <unk> [MASK] but even if the floodgates opened up and even if all companies donated their data <unk> to academics to ngos to humanitarian organizations [MASK] it wouldn 't be enough to harness that full impact of data for humanitarian goals [MASK] why[MASK] to unlock insights in data you need decision scientists [MASK] decision scientists are people like me [MASK] they take the data <unk> they clean it up transform it and put it into a useful algorithm that 's the best choice to address the business need at hand [MASK] in the world of humanitarian aid there are very few decision scientists <unk> most of them work for companies[MASK] <unk> so that 's the second thing that companies need to do in addition to donating their data <unk> they need to donate their decision scientists [MASK] now companies will say <unk> ah <unk> don 't take our decision scientists from us <unk> we need every spare second of their time [MASK] but there 's a way [MASK] if a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist 's time it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period <unk> say for example five years <unk> [MASK] <unk> only amount to a couple of hours per month <unk> which a company would hardly miss <unk> but what it enables is really important long term partnerships[MASK] long term partnerships allow you to build relationships to get to know the data to really understand it[MASK] and to start to understand the needs and challenges that the humanitarian organization is facing in rome at the world food programme this took us five years to do five[MASK] <unk> years that first three years <unk> ok that was just what we couldn 't solve for then there was two years after that of refining and implementing the tool like in the operations in iraq[MASK] and other countries <unk> [MASK] i don 't think that 's an unrealistic timeline when it comes to using data to make operational changes <unk> it 's an investment <unk> it requires patience <unk> [MASK] but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable in our case it was the ability to feed[MASK] tens of thousands more people <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] we have donating data <unk> we have donating decision scientists and there 's actually a third way that companies can help [MASK] donating technology to capture new sources of data you see there 's a lot of things we just don 't have data on [MASK] right now syrian refugees are flooding into greece [MASK] and the un refugee agency they have their hands full[MASK] the current system for tracking people is paper and pencil and what that means is that when a mother and her five children walk into the camp <unk> headquarters is essentially blind to this moment [MASK] that 's all going to change in the next few weeks thanks to private sector collaboration [MASK] there 's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for with this new system there will be a data trail <unk> so you know exactly[MASK] <unk> the moment when that mother and her children walk into the camp <unk> and even more you know if she 's going to have supplies this month and the next [MASK] information visibility drives efficiency [MASK] for companies using technology to gather important data <unk> it 's like bread and butter <unk> they 've been doing it for years <unk> and it 's led to major operational efficiency improvements [MASK] just try to imagine your favorite beverage company[MASK] trying to plan their inventory and[MASK] <unk> not knowing how many bottles were on the shelves <unk> it 's absurd data drives better decisions [MASK] now <unk> if you 're representing a company <unk> and you 're pragmatic and not just idealistic [MASK] you might be saying to yourself ok <unk> this is all great mallory but why should i want to be involved [MASK] well for one thing[MASK] <unk> and there 's over five billion people <unk> maybe your next customers that live in the developing world <unk> [MASK] further companies that are engaging in data philanthropy <unk> they 're finding new insights locked away in their data <unk> [MASK] take for example a credit card company that 's opened up a center that functions as a hub for academics for ngos and governments all working together <unk> [MASK] <unk> they 're looking at information in credit card swipes and using that to find insights about how households in india live work earn and spend [MASK] for the humanitarian world <unk> this provides information about how you might bring people out of poverty <unk> [MASK] but for companies <unk> it 's providing insights about your customers and potential customers in india <unk> [MASK] it 's a win all around [MASK] now <unk> for me what i find[MASK] exciting about data philanthropy donating data <unk> donating decision scientists and donating[MASK] <unk> technology[MASK] it 's what it means for young professionals like me who are choosing to work at companies <unk> [MASK] studies show that the next generation of the workforce care about having their work make a bigger impact [MASK] we want to make a difference <unk> [MASK] and so through data philanthropy companies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists and that 's a big deal for a profession that 's in high demand[MASK] <unk> philanthropy makes good business sense <unk> and it also can help revolutionize the humanitarian world <unk> [MASK] if we coordinated the planning and logistics across all of the major facets of a humanitarian operation [MASK] we could feed clothe and shelter hundreds of thousands more people [MASK] and companies need to step up and play the role that i know they can in bringing about this revolution[MASK] <unk> revolution you 've probably heard of the saying food for thought well this is literally thought for food [MASK] it finally is[MASK] the right idea at the right time[MASK]
