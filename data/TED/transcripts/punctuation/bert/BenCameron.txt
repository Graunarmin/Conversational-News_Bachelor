institutions will continue to have importance [MASK] they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not[MASK] <unk> opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home [MASK] but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is by far too shortsighted
