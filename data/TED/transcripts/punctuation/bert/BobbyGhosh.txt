 <unk> 'm going to talk about the power of a word jihad [MASK] to the vast majority of practicing muslims jihad is an internal struggle[MASK] <unk> against vice <unk> sin <unk> temptation lust greed it is a struggle to try and live a life that is[MASK] set by the moral codes written in the koran <unk> [MASK] in that original idea the concept of jihad is as important to muslims[MASK] as the idea of grace is to[MASK] <unk> christians it 's a very powerful word jihad <unk> if you look at it in that respect and there 's a certain[MASK] almost mystical resonance to it and that 's the reason why for hundreds of years muslims everywhere have named their children jihad <unk> their daughters[MASK] as much as their sons in the same way that say christians name their daughters[MASK] <unk> my people name our daughters bhakti which means in sanskrit <unk> spiritual worship <unk> [MASK] but there have always been in islam a small group a minority <unk> [MASK] who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith or the faithul [MASK] and some of these people believe that in that struggle it is sometimes okay[MASK] <unk> take up arms <unk> [MASK] and so the thousands of young muslim men who flocked to afghanistan in the <unk> 1980s to fight against the soviet occupation of a muslim country <unk> [MASK] in their minds they were fighting a jihad <unk> [MASK] they were doing jihad <unk> and they named themselves the mujahideen which is a word that comes from the same root[MASK] <unk> forget this now but back then[MASK] the mujahideen were celebrated in this country <unk> [MASK] in america <unk> we thought of them as as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists [MASK] america gave them weapons gave them money gave them support encouragement <unk> [MASK] but within that group a tiny smaller group a minority within a minority within a minority were coming up with a new[MASK] <unk> new and dangerous[MASK] conception of jihad <unk> and in time this group would come to be led by osama bin laden [MASK] and he refined the idea his idea of jihad was a global war of terror <unk> [MASK] primarily targeted at the far enemy at the crusaders from the[MASK] <unk> and the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous so monstrous <unk> and had such great impact that his definition[MASK] was the one that stuck [MASK] not just here in the west <unk> we didn 't know any better <unk> we didn 't pause pause to ask <unk> we just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were[MASK] calling what they did jihad then that 's what jihad must mean but it wasn 't just[MASK] <unk> us even in the muslim world [MASK] his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance [MASK] a year ago i was in tunis <unk> [MASK] and i met the the imam of a very small mosque an old man fifteen years ago he named his granddaughter jihad <unk> [MASK] after the old meaning he hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live[MASK] a spiritual life but he told me that[MASK] <unk> after nine eleven [MASK] he began to have second thoughts <unk> [MASK] he worried that if he called her by that name especially outdoors <unk> outside in public <unk> [MASK] he might be seen as endorsing bin laden 's idea of jihad <unk> [MASK] on fridays in his mosque he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word <unk> [MASK] but his congregants <unk> the people who came to[MASK] <unk> mosque <unk> they had seen the videos <unk> they had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers the towers coming down <unk> [MASK] they had heard bin laden say that that was jihad <unk> and claimed victory for it and so the old imam worried that[MASK] his words were falling on deaf ears no one was paying attention <unk> [MASK] he was wrong some people were paying attention but for the wrong reasons the united states[MASK] <unk> this point was putting pressure on all its arab allies including tunisia to stamp out extremism in their societies <unk> [MASK] and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs[MASK] of the tunisian intelligence service <unk> they had never paid him any attention before old man small mosque[MASK] but now they began to pay visits <unk> and sometimes they would drag him in for questions and always the same question[MASK] <unk> you name your granddaughter[MASK] jihad <unk> why do you keep using the word jihad in your friday sermons [MASK] do you hate americans what is your connection to osama bin laden [MASK] so to the tunisian intelligence agency and organizations like it all over the arab world [MASK] <unk> bin laden 's definition[MASK] had become institutionalized that was the power[MASK] of that word that he was able to do and it filled this this old imam it filled him with great sadness [MASK] he told me that of bin laden 's many crimes this was in his mind one that didn 't get enough attention that he took this word this[MASK] <unk> he didn 't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it[MASK] and turned it into something it was never meant to be <unk> and then persuaded all of us that it always was[MASK] a global jihad <unk> but <unk>[MASK] the good news is that the global jihad is almost over as bin laden defined it[MASK] <unk> it was dying well before he did <unk> and now it 's on its last legs <unk> opinion polls from all over the muslim world show that there is very little interest[MASK] among muslims[MASK] in a global holy war against the west against the the far enemy <unk> the supply of of young men willing to[MASK] fight and die for this cause is dwindling <unk> [MASK] the supply of money just as important more important perhaps the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling the wealthy fanatics who were previously[MASK] sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous [MASK] what does that mean for us in the west does it mean we can break out the champagne <unk> [MASK] wash our hands of it <unk> disengage <unk> sleep easy at night[MASK] <unk> is not an option <unk> because if you let local[MASK] jihad survive <unk> it becomes international jihad <unk> and so there 's now a lot of different[MASK] violent jihads all over the world in somalia in mali in nigeria [MASK] in iraq in afghanistan pakistan <unk> there are groups that claim to be[MASK] the inheritors of the legacy of osama bin laden <unk> they use his rhetoric [MASK] they even use the brand name he created for his jihad <unk> so there is now an al qaeda in the[MASK] islamic maghreb there 's an al qaeda in the arabian peninsula there is an al qaeda in mesopotamia [MASK] <unk> there are other groups in nigeria boko haram in somalia al shabaab and they[MASK] all pay homage to osama bin laden but if you look closely <unk> [MASK] they 're not fighting a global jihad they 're fighting battles over much narrower issues <unk> [MASK] usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism <unk> or it 's a power struggle more often than not it 's a power struggle in[MASK] <unk> even a small region within one country <unk> occasionally they will go across a border from iraq to syria <unk>[MASK] <unk> from mali to algeria from somalia to kenya but they 're not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy <unk> [MASK] but that doesn 't mean[MASK] that we can relax i was in yemen[MASK] <unk> it 's the home of the last al qaeda franchise[MASK] that still aspires[MASK] to attack america <unk> attack the west it 's old school al qaeda [MASK] you may remember these guys they are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here and they were using the internet to try and instigate[MASK] violence among american muslims <unk> but they have been distracted recently last year they took control over a portion of southern[MASK] <unk> and then the yemeni military got its act together and ordinary people rose up against[MASK] these guys and drove them out and since then most of their activities most of their attacks have been directed at yemenis [MASK] so i think we 've come to a point now where we can say that just like all politics all jihad is local <unk> [MASK] but that 's still not reason[MASK] for us to disengage <unk> because we 've seen that movie before[MASK] <unk> before <unk> in afghanistan <unk> when those mujahideen defeated the soviet union we disengaged <unk> [MASK] and even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne <unk> [MASK] the taliban had taken over in kabul <unk> and we said local jihad[MASK] <unk> and then the taliban gave the keys of kandahar to osama bin laden he made it our problem [MASK] local jihad <unk> if you ignore it becomes global jihad again [MASK] the good news is that it doesn 't have to be <unk> [MASK] we know how to fight it now <unk> we have the tools we have the knowhow <unk> [MASK] and we can take the lessons we 've learned from[MASK] fight against global jihad the victory against global jihad <unk> and apply those[MASK] to local jihad <unk> what are those lessons [MASK] we know who killed bin laden <unk> seal team six [MASK] do we know do we understand <unk> who killed bin ladenism <unk> who ended the global jihad <unk> [MASK] there lie the answers to the solution to local jihad <unk> who killed bin[MASK] <unk> let 's start with bin laden himself [MASK] he probably thought nine eleven was his greatest achievement <unk> in reality <unk> it was the beginning of the end for him <unk> [MASK] he killed three thousand innocent people and that filled the muslim world with horror and revulsion[MASK] and what that meant was that his his idea of jihad could never become mainstream <unk> [MASK] he condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community[MASK] <unk> nine eleven didn 't empower him <unk> it doomed him <unk> [MASK] who killed bin ladenism <unk> abu musab <unk> al zarqawi killed it <unk> he was the[MASK] especially sadistic head of al qaeda in iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not americans[MASK] but iraqis muslims <unk> [MASK] <unk> sunni as well as shiites any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders[MASK] was drowned in the blood[MASK] of iraqi muslims <unk> who killed[MASK] osama bin laden <unk> the seal team six <unk> who killed bin ladenism <unk> al jazeera did al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations[MASK] <unk> television stations in a lot of these countries[MASK] which were designed to keep information from people [MASK] al jazeera brought information to them [MASK] showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion exposed the hypocrisy of osama bin laden and al qaeda [MASK] and allowed them gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions[MASK] <unk> who killed bin ladenism <unk> the arab spring did because it showed a way for young muslims to bring about change[MASK] in a manner that osama bin laden with his limited imagination could never have conceived <unk> [MASK] who defeated the global jihad <unk> the american military did the american soldiers did <unk> with their allies fighting in faraway battlefields[MASK] and perhaps a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it [MASK] so all these factors and many more besides we don 't even fully understand some of them[MASK] yet these came together[MASK] to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin ladenism <unk> the[MASK] <unk> you needed this group effort now not all of these things will work in local jihad <unk> the american military is not going to march into nigeria to take on boko haram <unk> [MASK] and it 's unlikely that seal team six will rappel into the homes of al shabaab 's leaders and take them out [MASK] but many of these other factors[MASK] that were in play are now even stronger than before half the work is already done <unk> we don 't have to reinvent the wheel[MASK] <unk> the notion of violent jihad in which more muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited <unk> we don 't have to go back to that [MASK] satellite television and and the internet[MASK] are informing and empowering young muslims in exciting new ways <unk> [MASK] and the arab spring has produced governments many of them islamist governments who[MASK] <unk> know that for their own self preservation they need to take on the extremists in their midsts <unk> [MASK] we don 't need to persuade them but we do need to help them because[MASK] they haven 't really come to this place before the good news again is that[MASK] a lot of the things they need we already have and we are very good at giving[MASK] <unk> not just money <unk> but expertise <unk> technology knowhow [MASK] private investment <unk> [MASK] fair terms of trade <unk> medicine <unk> education <unk> [MASK] technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective for their anti terror forces to become more[MASK] efficient[MASK] <unk> we 've got plenty of these things some of the other things that they need[MASK] we 're not very good at giving <unk> maybe nobody is time patience subtlety understanding[MASK] these are harder to give i live in new york now just this week posters have gone up in subway stations in new york that describe jihad as savage[MASK] <unk> we can say that[MASK]
