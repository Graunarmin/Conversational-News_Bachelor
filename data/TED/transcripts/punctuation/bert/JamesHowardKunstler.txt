 <unk> of our everyday environments in america is entropy made visible[MASK] <unk> you can describe this you know <unk> i like to call it the national automobile slum you can call it suburban sprawl [MASK] i think it 's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world <unk> you can call it a[MASK] technosis externality clusterfuck[MASK] <unk> and it 's a tremendous problem for us [MASK] the outstanding the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about we 're[MASK] going to talk about that some more [MASK] a sense of place your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings and to employ[MASK] <unk> employ the vocabularies grammars syntaxes rhythms and patterns of architecture[MASK] in order to inform us who we are the public realm[MASK] in america[MASK] has two roles it is the dwelling place of our civilization[MASK] <unk> and our civic life and it is the physical manifestation of the common good [MASK] and when you degrade the public realm you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments[MASK] of your public life and communal life that take place[MASK] there <unk> the public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in america because we don 't have the <unk>[MASK] <unk> cathedral plazas and[MASK] <unk> market squares of older cultures <unk> and[MASK] your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about[MASK] all comes from a body of culture that we call the the culture of civic design this is a body of knowledge method[MASK] <unk> and principle that we[MASK] threw in the garbage[MASK] after world war ii and decided we don 't need that anymore we 're not going to use it <unk> [MASK] and consequently <unk> we can see the result all around us <unk> [MASK] the public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically <unk> [MASK] but it has to inform us where we are in our culture where we 've come from what kind of people we are <unk> and it needs to by doing that[MASK] it needs to afford us a glimpse[MASK] to where we 're going[MASK] in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present <unk> [MASK] and if there is one tremendous if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we 've built the human environments we 've made for ourselves in the last fifty years it is that it has deprived us[MASK] of the ability to live[MASK] <unk> hopeful present[MASK] <unk> the environments we are living in more typically are like these you know [MASK] this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town and[MASK] remember to create a place of character and quality you have to be able to define space so how is that being[MASK] <unk> over here and try to look at the target store over here you can 't see it because of the curvature of the earth [MASK] that 's nature 's way of telling you that you 're doing a poor job of defining space consequently these will be places that nobody[MASK] wants to be in these will be places that are not worth caring about[MASK] <unk> thousand places that are not worth caring about in the united states today when we have enough of them we 're going to have a nation that 's not worth defending <unk> [MASK] and i want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like iraq spilling their blood in the sand [MASK] and ask yourself what is their last thought of home i hope it 's not the curb cut between the chuck e cheese and the target store because that 's not good enough[MASK] <unk> for americans[MASK] to be spilling their blood for we need better places in this country [MASK] public space this is a good public space it[MASK] 's a place worth caring about it 's well defined it is emphatically an outdoor public room it has something that is terribly important it has what 's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge that 's a fancy way of saying it 's got shops[MASK] <unk> destinations things go in and out of it <unk> it 's permeable the beer goes in and out the waitresses go in and out <unk> and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in you know [MASK] in these places in other cultures[MASK] <unk> people just go there voluntarily because they like them we don 't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here[MASK] <unk> kwanzaa festival people just go[MASK] because it 's pleasurable to be there <unk> but this is how we do it in the united states [MASK] probably the most significant public space failure in america designed by the leading architects of the day harry cobb and i m pei boston city hall plaza a public place so dismal that the winos don 't even want to go there[MASK] <unk> and we can 't fix it because i m pei 's still alive and every year harvard and m i t have a joint committee to repair it <unk> and every year they fail to because they don 't want to hurt i m pei 's feelings <unk> [MASK] this is the other side of the building this was the winner of an international design award in <unk>[MASK] something like that it wasn 't pei and cobb another firm designed this but there 's not enough prozac in the world to make people[MASK] <unk> feel ok[MASK] about going down this block <unk> [MASK] this is the back of boston city hall the most important you know significant civic building in albany[MASK] excuse me in in boston and[MASK] what is the message that is coming what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building and how is it informing us about who we are this[MASK] <unk> fact would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of josef stalin pol pot [MASK] saddam hussein <unk> [MASK] and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building <unk> because then we 'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us you know that it 's a despotic building it wants us to feel like termites[MASK] <unk> this is it on a smaller scale the back of <unk> the civic center in my town saratoga springs new york by the way when i showed this[MASK] slide to a group of kiwanians in my town <unk> they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken and[MASK] they shouted at me and said it was raining that day when you took that picture[MASK] <unk> because this was perceived to be a weather problem you know [MASK] this is a building[MASK] designed like a dvd player audio jack power supply[MASK] <unk> you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms right you know we hire firms to design these things you can see exactly what went on three o 'clock in the morning at the design meeting you know[MASK] <unk> eight hours before deadline four architects trying to get this building in on time right [MASK] and they 're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings and the renderings <unk> and all the chinese food caskets are lying on the table <unk> [MASK] and i mean what was the conversation that was going on there[MASK] because you know what the last word was what the last sentence was of that meeting it was fuck it [MASK] that[MASK] that is the message of this form[MASK] of architecture the message is we don 't give a fuck <unk> we don 't give a fuck[MASK] <unk> so i went back on the nicest day of the year just to you know do some reality testing <unk> and in fact <unk> he will not even go down there because [MASK] it 's not interesting enough for his clients <unk> you know the burglars the muggers it[MASK] 's not civically rich enough for them to go down there <unk> [MASK] <unk> the pattern of main street usa in fact <unk> this pattern of building downtown blocks all over the world is fairly universal it 's not that complicated buildings <unk>[MASK] <unk> more than one story high built out to the sidewalk edge <unk> so that[MASK] <unk> and so on you make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor they haven 't learned that in monterey if you go out to the the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center you 'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner it 's[MASK] really incredible anyway <unk> this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building and this is what happened when in glens falls new york when we tried to do it again where it was missing right so the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story[MASK] <unk> above grade to make it sporty <unk> [MASK] ok that completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk where the theoretical pedestrians are of course they[MASK] 'll never be there [MASK] as long as this is in that condition [MASK] then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed we pop a handicapped ramp on that and then to make ourselves feel better we put a nature[MASK] band aid in front of it <unk> and that 's how we do it <unk> i call them nature band aids because there 's a general[MASK] idea in america that the the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature[MASK] and in fact the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism good buildings not just flower beds not just cartoons of the sierra nevada mountains[MASK] <unk> know that 's not good enough we have to do good buildings the street trees have really four jobs to do and that 's it to spatially denote the pedestrian realm to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway [MASK] to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to[MASK] create a ceiling a vaulted ceiling over the street at its best <unk> and that that 's it <unk> those are the four jobs of the the[MASK] street trees they 're not supposed to be a cartoon of the north woods they 're not supposed to be a set for the[MASK] last of the mohicans you know <unk> one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our[MASK] understanding of the distinction between the country and the town between the urban and the rural they 're not the same thing and we 're not going to cure the[MASK] <unk> problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city <unk> which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time <unk> here you see it on a small scale the mothership has landed[MASK] have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet [MASK] a lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in america was such a trauma[MASK] that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city city life and everything connected with it <unk> and so what you see fairly early [MASK] in the mid 19th century is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city <unk> which is going to be life in the country for everybody <unk> [MASK] and that starts to be delivered in the form of the the railroad suburb the country villa along the railroad line[MASK] which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city <unk> but to return to the countryside every night and believe me there were no wal marts or convenience stores out there then <unk> so it really was a form <unk>[MASK] <unk> of country living but what happens is of course it mutates over the next eighty years and it turns into something rather insidious it becomes a cartoon of a country house in a cartoon of the country and that 's the great[MASK] of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule because it hasn 't delivered what it 's been promising for half a century now[MASK] and these are[MASK] these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there you know <unk> basically a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state emphatically [MASK] i 'm a little cabin in the woods there 's nothing on either[MASK] side of me i don 't have any eyes on the side of my head i can 't see [MASK] so you have this one last facade of the house the front which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house because[MASK] notice the porch here <unk> unless the people that live here are munchkins[MASK] <unk> nobody 's going to be using that <unk> this is really in fact a television[MASK] broadcasting a show twenty four seven called we 're normal we 're normal[MASK] <unk> we 're normal please respect us we 're normal we 're normal we 're normal <unk> but we know what 's going on in these houses you know we know that little skippy is loading his uzi down here [MASK] getting ready for homeroom [MASK] we know that heather his sister heather fourteen years old is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit [MASK] because these places these habitats are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children <unk> and they don 't have a lot of[MASK] <unk> experience with medication so they take the first one that comes along often these are not good enough for americans [MASK] these are the schools we are sending them to the hannibal lecter central school <unk> [MASK] las vegas nevada this is[MASK] a real school <unk> you know but there 's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver[MASK] so every effort is made to keep them within the the building notice that nature is present [MASK] we 're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not we are entering an epochal period of change in the world and certainly in america[MASK] <unk> change absolutely everything [MASK] chris asked me not to go on too long about this and i won 't except to say there 's not going to be a hydrogen economy <unk> forget it it 's not going to happen[MASK] <unk> we 're going to have to do something else instead <unk> we 're going to have to <unk>[MASK] and re size virtually everything we do in this country and we can 't start soon enough to do it <unk> we 're going to have we 're going to have to[MASK] <unk> live closer to where we work we 're going to have to live closer to each other we 're going have to grow more food closer to where we live the[MASK] age of the three thousand mile caesar salad is coming to an end <unk> [MASK] we 're going to have to we have a railroad system that the bulgarians would be ashamed of [MASK] we gotta do better than that and we should have started two days before yesterday [MASK] we are fortunate that the new urbanists were[MASK] <unk> there for the last ten years excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents ' generation after world war ii because we 're going to need it if we 're going <unk>[MASK] <unk> to learn how to reconstruct towns we 're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re learn how to compose meaningful places places that are integral that allow that are[MASK] <unk> living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life deployed in an integral fashion <unk> [MASK] so that you know <unk> the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business of culture and of governance[MASK] <unk> what the building blocks of these things are the street <unk> the block how to compose public space that 's both large and small the courtyard the civic square[MASK] and how to really make use of of this property [MASK] we can see some of the first ideas for retro fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in america <unk> the dead malls what are we going to do with them well in point of fact <unk> most of them are not going to make it they 're not going to be[MASK] <unk> salvage yards of the future some of them we 're going to fix though and we 're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development <unk> [MASK] and if we 're lucky the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities and by the way [MASK] our towns and cities are where they are and[MASK] <unk> grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites <unk> and most of them are still going to be there although the scale of them is probably going to be[MASK] diminished [MASK] we 've got a lot of work to do <unk> we 're not going to be rescued by the hyper car we 're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels no amount or combination[MASK] <unk> of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we 're running the way we 're running it we 're going to have to do everything very differently[MASK] <unk> and america 's not prepared we are sleepwalking into the future <unk> we 're not ready for what 's coming at us <unk> [MASK] so i urge you all to do what you can life in the[MASK] the <unk>[MASK] <unk> century is going to be about living[MASK] <unk> be prepared to be good neighbors be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your
