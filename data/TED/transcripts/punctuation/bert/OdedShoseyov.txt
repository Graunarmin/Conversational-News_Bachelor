 <unk> two hundred years[MASK] of modern science [MASK] we have to admit that our performance is not great the machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures <unk> [MASK] <unk> the houses we build[MASK] do not survive severe earthquakes but we shouldn 't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason they didn 't have much time [MASK] two hundred years is not a lot of time <unk> while nature[MASK] had three billion years[MASK] to perfect some of the most amazing materials that we wish we had in our possession <unk> [MASK] remember these materials carry a quality assurance[MASK] of three billion years[MASK] take for example sequoia trees <unk> they carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years[MASK] in cold weather <unk> in warm climates uv light <unk> [MASK] yet <unk> if you look at the structure by high resolution electron microscopy <unk> and you ask yourself what is it made of surprisingly[MASK] <unk> made of sugar <unk> [MASK] well not exactly as we drink in our tea it 's actually a nanofiber called nanocrystalline cellulose <unk> and this nanocrystalline cellulose[MASK] is so strong on a weight basis <unk> it 's about ten times stronger than steel <unk> yet it 's made of sugar <unk> [MASK] so scientists all over the world believe that <unk>[MASK] is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry <unk> but here 's the[MASK] <unk> problem say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose to build a boat or an airplane <unk> well <unk> you can google you can ebay you can even alibaba [MASK] you won 't find it of course you 're going to find[MASK] thousands of scientific papers great papers where scientists are going to say this is a great[MASK] <unk> lots of things we can do with it but no commercial source <unk> [MASK] so we at the hebrew university <unk> together with our partners in sweden decided to focus on the development[MASK] process to produce this <unk>[MASK] <unk> of course <unk> we didn 't want to cut trees <unk> so we were looking for another source of raw material <unk> and we found one[MASK] in fact <unk> the sludge of the paper industry[MASK] the reason <unk> there is a lot of it europe alone produces eleven million tons of that material annually it[MASK] 's the equivalent[MASK] of a mountain three kilometers high <unk> sitting on a soccer field [MASK] and we produce this mountain every year <unk> so for everybody <unk> it 's an environmental problem <unk> and for us it 's a gold mine[MASK] so now we are actually producing on an industrial scale in israel <unk> nanocellulose and very soon in sweden [MASK] we can do a lot of things with the material for example <unk> [MASK] we have shown that by adding only a small percent of <unk>[MASK] into cotton fibers the same as my shirt is made of it increases its strength dramatically so this can be used for[MASK] <unk> making[MASK] amazing things like <unk> super fabrics for industrial and medical applications <unk> but this is not the only thing [MASK] for example[MASK] <unk> structures like the shelters that you can see now actually are now showcasing in the venice biennale[MASK] <unk> nature actually didn 't stop its wonders[MASK] in the plant kingdom <unk> [MASK] think about insects cat fleas for example have the ability to jump about a hundred times their height [MASK] that 's amazing <unk> it 's the equivalent of a person standing in the middle of liberty island[MASK] in new york[MASK] <unk> and in a single jump going to the top[MASK] of the statue of liberty [MASK] i 'm sure everybody would like to do that [MASK] so the question is how do cat fleas do it it turns out they make this wonderful material <unk> which is called resilin [MASK] in simple words resilin which is a protein [MASK] is the most[MASK] elastic[MASK] <unk> you can squish it and it doesn 't lose almost any energy to the environment[MASK] when you release it snap it brings back all the energy <unk> [MASK] so i 'm sure everybody would like to have that material <unk> but here 's the problem [MASK] to catch cat fleas is difficult[MASK] <unk> it 's actually enough to catch one now we can extract its dna and read how cat fleas make the resilin and clone it[MASK] into a less jumpy organism[MASK] like a plant <unk> [MASK] so that 's exactly what we did <unk> now we have the ability to produce lots of resilin well <unk> my team decided to do something really cool at the university[MASK] <unk> decided to combine the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom[MASK] nanocellulose with resilin and the result is amazing [MASK] this material <unk> in fact is tough elastic and transparent <unk> [MASK] so there are lots of things that can be done with this material for example[MASK] <unk> shoes <unk> so we can jump higher <unk> run faster and even touch screens for computers[MASK] and smartphones that won 't break <unk> well <unk> the problem is we continue[MASK] to implant synthetic implants in our body <unk> which we glue and screw[MASK] into our body <unk> and i 'm going to say that this is not a good idea <unk> why <unk> because they fail this synthetic[MASK] <unk> fails just like this[MASK] plastic fork [MASK] that is not strong enough for its performance [MASK] but sometimes they are too strong <unk> and therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit their surrounding tissues <unk> [MASK] but in fact the reason is much more fundamental <unk> the reason is[MASK] that in nature there is no one there[MASK] that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck[MASK] or takes my skin and glues it onto my body <unk> [MASK] in nature everything is self assembled [MASK] so every living cell <unk> whether coming from a plant insect or human being has a dna[MASK] that encodes for <unk> nanobio building blocks many times they are proteins other times they are enzymes that make other materials like polysaccharides[MASK] <unk> fatty acids and the common feature about all these materials[MASK] is that they need no one they recognize each other and <unk> self assemble into structures[MASK] scaffolds on which cells are proliferating[MASK] to give tissues <unk> they develop into organs and together bring[MASK] <unk> so we at the hebrew university about ten years ago decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial[MASK] for humans which is collagen <unk> [MASK] why collagen <unk> because collagen accounts for about twenty five percent of our dry weight we have nothing more than collagen <unk> other than water [MASK] in our body <unk> [MASK] so i always like to say anyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings[MASK] <unk> like to have collagen [MASK] admittedly before we started our project there were already more than one thousand medical implants made of collagen you[MASK] know simple things like dermal fillers[MASK] to reduce wrinkles <unk> augment lips and other more sophisticated medical implants like heart valves <unk> so where is the problem well[MASK] the problem is the source the source of[MASK] <unk> all that collagen is actually coming from dead bodies <unk> dead pigs <unk> dead cows[MASK] and even human cadavers <unk> so safety is a big issue <unk> [MASK] but it 's not the only one also the quality now here i have a personal interest this is my[MASK] <unk> in our winery in israel a heart valve very similar to the one that i showed you before seven years ago was implanted in his body <unk> [MASK] now the scientific literature says that these heart valves[MASK] start to fail[MASK] ten years after the operation [MASK] no wonder they are made from old used tissues <unk> just like this[MASK] wall made of bricks that is falling apart yeah[MASK] of course i can take those bricks and and build a new wall <unk> but it 's not going to be the same <unk> so the us food and drug administration[MASK] made a notice already in two thousand and seven asking the companies to start to look for better alternatives <unk> [MASK] so that 's exactly what we did <unk> [MASK] we decided to clone[MASK] all the five human genes responsible for making[MASK] type i collagen in humans[MASK] into a transgenic[MASK] tobacco plant <unk> so now the plant has the ability to make human collagen[MASK] brand new untouched <unk> this is amazing actually it 's happening now <unk> today in israel we[MASK] <unk> thousand square meters of greenhouses all over the country <unk> [MASK] the farmers receive small plantlets of tobacco it looks exactly like regular tobacco <unk> except that they have five human genes they 're[MASK] responsible for making type i collagen <unk> [MASK] we grow them for about fifty to seventy days <unk> [MASK] we harvest the leaves and then the leaves are transported by cooling trucks to the factory there the process of extracting the collagen starts[MASK] now <unk> if you ever made a pesto essentially the same thing [MASK] you crush the leaves <unk> you get the juice that contains the collagen we[MASK] concentrate the protein transfer the protein to clean rooms for the final purification and the end result[MASK] is a collagen identical to what we have in our body[MASK] untouched brand new and from which we[MASK] <unk> make different medical implants bone void fillers for example <unk> for severe[MASK] bone fractures <unk> spinal fusion and more recently even we 've been able to launch into the market[MASK] here in europe a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers[MASK] <unk> that is now approved for use in the clinic <unk> this is not science fiction this is happening now we are using plants[MASK] to make medical implants for replacement parts for human beings [MASK] in fact more recently we 've been able to make collagen fibers which are six times stronger than the achilles tendon <unk>[MASK] that 's amazing[MASK] together with our partners from ireland <unk> we thought about the next thing[MASK] to those fibers by doing that we 've been able to make a superfiber which is about three hundred and eighty percent[MASK] tougher and three hundred percent more elastic [MASK] so oddly enough in the future <unk> when a patient is transplanted with[MASK] artificial tendons[MASK] <unk> have better performance after the surgery than we had before the injury[MASK] <unk> so what 's for the future <unk> in the future we believe we 'll be able to make[MASK] many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us[MASK] collagen[MASK] and many more and that will enable us to make better machines perform better[MASK] <unk> heart is not going to be the same as we can get from a donor <unk> it will be better it actually will perform better[MASK] and will last longer my friend zion suliman once told me a smart[MASK] sentence <unk> he said if you want a new idea <unk> you should open an old book and i 'm going to say[MASK] that the book was written it was written over three billion years[MASK] <unk> of evolution and the text is the dna of life all we have to do[MASK] is read this text embrace nature 's gift to us and start our progress from here thank you[MASK]
