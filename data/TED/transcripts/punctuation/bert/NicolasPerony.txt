 <unk> has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the the universe <unk> which is at the same time[MASK] tremendously important and extremely remote <unk> and yet much much[MASK] <unk> closer much more directly related to us there are many things we don 't really understand [MASK] and one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us and today i want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity [MASK] but first <unk> what do we call complexity <unk> [MASK] what is complex well[MASK] <unk> something complicated comprises many small parts <unk> all different [MASK] and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery on the opposite [MASK] a complex system is made of many many similar parts <unk> and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior [MASK] complex systems have many interacting parts[MASK] which behave according to simple individual rules[MASK] and this results in emergent properties <unk> the behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only [MASK] as aristotle wrote <unk> the whole is greater than the sum of its parts <unk> but[MASK] from aristotle let 's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems these are scottish terriers in the beginning <unk> the system is disorganized[MASK] then comes a perturbation <unk> milk every individual starts pushing in one direction[MASK] and this is what happens <unk> [MASK] the pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction [MASK] so[MASK] it 's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges [MASK] i call this simplifying complexity and it 's what we do at the chair of systems design at eth zurich [MASK] we collect data on animal populations <unk> analyze complex patterns try to explain them <unk> [MASK] it requires physicists who work with biologists with mathematicians and computer[MASK] <unk> scientists and it is their interaction that produces <unk> cross boundary competence to solve these problems <unk> [MASK] so again <unk> the whole is greater than the sum of the parts <unk> in a way [MASK] collaboration is another example of a complex system <unk> [MASK] and you may be asking yourself which side i 'm on biology[MASK] <unk> it 's a little different and to explain i need to tell you a short story about myself [MASK] when i was a child i loved to build stuff to create complicated machines <unk> so i set out to study electrical engineering and robotics [MASK] and my my end of studies project was about building a robot called er 1 it looked like this[MASK] that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground[MASK] <unk> it was very very complicated <unk> but it worked beautifully in our test room <unk> [MASK] and on demo day professors had assembled to grade the project so we took er 1 to the evaluation room it[MASK] turned out the light in that room was slightly different <unk> the robot 's vision system got confused at the first bend in the line <unk> [MASK] <unk> and crashed into a wall [MASK] we had spent weeks building it and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room [MASK] that 's when i realized that the more complicated you make a machine the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected <unk> [MASK] and i decided that in fact i didn 't really want to create complicated stuff <unk> [MASK] i wanted to understand complexity the complexity of the world around us and[MASK] <unk> especially in the animal kingdom which brings us to bats [MASK] bechstein 's bats are a common species of european bats they are very social animals mostly they roost or sleep together <unk> [MASK] and they live in maternity colonies which means that every spring <unk> the females meet after the winter hibernation <unk> and they stay together for about six months to rear their young[MASK] carry a very small chip <unk> which means that every time one of them enters enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes <unk> we know where she is and more importantly we know with whom she is [MASK] so i study roosting associations in bats <unk> [MASK] and this is what it looks like <unk> [MASK] during the day <unk> the bats roost in a number of sub groups in different boxes <unk> it could be that on one day[MASK] <unk> the colony is split between two boxes <unk> [MASK] but on another day <unk> it could be together in a single box or split between three or more boxes <unk> and that all seems rather erratic really it 's called fission fusion dynamics <unk> [MASK] the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups <unk> so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them[MASK] <unk> together to extract a long term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony [MASK] okay <unk> so that 's what this picture looks like <unk> [MASK] in this network all the circles are nodes individual bats <unk> [MASK] and the lines between them are social bonds <unk> associations between individuals[MASK] <unk> out this is a very interesting picture [MASK] this bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission fusion dynamics <unk> [MASK] we call them cryptic social units <unk> [MASK] even more interesting in fact every year <unk> around october <unk> the colony splits up <unk> and all[MASK] <unk> but year after year <unk> when the bats come together again in the spring <unk> the communities stay the same [MASK] so these bats remember their friends for a really long time [MASK] with a brain the size of a peanut <unk> they maintain individualized long term social bonds <unk> we didn 't know that was possible [MASK] we knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that but compared to bats they have huge brains so[MASK] how could it be that the bats maintain this complex stable social structure with such limited cognitive cognitive abilities <unk> [MASK] and this is where complexity brings an answer [MASK] to understand this system [MASK] we built a computer model of roosting <unk> based on simple individual rules <unk> and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony it[MASK] 's a mathematical model[MASK] <unk> but it 's not complicated [MASK] what the model told us is that in a nutshell each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them [MASK] simple <unk> individual rules this is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats <unk> but it gets better [MASK] between two thousand and ten and two thousand and eleven the[MASK] <unk> colony lost more than two thirds of its members probably due to the very cold winter [MASK] the next spring <unk> it didn 't form two communities like every year <unk> which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small [MASK] instead it formed a single cohesive social unit [MASK] which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years[MASK] what we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this all they do is follow simple association rules <unk> and from this simplicity emerges social complexity[MASK] which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure <unk> and i find this incredible[MASK] <unk> to tell you another story but for this we have to travel from europe to the kalahari desert in south africa this is where meerkats live i 'm sure[MASK] you know meerkats they 're fascinating creatures[MASK] they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy <unk>[MASK] there is one dominant pair and many subordinates some acting as sentinels some acting as babysitters some teaching pups and so on [MASK] what we do is put very small gps collars on these animals[MASK] <unk> how they move together and what this has to do with their social structure [MASK] and there 's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats [MASK] in the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road on this road there are cars <unk> so it 's dangerous <unk> [MASK] but the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to[MASK] <unk> so we asked [MASK] how exactly do they do this [MASK] we found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road <unk> but when it comes to crossing it crossing the road she gives way to the subordinates [MASK] a manner of saying go ahead tell me if it 's safe [MASK] what i didn 't know in fact was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen[MASK] and if simple rules were sufficient[MASK] <unk> to explain it <unk> [MASK] so i built a model [MASK] a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road <unk> [MASK] it 's a simplistic model moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment they simply move together <unk> [MASK] when these particles get to the road <unk> they sense some kind of obstacle <unk> and they bounce against it the only difference[MASK] between the dominant female <unk> here in red <unk> and the other individuals is that for her <unk> the height of the obstacle <unk> which is in fact the risk perceived from the road is just slightly higher <unk> [MASK] and this tiny difference in the individual 's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe that[MASK] the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first[MASK] <unk> george box who was an english statistician <unk> once wrote all models are false <unk> but some models are useful [MASK] and in fact <unk> this model[MASK] is obviously false <unk> because in reality meerkats are anything but random particles but it 's also useful because it tells us that extreme[MASK] <unk> at the individual level[MASK] can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group <unk> [MASK] so again that 's simplifying complexity <unk> i would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species <unk> [MASK] when the dominant female[MASK] gives way to a subordinate it 's not out of courtesy <unk> [MASK] in fact the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group if she dies on the road <unk> the whole group is at risk[MASK] <unk> behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response these meerkats[MASK] are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old and they 're adapting it to a modern risk <unk> in this case a road built by humans <unk> [MASK] they adapt very simple rules <unk> and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat[MASK] in the end <unk> [MASK] it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash or[MASK] it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road or[MASK] it may be another species [MASK] my message here and it 's not a complicated one but a simple one of wonder[MASK] <unk> and hope[MASK] my message here is that[MASK] animals show extraordinary social complexity <unk> and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment in[MASK] three words in the animal kingdom <unk> simplicity[MASK] leads to complexity which leads to resilience <unk> thank you[MASK]
