 <unk> any power in design that 's the power of synthesis <unk> the more complex the problem <unk> the more the need for simplicity <unk> [MASK] so allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design 's power of synthesis <unk> [MASK] let 's start[MASK] <unk> start with the global challenge of urbanization <unk> [MASK] it 's a fact that people are moving towards <unk> cities and even if counterintuitive <unk> it 's good news <unk> [MASK] evidence shows that people are better off in cities <unk> [MASK] but there 's a problem that i would call the 3s menace <unk> [MASK] the scale <unk> speed and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon[MASK] <unk> has no precedence in history [MASK] for you to have an idea out of the three billion people living in cities today one billion are under the line of poverty [MASK] by two thousand and thirty out of the five billion people that will be living in cities [MASK] two billion are going to be under the line of poverty [MASK] <unk> that means that we will have to build[MASK] a one <unk>[MASK] city per week[MASK] with ten thousand dollars per family[MASK] during the next fifteen years a one million person city per week with ten thousand dollars per family if we don 't solve this equation it is not that people[MASK] <unk> will stop coming to cities they will come anyhow <unk> [MASK] but they will live in slums favelas and informal settlements <unk> so what to do <unk> [MASK] well an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves [MASK] a clue could be in this question we were asked ten years ago <unk> we were asked to accommodate one hundred families that had been occupying[MASK] illegally half a hectare[MASK] in the center of the city of iquique in the north of chile using a $ ten thousand subsidy with which we had to buy the land [MASK] provide the infrastructure and build the houses that in the best of the cases would be of around forty square meters[MASK] <unk> and by the way they said [MASK] the cost of the land because it 's in the center of the city is three times more than what social housing can normally afford <unk> [MASK] due to the difficulty of the question we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints <unk> [MASK] and we started a participatory design process and testing what was available[MASK] <unk> only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height [MASK] and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution <unk> because they could not make the tiny apartments expand <unk> [MASK] so the conclusion with the[MASK] <unk> families and this is important not our conclusion with the families was that we had a problem we had to innovate <unk> so what did we do [MASK] well a middle class family[MASK] lives reasonably well in around eighty square meters <unk> but[MASK] when there 's no money what the market does is to reduce the size of the house[MASK] to forty square meters <unk> what we said was what if <unk> [MASK] instead of thinking of forty square meters[MASK] as a small house why don 't we consider it half of a good one when you rephrase the[MASK] <unk> problem as half of a good house instead of a small one <unk> the key question is which half do we do <unk> [MASK] and we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won 't be able to do individually[MASK] <unk> we identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half[MASK] <unk> a house and we went back to the families to do two things join forces and split tasks [MASK] our design was something in between a building and a house [MASK] as a building it could pay for expensive well located land <unk> [MASK] and as a house <unk> it could expand if[MASK] in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house families kept their network and their jobs[MASK] <unk> we knew that the expansion would begin right away <unk> so we went from this initial social housing[MASK] to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks [MASK] this was our first project in iquique ten years ago this is our last project in chile <unk> different designs[MASK] <unk> same principle you provide the frame <unk> and from then on families take over <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] the purpose of design [MASK] trying to understand and trying to give an answer to the 3s menace scale speed and scarcity is to channel people 's own building[MASK] <unk> we won 't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people 's own power for building <unk> [MASK] so with the right design slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution <unk> [MASK] the second case is how design can contribute to sustainability in two thousand and[MASK] <unk> we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation <unk> [MASK] it is accepted that for such an aim knowledge creation interaction among people face to face contact it 's important and we agreed on that [MASK] but for us the question of the right environment was a very literal question we wanted to have a working space with the right light with the right temperature with[MASK] <unk> the right air <unk> [MASK] so we asked ourselves [MASK] does the typical office building help us in that sense <unk> well how does that building look typically <unk> [MASK] it 's a collection of floors one on top of each other with a core in the center with[MASK] <unk> and then a glass skin on the outside[MASK] that due to direct sun radiation <unk> creates a huge greenhouse effect inside <unk> [MASK] in addition to that let 's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day through the third floor but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on <unk> [MASK] so we thought well <unk> maybe we have[MASK] <unk> to turn this scheme inside out <unk> and what we did was let 's have an open atrium a[MASK] hollowed core <unk> the same collection of floors <unk> but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter <unk> [MASK] so that[MASK] when the sun[MASK] <unk> 's not impacting directly glass but a wall [MASK] when you have an open atrium inside you are able to see what others are doing from within the building and you have a better way to control light <unk> [MASK] and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter <unk> then you are preventing direct sun radiation <unk> [MASK] you may also open those windows and get[MASK] <unk> we just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares <unk> outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building <unk> [MASK] none of this is rocket science <unk> you don 't require sophisticated programming it 's not about technology this is just[MASK] <unk> and by using common sense <unk> we went from one hundred and twenty kilowatts per square meter per year <unk> which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower [MASK] to forty[MASK] kilowatts per square meter per year <unk> so with the right design sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common[MASK] <unk> last case i would like to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters [MASK] you may know that chile in two thousand and ten was hit by an eight point eight richter scale earthquake and tsunami <unk> [MASK] and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the constitucin in the southern part of the[MASK] <unk> we were given one hundred days [MASK] three months to design almost everything from public buildings to public space <unk> street grid transportation housing and mainly[MASK] how to protect the city against future tsunamis <unk> [MASK] this was new in chilean urban design <unk> [MASK] and there were in the air a couple of alternatives first one <unk> forbid installation on ground zero <unk> thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation[MASK] this is exactly what 's being discussed in japan nowadays and if you have a disciplined population like the japanese this may work [MASK] but we know that in chile <unk> this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow <unk> so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable [MASK] second alternative build a[MASK] big wall heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves[MASK] <unk> this alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies because it meant forty two million dollars in contracts and was also politically preferred because it required no land expropriation <unk> [MASK] but japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless <unk>[MASK] <unk> and we started a participatory design process[MASK] <unk> i don 't know if you were able to read the subtitles but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not[MASK] <unk> it is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer <unk> [MASK] it is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question there is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question <unk> [MASK] so it was pretty obvious after this process that well <unk> [MASK] we chicken out here and go away because it 's too tense <unk> or we go even further[MASK] in asking what else is bothering you what other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city[MASK] will have to be rethought from scratch <unk> [MASK] and what they said was look <unk> fine to protect the city against future tsunamis we really appreciate but the next one is going to come in what twenty years <unk> [MASK] but every single year <unk> we have problems of flooding due to rain[MASK] <unk> in addition we are in the middle of the forest region of the country <unk> and our public space sucks <unk> it 's poor and it 's scarce [MASK] and the origin of the city our identity is not really connected to the buildings that fell <unk> it is connected to the river <unk> but the river cannot be accessed publicly because its shores are privately owned[MASK] <unk> so we thought that we had to produce a third alternative <unk> [MASK] and our our approach was against geographical threats have geographical answers [MASK] what if <unk> in between the city[MASK] and the sea[MASK] we have a forest[MASK] a forest that doesn 't try to resist the energy of nature <unk> but dissipates it by introducing friction [MASK] a forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding [MASK] that may pay the historical debt of public space <unk> [MASK] and that may provide finally[MASK] <unk> access to the river <unk> [MASK] so as a conclusion of the participatory design <unk> the alternative was validated politically and socially but there was still the problem of the cost[MASK] forty eight million dollars <unk> so what we did was a survey in the public investment system <unk> and found out that[MASK] were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place not knowing of the existence of the other projects the sum of them[MASK] million dollars <unk> [MASK] so design 's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities which is not money but coordination [MASK] by doing so we were able to save four million dollars and that is why the forest is today under construction[MASK] so[MASK] be it the force of self construction [MASK] the force of common sense <unk> or the force of nature <unk> all these forces need to be translated into form <unk> [MASK] and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement[MASK] <unk> life itself [MASK] design 's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life [MASK] thank you so much[MASK]
