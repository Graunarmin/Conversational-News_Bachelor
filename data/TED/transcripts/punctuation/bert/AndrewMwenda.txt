 <unk> i am very very happy to be amidst some of the most the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're[MASK] reflecting on my glasses i am very happy and honored to be amidst[MASK] <unk> innovative and intelligent people <unk> i have listened to the three previous speakers <unk> and guess what happened [MASK] every single thing i planned to say they have said it here <unk> and it looks and sounds like i have nothing else to say [MASK] but there is a saying in my culture[MASK] that if a bud[MASK] leaves a tree without saying something that bud is a young one so i will since i am not young[MASK] <unk> am very old <unk> [MASK] i still will say something [MASK] we are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment <unk> because another conference is taking place in berlin <unk> it is the <unk> g8 summit [MASK] the <unk> g8 summit[MASK] proposes that the solution to africa 's problems should be a massive increase in aid[MASK] <unk> something akin to the marshall plan <unk> [MASK] unfortunately <unk> i personally do not believe in the marshall plan one because the benefits of the marshall plan have been overstated [MASK] its largest recipients were germany and france [MASK] and it was only two point five percent of their gdp an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune[MASK] of thirteen <unk> fifteen percent of its gdp[MASK] <unk> and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries <unk> [MASK] but i want to say that there are two things we need to connect <unk> how the media covers africa in the west and the consequences of that [MASK] by displaying despair <unk> helplessness and hopelessness <unk> [MASK] the media is telling the truth about africa <unk> and nothing but the truth[MASK] <unk> however the media is not telling us the whole truth <unk> because despair <unk> civil war <unk> hunger and famine <unk> [MASK] although they 're part and parcel of our our african reality <unk> they are not the only reality <unk> and secondly they are the smallest reality [MASK] africa has fifty three nations <unk> we have civil wars only[MASK] in six countries <unk> which means that the media are covering only six countries[MASK] africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness[MASK] that the western media largely presents to its audience but the effect of that presentation is it appeals to sympathy <unk> it appeals to pity <unk> it appeals[MASK] to something called charity [MASK] <unk> as a consequence the western view of africa 's economic dilemma[MASK] is framed wrongly the wrong framing is a product of thinking that africa[MASK] is a place of despair what should we do with it [MASK] we should give food to the hungry <unk> we should deliver medicines to those who are ill <unk> we should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war <unk> and in the process africa has been stripped of[MASK] <unk> i want to say that it is important to recognize that africa has fundamental weaknesses <unk> [MASK] but equally <unk> it has opportunities and a lot of potential <unk> [MASK] we need to reframe the challenge that is facing africa from a challenge of despair[MASK] despair which is called[MASK] poverty reduction to a challenge of hope <unk> we frame it as a challenge of hope <unk> and that is[MASK] <unk> worth creation the challenge facing all those who are interested in africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty it should be a challenge of creating[MASK] wealth <unk> once we change those two things[MASK] if you say the africans are poor and they need poverty reduction you have[MASK] the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent with what medicines for the poor[MASK] food relief for those who are hungry <unk> and[MASK] peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war <unk> and in the process <unk> [MASK] none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms not the causes of africa 's[MASK] fundamental problems [MASK] sending somebody to school and giving them medicines ladies and[MASK] <unk> does not create wealth for them [MASK] wealth is a function of income and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well paying job [MASK] now once we begin to talk about wealth creation in africa our second challenge will be who are the wealth creating agents in any society <unk> [MASK] they are entrepreneurs <unk> [ unclear ] told us they are always about four percent[MASK] of the population but sixteen percent are imitators[MASK] <unk> but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship <unk> so where should we be putting the money we need to put money[MASK] where it can productively grow support private[MASK] investment in africa <unk> both domestic and foreign support research institutions <unk> because knowledge is an important[MASK] <unk> but what is the international aid community doing with africa today [MASK] they are throwing large sums of money for primary health for primary education for food relief <unk> the entire continent has been turned into a place of despair in <unk>[MASK] <unk> need of charity ladies and gentlemen can any one of you tell me a neighbor a friend a relative that you know who became rich[MASK] <unk> by holding the begging bowl and receiving alms does any one of you in the audience have that person does any one of you know a country that developed because[MASK] of the generosity and kindness of another well[MASK] since i 'm not seeing the hand it appears that what i 'm stating is true[MASK] <unk> me tell you this [MASK] external actors can only present to you an opportunity [MASK] the ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity [MASK] africa has received many opportunities many of them we haven 't benefited much <unk> [MASK] <unk> we lack the internal institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations i 'll give you an example <unk> [MASK] under the cotonou agreement formerly known as the lome convention [MASK] african countries have been given an opportunity by europe to export goods duty free to the european union market [MASK] my own country uganda[MASK] <unk> a quota to export fifty thousand metric tons[MASK] of sugar to the european union market <unk> we haven 't exported one kilogram yet <unk> we import fifty thousand[MASK] metric tons of sugar[MASK] from brazil and[MASK] and cuba secondly <unk> under the beef protocol of that agreement african countries that produce beef have quotas[MASK] <unk> to the european union market <unk> [MASK] none of those countries <unk> including africa 's most successful nation botswana has ever met its quota so <unk> i want to argue today[MASK] that the[MASK] the fundamental source of africa 's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because[MASK] it has a poor institutional and policy[MASK] <unk> all forms of intervention need support the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth the kinds of institutions that increase productivity <unk> [MASK] how do we begin to do that and why is aid the bad instrument [MASK] aid is the bad instrument and do you know why because all governments across the world need money to survive [MASK] money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order and because many of our governments[MASK] are quite dictatorial[MASK] <unk> they need really to have the army clobber the opposition <unk> the second thing you need to do[MASK] is pay your political hangers on why should people support their government well because it gives them good paying jobs [MASK] or in many african countries <unk> unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption <unk> [MASK] the fact is no government in the world with the exception of a few like that of idi amin can seek to depend entirely[MASK] on force as an instrument of rule many countries in the [ unclear ] they need legitimacy to get legitimacy <unk> governments often need[MASK] to deliver things like primary education primary health <unk> roads <unk> build hospitals and clinics [MASK] if the government 's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people <unk> such a government is driven by[MASK] <unk> govern in a more enlightened fashion <unk> it will sit with those who create wealth talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary[MASK] for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them <unk> the problem with the african continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in africa <unk> [MASK] the productive[MASK] <unk> margin in our governments ' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy <unk> [MASK] it lies with international donors <unk> rather than sit with ugandan [MASK] rather than sit with ugandan entrepreneurs <unk> ghanaian businessmen <unk> [MASK] south african[MASK] enterprising leaders our governments find it more[MASK] <unk> productive to talk to the imf and the world bank <unk> [MASK] i can tell you even if you have ten ph ds you can never beat bill gates in understanding[MASK] the computer industry <unk> why <unk> because the knowledge[MASK] that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business it requires that you listen to the people <unk> the private sector actors in that industry [MASK] governments in africa[MASK] <unk> have therefore been given an opportunity by the international community to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens <unk> and therefore allowed[MASK] to begin endless negotiations with the imf and the world bank <unk> and then it is the imf and the world bank that tell them what its citizens need in the process we the african[MASK] <unk> implementation process in our countries <unk> we have limited input because he who pays the piper calls the tune the imf the world bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world[MASK] has taken over our rights as citizens <unk> and therefore what our governments are doing <unk> because they depend on aid is to listen[MASK] to international creditors rather than their own citizens <unk> but i want to put a caveat on my argument <unk> and that[MASK] <unk> caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive some aid may have built a hospital[MASK] fed a hungry village <unk> it may have built a road and that road may have served a very good role <unk> the mistake of the international aid industry[MASK] is to pick these isolated incidents of success generalize them[MASK] pour billions and trillions of dollars into them <unk> and then spread them across the whole world ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village <unk>[MASK] <unk> the skills <unk> the practices <unk> the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed[MASK] <unk> aid increases the resources available to governments <unk> [MASK] and that makes[MASK] working in a government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in africa seeking a career <unk> [MASK] by increasing the political attractiveness of the state especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in africa aid tends to accentuate[MASK] ethnic tensions as every[MASK] now begins struggling[MASK] to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie <unk> ladies and gentlemen <unk> [MASK] the most enterprising people in africa[MASK] cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business[MASK] <unk> governments are not changing it why because[MASK] they don 't need to talk to their own citizens <unk> they talk to international donors <unk> [MASK] so <unk> the most enterprising africans end up going to work for government <unk> and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid <unk> [MASK] i also want to say that it is important for us to note[MASK] that over the last fifty years <unk> africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community[MASK] in the form[MASK] of technical assistance and financial aid and all other forms of aid <unk> [MASK] between one thousand nine hundred and sixty and two thousand and three our continent received six hundred billion dollars of aid [MASK] and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in africa <unk> where has all the aid gone <unk> [MASK] i want to use the example of my own country called uganda[MASK] <unk> and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there [MASK] <unk> budget expected revenue two point five trillion shillings the expected foreign aid one point nine trillion uganda 's recurrent expenditure[MASK] by recurrent what do i mean <unk> hand to mouth is two point six trillion <unk> why does the government of uganda budget[MASK] <unk> spend one hundred and ten percent of its own revenue <unk> it 's because there 's somebody there called[MASK] foreign aid who contributes for it but this shows you that the government of uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue[MASK] to invest in productive investments <unk> but rather it devotes this revenue to[MASK] paying structure of public expenditure public administration which is largely patronage[MASK] <unk> takes six hundred and ninety billion <unk> [MASK] the military three hundred and eighty billion agriculture which employs eighteen percent of our poverty stricken citizens <unk> takes only eighteen billion [MASK] trade and industry[MASK] takes forty three billion <unk> and let me show you what does public expenditure[MASK] <unk> public administration expenditure in uganda constitute [MASK] there you go <unk> seventy cabinet ministers <unk> [MASK] one hundred and fourteen presidential advisers <unk> by the way who never see the president except on television [MASK] and when they see him physically <unk> [MASK] it is at public functions like this <unk> and even there it is him who advises them[MASK] we have eighty one units of local government <unk> each local government is organized like the central government a bureaucracy a cabinet a parliament <unk> and so many jobs for the political hangers on [MASK] there were fifty six and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits <unk> [MASK] he had to create twenty five new[MASK] <unk> government bodies all of which have directors and the cars and the final thing this is addressed to mr bono in his work he may help us on this[MASK] a recent government of uganda study found that there are three thousand[MASK] <unk> drive motor vehicles at the[MASK] minister of health headquarters uganda has nine hundred and sixty one sub counties [MASK] each of them with a dispensary <unk> none of which has an ambulance so the four wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers <unk> [MASK] the permanent secretaries <unk> the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects [MASK] while the poor[MASK] die without[MASK] ambulances[MASK] <unk> i want to say that before i came to speak here i was told[MASK] that the principle of tedglobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt <unk> [MASK] it should be short enough to arouse interest <unk> but long enough to cover the subject i hope i have achieved[MASK]
