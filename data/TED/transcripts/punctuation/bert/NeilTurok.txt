 an incredible surprise to me[MASK] to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life <unk> [MASK] because basically <unk> i work as a theoretical physicist <unk> i develop[MASK] and test models of the big bang[MASK] <unk> data <unk> and i 've been moonlighting for the last five years[MASK] helping with a project in africa [MASK] and i get a lot of flak for this at cambridge <unk> people wonder you know how do you have time to do this and so on[MASK] <unk> and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated[MASK] both those sides <unk> so i thought i 'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life[MASK] <unk> well i was born in south africa[MASK] and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime <unk> when they were released we left[MASK] and we went as refugees to kenya and tanzania <unk> both were very young countries then and full of hope for the future <unk> [MASK] we had an amazing childhood we didn 't have any[MASK] <unk> money <unk> but we were outdoors most of the time we had fantastic friends[MASK] and we saw the wonders of the world like kilimanjaro <unk> serengeti[MASK] and the olduvai gorge <unk> well then we moved to london for high school <unk> and[MASK] after that there 's nothing much to say about that it was rather dull <unk> but i came back to[MASK] <unk> africa at the age of seventeen as a volunteer teacher[MASK] to lesotho which is a tiny country <unk> surrounded at that time by apartheid south africa <unk> [MASK] well <unk> eighty percent of the men in lesotho worked[MASK] in the mines over the border in brutal conditions[MASK] <unk> 'm sure as a rather irritating young white man coming into their village <unk> [MASK] i was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth but the kids were the best part the[MASK] kids were amazing extremely eager[MASK] and often very bright and i 'm just going to tell you one story <unk> which got through to me <unk> i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible to[MASK] <unk> the academic stuff with the real world <unk> and they weren 't used to that <unk> but[MASK] i took them outside one day and i said i want you to estimate the height of the building [MASK] and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall size it up with a finger and make an estimate of the height but there[MASK] was one little boy very small for his age he was the son of one of the poorest families in the[MASK] in the village <unk> [MASK] and he wasn 't doing that he was scribbling with chalk on the pavement <unk> [MASK] and so [MASK] i said i was annoyed i said [MASK] what are you doing <unk> i want you to estimate the height of the building he said ok <unk> i measured the height of a brick <unk> [MASK] i counted the number of bricks and now i 'm multiplying [MASK] well[MASK] <unk> i hadn 't thought of that one [MASK] and many experiences like this happened[MASK] to me another one is that i met a miner <unk> he was home[MASK] on his three month leave from the mines sitting next to him one day[MASK] he said there 's only one thing that i really loved at school and you know what it was shakespeare and he recited some to me[MASK] these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in africa[MASK] and starved of opportunity <unk> and if africa is going to get fixed <unk> it 's by them not by us[MASK] <unk> and i went to cambridge <unk> and there i fell for theoretical physics <unk> [MASK] well <unk> i 'm not going to explain this equation but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject we can write down all the laws of physics we know[MASK] in one line[MASK] and admittedly it 's in a very shorthand notation <unk> [MASK] and it contains eighteen free parameters[MASK] ok <unk> which we have to fit to the data so it 's not the final story <unk> but it 's an incredibly powerful summary[MASK] of everything we know about nature at the most basic level and apart[MASK] <unk> from a few very important loose ends <unk> [MASK] which you 've heard about here like dark energy and dark matter this equation describes seems to describe everything about the universe[MASK] and what 's in it <unk> but there 's one big puzzle remaining <unk> and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary[MASK] school math teacher in tanzania who 's a wonderful scottish lady[MASK] who i still stay in touch with <unk> [MASK] and she 's now in her 80s and when i try to explain my work to her [MASK] she waved away all the details and she said neil there 's only one question that really matters[MASK] <unk> 's a question we 've all been avoiding the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence full of a strange kind of <unk>[MASK] <unk> energy[MASK] but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely[MASK] <unk> i worked on that theory for a while with stephen hawking and others but then i began to explore another alternative <unk> the alternative is that the big bang wasn 't the beginning <unk> [MASK] perhaps the universe existed before the bang <unk> [MASK] and the bang was just a violent event in a pre existing universe <unk> well this possibility is actually suggested[MASK] by the[MASK] <unk> the unified theories <unk> which try to explain all those eighteen free parameters[MASK] in in a single framework which will hopefully predict all of them [MASK] and i 'll just share a cartoon of this idea here it 's all i can convey <unk> [MASK] according to these theories there are extra dimensions of space not just the three we 're familiar with but at every point in the room there are more dimensions and in particular there 's one rather strange one in the most elegant unified theories we have[MASK] the strange one looks likes this that we live[MASK] in a three dimensional world we live in one of these worlds <unk> and i can only show it as a sheet but it 's really[MASK] and a tiny distance away there 's another sheet [MASK] also three dimensional and they 're separated by a gap the gap is very tiny and i 've blown it up so you can see it <unk> but it 's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic[MASK] <unk> nucleus i won 't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this but it comes out of the math[MASK] and trying to explain the physics that we know <unk> [MASK] well i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question which is what happens if these two three dimensional worlds should actually collide <unk> [MASK] and if they collide <unk> it would look a lot like the big bang <unk> but it 's slightly different than in the conventional picture[MASK] <unk> conventional picture of the big bang is a point everything comes out of a point you have infinite density [MASK] and all the equations break down <unk> no hope of describing that [MASK] in this picture you 'll notice the bang is extended it 's not a point <unk> the density of matter is finite <unk> and we have a chance of a consistent[MASK] set of equations that can describe the whole process so to cut a long story short <unk> we 've explored this[MASK] <unk> alternative we 've shown that it can fit all of the data[MASK] that we have about the formation of galaxies <unk> the fluctuations in the microwave background [MASK] furthermore there 's an experimental way to to tell this theory apart from the the inflationary explanation that i told you before it involves gravitational waves <unk> [MASK] and in this scenario not only was the big bang not the beginning[MASK] as you can see from the picture it can happen over and over again it may be that we live in an endless universe <unk> both in space and in time and there 've been[MASK] bangs in the past and there will be bangs in the future <unk> and[MASK] maybe we live in an endless universe <unk> well making and testing models of the universe[MASK] is for me the best way i[MASK] <unk> have of enjoying and appreciating[MASK] the universe [MASK] we need to make the best mathematical models we can the most consistent ones <unk> and then we scrutinize them logically and with data <unk> and we try to convince ourselves[MASK] we really try to convince ourselves they 're wrong that 's progress when we[MASK] <unk> hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world <unk> as i pursued my career something[MASK] was always gnawing away inside me what about africa <unk> what about those kids i 'd left behind[MASK] instead of developing as we 'd all hoped in the ' 60s things had gotten worse africa was gripped by poverty disease and war [MASK] this is very[MASK] <unk> graphically shown by the worldmapper website and project <unk> and so the idea is to represent each country[MASK] on a map but scale the area according to some quantity <unk> [MASK] so here 's just the standard area map of the world by the way africa is very large and the next map now shows africa[MASK] <unk> around the time of independence for many african states now this is <unk>[MASK] and then two thousand and two and here 's a projection for two thousand and fifteen [MASK] big changes are happening in the world <unk> [MASK] but they 're not helping africa <unk> what about africa 's population the population isn 't out of proportion to its area but africa leads the world[MASK] in deaths[MASK] from often preventable causes <unk> malnutrition simple infections[MASK] and birth complications then there 's hiv aids <unk> and then there are deaths from war ok[MASK] currently there are forty five thousand people a month dying in the congo as a consequence of the war there[MASK] over coltan and diamonds and other things[MASK] <unk> it 's still going on [MASK] what about africa 's capacity to do something about these problems [MASK] well here 's the number of physicians in africa <unk> [MASK] here 's the number of people in higher education <unk> and here most shocking to me[MASK] the number of scientific[MASK] <unk> research papers coming out of africa it just doesn 't exist[MASK] scientifically <unk> [MASK] and this was very eloquently argued at ted africa <unk> [MASK] that all of the aid that 's been given has completely failed to put africa onto its own two feet well[MASK] the transition to democracy in south africa in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four was literally a dream come true for many of us <unk> [MASK] my parents were both elected[MASK] <unk> to the first parliament <unk> alongside nelson and winnie mandela they were the only other couple [MASK] and in two thousand and one i took a research leave to visit them [MASK] and while i was busy working i was working on these colliding worlds in the day[MASK] <unk> but i learned that there was a desperate shortage of[MASK] <unk> the ability to make and test models[MASK] has become essential not only to every single area of science today <unk> but also to modern society itself <unk> and if[MASK] you don 't have math you 're not going to enter the modern age <unk> so i[MASK] <unk> and the idea was very simple the idea was to set up an african institute for mathematical sciences <unk> or aims [MASK] and let 's recruit students from the whole of africa <unk> bring them together with lecturers from all over the world[MASK] and we 'll try to give them a fantastic education [MASK] well as a cambridge professor i had many contacts and to my astonishment they backed me one hundred percent they said go and do[MASK] <unk> it and we 'll come and lecture and i knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant[MASK] students from these countries[MASK] where they don 't have any opportunities together with the best lecturers in the world who i knew would come because of the interest in africa[MASK] and put them together and just let the sparks fly <unk> [MASK] so we bought a[MASK] <unk> derelict hotel near cape town <unk> it 's an 80 room art deco hotel from the <unk>[MASK] the area was kind of seedy <unk> so we got an 80 room hotel[MASK] for one hundred thousand dollars <unk> it 's a beautiful building <unk> [MASK] we decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word we 're going to start the best math institute in africa[MASK] in this hotel well the new south africa is a very[MASK] <unk> exciting country <unk> and those of you who haven 't been there you should go <unk> it 's very very interesting what 's happening <unk> [MASK] and we recruited wonderful staff <unk> highly motivated staff [MASK] the other thing that 's happened which was good for us is the internet even though the internet is very expensive all over africa <unk> there are internet cafes[MASK] <unk> and bright young africans are desperate to join the global community to be successful[MASK] and they 're very ambitious they want to be the next einstein <unk> [MASK] and so when word came out that aims was opening it spread very quickly via <unk>[MASK] <unk> e mail and our website and we got lots of applicants <unk> [MASK] well <unk> we designed[MASK] <unk> learning environment and it was fantastic to start a university from[MASK] the beginning <unk> you have to rethink what is the university for [MASK] and that 's really exciting <unk> so we designed it to have interactive teaching <unk> no droning on at the chalkboard[MASK] we emphasize <unk>[MASK] working in groups every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades[MASK] <unk> lives together in this hotel lecturers and students and it 's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at one a m the[MASK] students don 't usually leave the computer lab till two or three a m and then they 're up again at eight in the morning[MASK] lectures problem solving and so on it 's an extraordinary place <unk>[MASK] <unk> we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa 's development <unk> [MASK] because in those areas scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage they 'll publish be invited to conferences they 'll do well <unk> they 'll have successful careers [MASK] and[MASK] aims has done extremely well <unk> here is a list of last year 's graduates graduated in june and what they 're currently doing[MASK] where they are is indicated over here and[MASK] where they 've gone so these are all postgraduate students and they 've all gone on to master 's and ph d degrees in excellent places [MASK] five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one[MASK] in the u s or europe[MASK] <unk> is a continual source[MASK] of strength <unk> pride and commitment to africa [MASK] we illustrate aims ' progress by coloring in the countries of africa <unk> [MASK] so here you can see behind this list <unk> [MASK] when a county is colored yellow <unk> we 've received an application <unk> orange <unk> we 've accepted an application and green a[MASK] student has graduated <unk> so here is where we were after the first graduation in two thousand and four <unk> [MASK] and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green[MASK] <unk> so there 's two thousand and five minus six minus seven minus eight [MASK] we 're well on[MASK] <unk> we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to aims and i 'll just show you one[MASK] <unk> so tendai[MASK] came to aims and[MASK] did very well and i 'll let her take it from there tm [MASK] my name is tendai mugwagwa and i was a student at aims[MASK] <unk> in two thousand and three and two thousand and four <unk> after leaving aims i went on to do a master 's in applied mathematics at the university of cape town in south africa <unk> [MASK] after that i came to the netherlands where i 'm now doing a ph d in theoretical immunology professor tendai[MASK] is working very independently [MASK] she communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital <unk> so all in all i have a very good ph d student from south africa <unk> so i 'm happy she 's[MASK] in the first year of aims was shehu <unk> and he 's shown here with his favorite[MASK] high school teacher <unk> and then entering university in northern nigeria <unk> and[MASK] after aims <unk> shehu wanted to do high energy physics <unk> and he came to cambridge[MASK] <unk> here are the current students at aims there are fifty three of them from twenty different countries including twenty women <unk> so now i 'm going to get to my[MASK] business well we had a party this is africa <unk> we have good parties in africa and last month they threw a surprise party for me here 's somebody you 've seen already[MASK] <unk> point out a few other exceptional people in this picture so we were having a party as you can see they 're completely eclipsing me at this point this is ezra she 's from darfur [MASK] she 's a physicist <unk> and somehow stays smiling in[MASK] <unk> spite of everything going on back home but she wants to continue in physics <unk> and she 's doing extremely well <unk> [MASK] this is lydia lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the central african republic <unk> and she 's now at aims[MASK] <unk> our wish <unk> as you 've already gathered <unk> and our wish has two parts one is a dream and the other 's a plan[MASK] ok our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african[MASK] <unk> of creative genius <unk> we want to give thousands of people the motivation <unk> the encouragement and the courage[MASK] to obtain the high level skills they need to help africa <unk> [MASK] among them will be not only brilliant scientists i 'm sure of that from what we 've seen at aims they 'll also be the[MASK] <unk> african gates <unk> brins[MASK] and pages of the future well[MASK] i said we also have a plan and our plan is quite simple aims is now a proven model [MASK] and what we need to do is to replicate it [MASK] we want to roll out fifteen aims centers in the next five years all over africa <unk> each will have a[MASK] <unk> in a different area of science we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural cultural barriers as it does at aims and we want to add elements to the curriculum we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills[MASK] the expanded aims will be a coherent pan african institution <unk> and its graduates will form a powerful network working together for peace and progress across the continent[MASK] over the last[MASK] year we 've been visiting sites in africa <unk> looking at potential sites for new aims centers and here are the ones we 've selected [MASK] and each of these centers has a strong local team [MASK] each is in a beautiful place an interesting place <unk> which international lecturers will be happy to[MASK] <unk> our partners across africa are extremely enthusiastic about this <unk> everyone wants an aims center in their country <unk> and last[MASK] november <unk> the conference of all the african ministers of science and technology <unk> held in mombasa <unk> [MASK] called for a comprehensive plan to roll out aims <unk> so we have political support right across the continent <unk> it won 't be easy [MASK] at every site there will be huge challenges local scientists[MASK] <unk> must play leading roles[MASK] and governments must be persuaded to buy in [MASK] conditions are very difficult but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made aims work[MASK]
