 <unk> my favorite topic is[MASK] shortcuts <unk> the master of shortcuts it 's of course <unk> nature <unk> but i will demonstrate different ways[MASK] <unk> difficulties and go to the point to find an answer probably much quicker than arthur did <unk> so <unk> first[MASK] we violate the common sense <unk> the logic all of you if you hold your hand like this <unk> ninety degrees[MASK] all of you <unk> not you <unk> all of you <unk> right <unk> palm[MASK] <unk> if you do this the common <unk> the logic says you must turn the wrist do you agree <unk> [MASK] good <unk> but i will first teach you[MASK] a method how you can do it without moving the wrist <unk> and then the shortcut <unk> you can do it immediately <unk> right <unk> [MASK] hold the hand like this palm up don 't move the wrist the wrist is i doesn 't speak very many but i do the best what i are[MASK] <unk> right molded you say with iron that was a joke actually <unk> and i[MASK] ok <unk> [MASK] hold the hand palm up do this <unk> don 't move the wrist <unk> over the heart <unk> don 't move the wrist <unk> forward don 't move the wrist [MASK] up <unk> don 't move the wrist <unk> over the heart[MASK] <unk> you have got to this position from this without moving the wrist now the shortcut [MASK] but it was six six moves <unk> now with one move <unk> i start here <unk> palm down you can[MASK] <unk> that was the warming up[MASK] now i need an assistant i talked to a nice[MASK] <unk> and you can sit over there one item here was water <unk> right <unk> and i will give my tribute[MASK] to water i think it 's enough with water for me the other guys can talk about[MASK] <unk> i will demonstrate different ways of memorizing control cards and so on and[MASK] <unk> don 't gamble but so if we are[MASK] if we have[MASK] <unk> now i will interact so a different person[MASK] all the time so not the same person can answer so we have an agreement <unk> [MASK] which one shall have a good poker hand which number one two three four or five lennart green three good <unk> and[MASK] here <unk> i had a mat here to make it a little the critical moment is[MASK] if a card shark gathers the cards together immediately when he[MASK] before he deals the card now <unk> [MASK] so i think number three i have arranged them in a full house [MASK] with queens and it[MASK] <unk> i start with three queens <unk> [MASK] so here you see the contrast when i treat the cards [MASK] and two tens [MASK] <unk> also the other hand is good if all the other guys have good hands too so these guys have actually a stronger hand three aces and two kings [MASK] this guy beats them with four of a kind or deuce deuce[MASK] <unk> i will have the winning hand ten jack queen[MASK] <unk> hand that looks so good from the beginning number three <unk> at the end was actually the lowest hand such life <unk> right <unk> [MASK] so please[MASK] mix them <unk> now <unk> if you are interested i will demonstrate some underground techniques [MASK] <unk> the first term is estimation here i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush of course[MASK] <unk> count the cards but this is much quicker right you agree <unk> so here i have actually <unk>[MASK] i know exactly where the cards are so here i can make a bet <unk> and this is actually one of the points where i get my money <unk> so here[MASK] <unk> a term[MASK] i do it quick <unk> i call this stealing <unk> [MASK] so here <unk> i think i know about where the cards are i will spread the cards and you 'll say stop when i point to them right[MASK] ok <unk> [MASK] now <unk> another term called shuffle tracking [MASK] shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards <unk> [MASK] even if another person person shuffles <unk> this is a little risky so because if you look now i can still see[MASK] <unk> agree <unk> but if you square square <unk> and shuffle [MASK] and then a cut so here <unk> to follow my cards i must look at the shuffle from the[MASK] <unk> to calculate but actually i don 't like to calculate <unk> i work direct with the right brain <unk> if you pass the left brain you have to take care of logic and common sense [MASK] direct in the right brain that 's much better and so [MASK] arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing and[MASK] <unk> if you work with in the right atmosphere with humor <unk> you have that 's the password to the[MASK] cosmic bank of knowledge where you can find any solution of[MASK] any problem <unk> ok <unk> now i drop the cards and you say stop anyway right <unk> not at the last card zoe stop lg [MASK] yeah <unk> when i 'm sober i do this much quicker <unk> but we will check[MASK] <unk> not in order it that was a mistake no i 'm kidding [MASK] no <unk> now and then i put in a mistake just to emphasize how difficult it is right [MASK] yeah last night i forgot that that was a mistake but now i 'm glad i remember it so[MASK] <unk> this deck is bought here sorry i have a little pad to make it a little softer [MASK] this deck is bought here in america it 's called [MASK] bicycle and this deck is very flexible but not so many people know <unk> [MASK] <unk> at the right spots you see how thin and flexible this deck is right <unk> now you can carry this in your wallet so[MASK] <unk> when we will have it back you do this <unk> but not too much <unk> then you[MASK] have to push it down again here please if you push these[MASK] heaps everyone see push them together so they are really interlaced[MASK] and then i will demonstrate a thing from[MASK] russian satellite stealen stolen [MASK] probably copied from america but we will see [MASK] here[MASK] shortcuts <unk> i talk about shortcuts[MASK] <unk> i go very quick[MASK] through the deck and try to find some pattern <unk> [MASK] the new chaos theory is already old right <unk> but you know i think you are familiar with[MASK] fractals the mandelbrot spirals and all these things <unk> and[MASK] it 's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern[MASK] <unk> and not concentrate if you concentrate and calculate then you go to[MASK] then it 's the left brain but if you just look and talk in another language <unk> [MASK] yeah great i think i have it <unk> so now different persons[MASK] <unk> all the time when i lift the heap i peek[MASK] <unk> seven of diamonds perfect my favorite yeah seven so i will do it quick <unk> very quick <unk> but in slow motion so you can follow[MASK] <unk> i think i do it the same way <unk> i like to[MASK] so i know where it is <unk> ten of diamonds <unk> but now i do it the regular speed right[MASK] <unk> person even if it 's the same spot we can take some over there later <unk> so now i will drop the cards [MASK] and you 'll say stop <unk> anywhere got it five of clubs <unk> [MASK] not the last yes that 's difficult to find a card here we do it[MASK] again the person who said five of clubs say stop <unk> when the cards are in the[MASK] <unk> use a little force there <unk> i think we save five of clubs <unk> and now a card with a contrast of five of clubs[MASK] <unk> i will do the most difficult thing [MASK] for example you are sitting in las vegas <unk> and you 're betting <unk> and you let the other guys peek this card[MASK] by mistake <unk> feel it 's just the regular one card <unk> and now when i lift this card <unk> it shall[MASK] <unk> queen of hearts <unk> so that 's a tough challenge right <unk> [MASK] so here i grab[MASK] you know this five of clubs <unk> and queen of hearts <unk> yes this is a tough[MASK] one because here i must take[MASK] <unk> switch it with the five of clubs <unk> so now a false count which card shall i use queen or five[MASK] <unk> time eight nine <unk> ten <unk> this is a kind of optical deal right <unk> [MASK] when i put one card at a table look it 's not one card it 's look it 's a bunch of cards that gives this[MASK] impression <unk> yeah <unk> [MASK] now some hard stuff[MASK] <unk> i think we keep the queen here <unk> yes <unk> [MASK] now to the satellites things <unk> [MASK] this oh sorry <unk> don 't look at the beam my fault[MASK] <unk> now <unk> when i deal the cards in the laser [MASK] i know where they are but yes <unk> did the camera got it[MASK] <unk> do the cameras see the cards now[MASK] <unk> back the other one take back the queen[MASK] <unk> i have to peek lots of cards <unk> i think there are lots of[MASK] i don 't know how many but ten fifteen spades in a deck at least right laughter[MASK] so every time i lift the heap i peek right <unk> then i arrange them so i can[MASK] get them quick[MASK] <unk> so i start with the ace[MASK] yeah ace ah yeah spades same mistake as before right <unk> so[MASK] i arrange the spades the clubs[MASK] <unk> i try to do this right here first i take the spades <unk> you see i don 't work with prestige so always do mistakes [MASK] it doesn 't matter to me <unk> and now[MASK] <unk> and then i get some extra sympathy points[MASK] <unk> and we switch this to the king <unk> ace of diamonds <unk> and now look ace of diamonds will guide <unk> [MASK] so i find [MASK] <unk> there was the place <unk> and here is king of spades <unk> correct yeah ok [MASK] now a little more difficult thing maybe you think i have the cards in order already so you help me to shuffle again <unk> another suit please[MASK] <unk> like this guy yeah <unk> [MASK] ok <unk> that should be my end effect but ok <unk> armani who said armani [MASK] you <unk> i drop the cards and you which size <unk> [MASK] which size it 's a piece of cake i like challenges <unk> which size[MASK] <unk> this is tough [MASK] ok <unk> a suit <unk> i had[MASK] <unk> to locate diamonds i look at the cards and ok we try <unk> yeah <unk> you help me <unk> if i drop the card face up [MASK] like this you reverse it[MASK] <unk> i work with pattern[MASK] <unk> why do i put myself in this position [MASK] i have to figure out so many outs when i miss some cards but i love it <unk> so now i will do it <unk> i will try to[MASK] <unk> find[MASK] find the diamonds <unk> but i will do it the hard way <unk> it 's too easy to do it right away right <unk> [MASK] i think i will do it <unk> [MASK] blindfolded [MASK] at this distance it works immediately[MASK] <unk> i like the empathy empathy <unk> but it was[MASK] <unk> you can take the nostril too because some guys think[MASK] <unk> with dignity and elegance right <unk> [MASK] but i like her yeah i said be a little[MASK] <unk> rely on other senses right [MASK] i work with vibration[MASK] <unk> start with ace of diamonds <unk> just kidding warming up king of hearts [MASK] laughter and i give you a diamonds <unk> so they so you put them here in a nice row right <unk> and you can see[MASK] <unk> i never ever miss two <unk> this is interesting always i 've found two <unk> but the wrong color spades sorry[MASK] <unk> and the deck is a gift to you after so let the skepticals here in this <unk> examine them <unk> right <unk> remind me it 's a gift[MASK] two and it was two of[MASK] <unk> two of diamonds <unk> i 'll do it quick now three three of diamonds[MASK] <unk> this is maybe a little tough we will try[MASK] <unk> you see that in the screen and this is face up <unk> and it 's not at the bottom here so next card will be was it five[MASK] <unk> i do this <unk> i know where it is because i peeked before and then[MASK] <unk> i love this jonny wayne move[MASK]
