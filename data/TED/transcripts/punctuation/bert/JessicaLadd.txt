 <unk> is excited to be going to college [MASK] she couldn 't wait to get out of her parents ' house to prove to them that she 's an adult and to prove to her new friends that she belongs [MASK] <unk> she heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on <unk> let 's call him mike [MASK] the next day hannah wakes up with a pounding headache [MASK] she can only remember the night in flashes but what she does remember is throwing up in the hall[MASK] outside mike 's room[MASK] and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her wanting it to stop then shakily stumbling home[MASK] <unk> doesn 't feel good about what happened <unk> but she thinks maybe this is just what sex in college is [MASK] one in five women and one in thirteen men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the united states <unk> [MASK] less than ten percent will ever report their assault to their[MASK] <unk> or to the police and those who do on average wait eleven months to make the report [MASK] hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own but when she sees mike taking girls home from parties she 's worried about them <unk> [MASK] after graduation hannah learns that she was one of five women[MASK] who mike did the exact same thing to[MASK] <unk> and this is not an unlikely scenario[MASK] because ninety percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders [MASK] but with such low reporting rates it 's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported much less anything happen if they are [MASK] in fact only six percent[MASK] of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison[MASK] <unk> percent chance that they 'll get away with it this means there 's practically no deterrent to assault in the united states <unk> [MASK] now i 'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training i 'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good [MASK] so this to me is a tragic but a solvable problem[MASK] <unk> so when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago <unk> it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change <unk> and so we did [MASK] we started by talking to college survivors and what they wish they 'd had in college is pretty simple [MASK] they wanted a website one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them[MASK] with clearly written information about their reporting options[MASK] with the ability to electronically report their assault rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them [MASK] with the option to create a secure timestamped document of what happened to them <unk> preserving evidence even if they don 't want to report yet <unk> [MASK] and lastly <unk> and perhaps most critically[MASK] <unk> with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant [MASK] you see knowing that you weren 't the only one changes everything it changes the way you frame your own experience [MASK] it changes the way you think about your perpetrator it means that if you do come forward you 'll have someone else 's back and they 'll have yours [MASK] we created a website that actually does this and we launched it [ [MASK] <unk> on two college campuses <unk> and we included a unique matching system[MASK] where if mike 's first victim[MASK] had come forward <unk> saved her record entered into the matching system and named mike <unk> and mike 's second victim had done the same thing a few months later [MASK] they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time[MASK] <unk> for investigation and follow up [MASK] if a system like this had existed for hannah and her peers <unk> it 's more likely that they would have reported that they would have been believed <unk> [MASK] and that mike would have been kicked off campus gone to jail or at least gotten the help that he needed [MASK] and if we were able to stop repeat offenders like mike after just their second assault[MASK] following a match survivors like hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place we[MASK] percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on [MASK] and because we 're creating a real deterrent to assault for perhaps the first time [MASK] maybe the mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone [MASK] the type of system i 'm describing[MASK] <unk> the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow <unk> [MASK] meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre agreed upon conditions are met such as a match [MASK] the application that we built is for college campuses <unk> but the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace [MASK] we don 't have to live in a world where[MASK] <unk> rapists get away with it [MASK] we can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable [MASK] where survivors get the support and justice they deserve where the authorities get the information they need [MASK] and where there 's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being[MASK]
