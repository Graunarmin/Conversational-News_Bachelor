 <unk> on my way here <unk> the passenger next to me and i had a very interesting conversation[MASK] during my flight <unk> he told me it seems like the united states has run out of[MASK] <unk> because they 're just making some up cat psychologist <unk> dog whisperer <unk> tornado chaser [MASK] a couple of seconds later he asked me so what do you do[MASK] <unk> participation in peace processes and conflict resolution <unk> and because of my work i recognize[MASK] that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion [MASK] now this matter is vitally important to me as a young muslim woman i am very proud of my faith[MASK] <unk> gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day <unk> it 's the reason i can be here in front of you <unk> [MASK] but i can 't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion [MASK] not just my own but all of the world 's major faiths <unk> the misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture[MASK] has influenced our social and cultural norms[MASK] our laws our daily lives to a point where we sometimes don 't recognize it [MASK] my parents moved from libya north africa to canada in the early <unk>[MASK] and i am the middle child of eleven children yes eleven <unk> but growing up i saw my parents[MASK] <unk> spiritual people pray and praise god for their blessings <unk> namely me of course <unk> but among others [MASK] they were kind and funny[MASK] and patient limitlessly patient <unk> the kind of patience that having eleven kids forces you to have [MASK] and they were fair i was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens i[MASK] <unk> was treated the same the same was expected of me <unk> i was never taught that god judged differently based on gender [MASK] and my parents ' understanding of god as a merciful and beneficial friend and provider[MASK] shaped the way i looked at the world [MASK] <unk> of course my upbringing had additional benefits being one of eleven children is diplomacy one hundred and one [MASK] to this day i am asked where i went to school like did you go to kennedy school of government and i look at them and i 'm like no i went to the murabit school of international affairs it 's[MASK] extremely exclusive you would have to talk to my mom to get in lucky for you she 's here[MASK] <unk> being one of eleven children and having ten siblings teaches you a lot about power structures and alliances <unk> [MASK] it teaches you focus you have to talk fast or say less because you will always get cut off <unk> [MASK] it teaches you the importance of messaging you have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want <unk> [MASK] <unk> you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace but the most important lesson i learned growing up[MASK] was the importance of being at the table <unk> [MASK] when my mom 's favorite lamp broke <unk> i had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who because i had to defend myself [MASK] because if you 're not then the finger is pointed at you and before you know it you will be grounded <unk> i am not speaking from experience of course[MASK] when i was fifteen in two thousand and five <unk> i completed high school and i moved[MASK] from canada saskatoon[MASK] to zawiya my parents ' hometown in libya a very traditional city <unk> [MASK] mind you i had only ever been to libya before on vacation <unk> [MASK] <unk> was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives <unk> [MASK] turns out it 's not the same as a <unk> 15 year old young lady <unk> [MASK] i very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect[MASK] of religion the words haram meaning religiously prohibited[MASK] <unk> meaning culturally inappropriate[MASK] were exchanged carelessly [MASK] as if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences <unk> [MASK] and i found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates and colleagues professors friends even relatives <unk> [MASK] beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations <unk> [MASK] and even[MASK] <unk> the foundation my parents had provided for me i found myself questioning the role of women in my faith <unk> [MASK] so at the murabit school of international affairs we go very heavy on the debate <unk> [MASK] and rule number one is do your research <unk> so that 's what i did <unk> and it surprised me how easy it was[MASK] to find women in my[MASK] <unk> the islamic movement in its infancy we wouldn 't be here if it weren 't for her <unk> [MASK] so why weren 't we learning about her why weren 't we learning about these women why were women being relegated to positions[MASK] which predated the teachings of our faith <unk> and why if we are equal in the eyes of god are we not equal in the eyes of men [MASK] to me it all came back to the lessons i had learned[MASK] as a child [MASK] the decision maker <unk> the person who gets to control the message is sitting at the table <unk> [MASK] and unfortunately in every single[MASK] <unk> are not women [MASK] religious institutions are dominated by men and driven by male leadership and they create policies in their likeness <unk> [MASK] and until we can change the system entirely <unk> [MASK] then we can 't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women [MASK] our foundation is broken[MASK] <unk> my mom actually says you can 't build a straight house on a crooked foundation [MASK] in two thousand and eleven the libyan revolution broke out and my family was on the front lines <unk> [MASK] and there 's this amazing thing that happens in war a cultural shift almost very temporary <unk> [MASK] and it was the first time that i felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved but it was encouraged it was demanded[MASK] myself and other women had a seat at the table <unk> we weren 't holding hands or[MASK] a medium <unk> we were part of decision making we were information sharing we were crucial <unk> [MASK] and i wanted and needed for that change to be permanent <unk> [MASK] turns out that 's not that easy it only took a few weeks before the women that i had[MASK] <unk> previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles and most of them were driven by words of encouragement[MASK] from religious and political leaders most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense [MASK] it 's how they gained popular support for their opinions [MASK] so initially i focused on the economic and political empowerment of women i thought that[MASK] <unk> lead to cultural and social change it turns out it does a little <unk> but not a lot [MASK] i decided to use their defense as my offense <unk> and i began to cite and highlight islamic scripture as well [MASK] in two thousand and twelve and two thousand and thirteen my organization[MASK] <unk> the single largest and most widespread campaign in libya <unk> [MASK] we entered homes and schools and universities even mosques [MASK] we spoke to fifty thousand people directly <unk> and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials radio commercials and posters <unk> [MASK] and you 're probably wondering how a women 's rights organization was able to do this in communities which had previously opposed our sheer existence <unk> [MASK] i used scripture i used[MASK] <unk> verses from the quran and sayings of the prophet hadiths his sayings which[MASK] are for example the best of you is the best to their family do not let your brother oppress another [MASK] for the first time friday sermons led by local community imams promoted the rights of women they discussed taboo issues like[MASK] <unk> violence policies were changed [MASK] in certain communities we actually had to go as far[MASK] as saying the international human rights declaration which you opposed because it wasn 't written by religious scholars <unk> [MASK] well <unk> those same principles are are in our book <unk> [MASK] so really the united nations just copied us[MASK] by changing the message <unk> we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in libya <unk> [MASK] it 's something that has now been replicated internationally <unk> [MASK] and while i am not saying it 's easy believe me <unk> it 's not liberals[MASK] will say you 're using religion and call you a bad conservative conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things <unk> [MASK] i 've heard everything from your parents must be extremely ashamed of you false they 're my biggest fans[MASK] to you will not make it to your next birthday again wrong <unk> because i did <unk> and i remain[MASK] a very strong believer that women 's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive <unk> [MASK] but we have[MASK] <unk> be at the table <unk> [MASK] we have to stop giving up our position because by remaining silent we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide [MASK] by saying that we 're going to fight for women 's rights and fight extremism with bombs and warfare <unk> we completely[MASK] <unk> cripple local societies which need to address these issues so that they 're sustainable <unk> [MASK] it is not easy <unk> challenging distorted religious messaging [MASK] you will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats <unk> [MASK] but we have to do it we have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights the principles of our faith <unk> [MASK] not for us[MASK] <unk> for the women in your families not for the women in this room not even for the women out there <unk> but for societies that would be transformed[MASK] with the participation of women [MASK] and the only way we can do that our only option is to be and remain at the table <unk> thank you[MASK]
