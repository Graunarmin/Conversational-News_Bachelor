 <unk> across europe and central asia <unk> approximately one million children live in large residential institutions usually known as orphanages [MASK] most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children <unk> others know more about the living conditions[MASK] <unk> there but still think they 're a necessary evil after all <unk> where else would we put all of those children who don 't have any parents <unk> [MASK] but sixty years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development [MASK] and this is particularly true for young babies [MASK] as we know babies are born[MASK] without their full muscle development [MASK] and that includes the brain <unk> [MASK] during the first three years of life the brain grows to its full size with most of that growth taking place in the first six months <unk> [MASK] the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation [MASK] every time a young baby learns something new[MASK] <unk> to focus its eyes to mimic a movement or a facial expression to pick something up [MASK] to form a word or to sit up new synaptic connections are being built in the brain [MASK] new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning <unk> they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness <unk> [MASK] they communicate their delight to their children who respond with smiles[MASK] <unk> desire to achieve more and to learn more [MASK] this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical <unk> social <unk> language <unk> cognitive and psychomotor development <unk> [MASK] it is the model for all future relationships with friends with partners and with their own children <unk> [MASK] it happens so naturally in most families that we don 't even notice it most of us are unaware of its importance to human[MASK] <unk> and by extension to the development of a healthy society <unk> and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children [MASK] in august one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale[MASK] the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting those of us who remember the newspaper reports[MASK] <unk> that came out of romania after the one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine revolution[MASK] will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions i was asked to help the director of a large institution to[MASK] help prevent the separation of children from their families housing five hundred and fifty babies this was ceausescu 's show orphanage and so i 'd been told the conditions were[MASK] <unk> having worked with lots of young children i expected the institution to be a riot of noise <unk> but it was as silent as a convent [MASK] it was hard to believe there were any children there at all <unk> [MASK] yet the director showed me into room after room each containing row upon row of cots [MASK] in each of which lay a child staring into space [MASK] in a room of forty newborns[MASK] <unk> not one of them was crying <unk> yet i could see soiled nappies and i could see that some of the children were distressed but the only noise was a low continuous moan <unk> [MASK] the head nurse told me proudly you see our children are very well behaved [MASK] over the next few days <unk> i began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional <unk> [MASK] the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours but their demands were not met and so eventually they learned not to bother <unk> within a few days they were listless[MASK] and staring into space like all the others <unk> [MASK] over the years many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children [MASK] but often one member of staff is caring for ten twenty and even forty children <unk> hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program[MASK] <unk> the children must be woken at seven and fed at seven thirty at eight their nappies must be changed so a staff member may have only thirty minutes to feed ten or twenty children <unk> [MASK] if a child soils its nappy at eight thirty <unk> he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again [MASK] the child 's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing <unk> [MASK] and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling <unk> the walls[MASK] or the bars of their cots[MASK] <unk> since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution i 've seen hundreds of such places across eighteen countries from the czech republic to sudan [MASK] across all of these diverse lands and cultures the institutions and the child 's journey through them is depressingly similar <unk> [MASK] lack of stimulation often leads[MASK] <unk> rocking back and forth or aggression [MASK] and in some institutions psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children <unk> whilst in others children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others [MASK] these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities most of these children will never leave the institution again[MASK] <unk> for those without disabilities at age three they 're transferred to another institution and at age seven to yet another [MASK] segregated according to age and gender <unk> they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings often without even a chance to say goodbye [MASK] there 's rarely enough to eat <unk> they are often hungry <unk> the older children bully the little ones <unk> they learn to survive they learn to defend themselves or they go[MASK] <unk> when they leave the institution <unk> they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society [MASK] in moldova <unk> young women raised in institutions are ten times more likely to be trafficked than their peers <unk> [MASK] and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions young adults twenty percent of them[MASK] had a criminal record fourteen percent were involved in prostitution and ten percent had taken their own lives[MASK] but why are there so many orphans in europe[MASK] when there hasn 't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years [MASK] in fact more than ninety five percent of these children have living parents [MASK] and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children but research shows that most parents want their children <unk> and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty disability and[MASK] <unk> ethnicity [MASK] many countries have not developed inclusive schools <unk> [MASK] and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school at age six or seven [MASK] the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home if the family 's poor they find it difficult to visit and gradually the[MASK] <unk> relationship breaks down [MASK] behind each of the million children in institutions [MASK] there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options [MASK] like natalia in moldova <unk> who only had enough money to feed her baby <unk> and so had to send her older son to the institution [MASK] or desi in bulgaria who looked after her four children at home until her[MASK] <unk> but then she had to go out to work full time and with no support felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution [MASK] or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they 're pregnant who leave their babies in a hospital[MASK] <unk> or the new parents the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability [MASK] and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child 's potential are told by the doctors[MASK] <unk> her leave her in the institution go home and make a healthy one [MASK] this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable [MASK] every child has the right to a family deserves and needs a family [MASK] and children are amazingly resilient [MASK] we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on they recover their developmental delays and go on to lead normal happy lives[MASK] it 's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions [MASK] one study suggests that a family support service costs ten percent of an institutional placement <unk> whilst good quality foster care[MASK] costs usually about thirty percent [MASK] if we spend less on these children but on the right services we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality[MASK] residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs [MASK] across europe a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care[MASK] to community based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential <unk> [MASK] when i first started to work in romania nearly twenty years ago there were two[MASK] <unk> hundred thousand children living in institutions and more entering every day <unk> [MASK] now there are less than ten thousand and family support services are provided across the country [MASK] in moldova <unk> despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than fifty percent in the last five years <unk> [MASK] and the resources are being redistributed to[MASK] <unk> support services and inclusive schools <unk> [MASK] many countries have developed national action plans for change <unk> the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards <unk>[MASK] <unk> family support empowering communities to look after their own children [MASK] <unk> level of society people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children <unk> and the better alternatives that exist [MASK] if we know people who are planning to support orphanages we should convince them to support family services instead [MASK] together <unk> this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime <unk> thank you[MASK]
