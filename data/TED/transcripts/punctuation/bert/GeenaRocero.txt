 <unk> the world makes you something that you 're not [MASK] but you know inside what you are <unk> and that question burns in your heart how will you become[MASK] <unk> i may be somewhat unique in this <unk> but i am not alone not alone at all [MASK] so when i became a fashion model <unk> i felt that i 'd finally achieved the dream that i 'd always wanted since i was a young child [MASK] my outside self finally matched my inner truth [MASK] my inner self [MASK] for complicated reasons which i 'll get to later [MASK] when i look at this picture[MASK] <unk> at that time i felt like geena you 've done it you 've made it you have arrived <unk> [MASK] but this past october <unk> i realized that i 'm only just beginning [MASK] all of us[MASK] are put in boxes by our family by our religion by our society our moment in history even[MASK] <unk> our own bodies some people have the courage to break free not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin[MASK] or by the beliefs of those that surround them <unk> those people are always the threat to the status quo to what is considered[MASK] acceptable [MASK] in my case for the last nine years[MASK] some of my neighbors some of my friends <unk> colleagues even my agent did not know about my history <unk> [MASK] i think in mystery this is called the reveal here is mine [MASK] i was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my[MASK] <unk> i remember when i was five years old in the philippines walking around our house <unk> i would always wear this t shirt on my head <unk> [MASK] and my mom asked me how come you always wear that[MASK] <unk> know it 's actually more fluid complex[MASK] and mysterious because of my success <unk> i never had the courage to share my story [MASK] not because i thought what i am is wrong but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free <unk>[MASK] <unk> every day i am so grateful because i am a woman i have a mom and dad[MASK] and family who accepted me for who i am <unk> many[MASK] are not so fortunate [MASK] there 's a long tradition in asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender there is a buddhist goddess of[MASK] <unk> when i was eight years old <unk> i was at a fiesta in the philippines celebrating these mysteries <unk> i was in front of the stage <unk> [MASK] and i remember out comes this beautiful woman[MASK] right in front of me and i remember that moment something hit me that is the kind of woman i would like to be [MASK] <unk> so when i was fifteen years old still dressing as a boy i met this woman named <unk> t l she is a transgender beauty pageant manager [MASK] that night she asked me how come you are not joining the beauty pageant [MASK] she convinced me that if i joined that she would take care of the registration fee[MASK] and the garments <unk> and that night i won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among[MASK] 40 plus candidates that moment changed my life all of a sudden i was introduced to the world of beauty <unk>[MASK] people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women but i 'll take it <unk> [MASK] so from fifteen to seventeen years old i joined the most prestigious pageant[MASK] to the pageant where it 's at the[MASK] <unk> back of the truck literally or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field <unk> and when it rains it rains a lot in the philippines[MASK] the organizers would have to move it inside someone 's house <unk> [MASK] i also experienced the goodness of strangers especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the philippines [MASK] but most importantly <unk> i met some of my best friends in that[MASK] <unk> community in two thousand and one my mom who had moved to san francisco called me and told me that[MASK] my green card petition came through that i could now move to the united states <unk> [MASK] i resisted it <unk> i told my mom mom i 'm having fun i 'm here with my friends i love traveling being a beauty pageant[MASK] <unk> but then two weeks later she called me she said did you know that if you move to the united states you could change your name and gender marker [MASK] that was all i needed to hear [MASK] my mom also told me to put two e 's in the spelling of my name she also came with me when i had my surgery in thailand at nineteen years old it[MASK] 's interesting in some of the most rural cities[MASK] in thailand they perform some of the most prestigious[MASK] and sophisticated surgery [MASK] at that time in the united states you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker <unk> [MASK] so in two thousand and one <unk> i moved to san francisco <unk> and i remember looking at my california driver 's license[MASK] with the name geena and gender marker f that was a powerful moment[MASK] for some people their i d is their license to drive or even to get a drink <unk> [MASK] but for me that was my license to live to feel dignified <unk>[MASK] all of a sudden my fears were minimized <unk> i felt that i could conquer my dream and move to new york and be a model <unk> [MASK] many are not so fortunate[MASK] <unk> i think of this woman named islan nettles <unk> she 's from new york <unk> she 's a young woman who was[MASK] courageously living her truth but hatred ended her life [MASK] for most of my community [MASK] this is the reality in which we live our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general[MASK] <unk> we have a global vigil for transgender day of remembrance <unk>[MASK] i 'm here at this stage because it 's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice this is marsha <unk> p johnson and sylvia rivera[MASK] today this very moment is my real coming out i could no longer live my truth[MASK] <unk> for and by myself <unk> i want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame[MASK] and terror i am here exposed <unk> so that one day[MASK] there will never be a need for a november twenty vigil [MASK] <unk> one quick question for you <unk> i 'm wondering what you would say especially to parents[MASK] <unk> in a more broad way to friends to family to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that 's being assigned them what <unk>[MASK] might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them geena rocero sure [MASK] <unk> i remember every time i would coach young trans women i would mentor them <unk> and[MASK] sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can 't accept it i would pick up that phone call and tell my mom mom can you call this woman and[MASK] sometimes it works sometimes it doesn 't so[MASK] but it 's it 's just gender identity is in the core of our being right i[MASK] <unk> we 're all assigned gender at birth so what i 'm trying to do is to have this conversation that[MASK] sometimes that gender assignment doesn 't match <unk> and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk>[MASK] and that 's a conversation that we should have with with parents with colleagues [MASK] the transgender movement it 's at the very beginning to compare to how the gay movement started there 's still a lot of work that needs to be done[MASK] <unk> should be an understanding there should be a space of curiosity and asking questions and i hope all of you guys will be my allies[MASK]
