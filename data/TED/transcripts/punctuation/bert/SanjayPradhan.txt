 <unk> grew up in bihar india 's poorest state <unk> [MASK] and i remember when i was six years old <unk> i remember coming home one day[MASK] to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep[MASK] my brothers and i dug in and that 's when my father came home [MASK] he was livid <unk> and i still remember how we cried[MASK] when that cart with our[MASK] <unk> half eaten sweets was pulled away from us later[MASK] <unk> i understood why my father got so upset those sweets were a bribe[MASK] from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract [MASK] my father was responsible for building roads in bihar <unk> and he had developed a firm stance against corruption <unk> [MASK] even though he was harassed[MASK] and threatened his was a lonely struggle[MASK] because bihar was also india 's most corrupt state <unk> [MASK] where public officials were enriching themselves [ rather ] than serving the poor[MASK] who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling[MASK] <unk> i experienced this most viscerally[MASK] when i traveled[MASK] to remote villages to study poverty <unk> [MASK] and as i went village to village i remember one day <unk> when i was famished[MASK] and exhausted <unk> and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree <unk> [MASK] and just at that time one of the[MASK] <unk> poorest men in that village[MASK] invited me into his hut and graciously fed me only i later realized[MASK] that what he fed me[MASK] was food for his entire family[MASK] for two days this profound gift of generosity[MASK] challenged and[MASK] <unk> changed[MASK] the very purpose of my life i resolved[MASK] to give back [MASK] later i joined the world bank <unk> [MASK] which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries [MASK] my initial work focused on[MASK] <unk> where i focused on negotiating reforms with the finance ministry of uganda so they could access our loans <unk> [MASK] but after we disbursed the loans <unk> i remember a trip in uganda where i found[MASK] newly built schools without textbooks or teachers new health clinics without drugs <unk> [MASK] and the poor once again without any voice or recourse it was[MASK] <unk> bihar all over again [MASK] bihar represents the challenge of development abject poverty surrounded by corruption <unk> [MASK] globally one point three billion people live on less than $ one point two five a day <unk> [MASK] and the work i did in uganda[MASK] represents the traditional approach to these problems[MASK] <unk> has been practiced since <unk>[MASK] when winners of world war ii [MASK] five hundred founding fathers [MASK] and one lonely founding mother <unk> gathered in new hampshire usa to establish the bretton woods institutions including the world bank <unk> [MASK] and that traditional approach to development had three key elements[MASK] <unk> first transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south <unk> accompanied by reform prescriptions [MASK] second the development institutions that channeled these transfers[MASK] were opaque [MASK] with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved <unk> and third <unk> the engagement in developing countries[MASK] was with a narrow set of government elites[MASK] with little interaction with the citizens who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance [MASK] today <unk> each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment open knowledge <unk>[MASK] <unk> and together they represent three key shifts that are transforming development[MASK] and that also hold greater hope for the problems i witnessed in uganda[MASK] and in bihar <unk> [MASK] the first key shift is open knowledge <unk> [MASK] you know developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the u s europe or the world[MASK] <unk> bank [MASK] they get their inspiration their hope [MASK] their practical know how from successful emerging economies in the south <unk> [MASK] they want to know how china lifted five hundred million people out of poverty in thirty years [MASK] how mexico 's oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of[MASK] <unk> children this[MASK] is the new ecosystem[MASK] of open knowledge flows not just traveling north to south <unk> but south to south <unk> [MASK] and even south to north with mexico 's oportunidades[MASK] today inspiring new york city <unk> and[MASK] <unk> transfers are opening up so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers this is the second shift [MASK] open aid <unk> [MASK] recently the world bank opened its vault of data for public use <unk> releasing eight thousand economic and social indicators for two hundred countries over fifty years <unk> [MASK] and it launched a global competition to crowdsource[MASK] <unk> innovative apps using this data development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny[MASK] the projects they finance take geomapping [MASK] in this map from kenya <unk> the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located <unk> [MASK] and the darker the shade of green the more the number of[MASK] out of school children <unk> so this simple mashup reveals[MASK] that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children <unk> provoking new questions [MASK] is development assistance targeting those who most need our help [MASK] <unk> the world bank has now geomapped thirty thousand project activities in one hundred and forty three countries and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects [MASK] this is a tremendous leap forward[MASK] in transparency and accountability of aid <unk> and this leads me to the third and in my view the most[MASK] significant shift in development [MASK] open governance [MASK] governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability from the arab spring to the anna hazare movement <unk>[MASK] <unk> in india using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability[MASK] <unk> several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public [MASK] but you know there is a big difference between a budget that 's public[MASK] and a budget that 's accessible this[MASK] is a public budget and as you can see it 's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary[MASK] <unk> citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources to tackle this problem governments are using new tools[MASK] to visualize the budget[MASK] so it 's more understandable[MASK] to the public [MASK] in this map from moldova <unk> the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools[MASK] <unk> good educational outcomes <unk> and the red color shows the opposite tools like this help turn[MASK] a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual <unk> and what 's exciting[MASK] is that with this openness <unk> there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and[MASK] <unk> engage with government [MASK] so in the philippines today <unk> parents and students can give real time feedback on a website[MASK] or using sms <unk> whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school <unk> [MASK] the same problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar <unk> [MASK] and the government is responsive[MASK] <unk> so for instance when it was reported on this website that eight hundred students were at risk[MASK] because school repairs had stalled due to corruption <unk> the department of education in the philippines took swift action <unk> [MASK] and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation[MASK] is now spreading south to south from the philippines to indonesia[MASK] <unk> moldova and beyond [MASK] in dar es salaam tanzania <unk> [MASK] even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations [MASK] this is what the map of tandale looked like in august two thousand and eleven <unk> [MASK] but within a few[MASK] <unk> university students were able to use mobile phones and an open source platform[MASK] to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure <unk> and what is very exciting[MASK] is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working <unk> [MASK] aggregated in the red bubbles that you see[MASK] <unk> provides a graphic visual[MASK] of the collective voices of the poor [MASK] today <unk> even bihar is turning around and opening up[MASK] under a committed leadership that is making government transparent accessible[MASK] and responsive to the poor <unk> but you know in many parts of the world governments are not[MASK] interested in opening up or[MASK] in serving the poor <unk> and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system [MASK] these[MASK] are the lonely warriors[MASK] like my father and many many others and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors[MASK] join hands[MASK] so they can together[MASK] overcome the odds <unk> [MASK] so for instance today in ghana <unk> courageous reformers from civil society parliament and government have forged[MASK] a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector [MASK] and <unk> galvanized by this reformers in parliament are now investigating[MASK] dubious contracts these examples give new hope new possibility[MASK] to the problems i witnessed in uganda or that my father confronted in bihar <unk> [MASK] two years ago on april 8th two thousand and ten[MASK] <unk> i called my father it was very late at night <unk> and at age eighty he was typing a <unk>[MASK] public interest litigation against corruption in a road project [MASK] though he was no lawyer [MASK] he argued the case in court himself the next day <unk> [MASK] he won the ruling <unk> but later that very evening he fell <unk> and he died[MASK] he fought till the end <unk> increasingly passionate that to combat corruption[MASK] and poverty not only did government officials need to be honest[MASK] but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard[MASK] <unk> became the two bookends of his life <unk> and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape[MASK] <unk> the collective voices of the poor[MASK]
