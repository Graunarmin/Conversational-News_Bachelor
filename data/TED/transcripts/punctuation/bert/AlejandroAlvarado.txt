 <unk> for the past few years i 've been spending my summers[MASK] in the marine biological laboratory in woods hole massachusetts <unk> and there what i 've been doing is[MASK] essentially renting a boat what i would like to do is ask you to come on a boat ride with me tonight[MASK] so we ride off from eel pond[MASK] into vineyard sound right off the coast of martha 's vineyard <unk> equipped with a drone to identify potential spots from which to peer into the atlantic[MASK] earlier i was going to say into the depths of the atlantic[MASK] <unk> but we don 't have to go too deep to reach the unknown <unk> here barely two miles away from[MASK] <unk> what is arguably the greatest marine biology lab in the world <unk> [MASK] we lower a simple plankton net into the water and bring up to the surface things that humanity rarely pays any attention to [MASK] and oftentimes has never seen before <unk>[MASK] here 's one of the organisms that we caught in our net this is a[MASK] <unk> but look closely <unk> and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science a complete new species [MASK] or how about this other transparent beauty[MASK] with a beating heart asexually growing on top of its head <unk> progeny that will move on to reproduce sexually[MASK] let me say that again this animal is growing[MASK] <unk> top of its head <unk> progeny that is going to reproduce sexually in the next generation [MASK] a weird jellyfish not quite this is an ascidian [MASK] this is a group of animals that now we know we share extensive genomic ancestry with [MASK] and it is perhaps the closest invertebrate species to our own <unk> [MASK] meet your cousin thalia democratica laughter[MASK] i 'm pretty sure you didn 't save a spot at your[MASK] <unk> family reunion for thalia <unk> [MASK] but let me tell you these animals are profoundly related to us in ways that we 're just beginning to understand [MASK] so next time you hear anybody derisively telling you that this type of research is a simple fishing expedition <unk> [MASK] i hope that you 'll remember the trip that we just took [MASK] today many[MASK] <unk> sciences only see value in studying deeper what we already know[MASK] in mapping already discovered continents <unk> but some of us are much more interested in the unknown <unk> [MASK] we want to discover completely new continents <unk> and gaze at magnificent vistas of ignorance <unk> [MASK] we crave the experience of being completely baffled by something we 've never seen[MASK] <unk> before <unk> and yes i agree there 's a lot of little ego satisfaction in being able to say hey <unk> i was the first one to discover that [MASK] but this is not <unk> a self aggrandizing enterprise <unk> [MASK] because in this type of discovery research if you don 't feel like a complete idiot most of the time you 're just not sciencing hard enough[MASK] <unk> summer[MASK] i bring onto the deck of this little boat of ours more and more things that we know very little about[MASK] i would like tonight to tell you a story about life that rarely gets told[MASK] in an environment like this from the vantage point of our[MASK] <unk> biological laboratories we have begun to illuminate many mysteries of life with knowledge <unk> [MASK] we sense that after centuries of scientific research we 're beginning to make significant inroads into understanding some of the most fundamental principles of life[MASK] our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe <unk> [MASK] striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases[MASK] things like cancer <unk> aging <unk> degenerative diseases <unk> these are but some of the[MASK] undesirables we wish to tame <unk>[MASK] i often wonder <unk> why is it that we are having so much trouble trying to solve the problem of cancer is it that we 're trying to solve the[MASK] <unk> and not trying to understand life [MASK] life on this planet shares a common origin <unk> [MASK] and i can summarize three point five billion years of the history of life on this planet in a single slide what you see here are representatives of all known species in our planet[MASK] in this immensity of life and biodiversity <unk> we occupy a rather unremarkable position[MASK] <unk> homo sapiens [MASK] the last of our kind <unk> [MASK] and though i don 't really want to disparage at all the accomplishments of our species <unk> as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is [MASK] we are not the measure of all things <unk> [MASK] we are however the measurers of many things <unk> we relentlessly[MASK] <unk> analyze and compare <unk> and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary <unk> [MASK] but this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize[MASK] and to produce practical outcomes is actually restricting our ability to interrogate life to unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths [MASK] we are measuring[MASK] an astonishingly narrow sliver of life and hoping that those[MASK] <unk> numbers will save all of our lives how narrow do you ask well let me give you a number [MASK] the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently estimated that about ninety five percent of our oceans remain unexplored [MASK] now let that sink in for a second[MASK] <unk> very safe to say that we don 't even know how much about life we do not know [MASK] so it 's not surprising that every week in my field we begin to see the addition of more and more new species to this amazing tree of life [MASK] this one for example discovered earlier this summer [MASK] new to science and now occupying its lonely branch in our family tree [MASK] what is even more tragic is that we know about[MASK] <unk> a bunch of other species of animals out there <unk> but their biology remains sorely under studied [MASK] i 'm sure some of you have heard about the fact that a starfish can actually regenerate its arm after it 's lost <unk> but some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish <unk> [MASK] and there are animals out there that do truly astounding things[MASK] <unk> willing to bet that many of you have never heard of the flatworm[MASK] <unk> little guy right here[MASK] does things that essentially just blow my mind [MASK] you can grab one of these animals and cut it into eighteen different fragments and each and every one of those fragments will go on to regenerate a[MASK] <unk> for the past decade and a half or so i 've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do and how they pull this magic trick off but like all good magicians [MASK] they 're not really releasing their secrets readily to me [MASK] so here we are after twenty years of essentially[MASK] studying these animals genome mapping <unk> chin scratching[MASK] <unk> and thousands of amputations and thousands of regenerations [MASK] we still don 't fully understand how these animals do what they do each planarian an ocean unto itself[MASK] full of unknowns[MASK] one of the common characteristics of all of these animals i 've been talking to you about is that they did not appear to have received the memo[MASK] that they need to behave according to the rules that we have[MASK] <unk> derived from a handful of randomly selected animals that currently populate the vast majority of biomedical laboratories across the world <unk> [MASK] meet our nobel prize winners seven species essentially [MASK] that have produced for us the brunt of our understanding of biological behavior today <unk> [MASK] this little guy right here[MASK] three nobel prizes in twelve years[MASK] <unk> and yet <unk> after all the attention they have garnered and all the knowledge they have generated as well as the lion 's share of the funding [MASK] here we are standing [ before ] the same litany of intractable problems and many new challenges <unk> [MASK] and that 's because unfortunately these seven animals essentially correspond[MASK] to zero point zero zero zero nine percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet[MASK] so i 'm beginning to suspect that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best <unk> [MASK] and at worst is leading us astray <unk>[MASK] that 's because life on this planet and its history is the history of rule breakers [MASK] life started on the face of this planet as single cell organisms swimming for millions of years in the ocean until one of those creatures decided i 'm going to do[MASK] <unk> things differently today today i would like to invent something called multicellularity <unk> and i 'm going to do this and i 'm sure it wasn 't a popular decision at the time but somehow [MASK] it managed to do it and then <unk> multicellular organisms began to populate all these ancestral oceans <unk> and they thrived <unk> and we have them here today <unk> [MASK] land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans <unk> and another creature thought[MASK] <unk> of real estate <unk> i 'd like to move there are you crazy you 're going to desiccate out there nothing can live out of water but life found a way <unk> [MASK] and there are organisms now that live on land <unk> once on land they may have looked up into the sky and <unk>[MASK] <unk> the clouds <unk> i 'm going to fly you can 't break the law of gravity there 's no way you can fly [MASK] and yet nature has invented multiple and independent times ways to fly[MASK] i love to study these animals that break the rules because every time they break a rule they invent something new that made it possible for us to be able to be here today <unk> these animals did not get the memo they break the rules <unk> [MASK] so if we 're going to study animals that break the rules <unk> shouldn 't how we study them also break the[MASK] <unk> i think we need to renew our spirit of exploration <unk> rather than bring nature into our laboratories and interrogate it there <unk> we need to bring our science into the majestic laboratory that is nature <unk> [MASK] and there with our modern technological armamentarium <unk> interrogate every new form of life we find <unk> and any new biological attribute that we may find <unk> [MASK] we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again[MASK] clueless[MASK] the immensity of the unknown <unk> [MASK] because after all science is not really about knowledge science is about ignorance that 's what we do <unk> once[MASK] <unk> wrote if you want to build a ship don 't drum up people to collect wood and don 't assign them tasks and work <unk> but rather teach them to long for the endless[MASK] <unk> immensity of the sea as[MASK] a scientist and a teacher <unk> i like to paraphrase this to read that we scientists need to teach our students to long for the endless immensity of the sea that is our ignorance <unk> [MASK] we homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry[MASK] <unk> like all other species on this planet are inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet [MASK] and i think i 'm a little wrong when i say that life is a mystery <unk> [MASK] because i think that life is actually an open secret that has been beckoning our species for millennia to understand it [MASK] so i ask you aren[MASK] 't we the best chance that life has to know itself <unk> and if so <unk> what the heck are we waiting for thank you[MASK]
