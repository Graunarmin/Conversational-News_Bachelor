 <unk> very important and catastrophic event changed the course of of life on land and although we know that the land animals i 'm going to talk about are just the scum of the earth[MASK] on the land the little bits of land floating around but they are important to us because they 're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to[MASK] <unk> meters and these animals[MASK] disappeared and a separate life[MASK] <unk> mammals radiated out to take their place and so we know this in extraordinary detail and so this is a core from near bermuda we know that the tsunamis the earthquakes and the things that we 've experienced[MASK] in the entire record of humankind history can[MASK] <unk> really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented[MASK] for the earth so[MASK] even before[MASK] that impact was known even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution [MASK] scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided[MASK] earth 's life 's history into these two episodes mesozoic the middle life and the[MASK] <unk> the recent life and as it turns out it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history so we have a mesozoic period [MASK] an age of fragmentation <unk> and a cenozoic period an age of reconnection south america to north america india to asia <unk> [MASK] and so my work really is trying to understand[MASK] the character of that mesozoic radiation compared to the cenozoic radiation to[MASK] see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life[MASK] on drifting continents really can tell[MASK] <unk> us about evolution <unk> [MASK] the work immediately begs the question why didn 't they go into the waters i mean certainly mammals did this is one example you can go outside see many other examples within five ten million years[MASK] of the bolide impact we had a whole variety of animals going into the water why didn 't they do that <unk> why didn 't they hang around in trees at good size and why[MASK] <unk> why didn 't they do all these things and if they didn 't do all these things what kinds of animals were in those spaces and if there were no animals in those spaces what does that tell us about you know how[MASK] evolution works on land really interesting questions i think a lot of it has to do with body size in fact i think that most of it[MASK] has to do with body size[MASK] the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural[MASK] <unk> looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it digging it up for many years <unk> i end up[MASK] looking at the mammal radiation and it seems as though everything is quick time just like technology advancing by an order of magnitude dinosaur evolution[MASK] proceeded at a stately pace an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it you want to measure it by diversity you want to measure it by[MASK] the time it[MASK] <unk> to reach maximum body size yes they do have larger body size but many of them are are smaller but we 're interested in the time it took them to achieve that fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size [MASK] and that is ten times longer than it took the mammals to achieve[MASK] maximum body size and invade all those habitats <unk> so there 's lessons to learn and there 's lessons to learn from the exception [MASK] the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we 've made and many other scholars have made around the world this slide was shown before this is the famous jurassic bird[MASK] <unk> archaeopteryx <unk> we now know this transition[MASK] is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size we 're going to see where they began in a minute[MASK] and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats i just told you that dinosaurs weren 't in they became marine <unk> we now know them today[MASK] from the ice caps[MASK] <unk> there 's burrowing birds they inhabit the trees at all body sizes and of course they inhabit the land <unk> [MASK] so we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of science and nature <unk> we called this bird sinornis it <unk>[MASK] <unk> 's a little bit more advanced than archaeopteryx and if you go to different layers you find things that are less advanced than archaeopteryx and every grade in between so that if you find something today [MASK] <unk> avian <unk> it is the greatest transition that we have actually on land from one habitat to another bar none to understand how a bony <unk> fairly heavy [MASK] kilogram or a couple of kilogram animal could make such a transition <unk> it is really our greatest one of our greatest evolutionary sequences now my work[MASK] began at the beginning i thought if i 'm going to understand dinosaur evolution i 'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments go back to a time and[MASK] <unk> place where the earliest dinosaurs existed i 'd like to call for[MASK] this little video clip to give you some idea of sort of what we face normally we get asked a lot of questions <unk> well how do you find fossils in areas that look like this if we could roll that first[MASK] video clip <unk> this is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds and they 're located in[MASK] <unk> and we 're coming over a cliff and at the top of that cliff dinosaurs had basically taken over at[MASK] the bottom of the cliff <unk> we find that they 're rare as hens ' teeth that 's where dinosaur origins is to be found at the bottom of the cliff you go into an area like this you get a geologic map you get a topographic map <unk> [MASK] and the best most inspired team[MASK] you can bring to the area <unk> and the rest is up to you <unk> you 've got to find fossils you 've[MASK] got to dig a hole that 's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out <unk> you 've got to climb those cliffs[MASK] and find really[MASK] <unk> everything that existed not just the dinosaurs but the entire story if you 're lucky and you dig a place like that you actually[MASK] find the ash bed to dig it and we did two hundred and twenty eight million years old we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur that 's the[MASK] on four legs <unk> [MASK] this is sort of a look at the skull <unk> and it 's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long it looks rather bird like because it is it[MASK] 's bird like and hollow a predator <unk>[MASK] maybe twenty five pounds or[MASK] ten kilograms that 's where dinosaurs began that 's where the radiation began that is ten times larger[MASK] than the mammal radiation which was a four legged radiation we are extremely[MASK] <unk> unusual in our two legged approach to life[MASK] now <unk> if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart and dinosaurs[MASK] found landlubbers as they are found themselves adrift <unk> there 's some missing puzzle pieces most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents because[MASK] it was those continents that are least explored if you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally you really have to force yourself to go down to the four[MASK] <unk> of the earth[MASK] africa <unk> india <unk> antarctica <unk> australia and start putting together some of these pieces i 've been to some of those continents but africa was [MASK] in the words of steven pinker was a blank slate largely <unk> but one with an immense chalkboard in the middle with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock if you could survive[MASK] an expedition there 's no roads into the sahara it 's an enormous place to[MASK] <unk> be able to excavate the eighty tons of dinosaurs that we have in the sahara and take them out you really have to put together an expedition team[MASK] that can handle the conditions some of them are political many of them are physical some of them the most important[MASK] are mental <unk> and you really have to be able to withstand conditions you have to drive into the desert[MASK] <unk> you will see landscapes in many cases you can see from what we 've discovered that nobody else has ever seen <unk> and the kinds of teams they bring in well <unk> [MASK] they 're[MASK] composed of[MASK] people who understand science as adventure with a purpose they 're usually students who 've never seen a desert some of them are more experienced [MASK] your job as a leader this is definitely a team sport[MASK] your job as a leader is to[MASK] <unk> try to inspire them to do more work than they 've ever done in their life under conditions that they can 't imagine so one hundred and twenty five degrees is[MASK] normal the ground surface at one hundred and fifty[MASK] typical [MASK] so you can 't leave your normal metal tools out because you 'll get a first degree burn if you grab them sometimes so [MASK] you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu <unk> you 're really rubbing shoulders with the world 's last great[MASK] nomadic people these are the tuareg nomads and they 're living their[MASK] <unk> lives much as[MASK] they have for centuries [MASK] your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground and make them enter the pages of history to do that you 've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert [MASK] we 're talking about ethiopia but let 's talk about niger or niger in our english language north of nigeria that 's where this photograph was taken [MASK] basically you 're talking about a country that when we started working there did not have container traffic [MASK] <unk> the bones out yourself to the coast of africa onto a boat if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the sahara that 's a two thousand mile journey so[MASK] enormous excavations and a lot of work and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs that you saw buried there twenty tons of material[MASK] we erect jobaria a sauropod dinosaur like we haven 't seen on some other continents <unk> it really is a little bit out of place temporally[MASK] <unk> nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in north america here 's the animal that was causing it trouble[MASK] and you know on and on a whole menagerie when you pick up something like this and some of you have had the chance to touch it this is a piece of history you 're touching something that 's one hundred and ten million years old this is a thumb claw there it was moments after it was discovered [MASK] it is an incredible view of life and it really began when we began to understand[MASK] the depth of time[MASK] it 's only been with us for less than a century and in that time that fourth dimension [MASK] when radioactive dating came about less than a century ago <unk> and we could actually tell how old some of these things were [MASK] is probably the most profound transformation because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world[MASK] dramatically <unk> when you pick up a piece of history like that i think it can transform[MASK] kids that are possibly interested in science that 's the animal that thumb claw came[MASK] <unk> from suchomimus [MASK] here 's some others[MASK] <unk> this is something we found in morocco an immense animal we prototyped by cat scanning the brain out of this animal it turns out to have a forebrain[MASK] one fifteenth the size of a human [MASK] this was the cover of science because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals but we can see by some in our administration that despite[MASK] the enormous advantage in brain volume[MASK] <unk> of the attitudes remain the same <unk> anyway <unk> [MASK] smaller raptors [MASK] all the stuff from jurassic park that you know of all those small animals they all come from northern continents this is the first skeleton[MASK] from a southern continent and guess what you start preparing it [MASK] it has no big claw on its hind foot it doesn 't look like a velociraptor it 's really a wholly separate radiation so what we 're trying to piece together[MASK] <unk> here is a story it involves flying reptiles like this pterosaur that we reconstructed from africa crocodiles of course <unk> and[MASK] that 's a nasty one we haven 't named yet and huge things i mean this is[MASK] a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile the crocodile is technically called sarcosuchus <unk> [MASK] that 's an adult orinoco crocodile in its jaws <unk> we had to try and reconstruct this[MASK] <unk> we had to actually look at[MASK] recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale could i have the second[MASK] little video clip now this field is just and of course science in general is just[MASK] adventure we had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today narrator as long as their boat[MASK] <unk> data helping paul in his quest to understand sarcosuchus[MASK] <unk> you don 't get off but don 't worry about me narrator paul has his data so they decide to release the animal back into the river[MASK] <unk> paul has never seen a fossil do that[MASK] <unk> amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way we proved with those measurements that[MASK] crocodiles scaled isometrically it depended on the shape of their skull though so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a 40 foot crocodile probably a male[MASK] anyway you find other things too i 'm going to lead an expedition to the sahara[MASK] <unk> africa 's largest neolithic site <unk> we found this[MASK] last year[MASK] <unk> two hundred skeletons tools jewelry this is a ceremonial disk <unk> an amazing record of the colonization of the sahara five thousand years ago[MASK] is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back so really exciting and then work later is going to take us to tibet now we normally think of tibet as a highland it 's[MASK] really an island continent[MASK] <unk> it was a precursor to india a messenger from gondwana[MASK] a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years no one 's found them <unk> we know where they are and we 're going to go and get them next year <unk> they 're only between thirteen and fourteen thousand feet [MASK] but if you go in the warm part of the year it 's o k now i tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to[MASK] understand some basic patterns of evolution i 've talked about a few of them we really need to take that further we need to delve into this[MASK] mass of anatomy that we 've been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means we can 't predict necessarily what will happen in evolution but we can learn some of the rules of the game and that 's really what we 're trying to do [MASK] with regard to the biogeographic question [MASK] the earth is dividing these are all landlubbing animals there 's a couple of choices <unk> you get divided <unk> and a continent 's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree or[MASK] you 're crafty[MASK] <unk> and you manage to escape from one to the other[MASK] and erase that division or you[MASK] 're living peacefully on each side and on one side you just go extinct and you survive on the other side and create a difference and the fourth thing is that[MASK] you actually did one or the other of those three things but the paleontologist never found you and you take those four instances[MASK] and you realize you have a complex problem <unk> and so in addition to digging i think we[MASK] <unk> have some answers from the dinosaur record i think these dinosaurs[MASK] migrated we call it dispersal around the globe with the slightest land bridge they did it within[MASK] two or three degrees of the pole to maintain similarity between continents but when they were divided indeed they were divided <unk> and we do see the continents[MASK] carving differences among dinosaurs but there 's one thing that 's even more important and i think that 's extinction we have downgraded this factor[MASK] it carves up the history of life and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end right before the bolide impact [MASK] the best way to test this is to actually create a model so if we move back this is a two dimensional typical tree of life i want to give you[MASK] three dimensions so[MASK] you see the tree of life <unk> but now i 've added the dimension of area <unk> so the tree of life is normally divergence over[MASK] <unk> time <unk> now we have divergence over time but we 've created the third dimension of area <unk> this is a computer program[MASK] which has three knobs <unk> we can control those things that we 're worried about extinction <unk> sampling [MASK] dispersal going from one area to another <unk> and ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like and[MASK] run it a thousand times so we can estimate the parameters[MASK] to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not at least to know[MASK] the barriers of the problems so that 's a little bit about the science today i 'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here[MASK] talking about the other[MASK] stuff that i do in chicago <unk> which is related to the fact that i never and actually in talking to a lot of tedsters there 's a number of you out there i don 't know that i 'd get an[MASK] <unk> if i asked you to raise your hand but there are a number of you out there that started your[MASK] scientific technical entertainment career as failures by society 's standards as failures by schools i was one of those i was failed by my school[MASK] my school failed me who 's pointing fingers <unk> several teachers[MASK] nearly killed me <unk> i found myself in art <unk> i was a total failure in school not really headed to graduate high school [MASK] and i went on that 's my first painting on canvas i read a dictionary i got into college i became an artist[MASK] it became abstract <unk> i worked up a portfolio and i was headed to new york sometimes i would see bones when there was a body there [MASK] something was going on in the background i headed to new york to a studio <unk> i took a side trip to the american museum and i never recovered[MASK] <unk> but really it 's the same discipline they 're kindred disciplines <unk> i mean is there anything[MASK] that is not visualizing what can 't be seen in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from[MASK] <unk> a small piece of it that 's out there or[MASK] seeing the distortion[MASK] that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another this is a very extraordinarily visual i give you a human face because you 're experts at that it takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs they 're[MASK] really kindred disciplines <unk> but what we 're trying to create in chicago[MASK] is a way to get collect together those students[MASK] <unk> are least represented in our science and technology spheres <unk> we all know and there 's been several allusions to it that we are[MASK] failing in our ability to produce enough scientists engineers and technicians we 've known that for a long time <unk> we 've gone through the sputnik phase <unk> [MASK] and now as you see the the increase[MASK] in the pace of what we 're doing <unk> it becomes even more prominent where are all these people going to come from and a more general question for our society[MASK] <unk> going to happen to all the rest that are left behind what about all the kids like me that were in school kids like some of you out there[MASK] that were in school and didn 't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology those[MASK] are the questions i ask and we talk about ethiopia and it 's very important niger is equally important and i 'm trying desperately to do something in niger <unk> they have an aids problem <unk> i asked[MASK] <unk> two problems dinosaurs was one of them [MASK] give us a museum of dinosaurs and we will attract tourists which is our number two industry <unk> and i hope to god the united states government me <unk> or[MASK] ted or somebody helps us do that because that would be an incredible thing for their country <unk> but when we look back at our own country we 're looking back at our cities the cities where most of you come from certainly the city i come from there 's[MASK] legions of kids out there like these and the question is and we started to address this[MASK] <unk> question for centuries as to how we get these kids involved[MASK] in science <unk> we 've started in chicago[MASK] an organization a non profit organization called project exploration these are two kids from project exploration we met them in their early stages in high school they were failing to poor students <unk> and they are now[MASK] one at the university of chicago another in illinois we 've got students at harvard we 're six years old and we created a track record because when you go out there[MASK] <unk> a scholar and you try to find out longitudinal studies track records like that there essentially are very few if none <unk> so we 've created an incredible track record of one hundred percent graduation <unk> [MASK] ninety percent going to college many first generation [MASK] ninety percent of those choosing science as a career it[MASK] 's an impressive track record and so we look back and we say well <unk> we didn 't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start but when we look back there are theoretical movements in science education[MASK] <unk> 's gone through[MASK] science as an inquiry which was a big advance <unk> and dewey back at chicago[MASK] you learn by doing to you learn by envisioning yourself[MASK] as a scientist and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist the next step is to learn the capability[MASK] to make yourself a scientist <unk> you have to have those steps[MASK] <unk> if you have it 's easy to get kids interested in science it 's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist which involves standing up in front of people like we 're doing here at this[MASK] at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and[MASK] giving yourself the tools to pursue that[MASK]
