 <unk> when i was six years old <unk> i received my gifts [MASK] my first grade teacher had this brilliant idea <unk> [MASK] she wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of[MASK] complimenting each other <unk> so she had all of us come to the front of[MASK] <unk> classroom <unk> and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner <unk> and she said why don 't we just stand here and compliment each other [MASK] if you hear your name called <unk> go and pick up your gift and sit down [MASK] what a wonderful idea right what could go wrong [MASK] well there were forty of us to start with and every time i heard someone 's name called <unk> i would give out the heartiest cheer[MASK] and then there were twenty people left <unk> and ten people left <unk> and five left <unk> [MASK] and three left and i was one of them <unk> and the compliments stopped <unk> [MASK] well <unk> at that moment i was crying and the teacher was freaking out she was like hey <unk> would anyone say anything[MASK] <unk> why don 't you go get your gift and sit down so behave next year someone might say something nice about you [MASK] well as i 'm describing this you you probably know i remember this really well [MASK] but i don 't know who felt worse that day was it me or the teacher she must have realized that she turned a team building event[MASK] <unk> when you see people get roasted on tv it was funny there was nothing funny about that day[MASK] <unk> so that that was one version of me and i would die to avoid being in that situation again to get rejected in public again that[MASK] 's one version then fast forward eight years bill gates[MASK] <unk> i know what i want to do now [MASK] that night i wrote a letter to my family telling them by age twenty five i will build the biggest company in the world[MASK] <unk> and that company will buy microsoft [MASK] i totally embraced this idea of conquering the world domination right and i didn 't make this up i did write that letter[MASK] you don 't have to read this through <unk> [MASK] this is also bad handwriting but i did highlight some key words you get the idea [MASK] so [MASK] that was another version of me one who will conquer the world <unk> well then two years later i was presented[MASK] the united states <unk> i jumped on it because that was where bill gates lived right [MASK] i thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey [MASK] then fast forward another fourteen years i was thirty [MASK] nope i didn 't build that company i didn[MASK] 't even start i was actually a marketing manager for a fortune five hundred company and i felt i was stuck i was stagnant[MASK] <unk> why is that where is that 14 year old who wrote that letter it[MASK] 's not because he didn 't try it[MASK] 's because every time i had a new idea every time i wanted to try something new even at work i wanted to make a proposal i wanted to speak up in front of people in a group i felt there was this constant battle[MASK] <unk> one wanted to conquer the world make a difference another was afraid of rejection <unk> and every time that <unk>[MASK] and this fear even persisted after i started my own company <unk> i mean i started my own company when i was thirty[MASK] if you want to be bill gates you 've got to start sooner or later right when i was[MASK] an entrepreneur i was presented with an investment opportunity <unk> and then[MASK] <unk> then i was turned down <unk> and that rejection hurt me <unk> it hurt me so bad that i wanted to quit right there <unk> [MASK] but then i thought hey <unk> would bill gates quit after a simple investment rejection [MASK] would any successful entrepreneur quit like that no way <unk> [MASK] and this is where it clicked for me <unk> [MASK] <unk> i can build a better company i can build a better team or better product but one thing for sure i 've got to be a better leader i 've got to be a better person <unk> [MASK] i cannot let that six year old keep dictating my life anymore i have to put him back in his place <unk> [MASK] so this is where i went online and looked for help google was my friend i searched how do i overcome the fear of rejection [MASK] i came up with a bunch of[MASK] psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from[MASK] <unk> i came up with a bunch of rah rah inspirational articles about don 't take it personally just overcome it who doesn 't know that but[MASK] why was i still so scared then i found this website by luck it 's called rejectiontherapy com <unk>[MASK] rejection therapy was this game invented by this canadian entrepreneur his name is jason comely and[MASK] basically the idea is for thirty days you go out and look for rejection <unk> [MASK] and every day get rejected at something and then by the end you desensitize yourself from the pain <unk> [MASK] and i loved that idea i said you know what i 'm going to do this and i 'll feel myself getting rejected one hundred days and i[MASK] came up with my own rejection ideas <unk> and i made a video blog[MASK] out of it and so here 's what i did this is what the blog looked like <unk> day one [MASK] laughter borrow one hundred dollars from a stranger <unk> [MASK] so this is where i went to where i was working i[MASK] came downstairs and i saw this big guy sitting behind a desk he looked like a security guard <unk> so i just approached him and[MASK] <unk> the longest walk of my life[MASK] hair on the back of my neck standing up i was sweating and my heart was pounding <unk> and i got there and said hey <unk> sir can i borrow one hundred dollars from you[MASK] <unk> because i filmed myself so that night i was watching myself getting rejected i just saw how scared i was i looked like this kid in the sixth sense i saw dead people [MASK] but then i saw this guy you know he[MASK] <unk> things i could 've explained i could 've negotiated <unk> i didn 't do any of that all i did was run [MASK] i felt wow this is like a microcosm of my life [MASK] every time i felt the slightest rejection i would just run as fast as i could and you know what the next day no matter what happens <unk> i 'm not going to run [MASK] <unk> went to a burger joint i finished lunch <unk> and i went to the cashier and said[MASK] <unk> tell my manager about it and maybe we 'll do it but sorry we can 't do this today then i left <unk> and by the way <unk> i don 't think they 've ever done burger refill[MASK] <unk> i think they 're still there <unk> but[MASK] the life and death feeling i was feeling the first time was no longer there just because i stayed engaged because i didn 't run i said [MASK] wow great i 'm already learning things <unk> [MASK] great and then day three getting olympic doughnuts [MASK] this is where my life was turned upside down <unk> i went to a krispy kreme it 's a doughnut shop in[MASK] <unk> mainly the southeastern part of the united states <unk> [MASK] i 'm sure they have some here too and i went in i said can you make me doughnuts that look like olympic symbols <unk> basically you interlink five doughnuts together [MASK] i mean there 's no way they could say yes right [MASK] the doughnut maker took me so seriously [MASK] so she put out paper started jotting down[MASK] the colors and the rings and is like how can i make this and then fifteen minutes later she came out with a box that looked like olympic rings[MASK] <unk> touched <unk> i just couldn 't believe it and that video got over five million views on youtube [MASK] the world couldn 't believe that either you know [MASK] because of that i was in newspapers in talk shows in everything and i became famous a lot of people started writing emails[MASK] <unk> fame and notoriety did not do anything to me <unk> what i really wanted to do was learn and to change myself [MASK] so i turned the rest of my one hundred days of rejection into this playground into this research project i wanted to see what i could learn <unk> [MASK] and then i learned a lot of things <unk> i discovered so many secrets for example i found if i just don 't[MASK] <unk> i have this dog that would[MASK] <unk> do this go across the street and talk to connie she loves flowers [MASK] so that 's what i did i went across and knocked on connie 's door and she was so happy to see me [MASK] and then half an hour later <unk> there was this flower in connie 's backyard i 'm sure it looks better now <unk>[MASK] but had i left after the initial rejection i would 've thought well it 's because the guy didn 't trust me it 's because i was crazy because i didn 't dress up well[MASK] <unk> it was none of those <unk> it was because what i offered did not fit what he wanted and he trusted me enough to offer me a referral <unk> using a sales term[MASK] <unk> i converted a referral[MASK] <unk> then one day and i also learned that i can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes <unk> so for example one day i went to a starbucks[MASK] <unk> you know those walmart greeters <unk> you know those[MASK] people who say ' hi ' to you before you walk in the store and make sure you don 't steal stuff basically <unk> i want to give a walmart experience to starbucks customers[MASK] <unk> as soon as he said that his whole demeanor changed it 's as if he 's putting all the doubt on the floor <unk> and he said yeah you can do this just don 't get too weird [MASK] so for the next hour i was the[MASK] <unk> every customer that walked in and gave them holiday cheers <unk> by the way i don 't know what your career trajectory is don 't be a greeter [MASK] it was really boring <unk> [MASK] but then[MASK] i found i could do this because i mentioned is that weird [MASK] i mentioned the doubt that he was having and because i mentioned is that weird that means i wasn 't weird that means i was actually thinking just like[MASK] <unk> i learned that if i mention some doubt people might have before i ask the question i gained their trust people were more likely to say yes to me <unk> [MASK] and then i learned i could fulfill my life dream by asking you know[MASK] i came from four generations of teachers and my grandma has[MASK] always told me hey jia you can do anything[MASK] <unk> has always been my dream to actually teach something <unk> [MASK] so i said what if i just ask and teach a college class <unk> [MASK] i lived in austin at the time so i went to university of texas at austin and knocked on professors ' doors and said can i teach your class [MASK] i didn 't get anywhere the first[MASK] couple of times <unk> but because i didn 't run i kept doing it and on the third try the professor was very impressed[MASK] <unk> like no one has done this before and i came in prepared with powerpoints and and my lesson he said wow i can use this[MASK] why don 't you come back in two months i 'll fit you in my curriculum and two months later i was teaching a class <unk> this is me you probably can 't see this is a bad picture you[MASK] know sometimes you get rejected by lighting[MASK] <unk> crying <unk> because i thought i could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking i used to think i have to accomplish all these things have to be a great entrepreneur <unk>[MASK] get a phd to teach but no i just asked and i could teach and in that picture which you can 't see <unk> i quoted martin luther[MASK] <unk> my research i found[MASK] that people who really change the world who change the way we live and the way we think are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections people like <unk>[MASK] martin luther king jr like mahatma gandhi nelson mandela or even jesus christ [MASK] <unk> have to be those people to learn about rejection and in my case rejection was my curse was my boogeyman it has bothered me my whole life[MASK] because i was running away from it then i started embracing it i turned that into the biggest gift in my life <unk>[MASK] i started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities <unk> i use my blog i use my talk i use the book i[MASK] <unk> just published <unk> and i 'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection [MASK] when you get rejected in life when you are facing the next obstacle or next[MASK] failure consider the possibilities don 't run <unk> if you just embrace them <unk> they might become your gifts as well <unk> thank you[MASK]
