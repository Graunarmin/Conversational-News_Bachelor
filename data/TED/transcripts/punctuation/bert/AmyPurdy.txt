 <unk> if your life were a book[MASK] and you were the author how would you want your story to go that 's the question that changed my[MASK] <unk> growing up in the hot last vegas desert all i wanted was to be free <unk> i would daydream[MASK] about traveling the world <unk> living in a place where it snowed [MASK] and i would picture all of the stories that i would go on to tell [MASK] at the age of nineteen the day after i graduated[MASK] <unk> i moved to a place where it snowed[MASK] and i became a massage therapist [MASK] with this job all i needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and i could go anywhere [MASK] for the first time in my life i felt free <unk> independent[MASK] and completely[MASK] in control of my[MASK] <unk> that is until my life took a detour <unk> [MASK] i went home from work early one day with what i thought was the flu <unk> [MASK] and less than twenty four hours later i was in the hospital on life support[MASK] with less than a two percent chance of living it wasn 't until days later as i lay in a coma[MASK] that the doctors diagnosed me with[MASK] <unk> bacterial meningitis[MASK] <unk> blood infection [MASK] over the course of two and a half months[MASK] i lost my spleen my kidneys the hearing in my left ear[MASK] and both of my legs below the knee when my parents wheeled me out of the hospital[MASK] i felt like i had been pieced back[MASK] <unk> together like a patchwork doll <unk> i thought the worst was over[MASK] until weeks later when i saw my new legs for the first time the calves were[MASK] bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot[MASK] with a raised rubber line from the toe[MASK] <unk> to the ankle to look like a vein i didn 't know what to expect <unk> but i wasn 't expecting that [MASK] with my mom[MASK] by my side[MASK] and tears streaming down our faces <unk> i strapped on these chunky legs[MASK] and i stood up they were[MASK] <unk> so painful[MASK] and so confining[MASK] that all i could think was [MASK] how am i ever going to travel the world in these things <unk> [MASK] how was i ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories as i always wanted <unk> [MASK] and how was i going to snowboard again[MASK] <unk> i went home <unk> i crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months [MASK] me passed out escaping from reality <unk> with my legs resting by my side [MASK] i was absolutely[MASK] physically[MASK] and emotionally[MASK] broken <unk> [MASK] but i knew that in order to[MASK] <unk> forward <unk> i had to let go of the old amy[MASK] and learn to embrace the new amy [MASK] and that is when it dawned on me that i didn 't have to be five foot five anymore i could be as tall as i wanted[MASK] <unk> or as short as i wanted <unk> depending on who i was dating [MASK] and[MASK] if i snowboarded again <unk> my feet aren 't going to get cold [MASK] and best of all i thought <unk> i can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales[MASK] <unk> and i did so there were benefits here <unk> it was this moment that i asked myself that <unk>[MASK] <unk> question if my life were a book[MASK] and i were the author <unk> [MASK] how would i want the story to go and i began to daydream <unk> i daydreamed like i did as a little girl[MASK] and i imagined myself walking gracefully[MASK] helping other people through my journey[MASK] and snowboarding again <unk> [MASK] and i didn 't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder[MASK] <unk> i could actually feel it i could feel the wind against my face and the beat[MASK] of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment <unk> and that[MASK] <unk> is when[MASK] a new chapter in my life began <unk> [MASK] four months later i was back up on a snowboard <unk> although things didn 't go quite as expected [MASK] my knees and my ankles wouldn 't bend and at one point[MASK] i traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when[MASK] i i fell and my legs still attached to my snowboard[MASK] went flying down the mountain [MASK] and i was on top of the mountain still <unk> i was so shocked i was just as shocked as everybody else and i was[MASK] so discouraged but i knew that if i could find the right pair of feet that i would be able to do this again <unk> [MASK] and this is when i learned that our borders[MASK] <unk> and our obstacles can only do two things one stop us in our tracks[MASK] or two force us to get creative <unk> [MASK] i did a year of research <unk> still couldn 't figure out what kind of legs to use couldn 't find any resources that could help me so i decided to make a pair[MASK] <unk> my leg maker and i put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that i could snowboard in [MASK] as you can see <unk> rusted bolts <unk> rubber wood and neon pink duct tape[MASK] <unk> and yes i can change my toenail polish[MASK] <unk> it was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift i could ever receive a new kidney from my dad that allowed me to follow my dreams again[MASK] i started snowboarding <unk> [MASK] then i went back to work then i went back to school <unk> then in two thousand and five i cofounded a nonprofit organization for youth and young adults with physical disabilities so they could get involved with action sports [MASK] from there <unk> i had the opportunity to go to south africa [MASK] where i helped to put shoes on thousands of children 's feet so they could attend school <unk> [MASK] and just this past february[MASK] <unk> i won two back to back world cup gold medals [MASK] which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world[MASK] <unk> eleven years ago when i lost my legs <unk> i had no idea what to expect <unk> but if you ask me today if i would ever want to change my situation [MASK] i would have to say no [MASK] because my legs haven 't disabled me if anything they 've enabled me they 've forced me to rely on my imagination and to believe in the possibilities <unk>[MASK] <unk> and that 's why i believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for[MASK] <unk> breaking through borders because in our minds we can do anything and we can be anything [MASK] it 's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head on[MASK] that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits <unk> [MASK] and although today is about innovation[MASK] <unk> i have to say that in my life innovation has only been possible because of my borders <unk> [MASK] i 've learned that borders are where the actual ends <unk> but also where the imagination and the story begins[MASK]
