 <unk> let 's start the story one hundred and twenty years ago when american factories began to electrify their operations <unk> igniting the[MASK] <unk> the amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for thirty years <unk> [MASK] thirty years that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire [MASK] you see the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors <unk> [MASK] but they didn 't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility [MASK] it fell to the next generation to invent new work processes <unk> and then productivity soared[MASK] <unk> soared <unk> often doubling or even tripling in those factories [MASK] electricity is an example of a general purpose technology like the steam engine before it [MASK] general purpose technologies drive most economic growth <unk> because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations <unk> like lightbulbs and yes <unk> factory redesign [MASK] is there a general purpose technology of our era[MASK] <unk> sure <unk> it 's the computer <unk> [MASK] but technology alone is not enough technology is not destiny <unk> [MASK] we shape our destiny <unk> [MASK] and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories we 're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system [MASK] we 're not doing as well at that job as we should be as we 'll see in a moment productivity is[MASK] <unk> actually doing all right <unk> but it has become decoupled from jobs <unk> and the income of the typical worker[MASK] is stagnating these troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed[MASK] as the end of innovation but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and[MASK] i call[MASK] the new machine age [MASK] let 's look at some data <unk> [MASK] so here 's gdp per person in america [MASK] there 's some bumps along the way <unk> but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it [MASK] this is a log scale so what looks like steady growth is actually an acceleration in real terms <unk> and here 's productivity [MASK] you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid [MASK] <unk> but it matches up pretty well with the second industrial revolution when factories were learning how to electrify their operations <unk> after a lag productivity accelerated again [MASK] so maybe history doesn 't repeat itself <unk> but sometimes it rhymes [MASK] today productivity is at an all time high <unk> and despite the great recession <unk> it grew faster in the <unk> 2000s than it did in the[MASK] <unk> growing faster than it did during the second industrial revolution <unk> and that 's just the united states <unk> the global news[MASK] is even better worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history <unk> [MASK] if anything all these numbers actually understate our progress <unk> because[MASK] the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production it 's mind[MASK] <unk> not matter brain not brawn ideas not things [MASK] that creates a problem for standard metrics because we 're getting more and more stuff for free [MASK] like wikipedia <unk> google skype <unk> and if they post it on the web even this ted talk now getting stuff for free is a good thing right <unk> sure of[MASK] <unk> that 's not how economists measure gdp zero price[MASK] means zero weight in the gdp statistics [MASK] according to the numbers the music industry is half the size that it was ten years ago <unk> [MASK] but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever you know i bet you are too [MASK] in total my research estimates that the gdp numbers miss over three hundred billion dollars per year in free goods and[MASK] <unk> services on the internet [MASK] now let 's look to the future there are some super smart people who are arguing that we 've reached the end of growth <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] to understand the future of growth <unk> we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of[MASK] <unk> i 'm optimistic <unk> because the new machine age is digital <unk> exponential[MASK] and combinatorial <unk> when goods are digital they can be replicated with perfect quality[MASK] at nearly zero cost <unk> and they can be delivered[MASK] almost instantaneously <unk> welcome to the economics of abundance <unk> [MASK] but there 's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world measurement[MASK] is the lifeblood of science[MASK] and progress in the age of big data <unk> we can measure the world in ways we never could before <unk> [MASK] secondly the new machine age is exponential [MASK] computers get better faster than anything else ever a child 's playstation[MASK] <unk> but our brains are wired for a linear world as a result exponential trends take us by surprise [MASK] i used to teach my students that there are some things you know computers just aren 't good at like driving a car through traffic [MASK] that 's right <unk> here 's andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down route one hundred and one in yes a driverless car[MASK] thirdly the new machine age is combinatorial <unk> the stagnationist view is that ideas get used up like low hanging fruit <unk> [MASK] but the reality[MASK] is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations <unk> here 's an example [MASK] in just a matter of a few weeks an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached one point three million users[MASK] <unk> users [MASK] he was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of facebook <unk> and facebook was built on top of the web <unk> and that was built on top of the internet and so on and so forth [MASK] now individually digital <unk> [MASK] exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers put them together <unk> and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing[MASK] <unk> like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound you know[MASK] robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation [MASK] laughter but perhaps the most important invention the most important invention[MASK] is[MASK] machine learning <unk> [MASK] consider one project ibm 's watson these little dots here those are all the champions on the quiz show[MASK] <unk> jeopardy at first watson wasn 't very good <unk> [MASK] but it improved at a rate faster than any human could and shortly after dave ferrucci showed this chart to my class at mit watson beat the world jeopardy champion [MASK] at age seven <unk> watson is still kind of in its[MASK] <unk> its teachers let it surf the internet[MASK] unsupervised the next day it started answering questions with profanities <unk> [MASK] damn [MASK] but you know watson is growing up fast it 's being tested for jobs in call centers <unk> and it 's getting them <unk> [MASK] it 's applying for legal banking and medical jobs <unk> and getting some of them <unk> [MASK] isn 't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent[MASK] <unk> machines perhaps the most important invention in human history some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating <unk> [MASK] like the first two industrial revolutions <unk> [MASK] the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out <unk> [MASK] but they are staggering <unk> [MASK] so does that mean we have nothing to worry about [MASK] no technology is[MASK] <unk> not destiny <unk> [MASK] productivity is at an all time high <unk> but fewer people now have jobs <unk> [MASK] we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever <unk> but for a majority of americans their income has fallen <unk> [MASK] this is the great decoupling[MASK] of productivity from employment of[MASK] <unk> not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling but like too many others they misunderstand its basic causes [MASK] technology is racing ahead <unk> but it 's leaving more and more people[MASK] behind today <unk> we can take a routine job codify it in a set of machine readable instructions[MASK] <unk> and then replicate it a million times you know[MASK] i recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics [MASK] this guy says [MASK] nah <unk> i don 't use h & r block anymore turbotax does everything that my tax preparer did but it 's faster <unk> cheaper and more accurate [MASK] how can a skilled worker compete with a $ thirty nine piece of software she can 't [MASK] <unk> millions of americans do have faster <unk> cheaper more accurate tax preparation <unk> and the founders of intuit have done very well for themselves <unk> [MASK] but seventeen percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs [MASK] that is a microcosm of what 's happening not just in software and services [MASK] but in media and music in finance and manufacturing in retailing and trade in short [MASK] in every industry [MASK] people are racing against the[MASK] <unk> machine <unk> and many of them are losing that race what can we do to create shared prosperity <unk> [MASK] the answer is not to try to slow down technology [MASK] instead of racing against the machine we need to learn to race with the machine that is our grand challenge [MASK] the new machine age[MASK] can be dated to a day fifteen years[MASK] <unk> ago when garry kasparov the world chess champion <unk> played deep blue a supercomputer [MASK] the machine won that day <unk> and today a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster <unk> [MASK] it got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a[MASK] <unk> but today a computer is no longer the world chess champion <unk> [MASK] neither is a human because kasparov organized a freestyle tournament[MASK] where teams of humans and computers could work together <unk> and the winning team had no grandmaster <unk> and it had no supercomputer[MASK] what they had[MASK] was better teamwork <unk> and they showed[MASK] that a team of humans and computers working together could beat any computer[MASK] or any human working alone racing with the machine[MASK] beats racing against the machine <unk> technology is not destiny <unk> we shape our destiny[MASK]
