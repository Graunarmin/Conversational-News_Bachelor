<unk>[MASK] <unk> intriguing features about mars the national academy of science says one of the ten major mysteries of the[MASK] <unk> on mars where for some reason we don 't understand why at this point the surface is very very highly magnetized [MASK] is there water on mars <unk> the answer is no there is no liquid water on the surface of mars today [MASK] but there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water[MASK] <unk> today mars is very very dry we believe there 's some water[MASK] in the polar caps there are polar caps of north pole and south pole here are some recent images this is from[MASK] spirit and opportunity these images that show at one time there was very fast flowing water on the surface of mars <unk> why is water important [MASK] water is important because if you want life you have to have water[MASK] <unk> water is the[MASK] key ingredient in the evolution the origin of life on a planet <unk> [MASK] here is some picture of antarctica and a picture of olympus mons <unk> very similar features glaciers <unk> so this is frozen water this is ice water on mars <unk> [MASK] this is my favorite picture this[MASK] <unk> just taken a few weeks ago it has not been seen publicly <unk> this is european space agency mars express <unk> image of a crater on mars and in the middle of the

years ago mars[MASK] <unk> mars had rivers mars had lakes but more important mars had[MASK] we believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere <unk> and this area in blue which shows a depression of about four miles was the ancient ocean area on the surface of mars <unk> [MASK] where did the ocean 's worth of water on mars go[MASK] <unk> we have an idea <unk> this is a measurement

intriguing and puzzling measurement in my opinion <unk> we 've obtained of mars <unk> was released earlier this year in the[MASK] magazine science and what we 're looking at is the presence of the gas methane[MASK] in the atmosphere of mars <unk> and you can see there are three distinct regions of methane why is methane important[MASK] <unk> because on earth <unk> almost all ninety nine point nine percent of the methane is produced by living systems not little green men <unk> [MASK] but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface <unk> we now have evidence that methane is in the

from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on mars in fact [MASK] the earth and mars are both four point six billion years old [MASK] the oldest rock on earth is only three point six billion the reason there[MASK] gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics the crust of the earth has been recycled we have no geological record prior for the first billion years [MASK] that record exists on mars and this terrain that we 're looking at[MASK] dates back to four point six billion[MASK] <unk> this is a map that shows where we 've put our spacecraft

hemisphere that 's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient[MASK] ocean basin there aren 't many craters <unk> and that 's because the water protected the the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites[MASK] but look in the southern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere there are impact craters there are volcanic craters <unk> here 's hellas basin[MASK] <unk> a very very different place geologically look where the methane is the methane is in a very rough terrain area <unk> [MASK] what is the best way to unravel the mysteries on mars that exist <unk> we asked this question[MASK] ten years ago <unk> we invited ten of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two[MASK] <unk> days we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered <unk> [MASK] and we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question and the result of our meeting[MASK] was a robotic[MASK] <unk> there 's a model of ares here this is a 20 percent scale model this airplane was designed at the langley research center if any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on mars <unk> it 's the langley research center [MASK] for almost one hundred years a leading center of aeronautics in the world <unk> [MASK] we fly about a mile above the surface <unk> we cover hundreds of miles[MASK] <unk> and we fly about four hundred and fifty

will fly where the methane is we will have instruments aboard the plane[MASK] <unk> that will sample every three minutes the atmosphere of mars <unk> we will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems <unk> we will pinpoint <unk>[MASK] where these gases emanate from because we can measure the gradient where it comes from [MASK] in two words very carefully <unk> [MASK] the problem is we don 't fly it to mars <unk> we put it in a spacecraft[MASK] and we send it to mars <unk> the problem is the spacecraft 's largest diameter is nine feet[MASK] we fold it <unk> [MASK] and we transport it in a spacecraft [MASK] and we have it in something called an aeroshell <unk> this is how we do it <unk> and we have a little video that describes the sequence[MASK] <unk> taking nine
