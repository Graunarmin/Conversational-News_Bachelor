 <unk> and my father smiled and said well you know what that means don 't you [MASK] and i said <unk> yeah <unk> that i 'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents [MASK] and my dad said well yes [MASK] but more importantly being seven means that you 've reached the age of reason and you 're now capable of committing any and all sins against god and man[MASK] <unk> age of reason before sister mary kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school <unk> but when she said it the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession [MASK] and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil [MASK] and anyway <unk> i hadn 't really paid all that much attention to that phrase age of reason[MASK] <unk> we believe in the catholic church that god knows that little kids don 't know the difference between right and wrong <unk> but when you 're seven you 're old enough to know better so you 've grown up and reached the age <unk>[MASK] <unk> of reason <unk> and now god will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record[MASK] <unk> time up till today all that time i was so good god didn 't notice it and my mom said well i noticed it and[MASK] i thought how could i not have known this before how could it not have sunk in when they 'd been telling me all that being good and no real credit for it [MASK] and worst of all how could i not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me[MASK] <unk> so i said well <unk> mom and dad what about santa claus <unk> i mean santa claus knows if you 're naughty or nice right and my dad said yeah [MASK] but honey i think that 's technically just between thanksgiving and christmas [MASK] and my mother said oh bob stop it let 's just tell her i mean she 's seven <unk> julie <unk> there is no santa claus[MASK] <unk> that upsetting to me my parents had this whole elaborate story about santa claus how they had talked to santa claus himself and agreed that instead of santa delivering our presents over the night of christmas eve like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing christmas morning [MASK] our family would give santa more time [MASK] santa would come to our house while we were at nine o 'clock high mass on christmas morning but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss <unk> which made me[MASK] <unk> very suspicious it[MASK] was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents presents <unk> i mean my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother 's handwriting was so close to santa 's plus why[MASK] would santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he 'd gone to everybody else 's there was only one obvious[MASK] conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence [MASK] our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly but let 's face it he was also very judgmental [MASK] so to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief [MASK] i left the kitchen not really in shock about santa <unk> but rather i was just dumbfounded about how i could have missed this whole age of reason thing[MASK] <unk> late for me but[MASK] maybe i could help someone else someone who could use the information they[MASK] had to fit two criteria they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason <unk> and not yet seven <unk> [MASK] the answer was clear my brother bill he was six [MASK] well i finally found bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground it was a saturday and he was all by himself just kicking a ball against the side of a wall[MASK] <unk> i ran up to him and said bill <unk> [MASK] i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven <unk> and then you 're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man and bill said so and i said <unk>[MASK] so you 're six you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won 't notice it [MASK] <unk> i was so angry with him <unk> but when i got to the top of the steps i turned around dramatically and said oh by the way bill there is no santa claus [MASK] now <unk> i didn 't know it at the time but i really wasn 't turning seven on september 10th [MASK] for my 13th birthday i planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother[MASK] <unk> i told them that your birthday was september 10th and then i wasn 't sure[MASK] <unk> just going to go blab it all over the place so i started to tell you your birthday was september 10th but[MASK] julie you were so ready to start school honey you were so ready [MASK] i thought about it and when i was four i was already the oldest of four children and my mother even had another child to come so what i think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready she was so ready <unk> [MASK] then she said don 't worry julie every year on october 10th[MASK] when it was your birthday but you didn 't realize it <unk> i made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day [MASK] which was comforting but troubling my mother had been celebrating my birthday with me <unk> without me [MASK] what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that i had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends what was most upsetting was that this meant i was not a virgo i had a huge virgo poster in my bedroom[MASK] <unk> and i read my horoscope every single day and it was so totally me [MASK] and this meant that i was a libra <unk> [MASK] so i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster <unk> [MASK] the virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair sort of lounging by some water <unk> but the libra poster is just a huge[MASK] <unk> this was around the time that i started filling out physically and i was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed[MASK] ominous and depressing [MASK] but i got the new libra poster and i started to read my new libra horoscope [MASK] and i was astonished to find that it was also[MASK] <unk> it wasn 't until years later looking back on this whole[MASK] thing that it dawned on me <unk> i wasn 't turning seven when i thought i turned seven i had a whole other month to do anything i wanted to before god started keeping tabs on me <unk> [MASK] oh life can be so cruel [MASK] one day two mormon missionaries came to my door now i just live[MASK] <unk> off a main thoroughfare in los angeles and my block[MASK] is well it 's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door [MASK] sometimes i get little old ladies from the seventh day adventist church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven and sometimes i get teenagers who promise me that they won 't join a gang and just start robbing people if i only buy some magazine subscriptions from them [MASK] so normally i just ignore the doorbell but on this day i answered and there stood two boys each about nineteen in white[MASK] and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints <unk> [MASK] and they said they had a message for me <unk> from god [MASK] i said a message for me <unk> from god and they said yes [MASK] now i was raised in the pacific northwest around a lot of church of latter day saints people and you know i 've worked with them and even dated them but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said[MASK] <unk> to people when they were out on a mission and i guess i was sort of curious so i said [MASK] well please come in and they looked really happy because i don 't think this happens to them all that often [MASK] and i sat them down and i got them glasses of water[MASK] <unk> i got it <unk> i got them glasses of water don 't touch my hair that 's the thing you can 't put[MASK] a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair ok [MASK] laughter so i sat them down and i got them glasses of water and after niceties they said do you believe that god loves you with all his heart[MASK] and i thought well of course i believe in god but[MASK] you know i don 't like that word ' heart ' because it anthropomorphizes god and[MASK] i don 't like the word ' his ' either because that[MASK] sexualizes god but i didn 't want to argue semantics with these boys so after a very long uncomfortable pause i said [MASK] <unk> i feel very loved and they looked at each other and smiled like that was the right answer <unk> [MASK] and then they said do you believe that we 're all brothers and sisters on this planet and i said yes i do and i was so relieved that it was a question i could answer so quickly <unk> [MASK] and they said well <unk> then we have a story to tell you [MASK] and they told me this story all about this guy named lehi who lived in jerusalem in six hundred[MASK] <unk> apparently in jerusalem in six hundred bc everyone was completely bad and evil every single one of them man woman child infant fetus <unk> [MASK] and god came to lehi and said to him put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here [MASK] and god did lead them he led them to america <unk> [MASK] i said america [MASK] from jerusalem to america by boat[MASK] <unk> told me how lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced and over the course of six hundred years there were two great races of them the nephites and the lamanites and the nephites were totally totally good <unk>[MASK] each and every one of them and the lamanites were totally bad and evil every single one of them just bad to the bone [MASK] <unk> and he told them that that if they all remained totally totally good each and every one of them they would win the war against the evil lamanites <unk> [MASK] but apparently somebody blew it <unk> because the lamanites were able to kill all the nephites all but one guy this guy named mormon who managed to survive by hiding in the woods <unk> [MASK] and he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold[MASK] <unk> plates <unk> which he then buried near palmyra new york [MASK] well i was just on the edge of my seat [MASK] i said <unk> <unk> what happened to the lamanites and they said well they became our native[MASK] <unk> you believe the native americans are descended from a people who were totally evil and they said <unk> yes then they told me how this guy named joseph smith[MASK] found those buried gold plates right in his backyard <unk> and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed egyptian[MASK] <unk> this point i just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch [MASK] i wanted to say [MASK] ok don 't start with this story [MASK] i mean <unk> even the scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start [MASK] telling people all about xenu [MASK] <unk> do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets and i said no i don 't [MASK] because i was sort of upset about this lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story <unk> but the truth was i hadn 't really thought this through so i backpedaled a little and i said well <unk> what exactly do you mean by ' righteous ' [MASK] and what do you mean by prophets like could the prophets be women and they said[MASK] <unk> gave women a gift that is so spectacular <unk> it is so wonderful that the only gift he had left over to give men[MASK] was the gift of prophecy [MASK] what is this wonderful gift god gave women i wondered maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt [MASK] women 's longer lifespan <unk> the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men but no it wasn 't any of these gifts[MASK] they said well it 's her ability to bear children [MASK] i said oh come on i mean <unk> even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were fifteen to the time they were[MASK] forty five assuming they didn 't die from exhaustion <unk> it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god and they said[MASK] <unk> they had more to say [MASK] they said well we also believe that if you 're a mormon and if you 're in good standing with the church when you die <unk> you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity [MASK] and i said <unk> oh dear [MASK] <unk> we also believe that when you go to heaven <unk> you get your body restored to you in its best original state like <unk> if you 'd lost a leg well you get it back or if you 'd gone blind you could see [MASK] i said <unk> oh <unk> now <unk> i don 't have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago so does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my[MASK] <unk> i 'm happy without it gosh what if you had a nose job and you liked it would[MASK] god force you to get your old nose[MASK] back then they gave me this book of mormon told me to read this chapter and that chapter and said they 'd come back and check in on me and i think i said something like please[MASK] <unk> and they were gone <unk> [MASK] ok so i initially felt really superior to these boys <unk> and smug in my more conventional faith but[MASK] then the more i thought about it the more i had to be honest with myself if someone came to my door and i was hearing catholic theology and dogma for the very first time <unk> and they said we believe that <unk>[MASK] <unk> god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us[MASK] that 's the son of god i mean i would think that 's equally ridiculous i 'm just so used to that story[MASK] <unk> loves you with all his heart[MASK]
