 <unk> in kenya people cross oceans[MASK] to go see them these people are tall they jump high <unk> they wear red <unk> and they kill lions[MASK] <unk> might be wondering who are these people these are the[MASK] maasais and you know what 's cool <unk> i 'm actually one of them [MASK] the maasais <unk> the boys are brought up to be warriors the girls are brought up to be mothers when i was[MASK] five years old <unk> i found out that i was engaged[MASK] to be married as soon as i reached puberty [MASK] my mother my grandmother [MASK] my aunties they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by [MASK] cool yeah and[MASK] everything i had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman[MASK] at age twelve my day started at five[MASK] <unk> in the morning <unk> milking the cows sweeping the house cooking for my siblings collecting water <unk> firewood <unk> [MASK] i did everything that i needed to do[MASK] to become a perfect wife i went to school not because the maasais <unk> ' women or girls were going to[MASK] <unk> 's because my mother was denied an education [MASK] and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living [MASK] why did she say that my father worked as a policeman[MASK] in the city he came home once a year <unk> we didn 't see him for sometimes even two years [MASK] and whenever he came home <unk> it was a different case my mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat[MASK] <unk> she reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us <unk> [MASK] but when my father came he would sell the cows he would sell the the products we had and he went and drank with his friends in[MASK] in the bars <unk> because my mother was a woman she was not allowed to own any property <unk> and by default everything in my family[MASK] <unk> belongs to my father so he had the right <unk> and if my mother ever questioned him he beat her abused her and really[MASK] it was difficult [MASK] when i went to school <unk> i had a dream <unk> i wanted to become a teacher <unk> [MASK] teachers looked nice <unk> they wear nice dresses high heeled shoes i found out later that they are uncomfortable but i admired it[MASK] <unk> most of all the teacher was just writing on the board[MASK] not hard work that 's what i thought[MASK] <unk> compared to what i was doing in the farm <unk> so i wanted to become a teacher <unk> i worked hard in school <unk> but when i was in eighth grade <unk> [MASK] it was a determining factor in our tradition there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become[MASK] <unk> and it 's a rite of passage to womanhood <unk> [MASK] and then i was just finishing my eighth grade <unk> and that was a transition for me to go to high school <unk> this was the crossroad [MASK] once i go through this tradition <unk> i was going to become a wife [MASK] well <unk> my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass <unk> so i talked[MASK] i had to come up with a plan to figure these things out i talked to my father i did something that most girls have never done[MASK] <unk> i told my father i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school [MASK] the reason why if i ran away <unk> my father will have a stigma [MASK] people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn 't go through the ceremony it was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life <unk> so he figured out[MASK] <unk> i did the ceremony happened <unk> it 's a whole week long of excitement[MASK] <unk> it 's a ceremony people are enjoying it [MASK] and the day before the actual ceremony happens we were dancing having excitement <unk> and through all the night we we did not sleep <unk> [MASK] the actual day came <unk> [MASK] and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in yes we danced and danced we walked out to the courtyard[MASK] and there were a bunch of people waiting <unk> they were all in a circle <unk> [MASK] and as we danced and danced and we approached this circle of women men women children everybody was there [MASK] there was a woman sitting in the middle of it <unk> [MASK] and this woman was waiting to hold us [MASK] <unk> were my sisters and a couple of other girls <unk> and as i approached her <unk> [MASK] she looked at me and i sat down <unk> [MASK] and i sat down <unk> and i opened my legs <unk> [MASK] as i opened my leg <unk> another woman came <unk> and this woman was carrying a knife <unk> [MASK] and as she carried the knife <unk> she walked toward me and she held the clitoris <unk> and[MASK] <unk> it off [MASK] as you can imagine <unk> i bled <unk> i bled after bleeding for a while i fainted thereafter <unk> [MASK] it 's something that so many girls i 'm lucky i never died but many die <unk> [MASK] it 's practiced <unk> it 's no anesthesia it 's a rusty old knife <unk> [MASK] and it was difficult <unk> i was lucky because one also[MASK] <unk> mom did something that most women don 't do [MASK] three days later after everybody has left the home my mom went and brought a nurse we were taken care of three weeks later <unk> i was healed and i was back in high school <unk> [MASK] i was so determined[MASK] to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference[MASK] <unk> while i was in high school <unk> something happened <unk> [MASK] i met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the university of oregon this man was wearing a white t shirt jeans[MASK] <unk> camera[MASK] <unk> white sneakers and i 'm talking about white sneakers there is something about clothes i think and shoes[MASK] they were sneakers[MASK] <unk> that doesn 't even have paved roads it was quite attractive <unk> [MASK] i told him [MASK] well i want to go to where you are because this man looked very happy <unk> [MASK] and i admired that <unk> [MASK] and he told me well what do you[MASK] mean you want to go don 't you have a husband waiting for you and i told him don 't worry about that part just tell me how to get there[MASK] <unk> while i was in high school also my dad was sick he got a stroke <unk> and he was really really sick so he really couldn 't tell me what to do next <unk> [MASK] but the problem is my father is not the only father i have [MASK] everybody who is my dad 's age male in the community is my father by default my uncles all of them and they dictate what my future is [MASK] so the news came <unk> i applied[MASK] <unk> to school and i was accepted to randolph macon woman 's college in lynchburg virginia <unk> and i couldn 't come[MASK] without the support of the village because i needed to raise money to buy the air ticket i got a scholarship but i needed to get myself here <unk> [MASK] but i needed the support of the village <unk> [MASK] and here again when the men heard and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school[MASK] <unk> they said what a lost opportunity this should have been given to a boy <unk> we can 't do this [MASK] so i went back and i had to go back to the tradition <unk> [MASK] there 's a belief among our people that[MASK] morning brings good news so i had to come up with something to do with the morning <unk> because there 's good news in[MASK] <unk> if he says yes everybody will follow him <unk> so i went to him very early in the morning as the sun rose the first thing he sees when he[MASK] opens his door is <unk> it 's me [MASK] my child what are you doing here well dad i need help can you support me to go to america [MASK] i promised him that i would be the best girl <unk> i will come back [MASK] anything they wanted after that i will do it for[MASK] he said well but i can 't do it alone he gave me a list of another[MASK] fifteen men that i went sixteen more men every single morning i went and visited them they all came together [MASK] the village the women the men everybody came together to support me[MASK] to come to get an education <unk> i arrived in america as you can imagine what did i find <unk> i found snow[MASK] i found wal marts vacuum cleaners <unk> [MASK] and lots of food in the cafeteria i was in a land of plenty <unk> [MASK]

promised you that i would come back and help you [MASK] what do you need as i spoke to the women they told me you know what we need we really need a school for[MASK] <unk> because there had not been

before she got married <unk> the mother is blamed for that and she 's punished she 's beaten they said we wanted to put our girls in a safe place [MASK] as we moved <unk> and i went to talk to the
