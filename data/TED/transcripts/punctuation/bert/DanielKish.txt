 <unk> i was born with bilateral retinoblastoma <unk> retinal[MASK] <unk> right eye was removed[MASK] at seven months of age <unk> i was thirteen months when they removed my left eye the first thing i did[MASK] upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care[MASK] <unk> wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes the problem[MASK] was getting caught <unk> it 's impressions about blindness[MASK] that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself[MASK] think for a moment about your own impressions[MASK] of blindness think about your reactions when i first came onto the stage <unk> [MASK] or the prospect of your own blindness or a loved one going blind [MASK] the terror is incomprehensible[MASK] to most of us because blindness[MASK] is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness hapless exposure[MASK] to the ravages of the dark unknown <unk> how poetic[MASK] <unk> fortunately for me my parents were not poetic they were[MASK] <unk> they understood[MASK] that ignorance and fear[MASK] were but matters of the mind and the mind is adaptable they[MASK] believed that i should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities[MASK] as everyone else in their own words i would move out[MASK] which i did when i was eighteen[MASK] i will pay taxes[MASK] thanks[MASK] and they knew the difference between love and fear fear immobilizes <unk>[MASK] <unk> us in the face of challenge <unk> they knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge <unk> i was not raised with fear <unk> [MASK] now <unk> moving forward <unk> how do i manage today [MASK] the world is a much larger nursery <unk> [MASK] fortunately i have my trusty long cane <unk> [MASK] longer than the canes used by most blind people i call it my freedom staff [MASK] it will keep me[MASK] <unk> undignified departure from the stage i do see that cliff edge <unk> [MASK] they warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage <unk> i don 't care to set a new precedent[MASK] <unk> but beyond that many of you may have heard me clicking as i came[MASK] <unk> those are flashes of sound[MASK] that go out[MASK] and reflect from surfaces all around me <unk> just like a bat 's sonar <unk> and return to me with patterns with pieces of information <unk> [MASK] much as light does for you and my brain <unk> thanks to my parents[MASK] <unk> to form images in my visual cortex which we now call the imaging system from those patterns of information much as your brain does <unk> [MASK] i call this process flash sonar[MASK] <unk> it is how i have learned to see through my blindness to navigate my journey[MASK] through the dark unknowns of my own challenges[MASK] <unk> which has earned me the moniker the remarkable batman now batman[MASK] i will accept <unk> bats are cool <unk> [MASK] batman is cool <unk> but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable[MASK] <unk> i have always regarded myself much like anyone else who[MASK] <unk> navigates[MASK] the dark unknowns of their own challenges is that so[MASK] remarkable <unk> i do not use my eyes <unk> i use my brain <unk> [MASK] now <unk> someone <unk> somewhere <unk> must think that 's remarkable or i wouldn 't be up here but[MASK] let 's consider this for a moment[MASK] <unk> who faces or who has ever faced a challenge <unk> raise your hands [MASK] whoosh okay <unk> lots of hands going up a moment let me do a head count [MASK] this will take a while okay [MASK] lots of hands in the air keep[MASK] <unk> have an idea those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges <unk> put your hands down <unk> [MASK] okay anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own [MASK] so we all face challenges and we all face the[MASK] <unk> which is endemic to most challenges which is what what most of us fear <unk> okay <unk> but we all have brains[MASK] that allow us that activate to allow us to navigate[MASK] the journey through these challenges[MASK] <unk> wouldn 't[MASK] tell me[MASK] where the lectern was so you can 't trust those ted folks [MASK] find it yourself they said so [MASK] and the feedback for the p a system is no help at all so[MASK] <unk> now i present to you a challenge <unk> so if you 'd all close your eyes for just a moment okay and[MASK] you 're going to learn a bit of flash sonar <unk> i 'm going to make a sound [MASK] i 'm going to hold this panel in front of me but i 'm not going to move it just listen to the sound for a moment[MASK] <unk> nothing very interesting now <unk> listen to what happens to that same exact sound when i move the panel <unk>[MASK] you do not know the power of the dark side[MASK] <unk> now keep your eyes closed[MASK] because did you hear the difference <unk> okay <unk> now <unk> let 's be sure for your challenge <unk> [MASK] you tell me <unk> just say now when you hear[MASK] the panel start to move okay we 'll relax into this[MASK] <unk> open your eyes all right so[MASK] just a few centimeters you would notice the difference you 've experienced sonar [MASK] you 'd all make great blind people [MASK] let 's have a look at what can happen[MASK] when this activation[MASK] <unk> see with your eyes and we can see with our ears brian bushway it 's not a matter of enjoying it more or less[MASK] <unk> wouldn 't go back to being sighted jr the bigger the goal the more obstacles you 'll face and on the other side of that goal is victory[MASK] <unk> these people look terrified not so much we have[MASK] delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly forty countries when[MASK] <unk> blind people learn to see sighted people seem inspired[MASK] to want to learn to see their way better more clearly with less fear [MASK] because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all[MASK] to navigate any type of challenge through any form[MASK] of darkness to discoveries unimagined[MASK] when we are activated i wish you all[MASK] a most activating journey[MASK] <unk> spectacular standing ovation at ted thank you for an extraordinary talk[MASK] <unk> just one more question about your world your inner world that you construct we think[MASK] that we have things in our world[MASK] <unk> you as a blind person don 't have but what 's your world like what do you have that we don 't have [MASK] dk three hundred and sixty degree view[MASK] so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me <unk> it works around corners <unk> it works through surfaces [MASK] generally it 's kind of a fuzzy <unk> three dimensional geometry one of[MASK] an instructor when he lost his vision <unk> [MASK] after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house conversations [MASK] people in the kitchen people in the bathroom <unk> several floors away several walls away he said it was something like having <unk> x ray vision ca [MASK] what do you picture that you 're[MASK] <unk> a sound when they laugh when they fidget <unk> when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever <unk> i hear everything i hear every little movement that every single person makes none of it really escapes my attention <unk> [MASK] <unk> from a sonar perspective the size of the room the[MASK] curvature of the audience around the stage <unk> it 's the height[MASK] of the room [MASK] like i say it 's all that kind of three dimensional surface geometry all around me ca well daniel you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way[MASK]
