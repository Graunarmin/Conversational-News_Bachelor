 <unk> well after many years working in trade and economics four years ago i found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability <unk> [MASK] and i found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can 't even obtain a meal[MASK] this red cup comes from rwanda from a child named fabian <unk> [MASK] and i carry this around as a symbol really of the challenge and also the hope <unk> [MASK] because one cup of food a day changes fabian 's life completely <unk> [MASK] but what i 'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning about a billion people on earth[MASK] or one out[MASK] <unk> of every seven woke up and didn 't even know how to fill this cup one out of every seven people [MASK] first i 'll ask you why should you care why should we care for most people [MASK] if they think about hunger they don 't have to go far back on their own family[MASK] <unk> maybe in their own lives or their parents ' lives or their grandparents ' lives[MASK] to remember an experience of hunger <unk> [MASK] i rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience some are driven by compassion <unk> feel it 's perhaps[MASK] one of the fundamental acts of humanity as gandhi said to a hungry man a piece of bread is the face of god [MASK] others worry about peace and security <unk> stability in the world[MASK] <unk> the food riots in two thousand and eight after what i call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight <unk> [MASK] the destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history <unk> one of the most fundamental[MASK] acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food <unk> others think about malthusian nightmares will we be able to feed[MASK] a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades <unk> [MASK] this is not a negotiable thing hunger people have to eat there 's going to be a lot of people this is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain <unk> [MASK] but i actually came to this issue in a different way this[MASK] is a picture[MASK] <unk> i was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her[MASK] when an image very similar to this came[MASK] on the television <unk> [MASK] and this was yet another famine in ethiopia one two years earlier had killed more than a million people [MASK] but it never struck me as it did that moment because on that image was a woman trying to nurse[MASK] <unk> nurse her baby and she had no[MASK] milk[MASK] to nurse <unk> and the baby 's cry really penetrated me as a mother <unk> [MASK] and i thought there 's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned[MASK] with food the most fundamental expectation of every human being <unk> and it was at that moment that i just was filled with[MASK] <unk> with[MASK] the challenge[MASK] and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem this isn 't one of those rare diseases that we don 't have the solution for [MASK] we know how to fix hunger a hundred years ago we didn 't we actually have the technology and systems <unk> [MASK] and i was just struck[MASK] that this is out of place at our time in history[MASK] <unk> these images are out of place well guess what <unk> this is last week in northern kenya <unk> [MASK] yet again the face of starvation[MASK] at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day [MASK] in fact what we know now[MASK] is that every ten seconds[MASK] <unk> we lose a child to hunger <unk> this is more[MASK] than hiv aids <unk> malaria and tuberculosis combined <unk> and we know[MASK] that the issue is not just production of food one of my mentors in life was norman borlaug my hero <unk> [MASK] but today i 'm going to talk about access to food because actually[MASK] this year and[MASK] <unk> last year and during the two thousand and eight food crisis there was enough food on earth for everyone to have two thousand seven hundred kilocalories so why is it[MASK] that we have a billion people who can 't find food <unk> [MASK] and i also want to talk about what i call our new burden of knowledge in two thousand and eight <unk> [MASK] <unk> lancet compiled all the research[MASK] and put forward the compelling evidence[MASK] that if a child in its first thousand days from conception[MASK] to two years old does not have adequate nutrition <unk> [MASK] the damage is irreversible their brains and bodies will be stunted <unk> and here you see a brain scan[MASK] of two children one who had adequate nutrition another neglected and who was deeply malnourished[MASK] <unk> and we can see brain volumes up to forty percent less[MASK] in these children and in this slide you see the neurons[MASK] and the synapses of the brain don 't form <unk> and what we know now is this has huge impact on economies which i 'll talk about later <unk> but also the earning potential of these children is cut in half[MASK] in their lifetime due[MASK] <unk> to the stunting that happens in early years [MASK] so this burden of knowledge drives me because actually we know how to fix it very simply <unk> [MASK] and yet in many places a third of the children by the time they 're three[MASK] already are facing a life of[MASK] <unk> due to this i 'd like to talk about some of the things i 've seen on the front lines of hunger <unk> some of the things i 've learned[MASK] in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector i[MASK] 'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is well first i 'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on earth breastfeeding <unk> [MASK] you may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every[MASK] <unk> if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life <unk> [MASK] but in niger for example less than seven percent of the children are breastfed[MASK] for the first six months of life exclusively in mauritania less than three percent <unk> [MASK] this is something that can be transformed with knowledge this message this word[MASK] <unk> can come out that this is not an old fashioned way of doing business it 's a brilliant way[MASK] of saving your child 's life <unk> and so today we focus on not just passing out food but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment [MASK] and teaching them about breastfeeding <unk> [MASK] the second thing i 'd like to talk about if you were living in a remote[MASK] <unk> your child was limp [MASK] and you were in a drought or you were in floods or you were in a situation where there wasn 't adequate diversity of diet what would you do do you think you could go to the store[MASK] and get a choice of power bars like we can [MASK] and pick the right one to match <unk> well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count <unk> and i go to those[MASK] <unk> if there are any or out to the fields to see what they can get and they cannot obtain the nutrition [MASK] even if they know what they need to do it 's not available and i 'm very excited about this because one thing[MASK] we 're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops <unk> [MASK] and this[MASK] is made with chickpeas dried milk and a host of vitamins[MASK] <unk> matched to exactly what the brain needs it costs seventeen cents for us to produce this[MASK] as what i call food for humanity <unk> we did this with food technologists in india and pakistan[MASK] really about three of them but this is transforming ninety nine percent of the kids who get this one package seventeen cents a day[MASK] their malnutrition is overcome[MASK] <unk> so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods <unk>[MASK] and this is climate proof it doesn 't need to be refrigerated it doesn 't need water which is often lacking <unk> [MASK] <unk> the next thing i want to talk about is school feeding eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net <unk> when disaster strikes[MASK] the economy gets blown people lose a job <unk> floods war conflict bad governance all of those things there is nothing to fall back on and usually the[MASK] <unk> other things do not have the resources to provide a safety net <unk> [MASK] what we have found working with the world bank is that the poor man 's safety net the best investment is school feeding <unk> and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers you have a transformative effect [MASK] many kids in the world can 't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal but when that food is there it[MASK] 's transformative it costs less than[MASK] <unk> day to change a kid 's life <unk> but what is most amazing is the effect on girls in countries where girls don 't go to school[MASK] and you offer a meal to girls in school <unk> we see enrollment rates about fifty percent girls and boys <unk> we see a transformation in attendance by girls and there was no argument <unk> [MASK] because it 's incentive [MASK] families need the help <unk> and we find[MASK] <unk> that if we keep girls in school later they 'll stay in school until they 're sixteen and won 't get married if there 's food in school [MASK] or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week it costs about fifty cents will keep a girl in school and they 'll give birth to a healthier child because the malnutrition is[MASK] sent generation to generation we know that there 's boom and bust cycles of[MASK] <unk> hunger we know this right now on the horn of africa we 've been through this before <unk> so is this a hopeless cause <unk> absolutely not i 'd[MASK] like to talk about what i call our warehouses for hope <unk> cameroon northern cameroon boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades food aid coming in[MASK] every year when people are starving during the lean seasons[MASK] <unk> well two years ago <unk> [MASK] we decided let 's transform the model of fighting hunger and instead of giving out the food aid we put it into food banks and we said listen during the lean season take the food out [MASK] you manage the village manages these warehouses [MASK] and during harvest put it back with interest food interest[MASK] <unk> so add in five percent ten percent more food [MASK] for the past two years <unk> five hundred of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid they 're self sufficient and the food banks are growing and they 're starting school <unk>[MASK] <unk> feeding programs for their children by the people in the village but they 've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources [MASK] <unk> and simple ideas can transform[MASK] the face not of small areas of big areas of the world <unk> [MASK] i 'd like to talk about what i call digital food <unk> [MASK] technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine amartya sen won his nobel prize for saying guess what famines happen in the presence of food[MASK] <unk> because people have no ability to buy it we certainly saw that in two thousand and eight we 're seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up two hundred and forty percent in some areas over last year [MASK] food can be there and people can 't buy it well this picture i was in hebron in a small shop this shop where instead of bringing in food <unk>[MASK] <unk> the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items they have to be nutritious <unk> [MASK] and they have to be locally produced <unk> and what 's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry where this card 's used[MASK] for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus[MASK] the dairy industry has gone up thirty percent <unk> the shopkeepers are hiring more people it is a[MASK] win win win situation that starts[MASK] the food economy moving <unk> we now deliver food in over thirty countries over cell phones <unk> [MASK] transforming even the the presence of refugees refugees in countries and other ways [MASK] perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill[MASK] <unk> howard buffett and others have supported boldly <unk> [MASK] which is to ask the question what if instead of looking at the hungry as victims and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food[MASK] or sell food to even support their own families what if[MASK] we view them as the solution as the value chain to fight hunger what if[MASK] from the women in africa who cannot sell any food there 's no roads there 's no warehouses there 's not[MASK] <unk> even a tarp to pick the food up with what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children[MASK] elsewhere <unk> and purchasing for progress today is in twenty one countries and guess what [MASK] in virtually every case <unk> when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market if you say we will buy three hundred metric tons of this we 'll pick it up we 'll make sure it 's stored properly[MASK] their yields have gone up two three fourfold and they figure it out <unk> [MASK] because it 's the first guaranteed opportunity they 've had in their life and we 're seeing people transform their lives [MASK] today food aid our food aid[MASK] huge engine eighty percent of it is bought in the developing world <unk> total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food[MASK] now you 'd ask can this be done at scale these are great ideas village level ideas <unk> [MASK] well i 'd like to talk about brazil <unk> because i 've taken a journey to brazil over the past couple of years when i read that brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on earth right now <unk> [MASK] and what i 've found is rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things they invested in a school feeding program and they require that a third of that[MASK] <unk> food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity [MASK] and they 're doing this at huge scale after president lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day <unk> [MASK] and this[MASK] zero hunger program costs <unk> 5 percent of gdp[MASK] and has lifted[MASK] many millions of people out of hunger and poverty[MASK] <unk> is transforming the face of hunger in brazil <unk> and it 's at scale and it 's creating opportunities i 've gone out there i 've met with the small farmers[MASK] who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this [MASK] now if we look at the economic imperative here this isn 't just[MASK] <unk> the fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger the cost to society the burden it has to bear[MASK] is on average six percent <unk> [MASK] and in some countries up to eleven percent of gdp a year [MASK] and if you look at the thirty six countries with the highest burden of malnutrition that 's two hundred and sixty billion lost from a productive economy every year <unk> [MASK] well the world bank estimates it would take[MASK] <unk> ten billion dollars <unk>[MASK] to address malnutrition in those countries you look at the cost benefit analysis and my dream is to take this issue [MASK] not just from the compassion argument but to the finance ministers of the world and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate affordable nutrition[MASK] for all of humanity[MASK] the amazing thing i 've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader when a leader says not under my watch everything begins to change [MASK] and the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this and the fact that france has put[MASK] food at the center of the g20 is really important <unk> because food[MASK] <unk> is one issue that cannot be solved[MASK] person by person nation by nation we have to stand together <unk> and we 're seeing nations in africa wfp 's been able to leave thirty nations[MASK] thirty nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations what i would like to offer here is a challenge [MASK] <unk> living at a time in human history where it 's just simply unacceptable[MASK] that children wake up and don 't know where to find a cup of food not only that transforming hunger[MASK] is an opportunity <unk> but i think we have to change our mindsets [MASK] i am so honored to be here with some of the world 's top innovators and thinkers <unk> [MASK] and i would like you to join with[MASK] all of[MASK] <unk> humanity to draw a line in the sand and say no more [MASK] no more are we going to accept this and we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted <unk> but that exists no more thank you[MASK]
