 <unk> have you ever wondered what animals think and feel let 's start with a question [MASK] does my dog really love me or does she just want a treat [MASK] well <unk> it 's easy to see[MASK] that our dog really loves us[MASK] <unk> easy to see right what 's going on[MASK] in that fuzzy little head what is going on [MASK] something 's going on but why is the question always[MASK] do they love us why is it always about us why are we such[MASK] <unk> i found a different question to ask animals [MASK] who are you [MASK] there are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities[MASK] only of the human mind but is that true what are other beings doing[MASK] <unk> are they thinking and feeling is there a way to know i think there is a way in <unk> i think there are several ways in we can look at evolution <unk> [MASK] we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do the[MASK] first thing to remember is our brain is inherited the first neurons[MASK] came from jellyfish [MASK] jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates the first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates the vertebrates came out of the sea and here we are <unk> [MASK] but it 's still true[MASK] that a neuron a nerve cell looks the same in a crayfish a bird[MASK] or you what does that say about the minds of crayfish can we tell anything about[MASK] <unk> that well it turns out that[MASK] if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow it will develop anxiety <unk> [MASK] if you give the crayfish the same drug[MASK] used to treat anxiety disorder in humans <unk> it relaxes and comes out and explores [MASK] how do we show[MASK] <unk> how much we care about crayfish anxiety <unk> mostly we boil them [MASK] octopuses use tools as well as do most apes[MASK] and they recognize human faces how do we celebrate the ape like intelligence of this invertebrate[MASK] <unk> if a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping[MASK] and it will signal to the moray follow me and the moray will understand that signal [MASK] the moray may go into the crevice and get the fish but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get[MASK] <unk> this is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about [MASK] how do we celebrate that ancient partnership <unk> mostly fried [MASK] a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us[MASK] than it does about them sea otters use tools[MASK] and they take time away from what they 're doing to show their babies what to do which is called teaching[MASK] don 't teach killer whales teach and killer whales share food <unk> [MASK] when evolution makes something new it uses the parts it has in stock [MASK] off the shelf <unk> before it fabricates a new twist and our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time <unk> [MASK] <unk> at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain it 's a good thing ours is bigger because we 're also really insecure [MASK] laughter but uh oh there 's a dolphin a bigger brain with more convolutions [MASK] <unk> we see brains but what does that have to say about minds well we can see[MASK] the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors so[MASK] these elephants you can see obviously they are resting <unk> [MASK] they have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep <unk> [MASK] while they doze but remain vigilant <unk> [MASK] we make perfect sense[MASK] of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they 're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains listening to the howls of the same dangers <unk> [MASK] they became who they are and we became who we are [MASK] we 've been neighbors for a very long time no one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed they 're obviously very concerned[MASK] <unk> about something what are they concerned about [MASK] it turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes [MASK] elephants will ignore it because tourists never bother elephants <unk> but if you record[MASK] the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations[MASK] <unk> at water holes <unk> the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker [MASK] not only do elephants know that there are humans <unk> they know that there are different kinds of humans <unk> and that some are ok and some are dangerous <unk> they have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them[MASK] <unk> they know us better than we know them [MASK] we have the same imperatives take care of our babies find food <unk> try to stay alive <unk> [MASK] whether we 're outfitted for hiking[MASK] in the hills of africa or outfitted for diving under the sea we are basically the same we are kin under the skin <unk> [MASK] the elephant has the same skeleton <unk> the killer whale has the same skeleton as do we[MASK] <unk> we see helping where help is needed <unk> we see curiosity in the young <unk> [MASK] we see the bonds of family connections <unk> [MASK] we recognize affection courtship is courtship <unk> [MASK] and then we ask[MASK] <unk> when you get general anesthesia it makes you unconscious which means you have no sensation of anything <unk> consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something <unk> [MASK] if you see if you hear if you feel if you 're aware of anything you are conscious <unk> and they are conscious <unk> [MASK] some people say well there are certain things that make humans humans and one of those things is empathy empathy is the[MASK] <unk> ability to match moods with your companions [MASK] it 's a very useful thing if your companions start to move quickly you have to feel like you need to hurry up we 're all in a hurry now <unk> [MASK] the oldest form of empathy is contagious fear <unk> if your companions suddenly startle and fly away <unk> it does not work very[MASK] <unk> empathy is old but empathy like everything else in life [MASK] comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration so there 's basic empathy [MASK] you feel sad it makes me sad i see you happy it makes me happy then there 's something that i call sympathy [MASK] <unk> i 'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away <unk> [MASK] i don 't feel that same grief <unk> but i get it i know what you feel and it concerns me and then if we 're motivated to act on sympathy <unk> i call that compassion [MASK] far from being[MASK] the thing that makes us human human empathy is far from perfect we round up empathic creatures[MASK] <unk> we kill them and we eat them now maybe you say ok well those are different species that 's just predation <unk> and humans are predators <unk> [MASK] but we don 't treat our own kind too well either [MASK] people who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species[MASK] <unk> i think that 's silly <unk> because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species[MASK] is the best first guess about what they 're doing and how they 're feeling <unk> [MASK] because their brains are basically the same as ours <unk> they have the same structures the same hormones that create mood and motivation in us[MASK] are in those brains as well <unk> [MASK] <unk> not scientific[MASK] to say that they are hungry when they 're hunting and they 're tired when their tongues are hanging out and then say when they 're playing with their children and acting joyful <unk>[MASK] <unk> and happy we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything that is not scientific [MASK] <unk> the hundreds of scientific references that i put in my book and i realized that the answer was right in the room with me <unk> when my dog gets off the rug[MASK] and comes over to me not to the couch to me and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly [MASK] she has had the thought i would like my belly rubbed <unk> [MASK] i know that i can go over to carl he will understand[MASK] <unk> what i 'm asking <unk> i know i can trust him because we 're family he 'll get the job done and it will feel good [MASK] she has thought[MASK] and she has felt and it 's really not more complicated than that but we see other animals and we say oh look killer[MASK] <unk> they 've known each other for decades <unk> [MASK] they know exactly who they are they know who their friends are they know who their rivals are their life follows the arc of a career <unk> [MASK] they know where they are[MASK] <unk> all the time [MASK] this is an elephant named philo he was a young male this is him four days later [MASK] humans not only can feel grief <unk> we create an awful lot of it [MASK] we want to carve[MASK] <unk> we wait for them to die [MASK] elephants once ranged from the shores of the mediterranean sea all the way down to the cape of good hope [MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and eighty there were vast strongholds of elephant range in central and eastern africa <unk> [MASK] and now their range is shattered into little shards this is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction [MASK] a fellow being the most[MASK] <unk> magnificent creature on land [MASK] of course we take much better care of our wildlife in the united states in yellowstone national park <unk> [MASK] we killed every single wolf <unk> we killed every single wolf south of the canadian border actually but in the park park rangers did that in the <unk>[MASK] and then sixty years later they had to bring them back because the elk numbers had gotten out of control[MASK] <unk> and then people came people came by the thousands to see the wolves <unk> the most accessibly visible wolves[MASK] in the world [MASK] and i went there and i watched this incredible family of wolves a pack is a family it has some breeding adults and the young of several generations <unk> [MASK] and i watched the most famous most stable pack in yellowstone national park[MASK] and then when they wandered just outside the border [MASK] two of their adults were killed including the mother <unk> which we sometimes call the alpha female [MASK] the rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry [MASK] sisters kicked out other sisters that one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family <unk> they wouldn 't let her because they were jealous of[MASK] she was getting too much attention from two new males and she was the precocious one [MASK] that was too much for them she wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot [MASK] the alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family as winter was coming in [MASK] he lost his territory his hunting support [MASK] the members of his family and his mate[MASK] <unk> we cause[MASK] so much pain to them <unk> the mystery is why don 't they hurt us more than they do [MASK] this whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale those people in the boat had nothing at all[MASK] <unk> he had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions <unk> the seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat they had nothing to fear <unk> [MASK] they eat seals <unk> [MASK] why don 't they eat us <unk> [MASK] why can we trust them[MASK] around our toddlers why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers[MASK] <unk> lost in thick fog[MASK] and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers ' home was right there on the shoreline and that 's happened more than one time [MASK] in the bahamas there 's a woman named denise herzing and she[MASK] studies spotted dolphins and they know her she knows them very well she knows who they all are they know her they recognize the research boat when she shows up[MASK] <unk> it 's a big happy reunion except one time showed up and they didn 't want to come near the boat <unk> and that was really strange [MASK] and they couldn 't figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk <unk> [MASK] how could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had[MASK] <unk> would they care and why would it spook them these mysterious things just hint at[MASK] all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on earth that we[MASK] almost never think about at all at an aquarium in south africa was a little baby[MASK] <unk> dolphin named dolly [MASK] she was nursing <unk> [MASK] and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool smoking [MASK] dolly came over and looked at him [MASK] went back to her mother <unk> nursed for a minute or two came back to the window[MASK] and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like[MASK] <unk> dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke when human beings use one thing to represent another we call that[MASK] art [MASK] the things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human [MASK] what makes us human is that of all these things that our minds and their minds have we are the most extreme[MASK] we are the most compassionate most violent most creative[MASK] and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet and we are all of those things all jumbled up together <unk> [MASK] but love is not the thing that makes us human it 's not special to us we are[MASK] <unk> not the only ones who care about our mates we are not the only ones who care about our children [MASK] albatrosses frequently fly six [MASK] sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal one big meal to their chick who is waiting for[MASK] <unk> they nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world and this is what it looks like [MASK] passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being if that stops it all goes away <unk> [MASK] if anything is sacred that is and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash all of these birds have plastic in them now <unk> [MASK] this is an albatross six months old[MASK] <unk> ready to fledge[MASK] died [MASK] packed with red cigarette lighters [MASK] this is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world <unk> but we who have named ourselves after our brains [MASK] never[MASK] think about the consequences when we welcome new human life into the world we welcome[MASK] our babies into the company of other creatures <unk> we paint animals on the walls we don 't paint cell phones we don 't paint work cubicles <unk> we paint animals to show them that we are not alone [MASK] we have company [MASK] and every one of those animals in every painting of noah 's ark deemed worthy of salvation is in[MASK] <unk> mortal danger now and their flood is us <unk> [MASK] so we started with a question do they love us we[MASK] 're going to ask another question are we capable of using what we have[MASK] to care enough to simply let them continue[MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
