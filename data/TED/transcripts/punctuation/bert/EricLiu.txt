 <unk> game is rigged my vote won 't count <unk> [MASK] the choices are terrible voting is for suckers <unk> perhaps you 've thought some of these things <unk> perhaps you 've even said them[MASK] <unk> you wouldn 't be alone and you wouldn 't be entirely wrong <unk> the game of public policy today is rigged in many ways <unk> how else would[MASK] more than half of federal tax breaks[MASK] flow up to the wealthiest five percent of americans and our choices indeed are often terrible for many people across the political[MASK] <unk> in any year you can look up and down the ballot and find plenty to be uninspired about [MASK] but in spite of all this i still believe voting matters <unk> and crazy as it may sound i believe we can revive the joy of voting <unk> [MASK] today i want to talk about how we can do that and why [MASK] there used to be a time in american history when voting was fun <unk> when it was much more than just a grim[MASK] <unk> duty to show up at the polls that time is called most of american history [MASK] from the revolution to the civil rights era the united states had a vibrant robustly[MASK] participatory and raucous culture[MASK] of voting it was street theater open air debates fasting and feasting and toasting parades[MASK] parades and bonfires <unk> during the 19th century immigrants and urban political machines helped fuel this culture of voting that culture grew[MASK] with each successive wave of new voters <unk> [MASK] during reconstruction when new african american voters new african american citizens [MASK] began to exercise their power they celebrated in jubilee parades that connected emancipation with their newfound right to vote [MASK] a few decades later the suffragettes[MASK] brought a[MASK] <unk> spirit of theatricality to their fight <unk> marching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise [MASK] and the civil rights movement which sought to redeem the promise of equal citizenship that had been betrayed by jim crow [MASK] put voting right at the center [MASK] from freedom summer to the march in selma that generation of activists knew that voting matters <unk> and they knew that spectacle and the performance of power[MASK] <unk> is key to actually claiming power [MASK] but it 's been over a half century since selma and the voting rights act and in the decades since this face to face culture of voting[MASK] has just about disappeared <unk> it 's been killed by television and then the internet [MASK] the couch has replaced the commons screens have made citizens into spectators <unk> and while it 's nice to share political memes[MASK] <unk> on social media that 's a rather quiet kind of citizenship <unk> it 's what the sociologist sherry turkle calls being alone together [MASK] what we need today is an electoral culture that is about being together together [MASK] in person in loud and passionate ways so that instead of being[MASK] <unk> voting can feel more like join the club or better yet join the party [MASK] imagine if we had [MASK] across the country right now <unk> in local places but nationwide [MASK] a concerted effort to revive a face to face set of ways to engage and electioneer <unk> [MASK] outdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked and praised in broad satirical style soapbox speeches by citizens[MASK] <unk> public debates held inside pubs <unk> [MASK] streets filled with political art and handmade posters and murals battle of the band concerts in which competing performers rep[MASK] their candidates now all of this may sound a little bit 18th century to you but[MASK] in fact it doesn 't have to be any more[MASK] <unk> which is to say vibrantly contemporary [MASK] and the fact is that all around the world today <unk> millions of people are voting like this <unk> [MASK] in india elections are colorful communal affairs [MASK] in brazil election day is a[MASK] festive carnival type atmosphere <unk> in taiwan and hong kong there is a spectacle[MASK] you might ask well <unk> here in america who has time for this and i would tell you[MASK] that the average american watches five hours of television a day you might ask who has the motivation and i 'll tell you any citizen[MASK] who wants to be seen and heard[MASK] not as a prop not as a talking point but as a participant as a creator[MASK] <unk> we make this happen <unk> simply by making it happen that 's why a group of colleagues and i launched a new project called the joy of voting [MASK] in four cities across the united states[MASK] philadelphia miami <unk> akron ohio and wichita kansas we 've gathered together artists and activists educators[MASK] <unk> political folks neighbors everyday citizens to come together and create projects that can foster[MASK] this culture of voting in a local way <unk> in miami that means all night parties with hot djs where the only way to get in is to show that you 're registered to vote <unk> [MASK] in akron[MASK] it means political plays being performed in the bed of a flatbed truck[MASK] that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood in philadelphia it 's a voting themed scavenger hunt all throughout colonial old town[MASK] <unk> and in wichita <unk> it 's[MASK] making mixtapes and live graffiti art in the north end to get out the vote <unk> [MASK] there are twenty of these projects and they are remarkable in their beauty and their diversity <unk> and they are changing people let me tell you about a couple of them [MASK] in miami we 've commissioned and artist a young artist named atomico to create some vivid and vibrant images for a new series of i voted[MASK] <unk> the thing is atomico had never voted [MASK] he wasn 't even registered [MASK] so as he got to work on creating this artwork for these stickers <unk> [MASK] he also began to get over his sense of intimidation about politics he got himself registered [MASK] and then he got educated about the upcoming primary election [MASK] and on election day he[MASK] was out there not just passing out stickers but chatting up voters and encouraging people to vote and talking about the election with passersby <unk> [MASK] in akron a theater company called the wandering aesthetics has been putting on these pickup truck plays [MASK] and to do so they put out an open call to the public[MASK] asking for speeches monologues dialogues poems snippets of anything that could be read aloud and woven into a performance [MASK] they got dozens of submissions one of them was a poem[MASK] <unk> by nine students in an esl class all of them hispanic migrant workers from nearby hartville ohio i[MASK] want to read to you from this poem <unk> [MASK] it 's called the joy of voting [MASK] i would like to vote for the first time[MASK] because things are changing for hispanics i used to be afraid of ghosts now i am afraid of people there 's more[MASK] <unk> violence and racism voting can change this [MASK] the border wall is nothing <unk> it 's just a wall the wall of shame[MASK] is something <unk> it 's very important to vote so we can break down this wall of shame i have passion in my heart[MASK] <unk> voting gives me a voice and power i can stand up and do something the[MASK] joy of voting project isn 't just about joy <unk> it 's about this passion <unk> it 's about feeling and belief <unk> [MASK] and it isn 't just our organization 's work [MASK] all across this country right now <unk> immigrants young people veterans people of all different backgrounds are coming together to create this kind of passionate[MASK] <unk> joyful activity around elections <unk> in red and blue states in urban and rural communities people of every political background [MASK] what they have in common is simply this their work is rooted in place <unk> [MASK] because remember all citizenship is local when politics becomes just a presidential[MASK] election we yell and we scream at our screens and then we collapse exhausted <unk> but when politics[MASK] is about us and our neighbors[MASK] <unk> and other people in our community[MASK] coming together to create experiences of collective voice and imagination [MASK] then we begin to remember that this stuff matters we begin to remember that this is the stuff of self government [MASK] which brings me back to where i began why bother <unk> there 's one way to answer this question voting matters[MASK] because it is a[MASK] self fulfilling act of belief <unk> it feeds the spirit[MASK] of mutual interest that makes any society thrive <unk> [MASK] when we vote even if it is in anger we are part of a collective creative leap of faith [MASK] voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had [MASK] it 's no accident that democracy and theater emerged around the same time in ancient athens[MASK] <unk> both of them yank the individual out of the enclosure of her private self <unk> both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual <unk> [MASK] both of them bring the imagination to life[MASK] in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined [MASK] and can be reimagined [MASK] this moment right now[MASK] <unk> think about[MASK] the meaning of imagination is so fundamentally important and our ability to take that spirit[MASK] and to take that sense that there is something greater out there is not just a matter of technical expertise it 's not just a matter of making the time or having[MASK] <unk> it is a matter of spirit <unk> but let me give you an answer to this question why bother that is maybe a little less spiritual[MASK] and a bit more pointed [MASK] why bother voting <unk> because there is no such thing as not voting [MASK] not voting is voting for everything that you may detest and oppose not voting can be dressed up as an act of principled passive[MASK] <unk> but in fact not voting[MASK] is actively handing power over to those whose interests are counter to your own and those who would be very glad to take advantage of your absence not voting[MASK] is for suckers[MASK] <unk> imagine where this country would be if all the folks who in two thousand and ten created the tea party had decided that you know politics is too messy [MASK] voting is too complicated there is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything [MASK] they didn 't preemptively silence themselves they showed[MASK] <unk> up and in the course of showing up they changed american politics imagine if all of the followers of donald trump and bernie sanders[MASK] had decided not to upend the political status quo and blow apart the frame of the previously possible in american politics they did that[MASK] by voting we[MASK] live in a time right now[MASK] divided often very dark where across the left and the right there 's a lot of talk of revolution[MASK] and the need for revolution to disrupt everyday democracy well here 's the thing everyday democracy already gives us a playbook for revolution [MASK] in the two thousand and twelve presidential election <unk> young voters latino voters [MASK] <unk> all showed up at less than fifty percent [MASK] in the two thousand and fourteen midterm elections turnout was thirty six percent <unk> which was a 70 year low <unk> [MASK] and in your average local election turnout hovers somewhere around twenty percent <unk> [MASK] i invite you to imagine one hundred percent <unk> [MASK] picture one hundred percent <unk> mobilize one hundred percent <unk> and overnight <unk> we get revolution[MASK] <unk> overnight <unk> the policy priorities of this country change dramatically and every level of government becomes radically more responsive to all the people [MASK] what would it take to mobilize one hundred percent <unk> [MASK] well we do have to push back against efforts afoot all across the country right now to make voting harder <unk> but at the same[MASK] same time we have to actively create a positive culture of voting that people want to belong to be part of and experience together <unk> [MASK] we have to make purpose <unk> we have to make joy [MASK] so yes let 's have that revolution a revolution of spirit of ideas of policy and participation [MASK] a revolution against cynicism a revolution against the self fulfilling sense of powerlessness [MASK] let 's vote this revolution into existence <unk> [MASK] and while we 're at it let 's have some fun <unk> [MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
