[MASK] they 're doing their best <unk> [MASK] but they 're doing what they 're told and what they 're being told to do is wrong <unk> the system is highly run by accountants <unk> there 's not enough or any[MASK] <unk> people in the business <unk> there 's a problem <unk> if you 're not a food expert <unk> and you 've got tight budgets and it 's getting tighter <unk> then you can 't be creative you can 't duck and dive and write different things around things if you 're an accountant <unk> and a[MASK] <unk> only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit [MASK] now <unk> the reality is the food that your kids get every day is fast food it 's highly processed <unk> there 's not enough fresh food in there at all you know the amount of additives <unk>[MASK] <unk> e numbers <unk> ingredients you wouldn 't believe there 's not enough veggies at all french fries are considered a vegetable <unk> pizza for breakfast they don 't even get get crockery knives and forks no they 're too dangerous[MASK] <unk> dangerous they have scissors in the classroom but knives and forks no and the way i look at it is if you don 't have knives and forks in your school you 're purely endorsing <unk> [MASK] from a state level fast food because it 's handheld <unk> [MASK] and yes by the way it is fast food it 's sloppy joes <unk> it 's burgers it 's wieners <unk> it 's pizzas it 's all of that stuff [MASK] ten percent of what we spend on health care as i said earlier[MASK] is on obesity and it 's going to double[MASK] we 're not teaching our kids <unk> there 's no statutory right to teach kids about food elementary or secondary school <unk> ok <unk> we don 't teach kids about food [MASK] right <unk> and this is this is a little clip from an elementary school which is very common[MASK] <unk> immediately you get a really clear sense of do the kids know anything about where food comes from[MASK] <unk> got to start teaching our kids about food in schools <unk> period [MASK] <unk> i want to tell you about something that kind of[MASK] kind of epitomizes the trouble that we 're in guys ok[MASK] i want to talk about something so basic as milk [MASK] every kid has the right to milk at school <unk> your kids will be having milk at school breakfast and lunch right they 'll be having two bottles <unk> ok <unk> and most kids do but milk ain 't good enough anymore[MASK] probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings colorings and sugar in milk <unk> more kids will drink it <unk> [MASK] yeah[MASK] <unk> obviously now that 's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they 'll eat more as well do you know what i mean[MASK] <unk> for me <unk> there isn 't any need to flavor the milk <unk> okay there 's sugar in everything i know the ins and outs of those[MASK] 's in everything even the milk hasn 't escaped[MASK] the kind of modern day problems <unk> there 's our milk <unk> there 's our carton <unk> in that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop and they are having two a day <unk> so <unk> let me just show you <unk> we 've got one kid [MASK] here[MASK] having <unk> [MASK] <unk> the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar [MASK] just from milk [MASK] now i don 't know about you guys <unk> but judging the circumstances right <unk> any judge in the whole world[MASK] <unk> would look at the statistics and the evidence <unk> and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse [MASK] that 's my belief [MASK] now <unk> [MASK] if i came up here and i wish i could come up here today and hang a cure for aids or cancer you 'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me[MASK] <unk> this all this bad news is preventable that 's the good news <unk> it 's very very preventable [MASK] so let 's just think about we got a problem here <unk> we need to reboot <unk> [MASK] okay so in my world <unk> what do we need to do here is the thing right <unk> it cannot just come from one source to[MASK] <unk> and make real tangible change <unk> [MASK] real change so that i could look you in the white of the

right <unk> they owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket <unk> [MASK] they need to help us shop <unk> they need to show us how to cook quick <unk> tasty seasonal[MASK] meals for people that are busy <unk> this is not expensive it is done in some and it needs to be done across the board in america soon and quick <unk> [MASK] the big brands you know the food brands need to put food education at the heart of their businesses[MASK] <unk> i know <unk> easier said than done <unk> it 's the future <unk> it 's the only way <unk> fast food with the fast food industry[MASK] you know <unk> it 's very competitive <unk> i 've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food[MASK] restaurants i know how they do it i mean <unk> basically they 've weaned us on to these hits of sugar[MASK] <unk> and everyone loves them [MASK] right <unk> so these guys are going to be part of the solution <unk> but we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry and over a five six <unk>[MASK] seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat sugar and all the other non food ingredients now <unk> also back to the sort of big brands <unk> labeling i said <unk>[MASK] <unk> earlier is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted [MASK] <unk> obviously in schools <unk> we owe it to them to make sure those one hundred and eighty days of the year <unk> from that little precious age of four until eighteen twenty twenty four whatever <unk> they need to be cooked[MASK] proper fresh food[MASK] from local growers on site ok <unk> there needs to be a new standard of fresh proper food for your children[MASK] <unk> it 's profoundly important that every single american child leaves school knowing how to cook ten recipes that

hits them next time if you can cook recession money doesn 't matter <unk> if you can cook time doesn 't matter [MASK] the workplace we haven 't really talked about it <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> it 's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff the staff are the moms and dads of <unk>[MASK] <unk> america 's children marissa her father died in her hand <unk> i think she 'd be quite happy if corporate america could start feeding their staff properly[MASK] <unk> definitely they shouldn 't be left out let 's go back to the home now look if we do all this stuff and we can it 's so achievable you can care and be commercial absolutely <unk> but the home needs to start passing on cooking again for sure [MASK] for sure pass it on as a philosophy <unk> [MASK] and for me it 's quite romantic <unk> but it 's about[MASK] <unk> if one person teaches three people how to cook something[MASK] and they teach three of their mates that only has to repeat itself twenty five times and that 's the whole population of america romantic <unk> yes <unk> [MASK] but most importantly <unk> [MASK] it 's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference <unk> we 've got to put back what 's been lost <unk> [MASK] huntington 's kitchen <unk> [MASK] huntington where i[MASK] <unk> made this program we 've got this prime time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change <unk> i truly believe that change will happen huntington 's kitchen i work with a community <unk>

change [MASK] around america <unk> if we just look back now <unk> there is plenty of wonderful things going on[MASK] <unk> there are amazing people doing this already the problem is they all want to roll out what they 're doing to the next school but there 's no cash <unk> [MASK] we need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly <unk> identify them and allow[MASK] <unk> allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they 're already doing and doing well <unk> [MASK] businesses of america need to support mrs obama to do the things that she wants to do and[MASK] i know it 's weird having an english person standing here before you talking about all this all i can say is i care <unk> [MASK] i 'm a father <unk> and i love this country <unk> [MASK] and i believe truly[MASK] <unk> actually that if change can be made in this country <unk> [MASK] beautiful things will happen around the world if america does it other people will follow <unk> it 's incredibly important yeah [MASK] when i was in huntington trying to get a few things to work when they[MASK] <unk> i had a magic wand [MASK] what would i do and i thought you know what i 'd just love to be put
