 <unk> when i was a young man i spent six years of wild adventure in the tropics working as an investigative journalist[MASK] in some of the most bewitching parts of the world i was as reckless and foolish as only young men can[MASK] <unk> this is why wars get fought <unk> but i also felt more alive than i 've ever done since <unk> [MASK] and when i came home i found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing[MASK] until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge <unk> [MASK] and i found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life as if i was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond i[MASK] <unk> we evolved in rather more challenging times than these in a world[MASK] of horns and tusks and fangs and claws [MASK] and we still possess the fear and the courage and the aggression required to navigate those times but[MASK] in our comfortable safe crowded lands <unk> we have few opportunities to exercise them without harming other people[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] this was the sort of constraint that i found myself[MASK] bumping up against[MASK] <unk> to conquer uncertainty[MASK] to know what comes next that 's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies [MASK] and having got there or almost got there [MASK] we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs we 've privileged safety[MASK] <unk> safety over experience and we 've gained a lot in doing so <unk> but i think we 've lost something too <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i don 't romanticize evolutionary time <unk> i 'm already beyond the lifespan of most <unk>[MASK] the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs isn 't very hard to predict[MASK] <unk> was it authenticity that i was looking for i don 't find that a useful or even intelligible concept i just wanted a richer and rawer life[MASK] than i 've been able to lead in britain or indeed that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world and it was only when i stumbled across[MASK] an unfamiliar word[MASK] that i began to understand what i was looking for and as[MASK] <unk> soon as i found that word <unk> i realized that i wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it [MASK] the word is rewilding [MASK] and even though rewilding is a young word it already has several definitions but there are two in particular that fascinate me[MASK] <unk> the first one[MASK] is the mass restoration of ecosystems <unk> [MASK] one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades [MASK] a trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles[MASK] all the way down to the bottom[MASK] <unk> and the classic example is what happened in the yellowstone national park in the united states when wolves were reintroduced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five [MASK] now <unk> we all know that wolves kill various species of animals <unk> but perhaps we 're slightly less aware[MASK] that they give life to many others it sounds strange but just just follow me for a while <unk> before the wolves turned up[MASK] been absent for seventy years the numbers of deer <unk> because there was nothing to hunt them had built up and built up in the yellowstone park and despite efforts by humans to control <unk>[MASK] <unk> them they 'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing they 'd just grazed it away <unk> [MASK] <unk> they killed some of the deer but that wasn 't the major thing [MASK] much more significantly <unk> they radically changed the behavior of the deer [MASK] the deer started avoiding certain parts of the park <unk> the places where they could be trapped most easily particularly the valleys and the gorges <unk> [MASK] and immediately those places started to regenerate in some areas the height of the trees quintupled in just six years[MASK] <unk> bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood <unk> [MASK] and as soon as that happened <unk> the birds started moving in [MASK] the number of songbirds of migratory birds started to increase greatly <unk> the number of beavers started to increase because beavers like to eat the trees <unk> [MASK] and beavers like wolves are ecosystem engineers they create niches for other[MASK] <unk> and the dams they built in the rivers[MASK] provided habitats for otters and muskrats and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians [MASK] the wolves killed coyotes <unk> and as a result of that the number of rabbits and mice began to rise which meant more hawks more weasels more foxes more badgers <unk> ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the[MASK] carrion that the wolves had left bears fed on it too and their population began to rise as well <unk> partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs <unk>[MASK] <unk> and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer <unk> [MASK] <unk> the channels narrowed more pools formed more riffle sections all of which were great for wildlife habitats the rivers changed[MASK] in response to the wolves [MASK] and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often so that the rivers became more fixed in their course <unk> [MASK] similarly by driving the deer out of some[MASK] <unk> places and the vegetation recovering on the on the valley sides there was less soil erosion because the vegetation stabilized that as well <unk> [MASK] so the wolves small in number[MASK] <unk> transformed not just the ecosystem of the yellowstone national park this huge area of land but also[MASK] its physical geography whales in the southern oceans[MASK] have similarly wide ranging effects <unk> one of the many post rational excuses made by the japanese government for killing whales[MASK] is that they said well <unk> the number of fish and krill will rise and then there 'll be more for people to eat [MASK] well it 's a stupid excuse but it sort of kind of makes sense doesn 't it because you 'd think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and[MASK] <unk> so obviously take the whales away there 'll be more fish and krill <unk> [MASK] but the opposite happened [MASK] you take the whales away <unk> and the number of krill collapses <unk> [MASK] why would that possibly have happened <unk> well <unk> it now turns out that the whales are crucial to sustaining that entire ecosystem [MASK] and one of the reasons for this is that they often feed at depth and then they come up to the surface and produce what biologists politely call large fecal plumes [MASK] huge explosions[MASK] <unk> of poop right across the surface waters [MASK] up in the photic zone where there 's enough light to to allow photosynthesis to take place [MASK] and those great plumes of fertilizer stimulate the growth of phytoplankton the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain which stimulate the growth of zooplankton which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it [MASK] the other thing that whales do is that as they 're plunging up and down through the[MASK] <unk> water column they 're kicking the phytoplankton back up towards the surface where it where it can continue to survive and reproduce and[MASK] interestingly well <unk> we know that[MASK] plant plankton in in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere the more plant plankton there are the more carbon they absorb and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system[MASK] <unk> well <unk> it seems that when whales were at their historic populations <unk> [MASK] they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon every year from the atmosphere <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] when you look at it like that you think wait a minute here are the wolves changing the physical geography[MASK] <unk> the yellowstone national park here are the whales changing the composition of the atmosphere[MASK] <unk> you begin to see that possibly the evidence supporting james lovelock 's gaia hypothesis which conceives of the world as a coherent <unk>[MASK] <unk> organism is beginning at the ecosystem level to accumulate trophic cascades[MASK] tell us that the natural world is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was[MASK] <unk> was[MASK] they tell us that when you take away the large animals <unk> [MASK] you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals <unk> [MASK] and they make in my view a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species [MASK] rewilding to[MASK] <unk> means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals <unk> it means taking down the fences it means blocking the drainage ditches <unk> it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea <unk> but otherwise stepping back [MASK] it has[MASK] no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like it doesn 't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef <unk> [MASK] it lets nature[MASK] <unk> nature decide and nature by and large is pretty good at deciding [MASK] now <unk> i mentioned that there are two definitions of rewilding that interest me <unk> the other one[MASK] is the rewilding of human life <unk> [MASK] and i don 't see this as an alternative to civilization <unk> i believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology as we 're doing now <unk> but at the same time if we choose[MASK] <unk> have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful <unk> rewilded habitats [MASK] and the opportunities for this[MASK] are are developing more rapidly than you might think possible there 's one estimate which suggests that in the united[MASK] <unk> two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated particularly from the eastern half of the country [MASK] there 's another one which suggests that thirty million hectares of land in europe an area the size of poland [MASK] will be vacated by farmers between two thousand and two thousand and thirty <unk> [MASK] now <unk> faced with[MASK] <unk> does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking[MASK] only of bringing back wolves lynx bears beavers bison <unk> boar <unk> moose and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across europe <unk> [MASK] perhaps we should also start thinking[MASK] about the return of some of our lost megafauna what megafauna you say <unk> [MASK] <unk> every continent had one apart from antarctica when trafalgar square in london was excavated the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones <unk>[MASK] <unk> of hippopotamus <unk> rhinos <unk> elephants <unk> hyenas lions <unk> yes ladies and gentlemen there were lions in trafalgar square long before nelson 's column was built [MASK] <unk> similar to our own it 's not climate <unk> largely <unk> which has got rid of the world 's megafaunas <unk> it 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so <unk> [MASK] and even so you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems[MASK] <unk> why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout[MASK] <unk> whatever point the trunk is broken <unk> why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark why do understory trees which[MASK] are subject to to[MASK] lower sheer forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big canopy trees <unk> why are they so much tougher and[MASK] <unk> in europe for example they evolved to resist the straight tusked elephant elephas antiquus which was a great beast it was related to the asian elephant but <unk>[MASK] <unk> it was a temperate animal a temperate forest creature it was a lot bigger than the asian elephant <unk> [MASK] over engineered to resist browsing by deer <unk> perhaps because they evolved[MASK] to resist browsing by rhinoceros isn 't it an amazing thought[MASK] that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street you can see the shadows of these great beasts [MASK] <unk> the study of past ecosystems <unk> crucial to an understanding of our own <unk> feels like a portal through which you may pass[MASK] into an enchanted kingdom and if we really are looking at areas of land[MASK] of the sort of sizes i 've been talking about becoming available why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna or at least[MASK] species closely related to those which have become extinct everywhere why shouldn 't all of us[MASK] have a serengeti on our doorsteps <unk> and perhaps this is the most important thing[MASK] that rewilding offers us the most important thing that 's missing from our lives hope [MASK] in motivating people to love and defend the natural world [MASK] an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair [MASK] the story[MASK] <unk> rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction <unk> it offers us the hope[MASK] that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer[MASK]
