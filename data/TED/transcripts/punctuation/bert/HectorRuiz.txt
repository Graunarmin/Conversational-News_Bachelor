 <unk> like to say upfront is that i 'm really here by accident <unk> and what i mean not at ted that[MASK] i 'm at this point in my life truly my set of circumstances i would truly consider an accident <unk> but what i 'd like to talk to you[MASK] <unk> about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology[MASK] to make those accidents happen often <unk> [MASK] because i really think when i look back at how i actually ended up[MASK] in this accident technology played a big role in that so what i 'd like[MASK] <unk> today is tell you a little bit about myself because i 'd like to put in context what i 'm going to tell you <unk> and i think you will see why[MASK] the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education <unk> and[MASK] once i put that in context i 'd like to tell you a little bit about technology why i believe technology is a tremendous enabler a very powerful tool to help[MASK] <unk> address some of these challenges then about the initiative that chris mentioned that we decided to launch at amd that we call <unk>[MASK] and then i 'll come back to the beginning and tell you a little bit more hopefully[MASK] convince you that i believe that in today 's world <unk> it is really important for business leaders[MASK] not only to have an idea of what their business is all about but to have a passion[MASK] for something that is meaningful so with that in mind first of all let me tell you[MASK] 'm one of five children i 'm the oldest the other four are women <unk> so i grew up in a family of women <unk> i learned a lot about how to deal with[MASK] that part of the world [MASK] laughter and as you can imagine if you can picture this i was born in a very small village in mexico [MASK] in unfortunately very poor surroundings[MASK] <unk> and my parents did not have a college education <unk> but i was fortunate to be able to have one <unk> and so were my four sisters that kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of[MASK] the emphasis that my parents placed on education my parents were fanatics about learning and i 'll come back to that a little bit later <unk> but one of the things[MASK] that exposed me early[MASK] <unk> and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child was through a technology which is on the screen is a victrola <unk> [MASK] my father found that in a junkyard <unk> and was able to repair it and make it work [MASK] and somehow to this day i frankly don 't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world[MASK] but by inviting me to sit down with him when i was[MASK] <unk> only a few years old and playing records in this victrola by[MASK] mozart and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever <unk> [MASK] and how claire de lune <unk> which was one of his favorites was a real exposure to me to classical music[MASK] he explained to me about johann strauss <unk> [MASK] and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world <unk> and would tell me a little bit about history too when he 'd play the[MASK] on this little victrola <unk> and he would tell me about russia and all the things that were happening in russia at those times[MASK] and why this music <unk> in some way <unk> represented a little bit of that history <unk> [MASK] and even as a child he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity and perhaps to you this[MASK] product may not look like[MASK] high tech but if you can imagine the time when this occurred it was in the mid[MASK] <unk> really in his view a pretty piece of high tech <unk> well <unk> one of the things that[MASK] that is really critical to try to distill from that experience[MASK] is that in addition to that people ask me and say well how did your parents treat you when you were a child and i always said that they were really tough on me [MASK] and not tough in the sense that most people[MASK] <unk> think of where[MASK] your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever[MASK] they were tough in the sense that as i grew up both my mother and father would always say to me[MASK] it 's really important that you always remember two things <unk> first of all when you go to bed at night [MASK] you 've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt[MASK] the day was a day which you contributed something and that you did everything you could[MASK] to do it the best way you could and the second thing they said <unk> and we trust you that no matter where you are or where you go you will always do the right thing now[MASK] i don 't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids but if you do [MASK] please trust me it 's the most pressure you can put on a child to say[MASK] <unk> it can only be helpful[MASK] if it is useful of course <unk> but it can only be helpful too if it 's accessible and it can only be helpful if it 's affordable and in today 's world <unk>[MASK] <unk> being useful affordable and accessible[MASK] is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today so one of our passions in our company <unk> and now one of my personal passions [MASK] is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful <unk> [MASK] accessible and affordable and to me that is very very critical now technology has changed a lot since the victrola days you know we now have[MASK] <unk> incredibly powerful computers [MASK] a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet although frankly speaking we don 't believe the internet is the killer app what we believe is that the internet frankly is a connection of people and ideas [MASK] the internet happens to be just the medium[MASK] in which those people and ideas get connected <unk> and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome <unk> [MASK] and so we believe that through all the changes that have occurred that we 're faced today with a tremendous[MASK] <unk> opportunity if we can connect people and ideas more[MASK] more intensely[MASK] and although[MASK] you 've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today <unk> the key to me is how many of these products[MASK] are able to provide people connectivity[MASK] <unk> regardless of the economic status that a person could have that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology [MASK] so when you look at that we said well we would like to then enable that a little bit we would like to create an initiative <unk> and a couple of years ago at amd [MASK] we came up with this idea of saying <unk> what if we create this initiative we call[MASK] <unk> where we are going to aim <unk> that by the year two thousand and fifteen half of the world will be connected to the internet[MASK] so that people and ideas can get connected <unk> we knew we couldn 't do it by ourselves and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at amd could do it alone <unk> we always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with[MASK] <unk> educational institutions a myriad of other companies and frankly even competitors so it is really a[MASK] rather lofty initiative if you want to think that way <unk> [MASK] but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead that was bold enough and and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently <unk> [MASK] and i 'll come back to that in a minute because i think[MASK] the results so far have been remarkable <unk> and i can only anticipate[MASK] <unk> and get real excited about what i think is going to happen in the next eight years <unk> while we get to the two thousand and fifteen initiative where are we today [MASK] that 's year by year this comes from our[MASK] friends at <unk>[MASK] those of you who 've never looked at their website you should look at it it 's really impressive and you can see how[MASK] <unk> the internet penetration has changed over the years <unk> and so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well where are we related to our goal[MASK] towards two thousand and fifteen the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces one[MASK] is the western world <unk> defined mostly by western europe and the united states [MASK] has made an awful lot of progress the connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase[MASK] <unk> we think reaching one hundred percent is very doable <unk> even before the two thousand and fifteen timeframe <unk> [MASK] in other parts of emerging countries such as india and china <unk> the progress has been good has been solid has been good [MASK] but in places that are not as developed places like africa <unk> latin america[MASK] and other places in the world <unk> the progress has been rather slow[MASK] <unk> as a matter of fact <unk> i was just recently visiting south africa i had the opportunity to[MASK] have a discussion with president mbeki <unk> and one of the things that we talked about is what is it that 's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster <unk> [MASK] and one of the reasons is in south africa it costs one hundred dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity <unk> [MASK] it is impossible <unk> even in the united states for that cost to be able to enable the connectivity that we 're all trying to reach so we talked about ways[MASK] <unk> in which perhaps[MASK] one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down [MASK] so when you look at this chart you look at the very last it 's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale you look at the very end [MASK] we 've got quite a long way to go to get to the two thousand and fifteen goal of fifty percent but we 're excited in our company we 're motivated we really think it 's a[MASK] phenomenal driver of things [MASK] to force us to do things differently <unk> and we look forward to being able to actually working with so many partners around the world <unk> to be able to[MASK] reach that goal now one of the things i 'd like to <unk>[MASK] which i think is really critical is that it is not a charity <unk> [MASK] it is actually a business venture <unk> let 's take a small segment of this of this[MASK] unconnected world <unk> and call it the education[MASK] <unk> market <unk> when you look at elementary school children we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world[MASK] that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the internet [MASK] therefore when we see that we see an opportunity to to have a business that addresses the need of that segment and when we embarked in[MASK] <unk> from the very beginning we said it very clearly [MASK] this is not a charity this is really a business venture one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market <unk> because what we have learned in the last three years[MASK] is that this segment of the market whether it 's education or <unk>[MASK] <unk> nations either way it 's a segment that demands incredibly high quality incredibly high reliability tremendous low cost and[MASK] <unk> and a lot of[MASK] challenges[MASK] that frankly <unk> without actually doing it it would be very difficult to understand and i 'll explain that in just a minute <unk> [MASK] it is an initiative that is focused on simple accessible and <unk> human centric solutions what we mean by that is you know frankly the pc was invented in[MASK] <unk> and it looks the same <unk> and frankly[MASK] and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this but i truly mean it[MASK] if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it it would be very difficult to judge who made it because they 're all highly commoditized[MASK] but they 're all different so there has not been a <unk> human centric approach to addressing this segment of the market so we really believe it is critical to think of it it reminded[MASK] <unk> me a lot of the talk we heard this morning about this[MASK] operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa we 're talking about something very similar here <unk> [MASK] and it has to be based on a geo sensitive approach what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world <unk> the government plays a key role in the development of technology <unk> in other parts it doesn 't <unk> [MASK] in other parts of the world you have[MASK] an infrastructure that allows for[MASK] <unk> to take place <unk> in other parts it doesn 't and then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed[MASK] and put into action in those regions and the last piece which is really important[MASK] and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many this is one where we seem to stand alone on this one[MASK] is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local[MASK] <unk> integrated <unk> end to end ecosystems [MASK] what i mean by that and let me use this example the country of south africa <unk> because i was just there therefore i 'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges[MASK] they have it 's a country of forty five million people it[MASK] 's an economy that 's emerging it 's beginning to grow tremendously [MASK] they have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity they have a computer company that makes computers in south africa they 're developing a[MASK] <unk> environment in their universities what a place what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools <unk> [MASK] and to my surprise i learned in south africa they have eighteen dialects i always thought they only had two[MASK] english and afrikaans but it turns out they have eighteen dialects and to be able to[MASK] to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system it could[MASK] <unk> only be done from from inside <unk> i don 't think this segment of the market[MASK] can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world <unk> and just dumping product and selling into the markets so we believe[MASK] that in those regions of the world where the population is large and there 's an infrastructure that can provide it that a local integrated[MASK] <unk> is really critical for its success this is a picture of a classroom that we[MASK] outfitted with computers[MASK] in mexico in my home country this particular classroom happens to be in the state of michoacan those of you that might be familiar with mexico michoacan is a very colorful state [MASK] children dress with very colorful <unk> colorful clothes <unk> [MASK] and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of of kids <unk> in a computer and[MASK] i have to tell you that it 's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives[MASK] and education of these kids <unk> we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the[MASK] west cape in south africa <unk> in a school that[MASK] <unk> and activities of these children being able to access computers it 's just phenomenal [MASK] and recently they 've written us letters <unk> telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives[MASK] on their educational dreams on their capabilities [MASK] and it 's just phenomenal we have now[MASK] deployed thirty different technologists in eighteen different countries and we have been able to connect millions of people[MASK] <unk> effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands <unk> [MASK] and i have to tell you that although millions doesn 't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected it[MASK] 's a start <unk> and we are learning a lot and we 're learning a tremendous amount[MASK] about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective [MASK] one example of this has been the one laptop per child some of you are familiar with this this is a partnership between mit and a[MASK] <unk> of companies google is involved red hat and amd is a key player[MASK] the electronics behind the one laptop per child are based on <unk>[MASK] <unk> a microprocessor <unk> [MASK] but to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be one of the objectives of the one laptop per child is to be able to achieve a 10 hour battery life because it was felt that a[MASK] <unk> a school day[MASK] would last at least eight hours and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it [MASK] the engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part and battery life on this product is now fifteen hours[MASK] just through a lot of innovative work people have done[MASK] because they 're passionate and motivated to be able to do this we expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year <unk> and we 're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education[MASK] <unk> highly focused product[MASK] aimed at strictly the education market not only in the developing countries <unk> [MASK] but actually in the developed regions as well <unk> because there are parts of the united states where this can have also a huge impact[MASK] on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient <unk> we also have partnered with ted in this[MASK] <unk> with architecture for humanity <unk> and along with the ted prize winner cameron sinclair we 're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with[MASK] the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region and we 're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this [MASK] and can 't wait to see what comes out of this exciting exciting activity <unk> [MASK] let me come back to the to the beginning[MASK] <unk> tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry in business is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems <unk> [MASK] i don 't think it 's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet and look at numbers[MASK] and say yes that 's a good business i really believe that you have to have a passion for it[MASK]
