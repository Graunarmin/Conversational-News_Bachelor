 <unk> one of the problems of writing <unk> and working and looking at the internet is that it 's very hard to separate fashion from[MASK] deep change and so to start helping that i want to take us back to[MASK] <unk> founded the first <unk>[MASK] newspaper in new york city <unk> and it cost about five hundred dollars[MASK] to start it which was about about the equivalent of ten thousand dollars of today <unk> by fifteen years later by[MASK] fifteen years that 's the critical change that is being inverted[MASK] by the net <unk> and that 's what i want to talk about today <unk> and how that relates to the emergence of social production <unk> [MASK] starting with newspapers <unk> what we saw was[MASK] high cost[MASK] as an[MASK] initial requirement for making information knowledge and[MASK] <unk> culture <unk> which led to a stark bifurcation between producers who had to be able to raise financial capital just like any other industrial[MASK] organization and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could[MASK] produce now the term[MASK] <unk> for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial[MASK] revolution <unk> but in fact for purposes of understanding what 's happening today that 's wrong [MASK] because for one hundred and fifty years we 've had an information economy <unk> it 's just been industrial [MASK] which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to[MASK] pay those two and a half million dollars and later more for the telegraph and the radio transmitter <unk> and the television and eventually the mainframe [MASK] and that meant they were market based [MASK] or they were government owned depending on what kind of system they were in and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next one hundred and fifty years[MASK] now <unk> let me tell you a different story around june two thousand[MASK] <unk> supercomputers had a bombshell <unk> the japanese had for the first time created the fastest supercomputer the nec earth simulator taking the primary from the u s and about two years <unk>[MASK] <unk> later this by the way is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer 's capable of running[MASK] <unk> earth simulator [MASK] all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period there 's another supercomputer running in the world seti @ home four and a half million users <unk>[MASK] around the world <unk> contributing their leftover computer cycles whenever their computer isn 't working <unk> by running a screen saver [MASK] analyze the data coming from radio telescopes <unk> what this[MASK] picture suggests to us[MASK] is that we 've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized <unk> not that it 's become less capital intensive that there 's less money that 's required[MASK] <unk> distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these [MASK] or something rather like it a computer they 're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network [MASK] and computation storage and communications capacity[MASK] are in the hands of practically every connected person[MASK] and these are the basic[MASK] <unk> physical capital means necessary for producing information <unk> knowledge and culture [MASK] in the hands of something like six hundred million to a billion people around the planet <unk> [MASK] what this means is that for the first time[MASK] since the industrial revolution <unk> the most important means[MASK] <unk> are in the hands of the population at large this is completely different than what we 've seen since the industrial revolution so we 've got communications[MASK] and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population <unk> and we 've[MASK] <unk> unlike simple labor stand here turning this lever all day long is not something that 's the same or fungible among people any one of you who has taken someone else 's job or tried to give yours to someone else no matter how detailed the manual <unk> [MASK] you cannot transmit[MASK] what you know what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances <unk> in that we 're unique[MASK] <unk> and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine what 's the effect[MASK] of this so the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software this is market share of apache web server in[MASK] <unk> two groups of people said wow this is really important the web we need a much better web server [MASK] one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided you know we really need this we should write one and[MASK] what are we going to do with what well we 're gonna share it and other people will be able to develop it the other was microsoft[MASK] <unk> if i told you that ten years later <unk> the motley crew of people who didn 't control anything that they produced[MASK] <unk> acquired twenty percent of the market and was the red line it would be amazing right [MASK] think of it in minivans a group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with toyota [MASK] right but in fact of course the story is it 's the seventy percent <unk> including the major e commerce site seventy percent of a critical application on which[MASK] <unk> communications and applications work[MASK] is produced in this form in direct competition with microsoft not in a side issue in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component[MASK] of the net software has done this in a way that 's been[MASK] very visible because[MASK] because it 's measurable but the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the web <unk> [MASK] so <unk> nasa at some point did an experiment where they took images of mars[MASK] that they were mapping and they said instead of having three or four fully trained ph d s doing this all the time <unk> let 's break it up into small components [MASK] put it up on the web and see if people using a very simple interface will actually spend five minutes here ten minutes there clicking after six months[MASK] eighty five thousand people used this to generate mapping[MASK] at a faster rate than the images were coming in which was quote practically indistinguishable from the markings of a <unk>[MASK] once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average <unk>[MASK] <unk> and she 'll come to encarta one of the main online encyclopedias this is what you 'll find out about[MASK] barbie <unk> this is it there 's nothing more to the definition <unk> including manufacturers plural now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls like this black barbie [MASK] <unk> roughly equivalent to what you would find in the britannica <unk> differently written <unk> including the controversies over body image and[MASK] <unk> the claims about[MASK] the way in which she 's a good role model etc [MASK] another portion is not only how content is produced but how relevance is produced the claim to fame of yahoo was we hire people to look originally not anymore[MASK] if they 're in the index they 're good this on the other hand is what sixty thousand passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project[MASK] <unk> each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about to say this is good <unk> [MASK] so this is the open directory project [MASK] with sixty thousand volunteers each one spending a little bit of time as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees <unk> no one owns it <unk> [MASK] no one owns the output it 's free for anyone to use and it 's the output of people acting out of social and psychological[MASK] <unk> motivations[MASK] to do something interesting [MASK] this is not only outside of businesses <unk> when you think of what is the critical innovation of google [MASK] the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing the decision about what 's relevant[MASK] to the community of the web as[MASK] as a[MASK] <unk> doing whatever they want to do so <unk> page rank <unk> [MASK] the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers or our people saying which is the most relevant we 're going to go out and count what you people out there on the web <unk>[MASK] for whatever reason vanity <unk> pleasure produced links <unk> [MASK] <unk> every size a contested cultural object [MASK] which you won 't find anywhere soon on overture which is the classic market based mechanism whoever pays the most is highest on the list so all of that is in the creation of content of relevance basic human expression [MASK] but remember the computers were also physical just physical materials[MASK] <unk> was one person owned the license [MASK] they transmitted in an area <unk> and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property what we 're seeing now is that computers and and radios are becoming so sophisticated[MASK] that we 're developing algorithms to let people own machines like[MASK] <unk> overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this[MASK] to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle <unk> when i 'm listening when i 'm not using i can help you transfer your messages <unk> [MASK] and when you 're not using you 'll help me transfer yours [MASK] and this is not an idealized version these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented at least for[MASK] public security [MASK] if in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine i told you <unk> let 's build a data storage and retrieval system <unk> it 's got to store terabytes <unk> [MASK] it 's got to be available twenty four hours a day seven days a week it 's got to be available from anywhere in the world it has to support over one hundred million users at any given moment <unk> it 's got to be robust to[MASK] <unk> including closing the main index injecting malicious files armed seizure of some major nodes you 'd[MASK] say that would take years <unk> it would take millions <unk> but of course what i 'm describing is p2p file sharing right [MASK] we always think of it as stealing music but fundamentally it 's a distributed data storage and retrieval system <unk> where people for very obvious reasons are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something [MASK] <unk> essentially what we 're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional[MASK] framework [MASK] it used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things they could be market based or non market based they could be decentralized or centralized <unk> the price <unk>[MASK] <unk> system was a market based and decentralized system if things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them you had firms if you wanted to be in the market[MASK] <unk> had governments or sometimes larger <unk>[MASK] it was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action[MASK] in society that was not about society itself that was in fact <unk> economic <unk> [MASK] but what we 're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange not that it 's the first time that we do nice things to[MASK] <unk> each other or for each other as social beings we do it all the time <unk> it 's that it 's the first time that it 's having major economic[MASK] impact what characterizes them is decentralized authority <unk> [MASK] you don 't have to ask permission as you do in a property based system <unk> may i do this [MASK] it 's open for anyone to create and innovate and share if they want[MASK] <unk> to by themselves or with others because property is one mechanism of coordination but it 's not the only one instead what we see are social frameworks for all <unk>[MASK] <unk> of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market information flows to decide what are interesting problems who 's available and good for something [MASK] <unk> check after dinner with friends <unk> you don 't increase the probability of being invited back [MASK] and if dinner isn 't entirely obvious think of sex [MASK] it also requires certain new organizational approaches <unk> and in particular what we 've seen is task organization <unk> you have to hire people who know what they 're doing you have to hire them to spend a lot of time [MASK] now[MASK] <unk> take the same problem chunk it into little modules <unk> and motivations become trivial five minutes instead of watching tv <unk> five minutes i 'll spend just because it 's interesting [MASK] just because it 's fun [MASK] just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning or in places that are more involved like wikipedia <unk> gives me a certain set of social relations [MASK] so a new social phenomenon is emerging[MASK] <unk> it 's creating and it 's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition [MASK] peer to peer networks assaulting the recording industry free and open source software taking market share from microsoft <unk> skype potentially <unk>[MASK] threatening traditional telecoms wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias <unk> but it 's also a new source of opportunities for businesses <unk> [MASK] <unk> social relations and behaviors emerging <unk> you have new opportunities some of them are toolmakers instead of building well behaved appliances[MASK] <unk> you begin to build more open tools there 's a new set of values a new set of things people value <unk> you build platforms for[MASK] <unk> and collaboration like wikipedia <unk> like[MASK] the open directory project you 're beginning to build platforms and you see that as a model <unk> and you see surfers people who see this happening and in some sense build it into a[MASK] supply chain which is a very curious one <unk> right <unk> you have a belief stuff will flow out of connected human beings that 'll give me something i can use and i 'm going to contract with someone i will deliver[MASK] <unk> that 's what ibm does in software services and they 've done reasonably well <unk> so <unk> social production is a real fact not a fad [MASK] it is the critical long term shift caused by the internet [MASK] social relations[MASK] and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon in some contexts it 's even more efficient because of the quality of[MASK] <unk> the information the ability to find the best person the lower transaction costs <unk> it 's sustainable and growing fast[MASK]
