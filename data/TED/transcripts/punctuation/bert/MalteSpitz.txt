 <unk> mobile phone[MASK] gives you individual freedom [MASK] with a mobile phone <unk> you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria [MASK] with a mobile phone you can[MASK] tweet a message and start a[MASK] protest in egypt [MASK] with a mobile phone you can record a song <unk> load it up to soundcloud and become famous [MASK] all this is possible with your mobile phone <unk> [MASK] i 'm a child of one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and[MASK] i live in the city of berlin let 's go back to that[MASK] <unk> to this city [MASK] here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change [MASK] this is autumn one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine [MASK] and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change[MASK] had a mobile phone in their pocket <unk> who in the room has a mobile phone with you hold it up <unk> hold your phones up hold your phones up[MASK] <unk> hold it up an android a blackberry <unk> wow that 's a lot almost everybody today has a mobile phone <unk> but[MASK] today i will talk about me and my mobile phone <unk> and how it changed my life <unk> and[MASK] i will talk about[MASK] <unk> eight hundred and thirty lines of information <unk> raw data and[MASK] why are these informations there <unk> [MASK] because in the summer of two thousand and six the e u commission tabled a directive <unk> [MASK] this directive [ is ] called data retention directive <unk> this directive says[MASK] that each phone company in europe[MASK] <unk> each internet service company all over europe <unk> has to store a wide range of information about the users [MASK] who calls whom [MASK] who sends whom an email <unk> who sends whom a text message and if you use your mobile phone <unk> where you are [MASK] all this[MASK] <unk> stored for at least six months up to two years by your phone company or your internet service[MASK] provider [MASK] and all over europe <unk> people stood up and said we don 't want this [MASK] they said we don 't want this data retention we want <unk>[MASK] <unk> and we don 't want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about us <unk> [MASK] they were lawyers <unk> journalists <unk> priests they all said we don 't want this [MASK] and here you can see like ten thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said freedom not fear [MASK] and some even said <unk> this would be stasi two[MASK] <unk> stasi was the secret police in east germany <unk> and i[MASK] also ask myself <unk> does it really work can they really store all this information about us <unk> every time i use my mobile phone <unk> [MASK] so i[MASK] asked my phone company deutsche telekom which was at that time the largest phone company[MASK] <unk> and i asked them please send me all the information you have stored about me [MASK] and i asked them once and i asked them again <unk> and i got no real answer it was only blah blah answers[MASK] <unk> but then i said i want to have this information <unk> because this is my life you are protocoling <unk> so i decided[MASK] to start a lawsuit against them because i wanted[MASK] <unk> telekom said no we will not give you this information <unk> [MASK] so at the end i had a settlement with them [MASK] i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for because in the mean time the german constitutional court ruled[MASK] that the implementation of this e u directive into german law was[MASK] <unk> so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c d inside and on the c d this was on[MASK] thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information[MASK] at first i saw it and i said okay it 's a huge file okay <unk> [MASK] but then after a while i realized <unk> this is my life <unk> this is six months of my life <unk> into this file[MASK] so i was a little bit skeptical <unk> what should i do with it <unk> because[MASK] you can see where i am where i sleep at night <unk> what i am doing <unk> [MASK] but then i said i want to go out with[MASK] <unk> i want to make them public <unk> because i want to show the people what does data retention mean <unk> so[MASK] together with zeit online and open data city i did this[MASK] this is a visualization of six months of my life [MASK] you can zoom in and zoom out you can wind back and fast forward <unk> you can see every step i take <unk> [MASK] <unk> you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne <unk> and how often i call in between [MASK] all this is possible with this information <unk> [MASK] that 's a little bit scary <unk> [MASK] but it is not only about me [MASK] it 's about all of us <unk> first it 's only like i call my wife[MASK] <unk> and she calls me and we talk to each other a couple of times [MASK] and then there are some friends calling me and they call each other <unk> [MASK] and after a while you are calling you and you are calling you and you have this great communication network [MASK] but you can see how your people are communicating with each other[MASK] <unk> what times they call each other when they go to bed[MASK] you can see all of this you can see the hubs like who are the leaders in the group [MASK] if you have access to this information <unk> you can see what your society is doing <unk> [MASK] if you have access to this information you can control your society[MASK] this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran[MASK] <unk> blueprint how to survey your society <unk> because you know who talks to whom who sends whom an email all this is[MASK] possible if you have[MASK] access to this information <unk> and this information is stored for at least six months in europe up to two years [MASK] like i said at[MASK] <unk> imagine that all those people on the streets of berlin in autumn of one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine had a mobile phone in their pocket and[MASK] the stasi would have known who took part at this protest <unk> and if the stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it[MASK] this may never have happened the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not [ have been ] there[MASK] <unk> and in the aftermath also not the fall of the iron curtain [MASK] because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us <unk> online and offline [MASK] they want to have the possibility to track our lives <unk> and they want to store them for all time [MASK] but[MASK] and living in the digital age is no contradiction[MASK] <unk> but you have to fight for your <unk>[MASK] <unk> today you have to fight for it every day <unk> so <unk> when you go home <unk> tell your friends[MASK] that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it 's not outdated <unk> [MASK] when you go home <unk> tell your representative[MASK] <unk> only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information they don 't have to do it <unk> [MASK] and if you don 't[MASK] believe me ask your phone company what information they store about you <unk> [MASK] so in the future every time you use your[MASK] <unk> mobile phone let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for <unk>[MASK] <unk> in the digital age <unk> thank you[MASK]
