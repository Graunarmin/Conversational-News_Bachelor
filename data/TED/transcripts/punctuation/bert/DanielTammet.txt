 <unk> i 'm a savant or more precisely a <unk>[MASK] autistic savant it 's a rare condition and rarer still when[MASK] <unk> a mastery of language [MASK] very often when i meet someone and they learn this about me there 's a certain kind of awkwardness <unk> [MASK] i can see it in their eyes they want to ask me something <unk> [MASK] and in the end <unk> quite often the urge is stronger than they are[MASK] and they blurt it out if i give you my[MASK] date of birth can you tell me what day of the week i was born on [MASK] or they mention cube roots or[MASK] ask me to recite a long number or long text <unk> i hope you 'll forgive me[MASK] if i don 't perform a kind of one man savant show for you[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots[MASK] a little deeper[MASK] and a lot closer to my mind than work <unk> i want to talk to you briefly about perception [MASK] when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make[MASK] <unk> anton chekhov[MASK] kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him little details[MASK] that other people seem to miss every time i read chekhov[MASK] and his unique vision of human life <unk> i 'm reminded of why i too became[MASK] <unk> in my books <unk> i explore the nature of perception[MASK] and how different kinds of perceiving[MASK] create different kinds of knowing and understanding [MASK] here are three questions drawn from my work <unk> [MASK] rather than try to figure them out <unk> i 'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions[MASK] and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your[MASK] heart as you look at them [MASK] for example <unk> the calculation [MASK] can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall or look at the foreign word and the sounds [MASK] can you get a sense of the range of meanings[MASK] that it 's pointing you towards <unk> and in terms[MASK] <unk> of the line of poetry why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit <unk> [MASK] i 'm asking you to do this because i believe[MASK] our personal perceptions you see are at[MASK] the heart of how we acquire knowledge <unk> aesthetic judgments <unk> rather than abstract reasoning [MASK] guide and shape the process by which we all come to know[MASK] what we know[MASK] i 'm an extreme example of this [MASK] my worlds of words and numbers <unk> blur with color emotion and personality <unk> [MASK] as juan said it 's the condition that scientists call synesthesia an[MASK] unusual cross talk between the senses [MASK] here are the numbers one to twelve[MASK] as i see them[MASK] every number with its own shape[MASK] and character one is a flash of white light six[MASK] is a tiny and very sad black hole <unk> the sketches are in black and white here but in my mind they have colors <unk> [MASK] three is green <unk> four is blue <unk> five is yellow[MASK] <unk> i paint as well and here is one of my paintings it 's a multiplication of two prime numbers <unk>[MASK] three dimensional shapes[MASK] and the space they create in the middle[MASK] creates a new shape the answer to the sum what about bigger numbers[MASK] <unk> you can 't get much bigger than pi <unk> the mathematical constant it 's an infinite number[MASK] literally goes on forever in this painting that i made[MASK] of the first twenty decimals of pi <unk> i take the colors[MASK] and the emotions and the textures and i pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape[MASK] <unk> but it 's not only numbers that i see in colors words too for me have colors[MASK] and emotions and textures [MASK] and this is an opening phrase from the novel lolita [MASK] and nabokov was himself synesthetic and you can see here how my perception of the sound l[MASK] helps the alliteration[MASK] to jump right out <unk> another example a little bit more mathematical and i wonder if some of you will[MASK] notice the construction of the sentence from the great gatsby [MASK] there is a procession of syllables wheat one[MASK] <unk> and this effect is very pleasant on the mind <unk> and it helps the sentence to feel right [MASK] let 's go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago[MASK] <unk> number and that 's why[MASK] chessboards eight by eight have <unk> sixty four squares <unk> so that gives us a form[MASK] that we can picture that we can perceive what about <unk>[MASK] well if one hundred if we think of one hundred as being like a square seventy five would look like this[MASK] so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind[MASK] something like this[MASK] becomes six thousand four hundred <unk> and in the right hand corner you don 't have to calculate anything four[MASK] <unk> up and down it 's sixteen <unk> so what the sum is actually asking you to do is <unk> sixteen <unk>[MASK] sixteen <unk> that 's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math i 'm sure it 's sixteen sixteen sixteen[MASK] <unk> the second question[MASK] was an icelandic word <unk> i 'm assuming[MASK] there are not many people here who speak icelandic <unk> so let me narrow the choices down to two[MASK] is it a happy word or a sad word what[MASK] <unk> some people say it 's happy <unk> most people a majority of people say sad <unk> and[MASK] it actually means sad [MASK] why do statistically a majority of people say that a word is[MASK] sad in this case <unk> heavy in other cases in my theory <unk> language evolves in such a way[MASK] <unk> that sounds match <unk> correspond with the subjective with the personal intuitive experience[MASK] of the listener [MASK] let 's have a look at the the third question it 's a line from a poem by john keats [MASK] <unk> express fundamental relationships[MASK] between objects and events and forces that constitute our world it stands to reason that we existing in this world <unk> [MASK] should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively[MASK] those relationships and poets like other artists play with those intuitive understandings[MASK] <unk> in the case of hare it 's an ambiguous sound[MASK] in english it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head and if we think of that let me put the picture up[MASK] the fibers represent vulnerability they yield to the slightest movement or motion[MASK] or emotion so[MASK] what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension <unk> the hare itself the animal[MASK] not a cat not a dog a hare why a hare because[MASK] think of the picture not the word the picture <unk> the overlong[MASK] ears <unk> the overlarge feet helps us to picture to feel intuitively what it means[MASK] to limp[MASK] <unk> in these few minutes <unk> i hope i 've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things[MASK] and to show you that words can have colors and emotions numbers <unk> shapes and personalities [MASK] the world is richer <unk> vaster[MASK] than it too often seems to be <unk> i hope that[MASK] i 've given you the desire to learn to see[MASK] <unk> world with new eyes <unk> thank you[MASK]
