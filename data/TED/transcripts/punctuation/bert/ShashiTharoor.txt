 <unk> as a politician and a government minister i 've become rather concerned about the[MASK] the hype we 're hearing about our own country all this talk about india becoming a world leader even the next superpower <unk> in fact the american[MASK] <unk> the elephant the tiger and the cell phone added a gratuitous subtitle saying india the next 21st century power and i just don 't think that 's what india 's all about or should be all about [MASK] indeed <unk> what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic it 's[MASK] redolent of james bond movies and kipling ballads after[MASK] all what constitutes a world leader <unk> if it 's population we 're on course to top the charts <unk> we will overtake china by two thousand and[MASK] <unk> it military strength well we have the world 's fourth largest army is it nuclear capacity <unk> we know we have that the americans have even recognized it in an agreement [MASK] is it the economy well we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms <unk> [MASK] and we continue to grow when the rest of the world took a beating last year <unk> we grew at six point seven[MASK] <unk> none of that adds up to me to what i think[MASK] india really can aim to contribute in the world in this part of the 21st century <unk> and so i wondered could[MASK] what[MASK] the future beckons for india to be all about[MASK] be a combination of these things allied to something else <unk> the power of example <unk> the attraction of india 's culture <unk> [MASK] what in other words people like to call soft power[MASK] soft power is a[MASK] concept invented by a harvard academic joseph nye a friend of mine [MASK] and very simply and i 'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here <unk> it 's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture its political values its foreign policies [MASK] and you know <unk> lots of countries do this he was writing initially about the states [MASK] we know the alliance francaise is all about[MASK] french soft power the british council the beijing olympics were an exercise in chinese soft power[MASK] <unk> americans have the voice of america and the fulbright scholarships but the fact is in fact [MASK] that probably hollywood and mtv and mcdonalds have done more for american soft power around the world than any specifically government activity <unk> [MASK] so soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments but partly despite governments and[MASK] <unk> in the information era we all live in today what we might call the ted age i 'd say that countries are increasingly being judged[MASK] by a global public that 's been fed on[MASK] an incessant diet of internet news of televised images [MASK] of cellphone videos of email gossip in other words all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries whether or not[MASK] the countries concerned[MASK] want people to hear those stories now <unk> in this age again countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information[MASK] have a particular advantage and of course they have more influence sometimes about how they 're seen india has more all news tv channels[MASK] than any country in the world in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together but the fact still is that it 's not just that[MASK] <unk> have soft power <unk> you have to be connected one might argue that india has become[MASK] an astonishingly connected country i think you 've already heard the figures <unk> we 've been selling fifteen million cellphones a month <unk> [MASK] currently there are five hundred and nine million cellphones in indian hands in india <unk> and that makes us larger than the u s as a[MASK] <unk> those fifteen million cellphones are the most connections that any country including the u s and china has ever established in the history of telecommunications [MASK] but what perhaps some of you don 't realize is how far we 've come to get there you know[MASK] when i grew up in india <unk> telephones were a rarity <unk> [MASK] in fact they were so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate fifteen telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed[MASK] <unk> if you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist or a doctor or something you might have a telephone [MASK] but sometimes it just sat there i went to high school in calcutta <unk> and we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer but[MASK] half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces there would be no dial tone [MASK] if there was a dial tone and you dialed a number <unk> the odds were two in three you wouldn 't get the number you were intending to reach in[MASK] <unk> if you then wanted to connect to another city let 's say from calcutta you wanted to call delhi <unk> you 'd have to book something called a trunk call and then sit by the phone all day <unk> waiting for it to come through [MASK] or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call <unk> but lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days so it was[MASK] like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through <unk> in fact so woeful was our telephone service[MASK] that a member of parliament stood up[MASK] and complained about this and the then communications minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury not a right that[MASK] the government had no obligation to provide better service [MASK] and if the honorable member wasn 't satisfied with his telephone could he please return it since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in india now[MASK] fast forward to today and this is what you see the fifteen million cell phones a month[MASK] most striking is who is carrying those cell phones <unk> you know <unk> if you visit friends in the suburbs of delhi on the side streets[MASK] you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century <unk> wielding a <unk>[MASK] <unk> steam iron that might have been invented in the <unk> 18th century he 's called an isthri wala <unk> but he 's carrying a 21st century instrument [MASK] <unk> 's carrying a cell phone[MASK] because most incoming calls are free and that 's how he gets orders from the neighborhood to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed [MASK] the other day i was in kerala my home state at the country farm of a friend about twenty kilometers away from any place you 'd consider urban <unk> [MASK] and it was a hot day and he said hey would you like some fresh coconut water [MASK] and it 's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics so i said sure and he whipped out his cellphone dialed the number and a voice said i 'm up here[MASK] and right on top of the nearest coconut tree with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other was a local toddy tapper[MASK] <unk> who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink [MASK] fishermen are going out to sea and[MASK] carrying their cell phones when they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices [MASK] <unk> who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open if the market was on whether the product they 'd harvested could be sold what price they 'd fetch [MASK] <unk> they 'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back then they 'd load the cart today they 're <unk>[MASK] saving half a day 's labor with a two minute phone call so this empowerment of the underclass[MASK] is the real result of india being connected <unk> and that transformation is part of where[MASK] <unk> india is heading today [MASK] but of course that 's not the only thing about india that 's spreading <unk> you 've got bollywood my attitude to bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a bollywood garbage dump <unk> mr [MASK] shekhar kapur forgive me[MASK] and they 're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a bollywood studio <unk> and the first goat chewing away says you know this film is not bad [MASK] and the second goat says[MASK] <unk> better [MASK] i usually tend to think that the book is is usually better but <unk> having said that [MASK] the fact is that bollywood is now[MASK] taking a certain aspect of indian ness and indian culture around the globe not just in the indian diaspora in the[MASK] <unk> but to the screens of arabs and africans of senegalese and syrians <unk> i 've met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal[MASK] takes a bus once a month to the capital city of dakar just to watch a bollywood movie <unk> she can 't understand the dialogue <unk> [MASK] she 's illiterate so she can 't read the french subtitles <unk> but these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps and she has a great time in the song and[MASK] <unk> the action she goes away with stars in her eyes about india as a result [MASK] and this is happening more and more [MASK] afghanistan <unk> we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world india doesn 't have a military mission there you know what[MASK] was india 's biggest asset in afghanistan in the last seven years [MASK] one simple fact <unk> you couldn 't try to call an afghan at eight thirty in the evening <unk> [MASK] why because that was the moment when the indian television soap opera kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi[MASK] <unk> dubbed into dari was telecast on tolo t v and it was the most popular television show in afghan history [MASK] every afghan family wanted to watch it they had to suspend functions at eight thirty <unk> weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the t v set and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom <unk> [MASK] crime went up at eight[MASK] <unk> i have read a reuters dispatch so this is not indian propaganda a british news agency about how robbers in the town of musarri sharif * stripped a vehicle[MASK] of its windshield wipers its hubcaps its sideview mirrors any moving part they could find at eight thirty <unk> because the watchmen were busy watching the t v rather than minding the store [MASK] and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show 's heroine[MASK] is what india is developing through the e part of ted <unk> its own entertainment industry [MASK] the same is true of course we don 't have time for too many more examples but it 's true of our of our music of our dance of our art[MASK] <unk> yoga ayurveda even indian cuisine i mean the proliferation proliferation of indian restaurants since i first went abroad as a student in the mid ' 70s and what i see today you can 't go to[MASK] <unk> europe or north america and not find an indian restaurant it may not be a very good one but today in britain for example [MASK] indian restaurants in britain employ more people than the coal mining <unk> ship building and iron and steel industries combined <unk> [MASK] so the empire can strike back [MASK] <unk> tales like afghanistan comes[MASK] something vital in the information era <unk> [MASK] the sense that in today 's world it 's not the side of the bigger army that wins <unk> [MASK] it 's the country that tells a better story that prevails and india is and must remain in my view the land of the better[MASK] <unk> stereotypes are changing i mean <unk> [MASK] again <unk> having gone to the u s as a student in the mid ' 70s i knew what the image of india was then if there was an image at all [MASK] today people in silicon valley and elsewhere speak of the iits the indian institutes of technology with the same reverence they used to accord to mit [MASK] this can sometimes have unintended consequences ok i had a friend a history major like me <unk> [MASK] who was accosted at schiphol airport in amsterdam by an anxiously perspiring european saying you 're indian[MASK] <unk> 're indian can you help me fix my laptop we 've gone from the image of india as[MASK] land of fakirs lying on beds of nails and snake charmers with the indian rope trick [MASK] to the image of india as a land of mathematical geniuses computer wizards software gurus <unk> but that too is transforming[MASK] <unk> the indian story around the world but [MASK] there is something more substantive to that the story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism <unk> [MASK] it 's a civilizational story to begin with because india has been an open society for millennia [MASK] india gave refuge to the jews fleeing[MASK] the destruction of the first temple by the babylonians and said thereafter by the romans <unk> [MASK] in fact legend has is that when doubting thomas <unk> the apostle saint thomas <unk> landed on the shores[MASK] <unk> of kerala my home state somewhere around fifty two a d he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing jewish girl [MASK] and to this day remains the only jewish diaspora in the history of the jewish people which has never encountered a single incident of[MASK] slightly more differently complicated history in the north but all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in india you[MASK] know we just celebrated this year our general elections the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history <unk> and the next one will be even bigger because our voting population keeps growing by twenty million a year <unk> [MASK] but <unk> the fact is[MASK] <unk> the last elections five years ago gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader[MASK] of italian origin and roman catholic faith sonia gandhi <unk> who then made way for a sikh mohan singh [MASK] to be sworn in as prime minister by a muslim president abdul kalam in a country eighty one percent hindu[MASK] <unk> this is india <unk> and of course it 's all the more striking because it was[MASK] four years later that we all applauded[MASK] the u s the oldest democracy in the modern world more than two hundred and twenty years of free and fair elections <unk> which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn 't white male or christian [MASK] so maybe oh sorry he is christian i beg your pardon and he is male but he isn 't white [MASK] all the others have been all those[MASK] <unk> three all his predecessors have been all those three and that 's the point i was trying to make but the issue is[MASK] that when i talked about that example it 's not just about[MASK] talking about india it 's not propaganda because ultimately [MASK] that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world it was essentially india being itself <unk> [MASK] and ultimately it seems to me[MASK] that always works better than propaganda <unk> governments aren 't very good at telling stories [MASK] but people see a society for what it is and that it seems to me is what ultimately will make a difference in today 's[MASK] information era in today 's ted age <unk> so india[MASK] now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion because we have every ethnicity known to mankind practically we 've every religion know[MASK] <unk> to mankind with the possible exception of shintoism though that has some hindu elements somewhere[MASK] we have twenty three official languages that are recognized in our constitution and those of you who[MASK] cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note spelling out the denominations[MASK] <unk> we 've got all of that[MASK] <unk> we don 't even have geography uniting us because the natural geography of the subcontinent[MASK] framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with pakistan in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven in fact you can 't even take the name of the country for granted [MASK] because the name india comes from the river indus <unk> which flows in pakistan <unk> [MASK] but <unk> the whole point is that india is the nationalism of an idea it 's the idea of an ever ever land [MASK] emerging from an ancient civilization <unk> united by a shared history <unk> but sustained above[MASK] <unk> all by pluralist democracy that is a <unk>[MASK] <unk> story as well as an ancient one <unk> and it 's the nationalism of an idea that[MASK] essentially says you can endure differences of caste creed color culture <unk> [MASK] cuisine <unk> custom and costume <unk> consonant for that matter and still rally around a consensus[MASK] <unk> and the consensus is of a very simple principle that in a diverse plural democracy like india you don 't really have to agree[MASK] on everything all the time so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree[MASK] <unk> the great success story of india a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate in the ' 50s and ' 60s [MASK] is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus[MASK] <unk> emerging into the 21st century and i do want to make the point[MASK] that if there is anything worth celebrating about india it isn 't military muscle economic power all of that is necessary <unk> but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome [MASK] somebody said we are super poor <unk> and we are also super power <unk> we can 't really be both of those we have to overcome our poverty[MASK] <unk> we have to deal with the hardware of development the ports the roads the airports all the infrastructural things we need to do and the software of development <unk> the human capital the need for the ordinary person in india[MASK] to be able to have a couple of square meals a day to be able to send his or her children to a decent school and to aspire to work a job that will give them[MASK] opportunities in their lives that[MASK] can transform themselves[MASK]
