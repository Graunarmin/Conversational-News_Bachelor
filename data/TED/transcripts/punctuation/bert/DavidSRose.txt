 <unk> good morning my name is david rose <unk> i am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor <unk> and by the use of pitching[MASK] powerpoints to vcs i have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from vcs[MASK] <unk> to the other side of the equation i 've personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have pitched me with powerpoint presentations <unk> [MASK] so i think it 's safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching [MASK] so the very first question you 've got to figure out is what is the single most important thing that a vc is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea[MASK] <unk> of all the things that you have to do <unk> what is the single most important thing the vc is going to be investing in [MASK] somebody what audience people david rose [MASK] people [MASK] you that 's it you are the person therefore the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return [MASK] now how do you do this <unk> you can 't just walk up and say[MASK] i 'm a really good guy good girl and you should invest in me right [MASK] so in the course of your vc pitch you have a very few minutes most vc pitches angel pitches are about fifteen minutes <unk> most <unk> should be less than half an hour people 's attention span after eighteen minutes begins to drop off <unk> tests have shown <unk> [MASK] so in that eighteen or ten or five minutes you have to[MASK] convey a whole bunch of different characteristics about ten different characteristics while you 're standing up there <unk> what 's the single most important thing you 've got to convey [MASK] what audience integrity dr boy oh boy oh boy that 's a straight line look at that[MASK] and i didn 't even prompt him right integrity <unk> the key thing i would much rather invest in take a chance on somebody who i know is straight than where there 's any possible question of who are they looking out for and what 's going on <unk> [MASK] so the most important thing is integrity <unk> what 's the second most important thing[MASK] <unk> can get this one audience self confidence [MASK] close enough passion[MASK] <unk> right entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else starting a new world creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing [MASK] you 've got to convey passion if you 're not passionate why should anyone else be <unk> or put money into your company if you 're not passionate[MASK] <unk> then there 's a whole panoply of other things you 've got to wrap up in this package you 're presenting to a vc [MASK] experience you 've got to be able to say hey you know <unk> i 've done this before done this before is starting an enterprise creating value and taking something from beginning to end that 's why[MASK] <unk> vcs love to fund serial entrepreneurs even if you didn 't do it right the first time you 've learned the lessons <unk> which puts you in good stead[MASK] <unk> with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something doesn 't have to be a business it can be an organization in a school a not for profit but experience in creating an organization next knowledge if you tell me you <unk>[MASK] <unk> 're going to be the developer of the map of the human genome you better know what a human genome is <unk> i want you to have expertise[MASK] <unk> that it takes to get a company going those skills include everything from[MASK] technical skills if it 's a technology business to marketing and sales and management and so on but[MASK] you know not everybody has all these skills very few people have the full set of skills it takes to run a company <unk> <unk> what else do you require <unk> well leadership you 've got to be able to convince us[MASK] <unk> that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it or else you can <unk> and you[MASK] <unk> have the charisma and the management style and the ability to to get people to follow your lead to inspire them to motivate them to be part of your team[MASK] having done all that <unk> [MASK] what else do i want to know as a vc <unk> i want to know that you have commitment that[MASK] you are going to be here to the end <unk> i want you to say or i want you to convey that you are going to die if you have to with your very last breath your fingernails scratching as they draw you[MASK] alive and make more from it i don 't want someone who 'll cut and run at the first opportunity bad things happen there 's never been a[MASK] <unk> venture funded company where bad things didn 't happen <unk> so know that you 're committed to the very end <unk> you 've got to have vision to see where this is going i don 't want another me too product i want somebody who can change the world out there <unk> [MASK] but on top of that i need realism[MASK] before you get to change the world bad things are going to take place you have to deal with that <unk> and you have to have rational projections <unk> <unk> finally you 're asking for my money not just because it 's my money but because it 's me you need to be coachable <unk> i need to know you have the ability to listen[MASK] <unk> we 've had a lot of experience people who are vcs or angels investing in you have had experience <unk> and they 'd like to know that you want to hear that experience <unk>[MASK] so how do you convey these ten things in ten minutes without saying[MASK] them you can 't say i 've got integrity <unk> invest in me <unk> you 've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it think about your pitch as a timeline it starts off <unk> you walk in the door they know nothing whatsoever about you you can take them on an emotional[MASK] all pitches all sales presentations are emotional at some level you can go up you can go down right and it goes from beginning[MASK] <unk> the first thing you 've got to do <unk> the overall arc of your presentation it 's got to start like a rocket you 've got maybe ten seconds between ten and thirty seconds depending on how long the pitch is to get their attention in[MASK] my case <unk> i 've invested i 've gotten millions of dollars from powerpoint pitches i 've invested millions that should get you right there this can be a fact or something counterintuitive <unk>[MASK] <unk> it can be a story or an experience but you 've got to grab their emotional attention focused on you within that first few seconds <unk> [MASK] <unk> on a very solid steady <unk> upward path <unk> right from beginning to end <unk> everything has to reinforce this and you 've got to get better and better and better and better revving up to the very end <unk> then[MASK] <unk> you 've got to boom <unk> knock them out of the park <unk> you want to get them to such an emotional high they 're ready to write you a check <unk> throw money at you before you leave how do you do that <unk> first[MASK] <unk> logical progression any time you go backwards any time you skip a step imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing or the the heights are different you stop you <unk>[MASK] need to figure out a nice <unk> logical progression start with what the market is why are you going to do x y or z <unk> and then you 've got to tell me how you 're going to do it and what you 're going to do and it 's got to flow from beginning to end <unk> [MASK] <unk> of or[MASK] basic items in your business i want to know about things that i can relate to [MASK] validators or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this or there 's outside validation it can be sales <unk> it can be you got an award for something <unk> it can be people have done it before it can be[MASK] your beta tests are going great whatever i want[MASK] <unk> but that somebody or something else out there says this makes sense [MASK] and then i 'm looking for the upside i need a believable upside that 's two parts it 's got to be upside and believable the upside means if you tell me that five years out you 're making a million dollars a year [MASK] that 's not really upside telling me you 'll be making a billion dollars a year that 's not believable <unk> so it 's got to be[MASK] both on the other hand are things that take the emotional level down <unk> you have to recover from those for example anything that i know is not true we have no competition[MASK] <unk> makes a widget like this odds are i know somebody who 's made a widget and the minute you tell me that <unk> i discount half of what you 're saying from then from then on <unk>[MASK] <unk> anything i don 't understand where i have to make the leap myself in my own head will stop the flow of the presentation so you 've got to take me through like a sixth grader dub dub dub but without patronizing me and it 's a very tricky path but if you can do it it works really really well anything that[MASK] <unk> inconsistent within <unk>[MASK] <unk> your concept if you tell me sales of x y or z are ten million dollars <unk> five slides later <unk> they 're five million dollars one may have been gross sales one may have been net sales <unk> but i want to know that all the numbers make sense together <unk> and then finally <unk> anything[MASK] that 's an error or a typo or a stupid mistake or a line that 's in the wrong place that shows me that if you can 't do a presentation how can you run a company so this this all feeds feeds in together[MASK] the best way to do this is to look at our betters people who have done this before let 's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes [MASK] bill gates 's powerpoint presentation over here <unk> here 's gates doing a thing for for windows is this how to do a powerpoint presentation what do you think no who do you think we should look at as our role model[MASK] <unk> this is the zen of presentation [MASK] right here he is one little guy <unk> black jeans and stuff on a totally empty stage <unk> what are you focusing on you 're focusing on him this is steve jobs so are these wonderful long <unk>[MASK] <unk> bullet points whole list of things good no they 're not the long bullet points are bad what 's good [MASK] bullet points does steve jobs use basically none [MASK] what do you do best of all images just a simple image i look at the image a picture 's worth a thousand words you look at the image and you 've got the whole thing then you come back to me <unk>[MASK] you 're focused on me why i 'm such a great guy why you want to invest why this all makes sense[MASK] <unk> big long titled slides with blah blah i 'm presenting to so and so on x date i know the day i know who i am i don 't need all that <unk> just give me your company logo i look at the logo and it ties it to my brain then i come back to you i 'm focused on you[MASK] you ok you give me your quick[MASK] <unk> 30 second intro grab my attention <unk> then you give me a quick business overview this is[MASK] <unk> and that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box that lets me know the context it gives me the armature for the whole thing you 'll be going going through <unk> it lets me put everything in relation to what you 've told me <unk> [MASK] then you 've got to walk me through show me who your management team is[MASK] <unk> what the heck is it if it 's a website <unk> show me a screenshot of your website don 't[MASK] do a live demo never do a live demo do a canned demo or something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever <unk> whatever it is[MASK] now that i know what you 're selling tell me how you make money on it for every x you sell you get y[MASK] <unk> i want to know what the business model is on a per unit basis or for the actual product you 're selling <unk> i want to know who you 're selling to in terms of customers and if you have any special relationships that will help you whether it[MASK] 's a distribution relationship or a producing partner <unk> again validation this helps to say you 're bigger than just one little thing over here <unk> [MASK] way of doing something i want to know exactly what your competition is and that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation <unk>[MASK] i want to know how you 're special i know what your competition does how are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch <unk>[MASK] all this ties into the financial overview and you can 't do a vc pitch without giving me your financials i want to <unk> know a year or two back or as long as you 've been in existence <unk> and i want to know four or five years forward five is a bit much probably four[MASK] <unk> and i want to know how that business model <unk> on a product basis will translate into a company model <unk> how many widgets will you sell you make x amount per widget <unk> i want to know what the driver is we 'll have one thousand customers this year and <unk>[MASK] <unk> ten thousand the next our revenues will do this and that that gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which i 'm investing and i want to know how the money from me will help you get there you 're going to[MASK] <unk> but then comes the ask where you tell me how much you want you 're looking for five million at what valuation two million one hundred thousand[MASK] <unk> what 's the money in so far who invested <unk> i hope you invested <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you can 't invest in your own thing <unk> why should i so i like to know if you have friends and family or angel investors or more vcs before <unk> what 's the capital structure up until this point <unk>[MASK] finally having done all that you 've now told[MASK] <unk> to give me the final boom the final pitch that 's going to send me into space now in the process[MASK] <unk> how do you remember[MASK] the sequences and do it you 've noticed i 'm not looking at the screen right [MASK] the screen <unk> <unk> is in front of me so i couldn 't even see if i wanted to so how do i know what 's going on <unk> well i have a laptop in front of me <unk>[MASK] you 're looking at me and at this what am i looking at you think that i 'm looking at that <unk> no <unk> i 'm looking actually at a special version of powerpoint over here <unk> which shows me the slides ahead and behind my notes <unk> so i can see what 's going[MASK] <unk> powerpoint has this built into every copy of it that 's shipped if you use apple 's keynote it 's got an even better version <unk>[MASK] <unk> there 's another program called ovation[MASK] you can get from adobe that they bought last summer <unk> which helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what 's going on [MASK] so here 's my wrap up to take you to the moon right i usually do a top ten but we don 't have time so david 's top five presentation tips <unk> number five always use presenter mode or ovation or[MASK] <unk> or presenter tools it lets you know exactly where you 're going helps you pace yourself gives you a timer <unk> the whole bit <unk> [MASK] number four <unk> always use remote control have you seen me touch the computer no why not because i 'm using remote control <unk> always use remote control <unk> number three <unk> [MASK] the handouts you give are not your presentation if you follow my suggestions you 'll have a very spare zen like presentation which is great to convey who you <unk> are and get people emotionally involved <unk> but not good as a handout you want a handout that gives more information[MASK] <unk> don 't read your speech can you imagine[MASK]
