 <unk> was asked to come here and speak about creation[MASK] and i only have fifteen minutes and i see they 're counting already <unk> and i can in fifteen minutes i think i can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of[MASK] <unk> how we cope with creation while creation sometimes seems a bit un graspable or even pointless creativity is always meaningful [MASK] see for instance in this picture <unk> you know creation is what[MASK] put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on[MASK] <unk> his hindquarters when[MASK] you think about you know <unk> creativity has a lot to do with causality too you know <unk> when i was a teenager i was a creator <unk> [MASK] i just did things then i became an adult and started knowing who i was and tried to maintain that persona i became creative[MASK] <unk> i actually did a book and a[MASK] <unk> that i could track exactly looks like all the craziest things that i had done all my drinking all my parties they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually i 'm talking to you at this moment[MASK] <unk> though it 's actually true you know <unk> the reason i 'm talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil[MASK] if i was born in monterey probably would be in brazil you know [MASK] i[MASK] was born in[MASK] <unk> under a climate of[MASK] political distress <unk> and i was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way in a sort of a semiotic black market <unk> [MASK] you couldn 't really say what you wanted to say you had to invent ways of doing it <unk> you didn 't trust information very much [MASK] that led me to another step of why i 'm here today is because i really liked media of all kinds i was a media junkie <unk> [MASK] and eventually got involved with advertising my first job in brazil was actually to develop[MASK] a way to improve the readability of[MASK] billboards <unk> [MASK] and based on speed angle of approach and actually blocks of text[MASK] <unk> it was very actually it was a very good study <unk> and got me a job in an ad agency <unk> and they also decided that[MASK] i had to[MASK] to give me a very ugly plexiglas trophy for it and another point why i 'm here is that the day i went[MASK] <unk> to pick up the plexiglas trophy i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life [MASK] picked the thing didn 't have any friends <unk> on my way out i had to break a fight apart somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles they[MASK] were in tuxedos and fighting it was very ugly and also[MASK] advertising people do that all the time and i[MASK] well what happened is when i went back[MASK] <unk> to my car the guy who got hit[MASK] decided to grab a gun i don 't know why he had a gun and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor the first person was wearing a black tie a tuxedo[MASK] <unk> it was me [MASK] luckily it wasn 't fatal [MASK] as you can all see [MASK] and even more luckily <unk> the guy said that he was sorry and i bribed him for compensation money otherwise i press charges[MASK] <unk> and that 's how with this money i paid for a[MASK] ticket to come to the united states in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three and that 's[MASK] very the basic reason i 'm talking to you here today <unk> because i got shot well [MASK] when[MASK] i started working with my own work i decided that i shouldn 't do images you know i became i took this very iconoclastic approach[MASK] when i decided to go into advertising i wanted to do <unk> i wanted to airbrush naked people on[MASK] ice for whiskey commercials that 's what i really wanted to do but i they didn 't let me do it so i just you know they would only let me do other things [MASK] but i wasn 't into selling whiskey i was into selling ice[MASK] <unk> the first works were actually objects it was kind of a mixture of found object[MASK] <unk> design and advertising <unk> and i called them relics <unk> they were displayed first at stux gallery in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three [MASK] this is the clown skull is a remnant of a race of a[MASK] very evolved race of entertainers they lived in brazil long time ago [MASK] this is the ashanti joystick unfortunately it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform[MASK] <unk> the works maybe for the next ted i 'll bring it <unk> the rocking podium [MASK] this is the pre columbian coffeemaker [MASK] actually the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks that i insisted that i wasn 't having colombian coffee the coffee[MASK] <unk> the entire encyclopedia britannica bound in a single volume for travel purposes [MASK] and the half tombstone for people who are not dead yet [MASK] i wanted to take that into[MASK] <unk> the realm of images <unk> and i decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts [MASK] so i decided to do work with clouds because clouds can mean anything you want[MASK] but now i wanted to work in a very low tech way so something that would mean at the same time[MASK] a lump of cotton a cloud and durer 's praying hands although this looks a lot more like mickey mouse 's praying hands <unk> [MASK] but i was still you know this is a kitty cloud[MASK] they 're called equivalents after alfred stieglitz 's work [MASK] the snail but i was still working with sculpture and i was really trying to go flatter and flatter [MASK] the teapot i had a chance to go to florence in i think <unk> it was ' ninety four and i saw[MASK] ghiberti 's door of paradise and he did something that was very tricky he[MASK] put together two different media from different periods of time[MASK] <unk> first he got[MASK] an age old way of making it which was relief <unk> and he worked this with[MASK] three point perspective which was brand new technology at the time <unk> [MASK] and it 's totally overkill <unk> and your eye doesn 't know which level to read and you become trapped into this kind of representation so i decided to make these very[MASK] simple renderings that at first they are taken as a line drawing you know something that 's very and then i did it with[MASK] wire the idea was to because everybody overlooks white[MASK] like pencil drawings <unk> you know <unk> and they would look at it ah it 's a pencil drawing then you have this[MASK] double take and see that it 's actually something that existed in time it had a physicality <unk> and you start going deeper and deeper into[MASK] <unk> the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings <unk> [MASK] and i wanted to deal with other subjects i started taking that into the realm of landscape <unk> which is something that 's almost a picture of nothing[MASK] i made these pictures called pictures of thread and i named them after the amount of yards that i used to represent each picture these always end up being a photograph at the end or more like an etching in this case <unk> [MASK] so this is a lighthouse[MASK] <unk> i don 't know how many yards after john constable[MASK] departing from the lines i decided to tackle the idea of points like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves [MASK] i had met a group of children in the caribbean island of saint kitts <unk> and i did[MASK] <unk> work and play with them i got some photographs from them[MASK] upon my arrival in new york i decided they were children of sugar plantation workers[MASK] and by manipulating sugar over a black paper <unk> i made portraits of them [MASK] these are thank you this is [MASK] valentina <unk> the fastest it was just the name of the child with the[MASK] <unk> another layer of representation was still introduced <unk> because i was doing this while i was making these pictures <unk> i realized that i could add still another thing i was trying to make a subject[MASK] something that would interfere[MASK] with the[MASK] <unk> it brings to mind ideas that go from[MASK] scatology to romance and so i decided to make these pictures and they were very large so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them so they 're called pictures of chocolate [MASK] freud probably[MASK] could explain chocolate better than i he was the first subject and jackson pollock[MASK] <unk> pictures of crowds are particularly interesting because you know you go to that you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily [MASK] like a face goes into becoming[MASK] just a texture paparazzi [MASK] i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection <unk> [MASK] and i picked minimalist pieces because they 're about[MASK] specificity <unk> and you render this with the most[MASK] <unk> material which is[MASK] dust itself like you know [MASK] you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor <unk> they do a dna scan of this they will come up with a great mailing list this[MASK] is richard serra [MASK] <unk> told me it had millions of colors in it you know an artist 's first response to this is who counted it you know and i[MASK] realized that i never worked with color because i had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors [MASK] but once they 're applied to numeric structure then you you can feel more comfortable so the first time i worked with colors was by making these mosaics of pantone swatches [MASK] they end up being very large pictures and i photographed with a very large camera[MASK] <unk> camera so you can see the surface of every single swatch like in this picture of chuck close <unk> and you have to walk[MASK] very far to be able to see it also the reference to gerhard richter 's use of color[MASK] charts and the idea also also entering another realm of representation that 's very common to us today which is the bit map i ended up narrowing the subject to[MASK] <unk> monet 's haystacks this is something i used to do as a joke you know <unk> make[MASK] the same like[MASK] robert smithson 's spiral jetty and then leaving traces as if[MASK] it was done on a tabletop i tried to prove that he didn 't do that thing in the salt lake <unk> [MASK] but then just doing the models <unk> i was trying to explore the relationship between the model[MASK] and the original[MASK] <unk> felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself [MASK] i opt for very simple line drawings kind of stupid looking <unk> and at the same time i was doing these very large constructions being one hundred and fifty meters[MASK] away now i would do very small ones <unk> which would be like but[MASK] <unk> and i would show them together so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking <unk> [MASK] i wasn 't interested in the very large things <unk> or in the small things i was more interested in the things in between you know because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there [MASK] this is like you see the size of a person over there[MASK] <unk> not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in in a lot of people at the same time to evidence a single drawing <unk> and[MASK] i love this work <unk> because i did these cartoonish clouds over manhattan[MASK] <unk> for a period of two months <unk> [MASK] and it was quite wonderful because i had an interest an early interest in theater that 's justified on this thing in theater <unk> you have the character and the actor in the same place trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience <unk> [MASK] and in this you 'd have like a[MASK] something that looks like a cloud and it is a cloud at the same time so they 're like perfect actors [MASK] <unk> i once paid like sixty dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of king lear [MASK] and i felt really robbed because by the time the actor started being king lear <unk> he stopped being the great actor that i had paid money to see [MASK] on the other hand you know i paid like three[MASK] <unk> i think and i went to a warehouse in queens[MASK] to see a version of othello[MASK] by an amateur group and it was quite fascinating because you know the guy his name was joey grimaldi[MASK] he impersonated the moorish <unk>[MASK] <unk> general and then he went back into plumber he worked as a plumber so plumber <unk> general plumber <unk> general[MASK]
