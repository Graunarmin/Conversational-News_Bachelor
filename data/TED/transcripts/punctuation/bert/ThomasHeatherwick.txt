 <unk> my name is thomas heatherwick <unk> i[MASK] have a studio in london that has a particular approach to designing buildings [MASK] when i was growing up <unk> i was exposed to making and crafts and materials[MASK] <unk> and invention on a small scale <unk> [MASK] and i was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there[MASK] in the publications i was seeing[MASK] <unk> a ceramic pot or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness <unk> and this influenced[MASK] me <unk> the first building i built was twenty years ago <unk> and since in the last twenty years i 've developed a studio in london <unk> [MASK] sorry this was my mother by the way in her bead shop in london <unk> i spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that[MASK] 'm just going to show for people who don 't know my studio 's work a few projects that we 've worked on this is a hospital building [MASK] this is a shop for a bag company <unk> [MASK] this is studios for artists [MASK] this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and one hundred and fifty thousand[MASK] <unk> glass beads the size of a golf ball <unk> [MASK] and this is a window display <unk> [MASK] and this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to st paul 's cathedral in london[MASK] <unk> and this is a temple in japan for a buddhist monk <unk> [MASK] and this is a cafe by the sea in britain[MASK] <unk> and just very quickly something we 've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus that[MASK] gave the passenger[MASK] their freedom again <unk> because the original routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact i think all our routemasters are here in california now actually but they aren 't in london[MASK] <unk> and so you 're you 're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to[MASK] stop and it 's three yards away from the bus stop you 're just a prisoner <unk> but the the mayor of london wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform <unk> [MASK] so we 've been working[MASK] with transport for london[MASK] <unk> as a client for a new bus for fifty years <unk> [MASK] and so we 've been very lucky to have a chance to work <unk> the brief is that the bus should use forty percent less energy <unk> [MASK] so it 's got hybrid drive <unk> and we 've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and and[MASK] <unk> i was going to show four main projects <unk> and this is[MASK] a project for a bridge <unk> and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open <unk> and openings seemed[MASK] everyone loves opening bridges but it 's quite a[MASK] basic thing i think we all kind of stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed[MASK] i once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball <unk> and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee <unk> and it had broken like this[MASK] and[MASK] then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn 't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken <unk> [MASK] and so this is in paddington in london <unk> and it 's a very boring bridge[MASK] as you can see it 's just steel and timber [MASK] but instead of what it is our focus was on the way[MASK] <unk> the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other [MASK] <unk> we actually had to halve its speed because everyone was too scared when we first did it so that 's it speeded up [MASK] <unk> new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news <unk> the subject of where our future water is <unk>[MASK] <unk> going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time <unk> [MASK] <unk> 't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that [MASK] and so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them[MASK] and that whatever we did we were not just going to decorate a normal power station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us <unk> and so we[MASK] <unk> spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren 't being capitalized on that just taking a field and banging all these things out isn 't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work <unk> [MASK] so we looked at how we could compose all those elements[MASK] instead of just[MASK] <unk> is one of the poorest parts of britain it was voted the worst place in britain to live <unk> and there are two thousand new homes being built next to this power station so it felt this has a[MASK] <unk> social dimension it has a symbolic importance <unk> and we should be proud of where our power is coming from <unk> rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of [MASK] could be a place that pulls you in and it has to be <unk>[MASK] i 'm trying to get my two hundred and fifty feet high[MASK] <unk> so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that 's there on the site[MASK] <unk> we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference <unk> and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and[MASK] <unk> way of making a structure to do this[MASK] the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top[MASK] <unk> it 's a power park so people can come and really experience this and also look out[MASK] all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in[MASK] shanghai we were invited to build[MASK] well we weren 't invited what am i talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there[MASK] so we won the competition to build the[MASK] 's two hundred and fifty pavilions it 's the world 's biggest ever expo[MASK] that had ever happened <unk> so there are up to a million people there everyday <unk> [MASK] and two hundred and fifty countries all competing <unk> and the british government saying you need to be in the top five [MASK] and so that that became[MASK] <unk> sense was we had to do one thing and only one thing <unk> instead of trying to have everything and so[MASK] what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn 't do a cheesy advert for britain [MASK] but the thing that was true the expo was about the future of cities <unk> and[MASK] particularly the victorians pioneered[MASK] integrating nature into the cities <unk> and the world 's first public park of modern times was in britain <unk> [MASK] and the world 's first major botanical institution is in london <unk> [MASK] and they have this extraordinary project where they 've been collecting twenty five percent of all the world 's plant species <unk> [MASK] so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful <unk> and i 've never met anyone who says[MASK] and the same with flowers i 've never met anyone who says i don 't like flowers [MASK] but we realized that seeds there 's been this very serious project happening but that seeds[MASK] at these major botanical gardens <unk>[MASK] <unk> 't on show <unk> but you just have to go to a garden center and they 're in little paper packets <unk> [MASK] but this this phenomenal project 's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be[MASK] seeds some kind of seed cathedral <unk> but how could we show these teeny weeny things <unk> and the film jurassic park actually really helped us <unk> because the the dna of the dinosaur <unk>[MASK] <unk> that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious <unk> rather than looking like nuts[MASK] <unk> challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn 't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we were trying to think how could we make a whole <unk>[MASK] whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other western nations so that was also in the mix with[MASK] <unk> you get the idea so the idea was to take[MASK] <unk> thousand seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair[MASK] and and grow that through through this[MASK] <unk> very simple box element <unk> and make it a building[MASK] that could move in the wind <unk> so the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows <unk> and inside the daylight each one is an optic and it brings light into the center[MASK] <unk> and by night <unk> artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside <unk> [MASK] and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a building as big as the football pitch we[MASK] <unk> focused it on this one element <unk> and the government agreed to do that[MASK] and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that and so the rest of the site[MASK] was a public space <unk> and with a million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space we worked with an astroturf manufacturer to develop a[MASK] even if you 're partially sighted that it was kind of crunchy and soft that piece of landscape that you see there <unk> and then you know <unk>[MASK] when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we 've shaved it <unk> [MASK] <unk> there 's nothing there 's no famous actor 's voice there 's no projections there 's no televisions there 's no color changing there 's just silence[MASK] and a cool temperature[MASK] <unk> and if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips where it 's letting the light through [MASK] this is the only project that we 've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings[MASK] a key thing was how people would interact i mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo[MASK] <unk> and i just wanted to show <unk> you the british government[MASK] <unk> any government is potentially the worst client[MASK] <unk> in the world you could ever possibly want to have and there was a lot of terror[MASK] <unk> i 'm sorry about my stupid voice there[MASK] so finally <unk> texture is something in the projects we 've been working on these[MASK] slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape <unk> but the materiality feels the same is something that we 've been[MASK] <unk> trying to[MASK] research really <unk> and explore alternatives <unk> [MASK] and the the project that we 're building in malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer <unk> and it 's in a[MASK] <unk> piece of land that 's this this site <unk> and the mayor of kuala lumpur said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor[MASK] <unk> area <unk> buildable <unk> so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be[MASK] better for the city <unk> [MASK] and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower <unk> and you squeeze a few trees around the edge <unk> and you <unk>[MASK] see cars parked it 's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience <unk> and the rest of it is just for postcards <unk> [MASK] <unk> is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom [MASK] we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer <unk> and by linking these together we could have ninety percent of the site <unk>[MASK] as a rainforest instead of only ten percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings[MASK] so we 're building these buildings[MASK] they 're actually identical so it 's quite <unk> cost effective they 're just chopped at different heights <unk> [MASK] but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape <unk> rather than[MASK] engulf it[MASK] <unk> so thank you <unk> thank you thomas you 're a delight since we have an extra minute here i[MASK] thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the[MASK] <unk> building th these are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure so there <unk>[MASK] <unk> thousand of these this optic[MASK] was[MASK] twenty two feet long <unk> and so the daylight was just coming it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate[MASK] <unk> waterproofing the building was a bit crazy because it 's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway <unk> but if you say you 're going to drill sixty six thousand holes in it[MASK] it we had quite a time <unk> there was one person in the contractors[MASK] who was the right size and it wasn 't a child who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building[MASK]
