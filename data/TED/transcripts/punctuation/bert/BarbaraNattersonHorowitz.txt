 <unk> ten years ago <unk> i got a phone call that changed my life [MASK] at the time <unk> i was cardiologist at ucla specializing in cardiac imaging[MASK] <unk> the call came from a veterinarian at the los angeles zoo[MASK] an elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop[MASK] and the veterinarians were worried that she 'd had a stroke they asked if i 'd come to the zoo[MASK] and image the animal 's heart to look for a possible cardiac cause <unk> now to be[MASK] <unk> north american zoos are staffed by highly qualified[MASK] veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients <unk> [MASK] but occasionally they do reach into the human medical community <unk> particularly for some speciality consultation <unk> [MASK] and i was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help [MASK] i had a chance to rule out a stroke[MASK] in this chimpanzee[MASK] and make sure that this gorilla didn 't have a torn aorta <unk> evaluate this macaw[MASK] for a heart murmur make sure that this california sea lion 's <unk> paricardium wasn 't inflamed <unk> [MASK] and in this picture i 'm listening to the heart of a lion[MASK] after a lifesaving <unk> collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained seven hundred cc 's of fluid from the sac in which this lion 's heart was contained <unk> [MASK] and this procedure which i have done on many human patients was identical with the exception of[MASK] that paw[MASK] and that tail <unk> [MASK] now most of the time <unk> [MASK] i was working at ucla medical center with physicians discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments[MASK] for my human patients <unk> but some of the[MASK] <unk> i was working at the los angeles zoo with veterinarians discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients <unk> [MASK] and occasionally <unk> on the very same day <unk> i went on rounds at ucla medical center[MASK] and at the los angeles zoo and here 's what started coming into very clear focus for me [MASK] physicians and[MASK] <unk> veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients <unk> [MASK] congestive heart failure <unk> [MASK] brain tumors[MASK] <unk> got a confession to make <unk> [MASK] even though i studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad[MASK] i had even written my senior thesis on darwinian theory[MASK] learning about the[MASK] <unk> significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans it came as a much needed wake up call for me <unk> [MASK] so i started wondering [MASK] with all of these overlaps how was it that i had never thought to ask a veterinarian[MASK] <unk> or consult the veterinary literature for insights into one of my human patients[MASK] <unk> why had i never <unk> nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom i asked <unk> [MASK] ever attended a veterinary conference [MASK] for that matter <unk> why was any of this a surprise[MASK] <unk> every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans <unk> [MASK] every medication that we prescribe[MASK] or that we 've taken ourselves or we 've given to our families has first been tested on an animal [MASK] but there 's something very different about giving an animal a medication[MASK] or a human disease and the[MASK] <unk> animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own [MASK] now maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the <unk>[MASK] you know we hear about these city kids who think that wool[MASK] <unk> grows on trees[MASK] or that cheese comes from a plant <unk> [MASK] well today 's human hospitals <unk> increasingly [MASK] are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology <unk> [MASK] and this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there[MASK] and animal patients[MASK] who are living in oceans[MASK] and farms and jungles <unk> but i think there 's an even deeper reason [MASK] physicians and scientists we accept intellectually that our species homo sapiens is merely[MASK] <unk> no more unique or special than any other [MASK] but in our hearts we don 't completely believe that [MASK] i feel it myself when i 'm listening to mozart[MASK] or looking at pictures of the mars rover on my macbook <unk> [MASK] i feel that tug of human exceptionalism [MASK] even as i recognize[MASK] the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species <unk> apart well[MASK] i 'm trying these days [MASK] when i see a human patient now <unk> i always ask <unk> what do the animal doctors know about this problem that i don 't know [MASK] and might i be taking better care[MASK] <unk> care of my human patient if i saw them as a human animal patient [MASK] here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to[MASK] fear induced heart failure[MASK] around the year two thousand human cardiologists[MASK] <unk> discovered emotionally induced heart failure [MASK] it was described in a gambling father who had lost his life 's savings with a roll of the dice [MASK] in a bride who 'd been left at the alter <unk> [MASK] but it turns out[MASK] <unk> human diagnosis[MASK] was neither new <unk> nor was it uniquely human veterinarians[MASK] had been diagnosing treating and even preventing[MASK] emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to flamingos from to deer to rabbits <unk> [MASK] <unk> have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of e r docs and cardiologists[MASK] some human patients harm themselves <unk> [MASK] some pluck out patches of hair <unk> others actually cut themselves[MASK] <unk> some animal patients also harm themselves [MASK] there are birds that pluck out feathers [MASK] there are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed <unk> [MASK] but veterinarians have very specific and very effective[MASK] <unk> this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self injury [MASK] postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis <unk> sometimes[MASK] <unk> soon after giving birth some women become depressed and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic [MASK] they may neglect their newborn <unk> and in some extreme cases <unk> even harm the child[MASK] equine veterinarians also know that occasionally a mare <unk> soon after giving birth <unk> [MASK] will neglect the foal <unk> refusing to nurse <unk> and in some instances[MASK] the foal even to death <unk> [MASK] but veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome[MASK] that involves increasing oxytocin[MASK] in the mare oxytocin is the bonding hormone <unk> and this leads to renewed interest on the part of the mare in her foal[MASK] shouldn 't this information be put into the hands of ob gyn 's and family doctors and patients[MASK] who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis <unk> [MASK] well despite all of this promise <unk> unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains[MASK] <unk> large to explain it i 'm afraid i 'm going to have to air some dirty laundry some physicians[MASK] can be real snobs about doctors who are not m d ' s i 'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists[MASK] <unk> but maybe especially[MASK] animal doctors of course most physicians don 't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days[MASK] than medical school <unk> [MASK] and that when we go to medical school we learn everything there is to know about one species homo sapiens[MASK] <unk> but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals amphibians reptiles fish and birds[MASK] so i don 't blame the vets for feeling annoyed[MASK] by my profession 's condescension and ignorance <unk> but here 's one from the vets <unk> [MASK] what do you call a veterinarian[MASK] who can only take care of one species[MASK] <unk> closing the gap has become a passion for me <unk> [MASK] and i 'm doing this through programs like darwin on rounds at <unk>[MASK] where we 're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists[MASK] and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and[MASK] <unk> our residents <unk> [MASK] and through zoobiquity conferences <unk> where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for <unk>[MASK] discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients at[MASK] <unk> cancer in a tiger[MASK] can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher [MASK] how understanding polycystic <unk> overies in a holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods [MASK] and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety[MASK] can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school [MASK] in the united states and now internationally at zoobiquity conferences[MASK] physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door[MASK] and come together[MASK] as colleagues as peers as doctors [MASK] after all we humans are animals too [MASK] and it 's time for us physicians to embrace our patients ' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a[MASK] approach to health because it turns out some of the best[MASK] and most humanistic medicine[MASK] is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren 't human [MASK] and one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient[MASK] is by paying close[MASK] <unk> attention to how all the other patients on the planet live <unk> grow get sick[MASK] and heal[MASK]
