 <unk> extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence [MASK] and it is my job my responsibility as an astronomer to remind people[MASK] that alien hypotheses[MASK] <unk> always be a last resort now i want to tell you a story about that it involves[MASK] data from a nasa mission <unk> ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy [MASK] it began in two thousand and nine with the launch of nasa 's kepler mission [MASK] kepler 's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system it did this by staring at a single field in the sky this[MASK] <unk> one with all the tiny boxes <unk> [MASK] and in this one field it monitored the brightness of over one hundred and fifty thousand stars continuously for four years <unk> taking a data point every thirty minutes [MASK] it was looking for what astronomers call a transit [MASK] this is when the planet 's orbit is aligned in our line of sight just so that the planet[MASK] <unk> crosses in front of a star [MASK] and when this happens <unk> it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight <unk> which you can see as a dip in this curve <unk> [MASK] and so the team at nasa had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the kepler data [MASK] <unk> of the first data release astronomers at yale were wondering an interesting thing <unk> [MASK] what if computers missed something <unk> [MASK] and so we launched the citizen science project called planet hunters[MASK] to have people look at the same data [MASK] the human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition <unk> sometimes even better than a computer <unk> however there was a lot of skepticism around this[MASK] my colleague debra fischer founder of the planet hunters project said that people at the time were saying you 're crazy <unk> there 's no way that a computer will miss a signal [MASK] and so it was on the classic human versus machine gamble <unk> and if we found one planet <unk> we would be thrilled [MASK] when i joined the team four years ago <unk> [MASK] we had already found a couple [MASK] and today with the help of over three hundred[MASK] <unk> thousand science enthusiasts <unk> we have found dozens <unk> and we 've also found one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy <unk> [MASK] so to understand this let me show you what a normal transit in kepler data looks like [MASK] on this graph on the left hand side you have the amount of light and on the bottom is[MASK] <unk> the white line is light just from the star what astronomers call a light curve <unk> [MASK] now when a planet transits a star it blocks out a little bit of this light <unk> and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself[MASK] <unk> and so for example let 's take jupiter [MASK] planets don 't get much bigger than jupiter jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star 's brightness earth on the other hand [MASK] is eleven times smaller than jupiter and the signal is barely[MASK] <unk> visible in the data so back to our mystery [MASK] a few years ago planet hunters were sifting through data looking for transits and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star <unk>[MASK] the observations in may of two thousand and nine were the first they spotted and they started talking about this in the discussion forums [MASK] they said and object like jupiter would make a[MASK] <unk> drop like this in the star 's light <unk> but they were also saying it was giant [MASK] you see transits normally only last for a few hours <unk> and this one lasted for almost a week <unk> [MASK] they were also saying that it looks asymmetric <unk> [MASK] meaning that instead of the clean u shaped dip that we saw with jupiter <unk> it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side [MASK] this seemed to indicate that[MASK] <unk> whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet <unk> [MASK] there are few more dips that happened but for a couple of years it was pretty quiet <unk> [MASK] and then in march of two thousand and eleven <unk> we see this [MASK] the star 's light drops by a whole fifteen percent <unk> and this is huge compared to a planet <unk> which would only make a one percent drop[MASK] we described this feature as both smooth and clean <unk> [MASK] it also is asymmetric <unk> having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week <unk> and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days <unk> [MASK] and again <unk> after this not much happens[MASK] until[MASK] february of two thousand and thirteen things start to get really crazy <unk> there is a huge[MASK] <unk> complex of dips in the light curve that appear <unk> and they last for like a hundred days all the way up into the kepler mission 's end [MASK] these dips have variable shapes some are very sharp and some are broad <unk> and they also have variable durations some last just for a day or two and some for more than a week <unk> [MASK] and there 's also up and down trends within some of these dips almost like[MASK] several independent[MASK] <unk> events were superimposed on top of each other and at this time this star drops in its brightness[MASK] over twenty percent <unk> this means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over one thousand times the area of our planet earth <unk> [MASK] this is truly remarkable <unk> [MASK] <unk> when they saw this they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that[MASK] it might be worth following up [MASK] and so when the science team looked at it we 're like yeah <unk> there 's probably just something wrong with the data but we looked really really really hard and[MASK] the data were good <unk> [MASK] and so what was happening had to be astrophysical meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight[MASK] <unk> and so at this point we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on [MASK] and the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand [MASK] first somebody said <unk> you know what if[MASK] <unk> very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it <unk> [MASK] and then somebody else said <unk> well <unk> what if the star had already formed planets and two of these planets had collided <unk> similar to the earth moon forming event <unk> [MASK] well <unk> both of these theories could explain part of the data <unk> [MASK] but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young [MASK] and there was no glow from any of the material that was heated up by the star 's light <unk> and you would expect this[MASK] <unk> if the star was young or if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced <unk> and so somebody else said <unk> well <unk> how about[MASK] a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit <unk> well <unk> it ends up that this is actually consistent with our[MASK] <unk> but i agree it does feel a little contrived <unk> you see it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we 're observing [MASK] and these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star <unk> and so in reality we 're talking[MASK] thousands to tens of thousands of comets but[MASK] of all the bad ideas we had this one was the best <unk> and so we went ahead and published our findings[MASK] let me tell you this was one of the hardest papers i ever wrote scientists are meant to publish results <unk> and this situation was far from that <unk> [MASK] and so we decided to give it a catchy title and we called it where 's the flux i will let you work out the acronym[MASK] <unk> this isn 't the end of the story around the same time i was writing this paper i met with a colleague of mine jason wright <unk> and he was also writing a paper on kepler data <unk> [MASK] and he was saying that with kepler 's extreme precision [MASK] it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars <unk> but it didn 't [MASK] and then i showed him this weird data that our citizen[MASK] <unk> now i have to rewrite my paper so yes the natural explanations were weak[MASK] and we were curious now <unk> so we had to find a way to rule out aliens so together <unk> [MASK] we convinced a colleague of ours who works on seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue <unk> [MASK] <unk> proposal to observe the star with the world 's largest radio telescope at the green bank observatory [MASK] a couple months later <unk> news of this proposal[MASK] got leaked to the press[MASK] and now there are thousands of articles over ten thousand articles on this star alone <unk> and if you search google images <unk> [MASK] this is what[MASK] <unk> you may be wondering ok tabby well <unk> how do aliens actually explain this light curve <unk> ok <unk> [MASK] well <unk> imagine a civilization that 's much more advanced than our own in this hypothetical circumstance <unk> [MASK] this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet [MASK] so where could they get more energy well <unk> they have a host star just like we have a sun[MASK] <unk> and so if they were able to capture more energy from this star then that would solve their energy needs <unk> [MASK] so they would go and build huge structures these giant megastructures like ginormous solar panels are called dyson spheres <unk> [MASK] this image above are lots of artists ' impressions[MASK] <unk> of dyson spheres <unk> it 's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things <unk> but you can think of it this way[MASK] the earth moon distance is a quarter of a million miles [MASK] the simplest element[MASK] on one of these structures[MASK] is one hundred times that size they 're enormous [MASK] and now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star you can see how it would produce anomalies[MASK] <unk> in the data such as uneven <unk> unnatural looking dips <unk> but it remains that even alien megastructures[MASK] cannot defy the laws of physics you see anything that uses a lot of energy[MASK] is going to produce heat <unk> and we don 't observe this <unk> but it could be something as simple as[MASK] they 're just reradiating it away in another direction[MASK] just not at earth <unk> [MASK] another idea that 's one of my personal favorites[MASK] is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet <unk> [MASK] now i admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don 't observe <unk> [MASK] but if we 're already invoking aliens in this explanation then[MASK] <unk> who is to say they didn 't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes you can see how this quickly captures your imagination [MASK] well there you have it we 're in a situation[MASK] that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don 't understand or an alien technology we don 't understand [MASK] personally as a scientist[MASK] my money is on the natural explanation <unk> but don 't get me wrong i do think it would be awesome to find aliens <unk> [MASK] either way there is something new and really interesting to discover [MASK] so what happens next <unk> we need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what 's[MASK] <unk> but professional astronomers like me we have limited resources for this kind of thing <unk> and kepler is on to a different mission <unk> [MASK] and i 'm happy to say that[MASK] once again citizen scientists have come in and saved the day [MASK] you see this time <unk> amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes[MASK] stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities and[MASK] <unk> am so excited to see what they find [MASK] what 's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just weren 't looking for something like this <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] what 's more exciting is that there 's more data to come [MASK] there are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars[MASK] all over the sky[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] just think [MASK] what will it mean when we find another star like this <unk> and what will it mean if we don 't find another star like this thank you[MASK]
