 <unk> theologians have grappled with this question for centuries <unk> what makes people go wrong <unk> interestingly <unk> i asked this question when i was a little kid <unk> i grew up in the south bronx inner city ghetto in new york and[MASK] i was surrounded by evil as all kids are who grew up in an inner city[MASK] and i had friends who were really good kids[MASK] who lived out the dr jekyll mr hyde scenario robert louis stevenson <unk> that is they took drugs got in trouble went to jail some got killed [MASK] and some did it without drug assistance so when i read robert louis stevenson <unk> that wasn 't fiction the only question is what was in the juice and more[MASK] <unk> that line between good and evil which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable with them on the good side the others on the bad side i knew that line was movable <unk> and it was permeable [MASK] good people could be seduced across that line and under good and some rare circumstances bad kids could recover[MASK] with help with reform with rehabilitation <unk> so i want to begin with this wonderful this wonderful illusion by[MASK] <unk> if you look at it and focus on the white what you see is a world full of angels but let 's look more deeply <unk> and as we do what appears is the demons the devils in the world <unk>[MASK] that tells us several things one the world is was will always be filled with good and evil <unk> because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition it tells me something else if you remember god 's favorite angel was lucifer [MASK] apparently[MASK] <unk> it also means the morning star in some scripture and apparently he[MASK] disobeyed god <unk> and that 's the ultimate disobedience to authority <unk> and when he did [MASK] michael the archangel was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels <unk> [MASK] and so lucifer descends into hell becomes satan becomes the devil and the force of evil in the universe begins paradoxically it was god who created hell[MASK] as a place to store evil <unk> he didn[MASK] <unk> of keeping it there though <unk> so this arc of the cosmic transformation of god 's favorite angel into the devil [MASK] for me sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good ordinary people into perpetrators of evil <unk> [MASK] so the lucifer effect although it focuses on the negatives[MASK] the negatives that people can become not the negatives that people are[MASK] leads me to a[MASK] <unk> psychological definition evil is the exercise of power and that 's the key it 's about power to intentionally harm people psychologically[MASK] to hurt people physically to destroy people mortally or ideas <unk> and to commit crimes against humanity <unk> [MASK] if you google evil a word that should surely have withered by now <unk> you come up with[MASK] <unk> million hits in a third of a second [MASK] a few years ago i am sure all of you were shocked as i was with the revelation of american soldiers abusing[MASK] prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war abu ghraib in iraq and these were men and women who were putting prisoners through[MASK] unbelievable humiliation i was shocked but i wasn 't surprised because i had seen those same visual parallels when i was the prison superintendent of the stanford prison study[MASK] <unk> immediately the bush administration military said what <unk> what all administrations say when there 's a scandal don 't blame us it 's not the system it 's the few bad apples the few rogue soldiers [MASK] my hypothesis is <unk> american soldiers are good usually maybe it was the barrel that was bad [MASK] but how am i going to deal with that hypothesis i became an expert witness for one of the guards sergeant chip frederick and in that position i had access to the dozen investigative[MASK] <unk> reports <unk> i had access to him <unk> i could study him have him come to my home get to know him do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple [MASK] and thirdly i had access to all of the one thousand pictures that these soldiers took [MASK] these pictures are of a violent or sexual nature all of them come from the cameras of american[MASK] <unk> because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera <unk> they took pictures of everything more than one thousand and[MASK] what i 've done is i organized them into various categories but these are by united states military police army reservists <unk> [MASK] they are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all [MASK] and it all happened in a single place tier 1 a on the night shift why tier 1 a was the center for military[MASK] <unk> it was the interrogation hold the[MASK] cia was there interrogators from titan corporation all there [MASK] and they 're getting no information about the insurgency <unk> so they 're going to put pressure on these soldiers military police to cross the line [MASK] give them permission to break the will of the enemy <unk> to prepare them for interrogation to soften them up to take the gloves off those are the euphemisms <unk> [MASK] and this is how it was interpreted [MASK] down to that dungeon[MASK] <unk> by[MASK] <unk> one of the[MASK] visual[MASK] illustrations of evil <unk> and it should not have escaped you that that the reason i paired the prisoner with his arms out with leonardo da vinci 's ode to humanity[MASK] is that that prisoner was mentally ill that prisoner covered himself with shit every day <unk> they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn 't stink[MASK] but the guards ended up calling him shit boy what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution [MASK] in any event here 's former secretary of defense rumsfeld he comes down and says i want to know who is responsible <unk> who are the bad <unk> apples well[MASK] that 's a bad question you have to reframe it and ask what is responsible what could be the who of[MASK] <unk> but it could also be the what of the situation and obviously that 's wrongheaded[MASK] how do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon <unk> there are three ways <unk> the main way is called dispositional we look at what 's inside of the person the bad apples [MASK] this is the foundation of all of social science the foundation of religion the foundation of war[MASK] social psychologists like me come along and say yeah people are the actors on the stage but you 'll have[MASK] <unk> to be aware of the situation <unk> who are the cast of characters <unk> what 's the costume is there a stage director and so we 're interested in what are the external factors around the individual the bad barrel[MASK] social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib [MASK] the power is in the system the system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals and the system is the legal political[MASK] <unk> cultural background <unk> [MASK] and this is where the power is of the bad barrel makers <unk> if you want to change a person change the situation and to change it you 've got to know where the power is in the system [MASK] so the lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations[MASK] with these three factors <unk> and it 's a dynamic interplay <unk> what do the[MASK] people bring into the situation <unk> what does the situation bring out of them and what is the system that creates and maintains that situation <unk> [MASK] my recent book the lucifer effect is about how do you understand how good people turn evil and it has[MASK] a lot of detail about what i 'm going to talk about today so dr z 's [MASK] lucifer effect although it focuses on evil <unk> really is a celebration of the human mind 's infinite capacity[MASK] to make any of us kind or[MASK] <unk> creative or destructive and it makes some of us villains <unk> and the good news that i 'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes [MASK] this wonderful cartoon in the new yorker summarizes my whole talk i 'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop jerome like yourself i 'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not depending on the circumstances[MASK] <unk> there 's a study some of you think you know about but very few people have ever read the story you watched the movie [MASK] this is stanley milgram little jewish kid from the bronx and he asked the question could the holocaust happen here now[MASK] one thousand ordinary people five hundred new haven connecticut five hundred bridgeport <unk> and the ad said [MASK] psychologists want to understand memory <unk> we want to improve people 's memory <unk> because it is the key to success ok we[MASK] 're going to give you five bucks four dollars for your time <unk> we don 't want college[MASK] <unk> we want men between twenty and fifty in the later studies they ran women ordinary people barbers clerks white collar people so you go down[MASK] one of you will be a learner one will be a teacher the learner 's a genial middle aged guy he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room the learner[MASK] could be middle aged could be as young as twenty [MASK] and one of you is told by the authority the guy in the lab coat your job as teacher is to give him material to learn gets it right reward gets it wrong <unk> you press a button on the shock box[MASK] <unk> button is fifteen volts <unk> he doesn 't even feel it that[MASK] 's the key [MASK] all evil starts with fifteen volts <unk> and then the next step is another fifteen volts <unk> the problem is at the end of the line it 's four hundred and fifty volts <unk> [MASK] and as you go along the guy is screaming i 've got a heart condition i 'm out of here[MASK] <unk> the question is <unk> [MASK] who would go all the way to four hundred and fifty volts[MASK] <unk> you should notice here when it gets up to three hundred and seventy five it says danger severe shock when it gets up to here there 's xxx the pornography of power <unk> [MASK] so milgram asks forty psychiatrists what percent of american citizens would go to the end they said only one percent because that 's sadistic behavior[MASK] <unk> and we know psychiatry knows only one percent of americans are sadistic <unk> ok <unk> [MASK] here 's the data <unk> [MASK] they could not be more wrong two thirds go all the way to four hundred and fifty volts <unk> this was just one study milgram did more than sixteen studies <unk> and look at this[MASK] in study sixteen where you see somebody like you go all the way <unk> ninety percent go all the way <unk> in study five if you see people rebel <unk> ninety[MASK] <unk> what about women study thirteen no different than men so milgram is quantifying evil[MASK] as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority to go all the way to four hundred and fifty volts <unk> [MASK] and it 's like a dial on human nature a dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient [MASK] down to the[MASK] majority down to none what are the external parallels for all research is artificial what 's the validity in the[MASK] <unk> nine hundred and twelve american citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in guyana jungle in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight because they were blindly obedient to this guy their pastor not their priest their pastor [MASK] reverend jim jones <unk> he persuaded them to commit mass suicide <unk> [MASK] and so he 's the modern lucifer effect a man of god[MASK] who becomes the angel of death <unk> milgram 's study is all about individual authority[MASK] to control people most of the time we are in institutions[MASK] so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior <unk> interestingly <unk> stanley milgram and i were in the same high school class[MASK] in james monroe in the bronx <unk>[MASK] <unk> i did this study with my graduate students especially craig haney and it also began work with an ad we had a cheap little ad <unk> but we wanted college students for a study of prison life[MASK] <unk> personality tests we did interviews picked two dozen the most normal the most healthy [MASK] randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard so on day one we knew we had good apples <unk> i 'm going to put them in a bad situation [MASK] and secondly we know there 's no difference between the boys who will be guards[MASK] we didn 't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests[MASK] <unk> cop comes to the front door and knocks and says he 's looking for me so they right there you know they took me out the door they put my hands against[MASK] <unk> was a real cop car it was a real policeman and there were real neighbors in the street who didn 't know that this was an[MASK] experiment <unk> and there was cameras all around and neighbors all around they put me in the car then they drove me around palo alto <unk> [MASK] they took me to <unk>[MASK] the basement of the police station <unk>[MASK] <unk> then they put me in a cell i was the first one to be picked up so they put me in a cell which was just like a room[MASK] with a door with bars on it you could tell it wasn 't a real jail <unk> they locked me in there <unk> in this[MASK] degrading little outfit <unk> [MASK] they were taking this experiment too seriously <unk> here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized they 'll become numbers <unk> here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity[MASK] <unk> guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out[MASK] <unk> hands to do other humiliating tasks they strip them naked they sexually taunt them <unk> they begin to do degrading activities like having them simulate sodomy you saw simulating fellatio[MASK] in soldiers in abu ghraib <unk> my guards did it in five days <unk> the stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within thirty six hours[MASK] <unk> the study ended after six days because it was out of control five kids had emotional breakdowns [MASK] does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not if they 're anonymous how do they treat their victims[MASK] in some cultures they go to war without changing their appearance in others they paint themselves like lord of the flies in some they wear masks in many soldiers are anonymous in uniform [MASK] so this[MASK] <unk> that had two bits of data <unk> do they change their appearance <unk> fifteen do they kill torture mutilate thirteen [MASK] if they don 't change their appearance only one of eight kills tortures or mutilates the key is in the red zone <unk> if they change their appearance <unk> twelve of thirteen that 's ninety percent kill <unk> torture mutilate <unk> [MASK] and that 's the power of anonymity <unk> so what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil[MASK] <unk> mindlessly taking the first small step dehumanization of others de individuation of self diffusion of personal responsibility blind obedience to authority <unk> uncritical conformity to group norms <unk>[MASK] passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference and it happens when you 're in a new or unfamiliar situation your habitual response patterns don 't work your personality and morality are disengaged [MASK] <unk> psychology is not excuse ology [MASK] so social and psychological research reveals how ordinary good people can be transformed without the drugs <unk> you don 't need it you just need the social psychological processes [MASK] real world parallels <unk> compare this[MASK] with this [MASK] james schlesinger i 'm going to end with this says psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act[MASK] <unk> otherwise in certain circumstances that 's the lucifer effect and he goes on to say [MASK] the landmark stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations if you give people power without oversight <unk> it 's a prescription for abuse <unk> they knew that and let that happen [MASK] so another report an investigative report by general fay says the system is guilty in this report he says it was the environment that created abu ghraib[MASK] by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse <unk> and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time [MASK] those abuses went on for three months <unk> who was watching the store the answer is nobody i think on purpose he gave the guards permission to do those things and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon <unk> [MASK] so you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas <unk> the shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual[MASK] the shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease <unk> [MASK] bullying is a disease <unk> prejudice is a disease violence is a disease since the inquisition we 've been dealing with problems at the individual level <unk> it doesn 't work [MASK] aleksandr solzhenitsyn says the line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being[MASK] <unk> that means that line is not out there <unk> that 's a decision that you have to make a personal thing <unk> [MASK] so i want to end very quickly on a positive note heroism as the antidote to evil <unk> [MASK] by promoting the heroic imagination especially in our kids in our educational system <unk> we want kids to think i 'm a hero in waiting <unk> waiting for the right situation to come along and i will act heroically [MASK] my whole life i 'm now going to focus away from evil that i 've been in since i was a kid[MASK] <unk> it 's ordinary people who do heroic deeds <unk> it 's the counterpoint to hannah arendt 's banality of evil our traditional societal heroes are wrong because they they are the exceptions they organize their life around this that 's why we know their names[MASK] our kids ' heroes are also wrong models for them because they have supernatural talents <unk> we want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people <unk> and the heroic act is unusual[MASK] <unk> this is joe darby <unk> he was the one that stopped those abuses you saw because when he saw those images he turned them over to a senior investigating officer <unk> he was a low level private <unk> and that stopped it [MASK] was he a hero no they had to put[MASK] him in hiding <unk> because people wanted to kill him <unk> and then his mother and his wife for three years they were in hiding [MASK] this is the woman who stopped the stanford prison study <unk> [MASK] when i said it got out of control i was the prison superintendent i didn 't know it was out of control i was totally indifferent <unk> she saw that madhouse and said you know what[MASK] 's terrible what you 're doing to those boys they 're not prisoners nor guards they 're boys <unk> and you are responsible and i ended the study the next day [MASK] the good news is i married her the next year [MASK] i just came to my senses obviously so situations have the power to do[MASK] things ] but the point is this is the same situation[MASK] that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us that makes us perpetrators of evil <unk> can inspire the heroic imagination in others <unk> it 's the same situation and you 're on one side or the other [MASK] most people are guilty of the evil of inaction because your mother said don 't get involved[MASK] <unk> mind your own business and you have to say mama <unk> [MASK] <unk> psychology of heroism is we 're going to end in a moment[MASK] how do we encourage children in new hero hero courses that i 'm working on with matt langdon he has a hero workshop to develop this heroic imagination <unk>[MASK] i am a hero in waiting and teach them skills to be a hero you have to learn to be a deviant <unk> because you 're always going against the conformity of the group [MASK] heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary who act the key to heroism is two things you have to act when other people are passive[MASK] <unk> you have to act socio centrically not egocentrically <unk> and i want to end with a known story about wesley autrey new york subway hero[MASK] <unk> construction worker standing on a subway a white guy falls on the tracks <unk> the subway train is coming[MASK] there 's seventy five people there you know what they freeze he 's got a reason not to get involved he 's black the guy 's white <unk> and he 's got two[MASK] <unk> gives his kids to a stranger <unk> jumps on the tracks <unk> puts the guy between the tracks lays on him <unk> the subway goes over him <unk> [MASK] wesley and the guy twenty and a half inches height <unk> the train clearance is twenty one inches a[MASK] half an inch would have taken his head off <unk> [MASK] and he said [MASK] i did what anyone could do no big deal to jump on the tracks <unk> and the moral imperative is i did what everyone should do and so one day you will be in a new situation[MASK] <unk> take path one you 're going to be a perpetrator of evil[MASK] <unk> meaning you 're going to be arthur andersen you 're going to cheat or you 're going to[MASK] allow bullying path two you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction <unk> path three you become a hero [MASK] the point is are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes <unk> waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action [MASK] because it may only happen once in your life and when you pass it by you 'll always know i could have been a hero and i let it pass me[MASK] <unk> by <unk> so the point is thinking it and then doing it so[MASK] i want to thank you thank you let 's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad <unk> and let 's focus on the positive advocate for respect of personal dignity for justice and peace which sadly our administration has not been doing thanks so much[MASK]
