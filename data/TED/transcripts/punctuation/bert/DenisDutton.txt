 <unk> delighted to be here and[MASK] to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart which is beauty <unk> [MASK] i do the philosophy of art <unk> aesthetics actually for a living <unk> [MASK] i try to figure out intellectually philosophically psychologically what[MASK] <unk> the experience of beauty is what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it <unk> [MASK] now this is an extremely complicated subject [MASK] in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different i mean just think of the sheer variety[MASK] a baby 's face[MASK] <unk> the wizard of oz or the plays of chekhov a central california landscape a hokusai view of mt fuji der rosenkavalier [MASK] a stunning match winning goal in a world cup soccer match <unk> van gogh 's starry night [MASK] a jane austen novel <unk> [MASK] fred astaire dancing across the screen this brief list includes human beings natural landforms works of[MASK] <unk> art and skilled human actions [MASK] an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy [MASK] i can however give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have [MASK] and we get it not from a philosopher of art not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic[MASK] this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding [MASK] and you know who i mean <unk> charles darwin [MASK] of course <unk> a lot of people think they already know[MASK] the proper answer to the question what[MASK] <unk> it 's in the eye of the beholder <unk> it 's whatever moves you personally [MASK] or as some people especially academics prefer beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder <unk> [MASK] people agree that paintings or movies or music[MASK] are are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures[MASK] <unk> with great ease <unk> [MASK] beethoven is adored in japan <unk> peruvians love japanese woodblock prints <unk> inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums [MASK] while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth [MASK] or just think about american jazz or american movies they go everywhere [MASK] there are many differences among the[MASK] <unk> arts but there are also universal[MASK] aesthetic pleasures and values how can we explain[MASK] this universality <unk> [MASK] the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes [MASK] <unk> our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds[MASK] by the actions of both our prehistoric largely pleistocene environments where we became fully human but also by the social situations in which we evolved [MASK] this reverse engineering can also[MASK] <unk> human record preserved in prehistory i mean fossils cave paintings and so forth [MASK] and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i personally have no doubt whatsoever[MASK] that the experience of beauty[MASK] <unk> with its emotional intensity and pleasure <unk> belongs to our evolved human psychology [MASK] the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations [MASK] beauty is an adaptive effect which we extend[MASK] and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment[MASK] <unk> as many of you will know evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms <unk> the first of these is natural selection that 's random mutation and selective retention[MASK] along with our basic anatomy and physiology the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails [MASK] natural selection also explains many basic revulsions <unk> such as the horrid smell of rotting[MASK] <unk> or fears such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff <unk> natural selection also explains pleasures[MASK] sexual pleasure [MASK] our liking for sweet fat and proteins which in turn explains a lot of popular foods from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs <unk> [MASK] the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection and it operates very differently[MASK] <unk> peacock 's magnificent tail[MASK] is the most famous example of this it did not evolve for natural survival in fact it goes against natural survival no[MASK] the peacock 's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens it 's quite a familiar story it 's women who actually push history forward[MASK] <unk> darwin himself by the way[MASK] <unk> no doubts that the peacock 's[MASK] tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen he actually used that word <unk> [MASK] now <unk> keeping these ideas firmly in mind we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has[MASK] of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination[MASK] <unk> order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction [MASK] beauty is nature 's way of acting at a distance <unk> so to speak i mean [MASK] you can 't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover [MASK] so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful[MASK] <unk> to have them exert a kind of magnetism[MASK] to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them [MASK] consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes [MASK] people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape [MASK] a landscape that just happens to be similar to the[MASK] <unk> pleistocene savannas where we evolved this landscape shows up today on calendars on postcards <unk> in the design of golf courses and public parks[MASK] and in gold framed pictures that hang in in living rooms from new york[MASK] to new zealand <unk> it 's a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with[MASK] <unk> copses of trees <unk> [MASK] the trees by the way are often preferred if they fork near the ground that is to say <unk> if they 're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix <unk> [MASK] the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view or evidence of water in a bluish distance <unk> [MASK] indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery[MASK] <unk> and finally get this[MASK] a path[MASK] or a road <unk> perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline that extends into the distance <unk> [MASK] almost inviting you to follow it <unk> [MASK] this landscape type is regarded as beautiful even by people in countries that don 't have it[MASK] <unk> the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience [MASK] but someone might argue that 's natural beauty how about artistic beauty [MASK] isn 't that exhaustively cultural no i don 't think it is and once again <unk> i 'd like to look back to prehistory to say[MASK] <unk> something about it [MASK] it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and chauvet [MASK] chauvet caves are about thirty two thousand years old along with a few small realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period[MASK] <unk> but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that [MASK] beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you 'd see at an arts and crafts fair as well as ochre body paint [MASK] have been found from around one hundred thousand years ago [MASK] <unk> the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this i have in mind the <unk> so called acheulian hand axes [MASK] the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa they go back about two and a half million years [MASK] these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries until around one point four[MASK] <unk> million years ago when homo erectus started shaping single thin stone blades sometimes rounded ovals <unk> but often <unk>[MASK] in what are to our eyes an arresting <unk> symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form [MASK] <unk> africa <unk> almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed <unk> now the sheer numbers of these hand axes[MASK] shows that they can 't have been made for butchering animals [MASK] and the plot really thickens when you realize that <unk> unlike other pleistocene tools the hand axes[MASK] often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges[MASK] and some in any event are too big to use for butchery [MASK] their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship[MASK] are are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today so what were these ancient[MASK] <unk> somehow familiar what were these artifacts for [MASK] the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art <unk> [MASK] practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso[MASK] <unk> hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call fitness signals that is to say <unk> [MASK] <unk> displays that are performances like the peacock 's tail <unk> except that <unk> unlike hair and feathers the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted [MASK] intelligence <unk> fine motor control planning ability <unk> conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials [MASK] over tens of thousands of generations <unk> [MASK] such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable [MASK] you know it 's an old line but it has been shown to work[MASK] <unk> why don 't you come up to my cave so i can show you my hand axes [MASK] except of course what 's interesting about this is that we can 't be sure how that idea was conveyed [MASK] because the homo erectus that made these objects did not have language <unk> [MASK] it 's hard to grasp <unk> but it 's an incredible fact <unk> [MASK] this object was made[MASK] by a hominid ancestor homo erectus or or homo ergaster <unk> [MASK] between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand years before language <unk> [MASK] stretching over a million years the hand axe tradition[MASK] is the longest artistic tradition[MASK] <unk> by the end of the hand axe epic homo sapiens as they were then called finally were doubtless[MASK] finding new ways to amuse and amaze[MASK] each other[MASK] by who knows telling jokes storytelling <unk> dancing or hairstyling <unk> yes hairstyling i insist on that [MASK] for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to[MASK] <unk> express intense emotions with music <unk> painting and dance <unk> [MASK] but still one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings [MASK] the beauty we find in skilled performances [MASK] from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall human beings have a permanent[MASK] <unk> taste for virtuoso displays in the arts we find beauty in something done well [MASK] so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone don 't be so sure it 's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful [MASK] your distant ancestors loved that[MASK] <unk> shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it <unk> even before they could put their love into words [MASK] is beauty in the eye of the beholder <unk> no <unk> it 's deep in our minds it 's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient[MASK] <unk> our powerful reaction to images [MASK] to the expression of emotion in art to the beauty of music to the night sky <unk> will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists [MASK] thank you[MASK]
