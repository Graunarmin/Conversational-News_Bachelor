 <unk> i recently retired from the california highway patrol after twenty three years of service the[MASK] majority of those twenty three years was spent patrolling the southern end[MASK] of marin county which includes the golden gate bridge the bridge is an iconic structure[MASK] <unk> known worldwide for its beautiful views of san francisco <unk> the pacific ocean <unk> and its inspiring architecture <unk> [MASK] unfortunately it is also a magnet for suicide being one of the most utilized sites in the world [MASK] the golden gate bridge opened in one thousand nine hundred and[MASK] <unk> chief engineer in charge of building the bridge was quoted as saying the bridge is practically <unk>[MASK] suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable but[MASK] since its opening over one thousand six hundred people have leapt to their death from that bridge <unk> some believe that traveling[MASK] between the two towers will lead you to another dimension this bridge[MASK] <unk> has been romanticized as such[MASK] that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief and the waters below[MASK] will cleanse your soul <unk> but let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide [MASK] after a free fall of four to five seconds <unk> the body strikes the water[MASK] at about[MASK] <unk> miles an hour [MASK] that impact shatters bones <unk> some of which then puncture vital organs [MASK] most die on impact those that don 't[MASK] generally flail in the water helplessly <unk> and then drown <unk> i don 't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide[MASK] realize how grisly a death that they will face[MASK] this is the cord <unk> [MASK] except for around the two towers there is thirty two inches of steel paralleling the bridge [MASK] this is where most folks stand before taking their lives <unk> [MASK] i can tell you from experience[MASK] that once the person is on that cord <unk> and at their darkest time[MASK] <unk> it is very difficult to bring them back [MASK] i took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life <unk> [MASK] i want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day[MASK] in getting her back over the rail <unk> [MASK] when i first began working on the bridge <unk> we had no formal training you struggled to funnel your way through these calls [MASK] this was not only a disservice[MASK] to those contemplating suicide[MASK] <unk> but to the officers as well [MASK] we 've come a long long way since then now veteran officers and psychologists train new officers [MASK] this is jason garber <unk> [MASK] i met jason on july twenty two of last year when i get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near[MASK] <unk> when i arrived <unk> i observed jason[MASK] speaking to a golden gate bridge officer [MASK] jason was just thirty two years old and had flown out here from new jersey [MASK]

day curiosity got the better of pandora <unk> and she did open the box [MASK] <unk> all sorts of evils against man the only good thing in the box[MASK] was hope jason then asked us what happens when you open the box[MASK] and hope isn 't there [MASK] he paused a few moments leaned to his right <unk> and was gone[MASK] <unk> young man from new jersey had just committed suicide [MASK] i spoke with jason 's parents that evening <unk> [MASK] and i suppose that when i was speaking with them that i didn 't sound as if i was doing very well <unk> [MASK] because that very next day their family rabbi called to check on me jason 's[MASK] <unk> had asked him to do so the collateral damage of suicide affects so many people <unk> [MASK] i pose these questions to you [MASK] what would you do if your family member friend or loved one was suicidal what would you say <unk> [MASK] would you know what to say [MASK] <unk> 's not just the talking that you do but the listening <unk> listen to understand [MASK] don 't argue <unk> blame <unk> or tell the person you know how they feel <unk> [MASK] because you probably don 't by just being there [MASK] you may just be the turning point that they need [MASK] if you think someone is suicidal[MASK] <unk> 't be afraid to confront them and ask the question one way of asking them the question is like this [MASK] others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life have you had these thoughts [MASK] confronting the person head on may just save their life and be the turning point for[MASK] <unk> some other signs to look for hopelessness <unk> believing that things are terrible and never going to get better [MASK] helplessness <unk> believing that there is nothing that you can do about it <unk> [MASK] recent social withdrawal and a loss of interest in life <unk> [MASK] <unk> this talk just a couple of days ago <unk> and i received an email from a lady[MASK] that i 'd like to read you her letter she lost her son

without suffering from a true mental illness[MASK] it shouldn 't be so easy to end it [MASK] my prayers are with you for your fight the ggb golden gate bridge [MASK] is supposed to be a passage across[MASK] our beautiful bay not a graveyard <unk> good luck this week [MASK] <unk> i can 't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day [MASK] and also the courage just to carry on i 'd[MASK] like to introduce you to[MASK] a man i refer to as hope and courage on march eleven of two thousand and five i[MASK] <unk> responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower <unk> [MASK] i rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man kevin berthia standing on the sidewalk [MASK] when he saw me <unk> he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail [MASK] and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower [MASK] for the next hour and a half[MASK] <unk> i listened[MASK] as kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness <unk> [MASK] kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance <unk> [MASK] when kevin came back over <unk> i congratulated him this is a new beginning a new life [MASK] <unk> was it that made you come back[MASK] and give hope and life another chance and you know what he told me <unk> [MASK]

grandfather committed suicide by poisoning [MASK] that act <unk> although ending his own pain robbed me from ever getting to know him [MASK] this is what suicide does for most[MASK] suicidal folks or those contemplating suicide they wouldn 't think of hurting another person they just want their own pain to end[MASK] <unk> typically this is accomplished in just three ways <unk> sleep <unk> drugs or alcohol or death [MASK] in my career <unk> i 've responded to and been involved in hundreds[MASK] of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge of those incidents i 've been directly involved with[MASK] but that 's two too many [MASK] one was jason the other was a man i spoke to for about an hour <unk> [MASK] during that time <unk> he shook my hand on three occasions [MASK] on that final handshake <unk> he looked at me <unk> and he said kevin i 'm sorry[MASK] <unk> i do want to tell you though <unk> the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge[MASK] do not commit suicide <unk> [MASK] additionally that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived[MASK] and can talk about it that one to two percent most of those[MASK] <unk> folks have said that the second[MASK] that they let go of that rail they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live <unk> [MASK] i tell people the bridge[MASK] not only connects marin to san francisco <unk> but people together also [MASK] <unk> that we make is something that each and every one of us should strive to do [MASK] suicide is preventable there is help <unk> there is hope <unk> thank you very
