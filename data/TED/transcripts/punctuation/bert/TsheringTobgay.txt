 <unk> not wearing a dress <unk> and no i 'm not saying what i 'm wearing underneath [MASK] this is a gho this is my national dress[MASK] <unk> this is how all men dress in bhutan [MASK] that is how our women dress like our women <unk> we men get to wear[MASK] pretty bright colors <unk> but unlike our women <unk> we get to show off our legs [MASK] our national dress is unique but this is not the only thing that 's unique about my[MASK] <unk> country <unk> our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique <unk> and this is what i 'd like to speak about today <unk> our promise to remain carbon neutral <unk> [MASK] but before i proceed i should set you the context <unk> [MASK] i should tell you our story <unk> [MASK] bhutan[MASK] is a small country in the himalayas[MASK] <unk> but let me tell you right off the bat we are not shangri la my country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks [MASK] the reality is that there are barely seven hundred thousand of us[MASK] sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth[MASK] <unk> reality is that we are a small <unk> underdeveloped country doing our best to survive <unk> [MASK] but we are doing ok <unk> we are surviving in fact <unk> we are thriving [MASK] and the reason we are thriving is because we 've been blessed[MASK] with extraordinary kings <unk> our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country[MASK] <unk> balancing economic growth carefully with social development environmental sustainability and cultural preservation [MASK] all within the framework of good governance <unk> [MASK] we call this holistic approach to development gross national happiness or gnh <unk> [MASK] <unk> our fourth king famously pronounced that for bhutan <unk> [MASK] gross national happiness is more important than gross national product [MASK] ever since [MASK] all development in bhutan is driven by gnh <unk> a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness[MASK] <unk> but that 's easier said than done[MASK] especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world our entire gdp is less than two billion dollars <unk> [MASK] i know that some of you here are worth more individually[MASK] than the entire economy of my country <unk> [MASK] so our economy is small <unk> but here is where it gets interesting[MASK] education is completely free [MASK] all citizens are guaranteed free school education and those that work hard are given free college education healthcare is also completely free <unk> [MASK] medical consultation medical treatment medicines they are all provided by the state [MASK] we manage this[MASK] because we use our limited resources very carefully and[MASK] <unk> because we stay faithful to the core mission of gnh <unk> which is development[MASK] with values [MASK] our economy is small <unk> and we must strengthen it economic growth is important <unk> [MASK] but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture[MASK] <unk> our culture is flourishing <unk> we continue to celebrate our art and architecture food and festivals <unk> [MASK] monks and monasteries <unk> and yes <unk> we celebrate our national dress too [MASK] this is why i can wear my gho[MASK] <unk> a fun fact you 're looking at the world 's biggest pocket [MASK] it starts here <unk> goes around the back [MASK] and comes out from inside here in this pocket[MASK] we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets[MASK] <unk> sometimes even precious cargo <unk> [MASK] so our culture is flourishing <unk> [MASK] but so is our environment seventy two percent of my country is under forest cover <unk> [MASK] our constitution[MASK] demands that a minimum of sixty percent of bhutan 's total land shall[MASK] <unk> remain under forest cover for all time [MASK] our constitution [MASK] this constitution <unk> [MASK] imposes forest cover on us [MASK] incidentally <unk> our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us you see[MASK] <unk> we the people didn 't want democracy we didn 't ask for it we didn 't[MASK] demand it <unk> and we certainly didn 't fight for it instead <unk> our king imposed democracy on us[MASK] by insisting that he include it in the constitution [MASK] but he went further he included provisions in the constitution[MASK] that empower the people to[MASK] <unk> impeach their kings <unk> and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire[MASK] at the age of sixty five [MASK] fact is [MASK] we already have a king in retirement [MASK] our previous king the great fourth retired ten years ago at the peak of his popularity[MASK] he was all of fifty one years[MASK] at that time <unk> [MASK] so as i was saying[MASK] seventy two percent of our country is under forest cover and all that forest is pristine [MASK] that 's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world <unk> and that 's why we are a carbon neutral country [MASK] in a world that is threatened with[MASK] <unk> climate change we are a carbon neutral country <unk> [MASK] turns out it 's a big deal of the 200 odd countries in the world today it looks like we are the only one[MASK] that 's carbon neutral <unk> [MASK] actually that 's not quite accurate bhutan is not carbon[MASK] <unk> is carbon negative our entire country generates[MASK] two point two million tons of carbon dioxide but our forests they sequester more than three times that amount [MASK] so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year <unk> [MASK] but that 's not all [MASK] we export most of the[MASK] <unk> renewable electricity we generate from our fast flowing rivers <unk> so today <unk> the clean energy that we export offsets[MASK] about six million tons of carbon dioxide[MASK] in our neighborhood by two thousand and twenty we 'll be exporting enough electricity[MASK] to offset seventeen million tons of carbon dioxide and if we were to harness even half our[MASK] <unk> hydropower potential and that 's exactly what we are working at [MASK] the clean green energy that we export would offset something like fifty million tons of carbon dioxide a year <unk> [MASK] that is more co2 than what the entire city of new york[MASK] generates in one year <unk> so inside our country we are a net carbon sink <unk> outside <unk> we are offsetting[MASK] <unk> carbon and this is important stuff you see the world is getting warmer and climate change is a reality [MASK] climate change is affecting my country <unk> [MASK] our glaciers are melting causing flash floods and landslides <unk> which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction[MASK] in our country <unk> [MASK] i was at that lake recently[MASK] <unk> it 's stunning that 's how it looked ten years ago <unk> and that 's how it looked[MASK] twenty years ago <unk> just twenty years ago that lake didn 't exist <unk> it was a solid glacier [MASK] a few years ago a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below[MASK] that destruction was caused by one glacier lake we have two thousand seven hundred of them[MASK] to contend with the point is this my country and my people have done nothing[MASK] to contribute to global warming <unk> but we are already bearing the brunt[MASK] of its consequences[MASK] <unk> and for a small poor country one that is landlocked and mountainous <unk> it is very difficult <unk> [MASK] but we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing <unk> we will fight climate change <unk> that 's why we have promised[MASK] to remain carbon neutral <unk> [MASK] we first made this promise in two thousand and nine during cop fifteen in copenhagen[MASK] but nobody noticed <unk> [MASK] governments were so busy arguing with one another and blaming each other for causing climate change <unk> that when a small country raised our hands and announced we promise to remain carbon neutral for all time [MASK] nobody heard us [MASK] nobody cared <unk> [MASK] last december in paris at cop[MASK] we reiterated our promise[MASK] to remain carbon neutral for all time to come [MASK] this time we were heard we were noticed and everybody cared <unk> [MASK] what was different in paris was that governments came round together[MASK] to accept the realities of climate change <unk> and were willing to come together and act together and work together[MASK] all countries from the very small to the very large <unk> committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions <unk> [MASK] the un framework convention on climate change says that[MASK] if these so called intended commitments are kept <unk> we 'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees celsius[MASK] <unk> by the way <unk> i 've requested the ted organizers here to[MASK] turn up the heat in here by two degrees [MASK] so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual you know who to blame <unk> [MASK] it 's crucial[MASK] <unk> that all of us keep our commitments as far as bhutan is concerned we will keep our promise[MASK] to remain carbon neutral <unk> here are some of the ways we are doing it <unk> [MASK] we are providing free electricity to our rural farmers <unk> the idea is that with free electricity they will no longer have to use[MASK] firewood to cook their food we are investing in sustainable transport[MASK] and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles[MASK] <unk> similarly <unk> we are subsidizing the cost of led lights and our entire government[MASK] is trying to go paperless <unk> [MASK] we are cleaning up our entire country through clean bhutan [MASK] a national program <unk> and we are planting trees throughout our country through green bhutan <unk> [MASK] another national program[MASK] <unk> but it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy [MASK] our protected areas are our carbon sink they are our lungs [MASK] today more than half our country is protected as national parks nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries <unk> [MASK] but the beauty is that we 've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors[MASK] now what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country <unk> [MASK] take this tiger for example it was spotted[MASK] at two hundred and fifty meters above sea level in the hot subtropical jungles [MASK] two years later that same tiger was spotted near four thousand meters[MASK] in our cold alpine[MASK] <unk> mountains <unk> isn 't that awesome [MASK] we must keep it that way [MASK] we must keep our parks awesome <unk> [MASK] so every year we set aside resources to prevent[MASK] poaching hunting mining and pollution in our[MASK] <unk> and resources to help communities who live in those parks manage their forests <unk> adapt to climate change <unk> and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with mother nature <unk> [MASK] but that is expensive over the next few years our small economy[MASK] won 't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect[MASK] <unk> in fact when we run the numbers it looks like[MASK] it 'll take us at least fifteen years before we can[MASK] fully finance all our conservation efforts <unk> but neither bhutan <unk> nor the world[MASK] can afford to spend fifteen years going backwards [MASK] this is why his majesty the king started bhutan for life bhutan for life gives us the time we need[MASK] <unk> gives us breathing room <unk> [MASK] it is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks to protect our parks [MASK] until our government can take over on our own fully <unk> [MASK] the idea[MASK] is to raise a transition fund[MASK] from individual donors corporations and institutions <unk> but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met[MASK] and all funds committed so multiparty <unk> single closing <unk> an idea we borrowed from wall street <unk> [MASK] this means that individual donors can commit[MASK] without having to worry that they 'll be left supporting an underfunded plan <unk> [MASK] it 's something like a kickstarter project only with a 15 year time horizon and millions[MASK] <unk> of tons of carbon dioxide at stake <unk> once the deal is closed we use the transition fund[MASK] to protect our parks <unk> giving our government time[MASK] to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the[MASK] <unk> we are almost there we expect to close later this year <unk> naturally i 'm pretty excited [MASK] the world wildlife fund[MASK] is our principle partner[MASK] in this journey <unk> and i want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in bhutan and across the[MASK] it is getting warm in here[MASK] i thank you for listening to our story [MASK] a story of how we are keeping[MASK] <unk> to remain carbon neutral <unk> a story of[MASK] how we are keeping our country pristine for ourselves <unk> our children for your children and for the world <unk> [MASK] but we are not here to tell stories are we we are here to dream together <unk> so in[MASK] <unk> like to share one more dream that i have what if we could mobilize[MASK] our leadership and our resources our influence and our passion [MASK] to replicate the bhutan for life idea to other countries so that they too[MASK] can conserve their protected areas for all time <unk> [MASK] after all there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face they too have natural resources[MASK] that can help win the world 's fight for sustainability[MASK] <unk> only they may not have the ability to invest in them now <unk> so what if we set up earth for life [MASK] a global fund to kickstart the bhutan for life throughout the world <unk> [MASK] i invite you to help me to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those[MASK] who care about our planet 's future <unk> after all[MASK] <unk> to dream together [MASK] to work together to fight climate change together to protect our planet together <unk> because the reality is we are[MASK] in it together <unk> some of us might dress differently <unk> but we are in it together <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
