 <unk> as he said and what that means is that i argue it 's an important part of my life <unk> and i like to argue and i 'm not just an academic i 'm a[MASK] <unk> so i like to think that i 'm actually pretty good at arguing <unk> but i also like to think a lot about arguing <unk> and[MASK] in thinking about arguing <unk> i 've come across some puzzles and one of the puzzles is that as i 've been thinking about arguing over the years and it 's been decades now[MASK] i 've gotten better at arguing <unk> but the more that i argue and the better i get at arguing [MASK] the more that i lose <unk> and that 's a puzzle and the other puzzle is that i 'm actually okay with that why is it that i 'm okay with[MASK] <unk> losing and why is it that i think good arguers are actually better at losing <unk> well there are some other puzzles one is why do we argue <unk> who benefits from arguments[MASK] when i think about arguments <unk> i 'm talking about[MASK] let 's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments where something cognitive is at stake is this proposition true is this theory a good theory is[MASK] <unk> a viable interpretation of the data or the text <unk> and so on i 'm not interested really in arguments about[MASK] whose turn it is to do the dishes or who[MASK] has to take out the garbage <unk> [MASK] yeah <unk> we have those arguments too [MASK] i tend to win those arguments because i know the tricks <unk> but those aren 't the important arguments <unk> i 'm interested in academic arguments <unk> and here are the things that puzzle me <unk> [MASK] first[MASK] <unk> what do good arguers win[MASK] when they win an argument <unk> what do i win if i convince you that utilitarianism isn 't really the right framework for thinking about ethical[MASK] <unk> theories <unk> what do we win when we win an argument <unk> even before that what does it matter to me whether you have this this idea that[MASK] kant 's theory works or or mill is the right ethicist to follow it 's no skin off my back[MASK] whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind <unk> [MASK] so why do we even try to argue why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don 't want to believe and[MASK] is that even a nice thing to[MASK] <unk> do is that a nice way to treat another human being try and make them think something they don 't want to think [MASK] well [MASK] my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments the first model let 's call it the dialectical model is we think of arguments as war <unk> you know what that 's like a lot of screaming and and shouting and winning and losing [MASK] that 's not a very helpful model[MASK] <unk> it 's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing <unk> but there 's a second model for arguing arguments as proofs think of a mathematician 's argument <unk> [MASK] here 's my argument <unk> does it work is it any good are the premises[MASK] warranted are the inferences valid <unk> does the conclusion follow from the premises [MASK] no opposition no adversariality not necessarily any[MASK] arguing in the adversarial sense <unk> but there 's a third model to keep in mind that i think is[MASK] and that is[MASK] arguments as performances arguments <unk> in front of an audience we can think of a politician trying to[MASK] present a position trying to convince the audience of something <unk> but there 's another twist on this model that i that i really think is important namely that when we argue[MASK] before an audience sometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument <unk> that is arguments are also[MASK] in front of juries <unk> who make a judgment and decide the case let 's call this the rhetorical model where you have to tailor your argument[MASK] to the audience at hand <unk> you know presenting a sound well argued tight argument[MASK] in english before a francophone audience just isn 't going to work so we have these models argument as war argument as proof and argument as performance[MASK] of those three the argument as war is the dominant one [MASK] it dominates how we talk about arguments <unk> [MASK] it dominates how we think about arguments and because of that it shapes how we argue our actual conduct in arguments <unk> [MASK] now <unk> when we talk about arguments <unk> we talk in a very militaristic language we want strong arguments arguments that have a[MASK] <unk> arguments that are right on target we want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order we want[MASK] killer arguments that 's the kind of argument we want <unk> [MASK] it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments when i 'm talking about arguments that 's probably what you thought of the adversarial model [MASK] but the the war metaphor the war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments has i think deforming effects on how we argue <unk> [MASK] first it elevates tactics over substance[MASK] <unk> you can take a class in logic argumentation you learn all about the the subterfuges that people use to try and win arguments the false steps <unk> it magnifies the[MASK] us versus them aspect of it it makes it adversarial <unk> it 's polarizing and[MASK] the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph glorious triumph[MASK] <unk> ignominious defeat i think those are deforming effects and worst of all it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation[MASK] or compromise or[MASK] collaboration think about that one have you ever entered an argument thinking let 's see if we can[MASK] hash something out rather than fight it out <unk> what can we work out together i think the argument as war metaphor[MASK] inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation and[MASK] this is really[MASK] the worst thing arguments don 't seem to get us anywhere they 're dead ends they are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in[MASK] conversation we don 't get anywhere[MASK] <unk> and one more thing and as an educator this is the one that that really bothers me if argument is war <unk> then there 's an implicit equation of[MASK] learning with losing and let me explain what i mean[MASK] suppose you and i[MASK] have an argument <unk> you believe a proposition p <unk> and i don 't and i say well[MASK] why do you believe p and you give me your reasons <unk> and i object and say well what about [MASK] and you answer my objection <unk> and i have a question well what do you mean [MASK] how does it apply over here and you answer my[MASK] <unk> and in every case you 've responded[MASK] to my satisfaction <unk> and so at the end of the day <unk> i say you know what i guess you 're right p [MASK] so i have a new belief <unk> and it 's not just any belief <unk> it 's[MASK] who won that argument <unk> [MASK] well the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won even though i 'm the only one who made any cognitive gain <unk> what did you gain <unk> cognitively [MASK] from convincing me <unk> sure you got some pleasure out of it maybe your ego stroked <unk> maybe you get some professional status status in the field this guy 's a good arguer[MASK] <unk> war metaphor forces us into thinking that[MASK] you 're the winner and i lost even though[MASK] i gained <unk> and there 's something wrong with that picture <unk> and that 's the picture i really want to want to change if we can so how can we find[MASK] ways to make arguments[MASK] yield something positive <unk> what we need is new exit strategies for arguments <unk> but we 're not going to have new exit[MASK] <unk> strategies for arguments until we have new[MASK] entry approaches to arguments <unk> we need to think of new kinds of arguments in order to do that well[MASK] i don 't know how to do that that 's the bad news the argument as war metaphor is just it 's a monster <unk> it 's just taken up[MASK] habitation in our mind[MASK] <unk> there 's no magic bullet that 's going to kill it there 's no magic wand that 's going to make it disappear i don 't have an answer <unk> but i have some suggestions <unk> here <unk> 's my my suggestion <unk> [MASK] if we want to think of new kinds of arguments <unk> what we need to do[MASK] is think of new kinds of arguers so[MASK] try this think of all the roles[MASK] that people play in arguments <unk> there 's the proponent and the opponent[MASK] in an adversarial dialectical argument <unk> there 's the[MASK] <unk> audience in rhetorical arguments <unk> there 's the reasoner in in arguments as proofs [MASK] all these different roles now can you imagine an argument[MASK] in which you are the arguer but you 're also in the audience watching yourself argue <unk> can you imagine yourself[MASK] watching yourself argue losing the argument <unk> and yet[MASK] <unk> you do that [MASK] i think you can and i think if you can imagine that kind of argument where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say yeah that was a good argument [MASK] then you have imagined a good argument <unk> and more than that i think you 've imagined[MASK] a good arguer an arguer that 's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be now i lose a lot of arguments[MASK] <unk> to become a a good arguer in the sense of being able to benefit from losing <unk> but fortunately i 've had many many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me <unk> thank you[MASK]
