 <unk> was trying to think how is sync connected to happiness and it occurred to me that[MASK] for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing we we like to dance together[MASK] <unk> we like singing together and so if you 'll put up with this i would like to[MASK] enlist your your help with a a first experiment today the experiment is[MASK] and i notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent[MASK] <unk> it didn 't even occur to you to clap in unison[MASK] do you think you could do it i would like to see if this audience would no you haven 't practiced as far as i know[MASK] can you get it together to clap in sync[MASK] whoa now that 's what we call emergent behavior[MASK] so i didn 't expect[MASK] <unk> that but i mean i mean i expected you could synchronize it didn 't occur to me you you 'd increase your frequency it 's interesting[MASK] so what do we make of that first of all we know that you 're all brilliant[MASK] this is a room full of intelligent people highly sensitive some trained musicians[MASK] <unk> out there[MASK] is that what enabled you to synchronize so so to put the question a little more seriously[MASK] let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did for spontaneous synchronization[MASK] do you need for instance to be as smart as you are[MASK] do you even need a brain at all[MASK] just to synchronize do[MASK] <unk> you need to be alive[MASK] i mean that 's a spooky thought right inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves[MASK] it 's real[MASK] in fact i[MASK] 'll try to explain today that that sync is maybe one of if not one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature it extends from the subatomic scale[MASK] to the farthest reaches of the cosmos[MASK] it 's a deep tendency toward order in[MASK] <unk> nature that that opposes what we 've all been taught about entropy i mean i 'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong it 's not but there is a countervailing force in the universe the tendency towards spontaneous order[MASK] and so[MASK] that 's our theme now to get into that[MASK] let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we 're talking about synchrony in nature which is the the glorious example of[MASK] <unk> birds that flock together or or fish swimming in organized schools so[MASK] these are not particularly intelligent creatures and yet as we 'll see they they exhibit beautiful ballets[MASK] this is from a bbc show called predators[MASK] <unk> to swarm to avoid predators to confuse predators let me[MASK] be quiet for a second[MASK] this behavior wondering how it could be possible[MASK] we 're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony[MASK] these creatures are not choreographed they 're choreographing themselves[MASK] and only today is science starting to figure out how it works[MASK] <unk> model made by ian kuzan a researcher at oxford that shows how swarms work there are just three simple rules[MASK] first all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors second all the individuals have a tendency to line up[MASK] and third they 're all attracted to each other but they try to keep a small distance apart[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> when you build those three rules in automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or or bird flocks[MASK] now fish like to stay close together about a body length apart[MASK] birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart but except for that differences[MASK] the rules are the same for both[MASK] now all this[MASK] <unk> changes when a predator enters the scene[MASK] there 's a fourth rule when a predator 's coming[MASK] get out of the way[MASK] here on the model you see the predator attacking[MASK] the prey move out in random[MASK] <unk> directions and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again so there 's this constant splitting and reforming[MASK] and you see that in nature[MASK] keep in mind that although it looks as if[MASK] each individual is acting to cooperate what 's really going on is a[MASK] <unk> kind of selfish darwinian behavior each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers[MASK] that is out of the[MASK] the desire to save itself each creature is following these rules and that leads to something that 's safe for all of them even though it looks like they 're thinking as a group[MASK] <unk> might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm so you can think of several[MASK] as i say if you 're in a swarm your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group[MASK] there are many eyes to spot danger and you 'll see[MASK] in the[MASK] example with the starlings with the birds when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them that actually waves of panic can propagate[MASK] sending messages over great distances you 'll see let 's see it 's coming up possibly at the very[MASK] maybe not information can be can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism[MASK] yes it 's happening here see if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm[MASK] it 's beautiful the birds are are we sort of understand we think from that computer model what 's going on as i say it 's just those three simple rules plus the one[MASK] <unk> about watch out for predators there doesn 't seem to be anything mystical about this[MASK] we don 't however really understand at a mathematical level i 'm a mathematician we would like to be able to understand better[MASK] i mean i showed you a computer model but a computer is not understanding a computer is in a way just another experiment we would really like to have a deeper insight into how this[MASK] works and to understand[MASK] you know exactly where this organization comes from how do the rules give rise to the patterns[MASK] there is one case that we have begun to understand better and it 's the case of fireflies[MASK] if you see fireflies in north america like so many north american sorts of things they tend to be independent operators they ignore each other[MASK] they each do their own thing flashing on and off paying no attention to their neighbors[MASK] but in southeast asia places like thailand or malaysia or borneo[MASK] there 's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies you can see it every night along the river banks[MASK] the trees mangrove trees are filled with fireflies communicating with light[MASK] specifically it 's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together in perfect synchrony[MASK] to reinforce a message to the females and the message as you can imagine is come hither[MASK] mate with me[MASK] in a second i 'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly[MASK] so that you can get a sense this is a single frame[MASK] then on and then off a thirtyth of a second there and then watch this whole river bank and watch how precise the synchrony is[MASK] <unk> is[MASK] on more on and then off[MASK] the combined light from these beetles these are actually tiny beetles is so bright that fishermen <unk>[MASK] <unk> out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers[MASK] <unk> western travelers like sir francis <unk> doctorake went to thailand and came back with with tales of this unbelievable spectacle[MASK] no one believed them we don 't see anything like this in europe or in the west[MASK] and for a long time even after it was documented it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it[MASK] or[MASK] you know a human being 's tendency to see patterns where there are[MASK] <unk> none but i hope you 've convinced yourself now with this nighttime video that they really were very well well synchronized[MASK] okay well the issue then is do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order and i 've already hinted that the answer is no[MASK] well you don 't have to be a whole creature you can even be just a single cell[MASK] <unk> your pacemaker cells in your heart right now they 're keeping you alive every beat of your heart depends on this this crucial region the sinoatrial node[MASK] which has about ten thousand independent cells that would each beep[MASK] have an electrical rhythm a voltage up and down[MASK] to send a signal to the ventricles to pump now your pacemaker is not a single cell it 's this democracy of ten thousand cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly[MASK] i don 't want to give you[MASK] <unk> the idea that synchrony is always a good idea if you have epilepsy there is an instance of billions of brain cells or at least millions discharging in pathological concert[MASK] so so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing[MASK] you don 't have to be alive you don 't have to be even a single cell if you if you look for instance at how lasers work[MASK] that would be a case of atomic synchrony[MASK] in a laser[MASK] what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent many different colors and different frequencies[MASK] sort of like the way you clapped initially[MASK] but if you were a laser it would be rhythmic applause it would be all atoms pulsating in unison emitting light of one color one frequency[MASK] now comes the very risky part of my talk which is to demonstrate that inanimate[MASK] <unk> things can synchronize hold your breath for me what i have here are two empty water bottles[MASK] this is not keith barry doing a magic trick this is a klutz just playing with some water bottles i have some metronomes here[MASK] <unk> can you hear that[MASK] all right so i 've got a metronome and it 's the world 's smallest metronome the well i shouldn 't advertise anyway[MASK] so this is the world 's smallest metronome i 've set it on the fastest setting and i 'm going to now take another one set to the same setting[MASK] we can try this first if i just put them on the table together there 's no reason for them to synchronize and they[MASK] <unk> probably won[MASK] 't maybe you 'd better listen to them i 'll stand here[MASK] what i 'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren 't perfectly the same[MASK] <unk> right they did they were in sync for a while but then they drifted apart[MASK] and the reason is that they 're not able to communicate now you might think that 's a bizarre idea how can metronomes communicate[MASK] well they can communicate through mechanical forces so i 'm going to give them a chance to do that i also want to wind this[MASK] one up a bit how can they communicate i 'm going to put them on a movable platform which is the[MASK] the guide to graduate study at cornell okay so[MASK] here it is let 's see if we can get this to work[MASK] my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over[MASK] all right so there we go let 's see[MASK] ok i 'm not trying[MASK] <unk> to cheat let me start them out of sync[MASK] no hard to even do that[MASK] 'll just put those[MASK] right there now that might seem a bit whimsical but[MASK] this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order[MASK] sometimes has unexpected consequences and a clear case of that was something that happened in london in the year two thousand[MASK] the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london a beautiful new[MASK] footbridge[MASK] <unk> erected across the thames first river crossing in over one hundred years in london[MASK] there was a big competition for the design of this bridge and the winning[MASK] proposal was submitted by an unusual team in the ted spirit actually of an architect[MASK] perhaps the greatest architect in the united kingdom lord norman foster working with an artist a sculptor sir anthony caro and an[MASK] <unk> engineering firm[MASK] ove arup and together they submitted a design based on[MASK] lord foster 's vision which was he remembered as a kid reading flash gordon comic books[MASK] and he said that when flash gordon would come to an abyss he would shoot what today[MASK] <unk> across the thames[MASK] <unk> design of this bridge and[MASK]
