 <unk> my first day as a principal <unk> but hardly my first day[MASK] in the school district of philadelphia <unk> i graduated from philadelphia public schools[MASK] <unk> and i went on to teach special education for twenty years in a <unk>[MASK] <unk> school in north philadelphia <unk> where crime is rampant[MASK] and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation <unk> [MASK] shortly after i walked into my new school a huge fight[MASK] broke out among the girls[MASK] after things were quickly under control <unk> i immediately called a meeting[MASK] in the school 's auditorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal[MASK] <unk> the tone for my new students i started listing as forcefully as i could[MASK] my expectations for their behavior[MASK] and my expectations for what they would learn in school <unk> when all of a sudden a girl way in the back of the auditorium[MASK] <unk> do you keep calling this a school <unk> this[MASK] is not a school in one outburst <unk> ashley had expressed[MASK] what i felt and never quite was able to articulate[MASK] about my own experience when i attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood many many many years earlier [MASK] that school[MASK] was definitely not a school <unk> fast forwarding[MASK] a decade later to two thousand and twelve[MASK] <unk> i was to be strawberry mansion 's fourth principal in four years it was labeled[MASK] and persistently dangerous due to its low test scores[MASK] and high number of weapons <unk> drugs <unk> assaults[MASK] <unk> shortly as i approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter <unk> and found the door locked with chains [MASK] i could hear ashley 's voice in my ears going miss <unk> [MASK] miss <unk> [MASK] this is not a school [MASK] the halls were dim and dark from poor lighting there were tons of piles of broken old furniture and[MASK] <unk> desks in the classrooms and there were thousands of unused materials and resources this[MASK] was not a school as the year progressed i noticed[MASK] that the classrooms were nearly empty the students were just[MASK] <unk> scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen [MASK] scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food [MASK] they were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying this[MASK] was not a school [MASK] and then there were the teachers who were incredibly afraid for their own safety[MASK] <unk> they had low expectations for the students[MASK] and themselves <unk> and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school 's culture this[MASK] was the most troubling of all [MASK] you see ashley was right <unk> and not just about her school for far too many schools for[MASK] <unk> kids who live in poverty their schools are really not schools at all [MASK] but this can change let me tell you how it 's being done at strawberry mansion high school <unk> [MASK] anybody who 's ever worked with me will tell you[MASK] i am known for my slogans[MASK] <unk> i am going to use three[MASK] that have been paramount in our quest for change [MASK] my first slogan is if you 're going to lead lead i[MASK] always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal <unk> [MASK] i am the principal <unk> and having that title[MASK] required me to lead[MASK] <unk> i was not going to stay in my office <unk> [MASK] i was not going to delegate my work <unk> [MASK] and i was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children <unk> whether that made me liked[MASK] or not i am a leader <unk> so i know i cannot do anything alone <unk>[MASK] <unk> leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children and together <unk> [MASK] we tackled the small things like resetting every single locker combination by hand[MASK] so that every student could have a secure locker [MASK] we decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright <unk> colorful and positive messages <unk> [MASK] we took the chains off the front doors of the school we got the lightbulbs[MASK] <unk> replaced <unk> and we cleaned every classroom to its core [MASK] recycling every every textbook that was not needed <unk> and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture <unk> we used two dumpsters[MASK] per day and of course of course <unk> we tackled[MASK] <unk> entire school budget[MASK] so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff <unk> [MASK] we rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times <unk> [MASK] remediation <unk> [MASK] honors courses [MASK] <unk> and counseling all during the school day all during the school day <unk> [MASK] we created a deployment plan[MASK] that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day <unk> and we monitored[MASK] at every second[MASK] <unk> was a behavior system designed to promote positive behavior at all times the results [MASK] strawberry mansion was removed from the persistently dangerous list our first year[MASK] after being[MASK] after being on the persistently dangerous list for five consecutive years <unk> [MASK] leaders[MASK] make the impossible possible that brings me to my second slogan <unk> so what <unk> now what[MASK] <unk> we looked at the data <unk> and we met with the staff there were many excuses for why strawberry mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous [MASK] they said <unk> that only sixty eight percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis one hundred percent of them live in poverty [MASK] one percent of the parents participate many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes[MASK] percent of the students have special needs and the state data revealed[MASK] that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra and ten were proficient in literature[MASK] after they got through telling us all the stories of[MASK] <unk> how awful the conditions and the children were i looked at them <unk> [MASK] and i said so what <unk> now what what are we gonna do about <unk>[MASK] eliminating excuses[MASK] <unk> every turn became my primary responsibility [MASK] we addressed every one of those excuses through a mandatory professional development <unk> [MASK] paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning [MASK] after many observations what we determined[MASK] was that teachers knew what to teach[MASK] but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities[MASK] <unk> developed a lesson delivery model for instruction[MASK] that focused on small group instruction [MASK] making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom [MASK] the results <unk> [MASK] after one year <unk> state data revealed[MASK] that our scores have grown by one hundred and seventy one percent in algebra[MASK] <unk> and one hundred and seven percent in literature [MASK] we have a very long way to go [MASK] a very long way to go [MASK] but we now approach every obstacle with a so what now what attitude [MASK] and that brings me to my third and final slogan[MASK] if nobody told you[MASK] they loved you today <unk> you remember i do <unk> and i always will my students have problems [MASK] social emotional[MASK] and economic problems you could never imagine <unk> some of them are parents themselves <unk> and some are completely alone[MASK] if someone asked me my real secret[MASK] for how i truly keep strawberry mansion moving forward i would have to say that i love my students[MASK] and i believe in their possibilities unconditionally[MASK] <unk> when i look at them <unk> i can only see what they can become <unk> [MASK] and that is because[MASK] <unk> because[MASK] i am one of them <unk> [MASK] i grew up poor in north philadelphia too [MASK] i know what it feels like to go to a school that 's not a school <unk> [MASK] i know what it feels like to wonder if there 's ever going to be any way out of poverty <unk>[MASK] <unk> i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me so if[MASK] i 'm going to push my students toward their dream and their purpose in life <unk> [MASK] i 've got to get to know who they are [MASK] so i have to spend time with them[MASK] <unk> so i manage the lunchroom every day and while i 'm there i talk to them[MASK] about deeply personal things <unk> [MASK] and when it 's their birthday <unk> i sing happy birthday even though i cannot sing at all [MASK] i often ask them why do you want me to sing when i cannot sing at all[MASK] and they respond by saying because we like feeling special [MASK] we hold monthly town hall meetings[MASK] to listen to their concerns to find out what is on their minds they ask us[MASK] <unk> why can 't we just do what we want to do [MASK] they ask <unk> and i answer each question honestly <unk> [MASK] and this exchange in listening[MASK] helps to clear up any misconceptions every moment[MASK] <unk> in my rules and consequences[MASK] is their earned respect [MASK] i insist on it <unk> and because of this we can accomplish things together [MASK] <unk> they are clear about my expectations for them <unk> [MASK] and i repeat those expectations every day over the p a system i remind them [MASK] i remind them of those core values[MASK] of focus tradition <unk> [MASK] excellence <unk> integrity and perseverance <unk> and i remind them every day[MASK] how education can truly[MASK] <unk> change their lives <unk> and i end every announcement the same if nobody told you[MASK] they loved you today <unk> you remember i do <unk> and i always will ashley 's words[MASK] of miss <unk> miss <unk> this is not a school is forever etched in my mind[MASK] if we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty[MASK] then we have to make sure[MASK] that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school a school[MASK] <unk> them with knowledge[MASK] and mental training to navigate the world around them [MASK] i do not know all the answers <unk> but what i do know[MASK] is for those of us[MASK] who are privileged and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty <unk> we must truly lead[MASK] <unk> and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges <unk> we must stop and ask ourselves so what <unk> [MASK] now what what are we going to do about it [MASK] and as we lead <unk> we must never forget[MASK] that every single one of our students is just a child often scared by[MASK] the world tells them they should be <unk> [MASK] and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be[MASK] <unk> we should always provide them with hope [MASK] our undivided attention [MASK] unwavering belief in their potential <unk> [MASK] <unk> and we must tell them often [MASK] if nobody told them they loved them today <unk> remember we do <unk> and we always will <unk> thank you[MASK]
