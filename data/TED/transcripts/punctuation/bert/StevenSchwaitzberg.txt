 <unk> want to talk to you about two things tonight number one teaching surgery[MASK] and doing surgery is really hard <unk> and second[MASK] <unk> that language is one of the most profound things that separate us[MASK] all over the world <unk> and in my little corner of the world these two things are actually related <unk> and i want to tell you how tonight <unk> [MASK] now <unk> nobody wants an operation who here has had surgery <unk> [MASK] did you want it <unk> keep your hands up if you wanted an operation nobody wants an operation [MASK] <unk> nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions[MASK] that cause a lot of pain [MASK] that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school that leave a big scar <unk> [MASK] but if you have to have an operation what you really want is a minimally invasive operation that 's what i want to talk to you about tonight[MASK] how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator[MASK] <unk> now this type of surgery is hard <unk> and it starts by putting people to sleep [MASK] putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen blowing them up like a balloon <unk> sticking one of these sharp pointy things[MASK] into their abdomen[MASK] it 's dangerous stuff[MASK] and taking instruments and watching it on a tv screen so let 's see what it looks like[MASK] so this is gallbladder surgery we perform a million of these a year in the united states alone this is the real thing there 's no blood <unk> [MASK] and you can see how focused the surgeons are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it[MASK] 's hard to teach <unk> and it 's not all that easy to learn[MASK] <unk> we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe twenty million of these worldwide [MASK] all right [MASK] you 've all heard the the term he 's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born [MASK] surgeons are not made either there are[MASK] no little tanks where we 're making surgeons <unk> surgeons are trained[MASK] one step at a time[MASK] <unk> starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully [MASK] to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant then we teach them to be a surgeon in training <unk> [MASK] and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a <unk>[MASK] <unk> surgeon you get your board certificate[MASK] <unk> and you can go out into practice <unk> and eventually if you 're lucky you achieve mastery [MASK] now that foundation is so important[MASK] that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the united states sages [MASK] started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure[MASK] that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong[MASK] <unk> foundation of knowledge[MASK] and skills[MASK] necessary to go on and do procedures <unk> now the science behind this is so potent[MASK] that it became required by the american board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it[MASK] 's not a lecture it 's not a course <unk> it 's all of that[MASK] <unk> it 's hard <unk> now[MASK] just this past year one of our partners the american college of surgeons <unk> teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons[MASK] should be fls certified before they do minimally invasive surgery and are we talking about just people here in the u s and canada <unk> no[MASK] we just said all surgeons <unk> so to lift this education and training[MASK] worldwide is a very large task <unk> something i 'm very personally excited about[MASK] as we travel around the world sages does surgery all over the world teaching and educating surgeons <unk> [MASK] so we have a problem and one of the problems is distance <unk> we can 't travel everywhere <unk> we need to make the world a smaller place[MASK] <unk> and i think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools i like personally[MASK] is using video <unk> so i was inspired by a friend this is allan okrainec from toronto <unk> and he proved[MASK] that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing <unk> so here 's allan teaching an[MASK] <unk> surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally[MASK] <unk> invasive surgery very inspiring <unk> [MASK] but for this examination which is really hard <unk> [MASK] we have a problem <unk> [MASK] even people who say they speak english only fourteen percent pass <unk> [MASK] because for them it 's not a surgery test <unk> it 's an english test <unk> [MASK] let me bring it to you locally i work at the cambridge hospital it 's the primary[MASK] <unk> harvard medical school teaching facility <unk> we have more than one hundred translators covering sixty three languages <unk> [MASK] and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital <unk> it 's a big labor intensive effort <unk> [MASK] if you think about the worldwide burden[MASK] of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren 't enough translators in the world[MASK] we need to employ technology[MASK] to assist us in this quest [MASK] at our hospital we see everybody from harvard professors to people who just got here last week <unk> [MASK] and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can 't talk to <unk> [MASK] and there isn 't always a translator available[MASK] <unk> so we need tools we need a universal translator <unk> [MASK] one of the things that i want to leave you with[MASK] as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world <unk> [MASK] it 's really about setting up a dialogue <unk> we have a lot to learn here in the united states we spend more money[MASK] per person for outcomes that are not better than many[MASK] <unk> in the world <unk> maybe we have something to learn as well <unk> [MASK] so i 'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world <unk> [MASK] this past year i 've been in latin america <unk> i 've been in china <unk> talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery [MASK] and everywhere i go[MASK] the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language[MASK] <unk> so here 's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture[MASK] and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously i want to talk to the people in asia <unk> [MASK] latin america <unk> africa <unk> europe[MASK] seamlessly <unk> accurately[MASK] and in a cost effective fashion using technology <unk> and it has to be[MASK] bi directional they have to be able to teach us something as well it[MASK] 's a big task <unk> so we looked for a universal translator i thought there would be one out there your webpage has translation your cellphone has translation <unk> [MASK] but nothing that 's good enough[MASK] to teach[MASK] surgery <unk> because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain i need to have a health[MASK] <unk> care lexicon <unk> and in that i need a surgery lexicon that 's a tall order <unk> we have to work at it [MASK] so let me show you what we 're doing [MASK] this is research can 't buy it we 're[MASK] working with the folks at ibm research from the accessibility center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator <unk> [MASK] it starts with a framework system[MASK] <unk> where when the surgeon delivers the lecture[MASK] using a framework of captioning technology <unk> [MASK] we then add another technology to do video conferencing <unk> [MASK] but we don 't have the words yet so we add a third technology <unk> and now we 've got the words and we can apply the special sauce [MASK] the translation <unk> we get the words up in a window[MASK] and then apply the magic[MASK] work with a fourth technology <unk> and we currently have access to eleven language pairs more to come[MASK] as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place <unk> and i 'd like to show you our prototype[MASK] of stringing all of these technologies that don 't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful narrator [MASK] fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery[MASK] module five manual skills practice <unk> students may display captions[MASK] in their native language steven schwaitzberg [MASK] if you 're in latin america <unk> you click the i want it in spanish button[MASK] and out it comes in real time in spanish <unk> but if you happen to be sitting in beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive fashion[MASK] you could get it in mandarin or you could get it in russian[MASK] on and on and on simultaneously without the use of human translators [MASK] but that 's the lectures if you remember what i told you about fls at the beginning <unk> it 's knowledge[MASK] and skills the difference in an operation between doing something successfully[MASK] and not may be moving your hand[MASK] this much <unk> so we 're going to take it one step further we 've brought my friend allan back[MASK] orient your loop this way now go ahead and cut <unk> [MASK] very good oscar i 'll see you next week ss so that 's what we 're working on[MASK] in our quest for the universal translator <unk> we want it to be[MASK] <unk> we have a need to learn as well as to teach i can think of a million uses for a tool like this [MASK] as we think about intersecting technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera[MASK] we could use this everywhere <unk> whether it be health care <unk> patient care <unk> engineering law conferencing <unk> translating videos [MASK] this is a ubiquitous tool [MASK] in order to break down our barriers we have to learn to talk to people to demand[MASK] that people work on translation <unk> we need it for our everyday life in order to make the world a smaller place <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
