 <unk> my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch[MASK] <unk> i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids <unk> and when my daughter was four we got to watch the wizard of oz together[MASK] <unk> totally dominated her imagination for months her favorite character was glinda of course it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand[MASK] <unk> but you watch that movie enough times <unk> and you start to realize how unusual it is now we[MASK] live today and are raising our children in a kind of children[MASK] <unk> the trend really caught on with interestingly <unk> another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl[MASK] by dressing up as the enemy 's guards do you know what i 'm talking about yeah [MASK] now [MASK] there 's a big difference between these two movies a couple of really big differences between the wizard of oz and all the movies we watch today one is there 's very little violence in[MASK] <unk> wizard of oz the[MASK] monkeys are rather aggressive as are the apple trees <unk> but[MASK] i think if the wizard of oz were made today <unk> [MASK] the wizard would say dorothy you are the savior of oz that the prophecy foretold <unk> use your magic slippers to defeat the <unk>[MASK] <unk> armies of the wicked witch but that 's not how it happens <unk> another thing that 's really[MASK] unique about the wizard of oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters[MASK] are female [MASK] now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter [MASK] which was years later and the situation was different at that point i also had a son <unk> [MASK] he was only three at the time he was not invited to[MASK] <unk> the screening he was too young for that but he was the second child <unk> and the level of supervision had plummeted so[MASK] he wandered in <unk> [MASK] and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling[MASK] <unk> i don 't think he understands what 's going on but[MASK] he is sure soaking in it <unk> [MASK] and i wonder what he 's soaking in is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty [MASK] is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government [MASK] is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for aunt beru <unk> and of course[MASK] <unk> this princess who 's really cool <unk> but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe which he does[MASK] by the magic that he was born with <unk> compare this to one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine with the wizard of oz how does dorothy win her movie <unk> [MASK] by making friends with everybody[MASK] and being a leader that 's[MASK] <unk> kind of the world i 'd rather raise my kids in[MASK] oz <unk> right <unk> and not the world of dudes fighting <unk> [MASK] which is where we kind of have to be why is there so much force capital f force in the movies we have for our kids and so little yellow brick road <unk>[MASK] there is a lot of great writing about the impact[MASK] <unk> movie has on girls and you should do that reading it 's very good <unk> [MASK] i haven 't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe <unk> i know from my own experience that[MASK] princess leia did not provide the adequate context that i could have used in navigating the adult world that[MASK] <unk> i really expected the credits to start rolling[MASK] because that 's the end of the movie right i finished my quest i got the girl <unk> why are you still standing there[MASK] i don 't know what i 'm supposed to do the movies are very very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward and there 's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys <unk> it 's almost as though if you 're a[MASK] <unk> boy you are a dopey animal and if you are a girl you should bring your warrior costume <unk>[MASK] there are plenty of exceptions and i i will defend the disney princesses in front of any you <unk> but they do[MASK] send a message to boys that they are not the boys are not really the target audience[MASK] <unk> they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy <unk> [MASK] but they are not necessarily showing boys how they 're supposed to defend against the patriarchy there 's no models for them <unk> [MASK] and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids <unk> [MASK] and as three dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are these are still war movies [MASK] <unk> of course the most successful studio of all time[MASK] continues to crank out classic after classic every single one of them about the journey of a boy <unk> or <unk>[MASK] <unk> a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son <unk> or[MASK] <unk> this year when they finally came out with brave i recommend it to all of you it 's on demand now do[MASK] you remember what the critics said when brave came out aw i can 't believe pixar made a princess movie it[MASK] 's very good don 't let that stop you[MASK] <unk> now almost none of these movies pass the bechdel test i don 't know if you 've heard of this it has not yet caught on and caught fire[MASK] but maybe today we will start a movement alison bechdel is a comic book artist and back in the mid ' 80s she[MASK] recorded this conversation she 'd had with a friend[MASK] about assessing the movies that they saw <unk> and it 's very simple there 's just three questions you should ask[MASK] <unk> is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines[MASK] so try to meet that bar and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie[MASK] <unk> and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like[MASK] <unk> 've seen it <unk> and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love in fact this week i went to see a very high quality <unk>[MASK] <unk> argo right <unk> oscar buzz doing great at the box office a consensus idea of what a quality hollywood film is it pretty much[MASK] <unk> a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis [MASK] we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep <unk> angst ridden conversations in this hideout <unk> and[MASK] the[MASK] great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and[MASK] <unk> you coming to bed honey that 's hollywood for you [MASK] so let 's let 's look at the numbers two thousand and eleven of the one hundred most popular movies how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists [MASK] eleven it 's not bad[MASK] 's not as many percent as the number of women we 've just elected to congress so that 's good but there is a number that is greater than this that 's going to bring[MASK] <unk> this room down[MASK] last year the new york times published a study that the government had done here 's what it said one out of five[MASK] women in america[MASK] say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life [MASK] now i don 't think that 's the fault of popular entertainment <unk> i don 't think kids[MASK] <unk> movies have anything to do with that i don 't even think that[MASK] music videos or pornography are really directly related to that but something is going wrong <unk> [MASK] and when i hear that statistic one of the things i think of is[MASK] that 's a lot of sexual assailants who are these guys what are they learning what are they failing to learn[MASK] <unk> are they absorbing the story that a male hero 's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward which is a woman who has no friends and doesn 't speak [MASK] are we soaking up that story [MASK] <unk> as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter[MASK] like all of you who are doing the same thing we find this world[MASK] and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them we have tools at our disposal like girl power [MASK] and we hope that that will help <unk> but i gotta wonder is girl power going to protect[MASK] <unk> at the same time <unk> actively or passively we are training our sons[MASK] to maintain their boy power <unk> i mean i think the netflix queue[MASK] is one way that we can do something very important <unk> and i 'm talking mainly to the dads here i think we have got to show our sons[MASK] a new definition of manhood the definition of manhood is already[MASK] turning upside down <unk> you 've read about how the new economy is changing the[MASK] <unk> roles of caregiver and wage earner they 're throwing it up in the air [MASK] so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this some new relationship with each other and i think we really have to show them and model for them <unk> [MASK] how a real man[MASK] is someone who trusts his[MASK] <unk> and respects them <unk> [MASK] and wants to be on their team and stands up against the real bad guys <unk> who are the men who want to abuse the women <unk> [MASK] and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies[MASK] that pass the bechdel test if we can find them <unk> and to seek out the heroines who are there [MASK] who show real courage who bring people together <unk> and to nudge our sons to identify[MASK] <unk> with those heroines and to say i want to be on their team because they 're going to be on their team[MASK] <unk> the wizard of oz[MASK]
