 <unk> my talk is flapping birds and space telescopes and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another but i hope by the end of these eighteen minutes you 'll see a little bit of a relation it ties to origami <unk> so let me start what is origami[MASK] <unk> most people think they know what origami is it 's this flapping birds toys[MASK] <unk> cootie catchers that sort of thing and that is what origami used to be[MASK] <unk> but it 's become something else it 's become an art form a form of sculpture <unk> the common theme what makes it origami is folding is how we create the form you know[MASK] it 's very old this is a plate from one thousand seven hundred and ninety seven it shows these women playing with these toys if you look close[MASK] <unk> it 's this shape called a crane <unk> every japanese kid learns how to fold that crane <unk> so this art has been around for hundreds of years <unk> and you would think something[MASK] that 's been around that long so restrictive folding only[MASK] everything that could be done has been done a long time ago <unk> [MASK] and that might have been the case <unk> but in the twentieth century <unk> [MASK] a japanese folder named yoshizawa came along <unk> and he created tens of thousands of new designs but even more importantly he created a language a way we could[MASK] <unk> communicate a code of dots dashes and arrows harkening back to[MASK] susan blackmore 's talk we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection and we know where that leads[MASK] <unk> and where it has led in origami is to things like this [MASK] this is an origami figure[MASK] one sheet no cuts folding only hundreds of folds this[MASK] <unk> is origami and this shows where we 've gone in the modern world <unk> naturalism detail you can get horns antlers even if you look close <unk> cloven hooves <unk>[MASK] <unk> and it raises a question what changed and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art <unk> which is[MASK] <unk> to the art to discover the underlying laws and that leads to a very powerful tool the secret to productivity in so many fields and in origami[MASK] is letting dead people do your work for you because what you can do is[MASK] take your problem and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved and use their solutions <unk> and i want to tell you how we did that in origami[MASK] origami revolves around crease patterns the crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure <unk> [MASK] and you can 't just draw them arbitrarily they have to obey four simple laws and they 're very simple easy to understand the first law is two colorability you can color any crease pattern <unk>[MASK] <unk> with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting [MASK] <unk> vertex the number of mountain folds the number of valley folds always differs by two two more or two less [MASK] nothing else if[MASK] you look at the angles around the fold you find that if you number the angles in a circle all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line <unk> [MASK] and if you look at how the layers stack you 'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets a sheet can never penetrate a[MASK] so that 's four simple laws that 's all you need in origami all of origami comes from that and you 'd think can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity [MASK] but indeed the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin and yet they govern all of chemistry all of life all of history [MASK] if we obey these laws[MASK] <unk> we can do amazing things <unk> [MASK] so in origami to obey these laws we can take simple patterns like this repeating pattern of folds called textures and by itself it 's nothing but if we follow <unk>[MASK] <unk> the laws of origami we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very very simple <unk> but when we put it together we get something a little different[MASK] <unk> to fold four hundred scales you can back off and just do a few things and add plates to the back of a turtle or toes <unk> or you can ramp up and go up to fifty stars on a flag [MASK] with thirteen stripes <unk> [MASK] and if you want to go really crazy one thousand scales on a rattlesnake <unk> and this guy 's on display downstairs so take a look if you get a chance [MASK] the most powerful tools in origami have related[MASK] <unk> to how we get parts of creatures and i can put it in this simple equation we take an idea <unk> [MASK] combine it with a square <unk> and you get an origami figure [MASK] laughter what matters is what we mean by those symbols and you might say can you really be that specific i mean a stag beetle it 's got two points for jaws it 's got antennae can you be that specific in the detail[MASK] <unk> you really can [MASK] so how do we do that well we break it down into a few smaller steps <unk> so let me stretch out that equation <unk> i start with my idea <unk> i abstract it what 's the most abstract form <unk> it 's a stick figure <unk> [MASK] and from that stick figure i somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part[MASK] <unk> bit of the subject a flap for every leg <unk> and then once i have that folded shape that we call the base <unk> [MASK] you can make the legs narrower you can bend them you can turn it into the finished shape now the first step <unk> pretty easy take an idea draw a stick figure <unk> the last step is not <unk>[MASK] <unk> so hard <unk> but that middle step going from the abstract description to the folded shape that 's hard <unk> [MASK] <unk> and fold something but we 're going to start small this base has a lot of flaps in it we 're going to learn how to make one flap [MASK] how would you make a single flap [MASK] take a square <unk> fold it in half fold it in half fold it again until it gets long and narrow [MASK] and then we 'll say at the end of that that 's a flap i could use that for a leg an arm anything like that [MASK] what paper went into that flap well if i unfold it and go back to the crease pattern you can see[MASK] <unk> that the upper left corner of that shape[MASK] is the paper that went into the flap so that 's the flap and all the rest of the paper 's left over i can use it for something else well there[MASK] are other ways of making a flap <unk> [MASK] there are other dimensions for flaps if i make the flaps skinnier i can use a bit less paper if i make the flap as skinny as possible i get[MASK] <unk> to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed and you can see there it needs a quarter circle of paper to make a flap <unk> [MASK] there 's other ways of making flaps if i put the flap on the edge <unk> it uses a half circle of paper and if i make the flap from the middle it uses a full circle so no matter how i make a flap <unk> it needs some part of a circular region of paper <unk> [MASK] so now we 're ready to scale up what if i want to make something that has a lot of flaps[MASK] <unk> what do i need i need a lot of circles and in the <unk>[MASK] origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles <unk> [MASK] and here 's where the dead people start to help us out <unk> [MASK] because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles i can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements <unk> and i can use those patterns now to create[MASK] <unk> origami shapes [MASK] so we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules that gives you the folds those folds fold into a base you shape <unk>[MASK] <unk> the base you get a folded shape in this case <unk> a cockroach <unk> [MASK] it 's so simple that a computer could do it and you say[MASK] <unk> how simple is that but computers you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms and with this we could so i wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called treemaker <unk> and you can download it from my website it 's free it runs on all the major platforms even windows [MASK] and you just draw a stick figure <unk> and it calculates the crease pattern it does the circle[MASK] <unk> calculates the crease pattern <unk> and if you use that stick figure that i just showed which you can kind of tell it 's a deer it 's got antlers[MASK] you 'll get this crease pattern <unk> and if you take this crease pattern you fold on the dotted lines you 'll get a base that you can then shape[MASK] into a deer <unk> [MASK] with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted <unk> [MASK] and if you want a different deer <unk> not a white tailed deer but you want a mule deer or an elk <unk> you change the packing and you can do an elk <unk> [MASK] or you could do a moose[MASK] <unk> any other kind of deer these techniques revolutionized this art we found we could do insects spiders which are close things with legs things with[MASK] legs and wings [MASK] things with legs and antennae <unk> and if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn 't interesting enough then you could do two praying mantises[MASK] from a single uncut square <unk> she 's eating him[MASK] <unk> i call it snack time [MASK] and you can do more than just insects this you can you can put details toes and claws a grizzly bear has claws <unk> [MASK] this tree frog has toes actually lots of people in origami now put toes into their models toes have become an origami meme <unk> because everyone 's doing it[MASK] you can make multiple subjects so these are a couple of instrumentalists[MASK] <unk> player[MASK] from a single square the bass player from a single square <unk> and if you say well <unk> but the guitar bass that 's not so hot do a little more complicated instrument well then you could do an organ [MASK] and what this has allowed is the creation of[MASK] <unk> i want exactly this and this and this [MASK] and you can go out and fold it and sometimes you create high art and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work but i want to show you some examples <unk> everything you 'll see here [MASK] except the car is origami[MASK] <unk> really was[MASK] <unk> folded paper computers made things move <unk> but these were all real folded objects that that we made[MASK] and we can use this not just for visuals <unk> but it turns out to be useful even in the real world <unk> surprisingly origami and the structures that we 've developed in origami turn <unk>[MASK] <unk> out to have applications in medicine in science in space in the body consumer electronics and more and i want to show you some of these examples [MASK] <unk> by koryo miura a japanese engineer he[MASK] studied a folding pattern and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure and he used it to design this <unk>[MASK] <unk> solar array it 's an artist 's rendition but it flew in a japanese telescope in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five [MASK] going up in space <unk> it unfolds in two places it folds in thirds it 's a very simple pattern you wouldn 't even call that origami they certainly didn 't need to talk to origami <unk>[MASK] <unk> artists but if you want to go higher and go larger than this then you might need some origami <unk> [MASK] <unk> a lens the size of a football field there were two groups of people who were interested in this planetary scientists who want to look up [MASK] and then other people who wanted to look down [MASK] whether you look up or look down how do you get it up in space you 've got to get it up there in a rocket and rockets are small so you have to make it smaller how[MASK] <unk> do you make a large sheet of glass smaller well <unk> about the only way is to fold it up somehow so you have to do something like this this was a[MASK] small model folded lens you divide up the panels you add flexures <unk> but this pattern 's not going to work to get something one hundred meters down to a few meters [MASK] so the livermore engineers [MASK] wanting to make use of the work of dead people or perhaps live origamists[MASK] <unk> said let 's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing so they[MASK] looked into the origami community we got in touch with them and i started working with them <unk> and we developed a pattern together[MASK] that scales to arbitrarily large size but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat compact cylinder <unk> and they adopted that for their first generation which was not one hundred meters it was a[MASK] has about a quarter mile focal length and it works perfectly on its test range and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle [MASK] now there is other origami in space japan aerospace [ exploration ] agency flew a solar sail <unk> and you can see here that the sail expands out and you can still see the fold lines [MASK] the problem that 's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet like at its destination <unk> but needs to be small[MASK] <unk> small for the journey <unk> and that works whether you 're going into space <unk> or whether you 're just going into a body <unk> [MASK] and this example is the latter this is a heart stent developed by zhong you at oxford university [MASK] it holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination but it needs to be much smaller for the trip[MASK] <unk> your blood vessels and this stent folds down using an origami pattern based on a model called the water bomb base [MASK] airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space <unk> and they want to do their design by simulation so they need to figure out how in a computer to flatten an airbag [MASK] and the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags[MASK] to do their simulation and so they can do[MASK] a simulation like this those are the origami creases forming and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out does it work <unk> and that[MASK] leads to a really[MASK] interesting idea <unk> you know where did these things come from well <unk> the heart stent[MASK] came from that little blow up box that you might have learned in elementary school[MASK] 's the same pattern <unk> called the water bomb base the <unk>[MASK] <unk> algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects things with legs <unk> [MASK] the thing is that this often happens in math and science when you[MASK] <unk> that you solve for aesthetic value only or to create something beautiful turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world <unk> [MASK] and as weird and surprising as it may sound origami may someday even save a life[MASK]
