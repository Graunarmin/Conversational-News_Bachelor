 <unk> is it[MASK] that french people do better than all the others [MASK] if you would take polls <unk> the top three answers might be love <unk> wine[MASK] <unk> but let me suggest a fourth one [MASK] mathematics [MASK] did you know that paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world and more streets with mathematicians ' names too [MASK] and if you look at the statistics of the fields medal [MASK] often called the nobel prize for mathematics and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of forty [MASK] you will find that france has more fields medalists[MASK] <unk> per inhabitant than any other country <unk> [MASK] what is it that we find so sexy in math[MASK] <unk> after all it seems to be dull and abstract <unk> just numbers and computations and rules to apply [MASK] mathematics may be abstract <unk> but it 's not dull and it 's not about[MASK] <unk> is about reasoning[MASK] and proving our core activity <unk> it is about imagination the talent which we most praise <unk> it is about finding the truth [MASK] there 's nothing like the feeling which invades you when after months of hard thinking you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem[MASK] that this feeling can last for hours or even days <unk> [MASK] the reward may be big <unk> [MASK] hidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world [MASK] they are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses <unk> [MASK] close your eyes for moment and think of what is occurring right now around you[MASK] <unk> invisible particles from the air around are bumping on you by the billions and billions at each second [MASK] all in complete chaos <unk> and still <unk> their statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics <unk> [MASK] and open your eyes now to the statistics of the[MASK] <unk> the law of errors of deviations with respect to the mean behavior [MASK] this curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles in the same way as a demographic curve would tell about the statistics of ages of individuals <unk> [MASK] it 's one of the most important curves[MASK] <unk> keeps on occurring again and again from many theories and many experiments as a great example of the universality[MASK] which is so dear to us mathematicians [MASK] of this curve <unk> the famous scientist francis galton said it would have been deified by the greeks if they had known it[MASK] it is the supreme law of unreason[MASK] <unk> better way to materialize that supreme goddess than galton 's board inside this board[MASK] are narrow tunnels through which tiny balls will fall down randomly going[MASK] right or left <unk> or left <unk> etc all in complete randomness and chaos[MASK] <unk> let 's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together[MASK] <unk> trapped here inside this transparent box as dream in the sandman comics for you[MASK] i have shown it <unk> but to my students i explain why it could not be any other curve <unk> [MASK] and this is touching the mystery of that goddess replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation [MASK] all of science is like this [MASK] and beautiful mathematical explanations[MASK] are not only for our pleasure <unk> they also[MASK] <unk> they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories[MASK] and the gauss curve[MASK] to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms <unk> [MASK] it was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world [MASK] more than two thousand years ago at the time of the ancient greeks[MASK] it already occurred [MASK] in those days only a small fraction of the world had been explored and the earth might have seemed infinite <unk> [MASK] but clever eratosthenes <unk> using mathematics was able to measure the earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent[MASK] <unk> a pendulum swings slightly slower in cayenne than in paris [MASK] from this observation alone <unk> and clever mathematics <unk> newton rightly deduced that the earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles [MASK] like zero point three percent[MASK] so tiny that you wouldn 't even notice it on the real view of the earth [MASK] these stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition[MASK] measure the earth which seems infinite see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape and[MASK] <unk> if there is just one thing that you should take home from this talk <unk> it is this mathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition[MASK] and explore territories which do not fit within our grasp <unk> [MASK] here 's a modern example you will all relate to searching the internet[MASK] <unk> the world wide web more than one billion web pages do you want to go through them all [MASK] computing power helps <unk> but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling to find the information hidden in the data[MASK] let 's work out a baby problem <unk> [MASK] imagine that you 're a detective working on a crime case <unk> and there are many people who have their version of the facts [MASK] who do you want to interview first[MASK] <unk> answer prime witnesses you see suppose that[MASK] there is person number seven [MASK] tells you a story but when you ask where he got if from he points to person number three as a source <unk> [MASK] and maybe person number three in turn points at person number one[MASK] as the primary source now number one is a prime witness so i definitely want to interview[MASK] <unk> him priority <unk> [MASK] and from the graph we also see that person number four is a prime witness <unk> and maybe i even want to interview him first because there are more people who refer to him <unk> [MASK] ok that was easy <unk> but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify[MASK] <unk> and this graph i may think of it as[MASK] all people who testify in a complicated crime case <unk> [MASK] but it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other referring to each other for contents [MASK] which ones are the most authoritative not so clear <unk> [MASK] enter pagerank one of the early cornerstones of google [MASK] this algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to[MASK] <unk> determine automatically the most relevant web pages in the same way as we used randomness in the galton board experiment [MASK] so let 's send into this graph a bunch of tiny digital marbles[MASK] and let them go randomly through the graph [MASK] each time they arrive at some site they will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one <unk> and again[MASK] <unk> again and again and with small growing piles we 'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited by these digital marbles [MASK] here we go randomness randomness [MASK] and from time to time also let 's make jumps completely randomly to increase the fun <unk> [MASK] and look at this from the chaos will emerge the solution the[MASK] <unk> highest piles correspond to those sites which somehow are better connected than the others <unk> more pointed at than the others <unk> and here we see clearly which are the web pages we want to first try <unk> [MASK] once again <unk> the solution emerges from the randomness [MASK] of course <unk> since that time <unk> google has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms[MASK] <unk> was beautiful <unk> [MASK] and still <unk> just one problem in a million [MASK] with the advent of digital area <unk> more and more problems lend themselves to mathematical analysis <unk> [MASK] making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one [MASK] to the extent that a[MASK] few years ago <unk> it was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs in a study[MASK] about the best and worst jobs published by the wall street journal in two thousand and nine mathematician[MASK] best job in the world[MASK] <unk> analysis <unk> and why not stochastic processes linear programming or fluid simulation [MASK] each of these fields have monster industrial applications <unk> and through them there is big money in mathematics [MASK] and let me concede that when it comes to making money from[MASK] <unk> the americans are by a long shot the world champions [MASK] with clever <unk> emblematic billionaires and amazing giant companies all resting <unk> ultimately on good algorithm [MASK] now with all this beauty <unk> usefulness and wealth mathematics does look more sexy <unk> [MASK] but don 't you think that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one <unk> it is filled with perplexity[MASK] frustration a desperate fight for understanding [MASK] let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician 's life [MASK] or should i say one of the most striking nights [MASK] at that time i was staying at the institute for advanced studies in princeton for many years the home of albert einstein and[MASK] <unk> the most holy place for mathematical research in the world[MASK] <unk> and that night i was working and working on an elusive proof which was incomplete <unk> [MASK] it was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas which are a crowd of electrons in[MASK] the perfect world of plasma there are no collisions[MASK] <unk> and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to <unk> [MASK] but still if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes <unk> or damps out as if[MASK] by some mysterious friction force this paradoxical effect <unk> called the landau damping is one of the most important in[MASK] <unk> physics and it was discovered through mathematical ideas[MASK] but still <unk> a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing <unk> and together with my former student and main collaborator[MASK] in paris at the time we had been working for months and months on such a[MASK] <unk> i had already announced by mistake that we could solve it <unk> but the truth is the proof was just not working [MASK] in spite of more than one hundred pages of complicated mathematical arguments and a bunch discoveries and huge calculation it was not working [MASK] and that night in princeton a certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy <unk> i was putting in there all my energy[MASK] and experience and tricks <unk> and still nothing was working one[MASK] <unk> my head i swear take the second term to the other side fourier transform and invert in l2 damn[MASK] it that was the start of the solution [MASK] you see i thought i had taken some rest <unk> but really my brain had continued to work on it in[MASK] those moments you don 't think of your career or your colleagues[MASK] <unk> complete battle between the problem and you [MASK] that being said <unk> it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work and after we completed[MASK] our huge analysis of the landau damping i was lucky enough to get the most coveted fields medal from the[MASK] <unk> hands of the president of india in hyderabad on nineteen august two thousand and ten[MASK] an honor that mathematicians never dare to dream a day that i will remember until i live <unk> [MASK] what do you think on such an occasion <unk> [MASK] pride yes <unk> and gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible <unk> [MASK] and because it was a collective adventure you need to share it not just with your collaborators[MASK] <unk> collaborators [MASK] i believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research and share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it[MASK] and i 've been working with my staff at institut[MASK] together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide so that we can found our own very special[MASK] museum of mathematics there [MASK] so in a few years [MASK] when you come to paris <unk> after tasting the great crispy baguette and macaroon <unk> [MASK] please come and visit us at institut henri poincar and share the mathematical dream with us thank you[MASK]
