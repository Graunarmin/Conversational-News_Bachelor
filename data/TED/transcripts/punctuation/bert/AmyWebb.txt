 <unk> name is amy webb and a few years ago i found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion <unk> [MASK] and i[MASK] <unk> what 's wrong with me i don 't understand why this keeps happening <unk> so i asked everybody in my life what they thought[MASK] i turned to my grandmother who always had[MASK] plenty of advice and she said stop being so picky you 've got to date around <unk> and most importantly true love will find you[MASK] when you least expect it now as it turns out <unk> i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about[MASK] <unk> i am constantly swimming in numbers formulas and charts[MASK] <unk> i also have a very tight knit family and i 'm very very close with my sister and as a result i wanted to have the same type of family when i grew up <unk> so i 'm at the end of this bad breakup i 'm thirty years old [MASK] i figure[MASK] i 'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months[MASK] before i 'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of[MASK] <unk> have to do that for a while before we can get engaged <unk> [MASK] and if i want to start having children by the time i 'm thirty five that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago <unk> [MASK] so that wasn 't going to work if my strategy was to least expect my way into true love then the variable that i had to deal with was serendipity[MASK] <unk> in short i was trying to figure out what 's the probability of my finding mr right well [MASK] <unk> the time i was living in the city of philadelphia and it 's a big city <unk> and i figured[MASK] in this entire place there are lots of possibilities <unk> so again i started doing some math [MASK] population of philadelphia it[MASK] has one point five million people i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to seven hundred and fifty thousand i 'm[MASK] looking for a guy between the ages of thirty and thirty six which[MASK] was only four percent of the population so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of thirty thousand men i was looking for somebody who was jewish because[MASK] <unk> and that was important to me that 's only two point three percent of the population[MASK] i figure i 'm attracted to maybe one out of ten of those men and there was no way i was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer[MASK] <unk> so that basically meant there were thirty five men for me that i could[MASK] possibly date[MASK] in the entire city of[MASK] <unk> in the meantime my very large jewish family[MASK] was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children and i felt like i was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already [MASK] so i have two possible strategies at this point i 'm sort of figuring out one i can take my grandmother 's advice and sort of[MASK] <unk> my way into maybe bumping into the one[MASK] <unk> city of philadelphia or[MASK] i could try online dating [MASK] now i like the idea of online dating because it 's predicated on an algorithm <unk> and that 's really just a simple way of saying i 've got a problem i 'm going to use some data run it through a system and get to a solution [MASK] so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other[MASK] <unk> but as it turns out algorithms have been around for thousands of years[MASK] in almost every culture <unk> in fact in judaism there were matchmakers a long time ago and though they didn 't have an explicit algorithm per se they definitely were running through formulas in their heads like [MASK] is the girl going to like the boy are the families going to get along what 's the rabbi going to say are they going to start having children right away[MASK] the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this put two people together and that would be the end of it <unk> so in my case i thought[MASK] <unk> well <unk> will data[MASK] and an algorithm lead me to my prince charming <unk> [MASK] so i decided to sign on now there was one small catch as i 'm signing on to the various dating websites [MASK] as it happens i was really really busy but that actually that actually wasn 't the biggest problem <unk> [MASK] the biggest problem is that i hate filling out questionnaires of any kind[MASK] and i certainly don 't like questionnaires that are like cosmo quizzes <unk> so i just copied[MASK] <unk> and pasted from my rsum [MASK] so in the descriptive part up top <unk> i said that i was an award winning journalist <unk>[MASK] and a future thinker when i was asked about fun activities and my ideal date i said monetization[MASK] <unk> obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward <unk> [MASK] but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates what turned out to be truly[MASK] awful dates there was this guy[MASK] <unk> the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data[MASK] and ' 80s music and so i agreed to go out with him <unk> [MASK] so steve the i t guy invited me out to one of philadelphia 's white table cloth extremely expensive restaurants [MASK] and we went in and right off the bat our conversation really wasn 't taking flight[MASK] but he was ordering a lot of food in fact he didn 't even bother looking at the menu he was ordering multiple appetizers multiple[MASK] <unk> me as well <unk> and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table also lots and lots of bottles of wine[MASK] <unk> so we 're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and i 've decided steve the i t guy and i are really just not meant for each other but we 'll part ways as friends [MASK] when he gets up to go to the bathroom [MASK] and in the meantime <unk> the bill comes to[MASK] <unk> i 'm a modern woman i am totally down with with splitting the bill but then steve the i t guy didn 't come back and[MASK] that was my entire month 's rent audience[MASK] gasps so needless to say <unk> i was not having a good night <unk> [MASK] so i run home <unk> i call my mother <unk> i call my sister and as i do at the end of each one of these terrible[MASK] <unk> you 're just being too picky [MASK] so i said fine from here on out i 'm only going on dates where i know there 's wi fi and i 'm bringing my laptop i 'm[MASK] going to shove it into my bag <unk> i 'm going to have this email template <unk> and i 'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible[MASK] <unk> started tracking things like[MASK] really stupid awkward sexual remarks bad vocabulary [MASK] the number of times a man forced me to high five him [MASK] so i started to crunch some numbers <unk> and that allowed me to make some correlations <unk> so as it turns out[MASK] <unk> some reason men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately well [MASK] it turns out that these probably weren 't bad guys there were just bad for me <unk> and as it happens the algorithms that were setting us up [MASK] they weren 't bad either these algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do <unk> which was to take our[MASK] see the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and i don 't when confronted with blank windows where we 're supposed to input our information online [MASK] very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves <unk> [MASK] the other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like are you a dog person or a cat person[MASK] <unk> do you like horror films or romance films <unk> i 'm not looking for a pen pal i 'm looking for a husband right [MASK] so there 's a certain amount of superficiality in that data <unk> so i said fine <unk> i 've got a new plan i 'm going to keep using these online dating sites but i 'm going to treat them as databases [MASK] and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up i think i 'm going to try <unk>[MASK] <unk> this entire system <unk> so knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people[MASK] <unk> decided instead to ask my own questions what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate <unk> so i started writing[MASK] and writing[MASK] and writing [MASK] and at the end i had amassed seventy two different data points <unk> i wanted somebody was jew ish so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and[MASK] thoughts on our culture but wasn 't going to force me to go to shul every[MASK] <unk> friday and saturday <unk> [MASK] i wanted somebody who worked hard [MASK] because work for me is extremely important but not too hard for me <unk> the hobbies that i have are really just new work projects that i 've launched[MASK] <unk> i also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that i do <unk> so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three[MASK] <unk> maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it [MASK] so things like that but i also wanted somebody who would go to far flung exotic places like petra jordan <unk> [MASK] i also wanted somebody who would weigh twenty pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed [MASK] so i now have these seventy two different data points <unk> which to be[MASK] <unk> so what i did was i went through and i prioritized that list i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points[MASK] <unk> and i ranked everything starting at one hundred[MASK] and going all the way down to ninety one [MASK] and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart who would challenge and stimulate me <unk> and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points[MASK] <unk> these things were also important to me but not[MASK] <unk> had all this done i then built a scoring system <unk> because[MASK] what i wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not i thought the guy that i found online would be a match with me [MASK] i figured there would be a minimum of seven hundred points before i would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message [MASK] for nine hundred points i 'd agree to go out on a date <unk> and i wouldn 't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the one thousand five hundred point threshold[MASK] well as it turns out <unk> this worked pretty well <unk> so i go back online now i found[MASK] who 's incredibly good looking incredibly well spoken he had hiked mt fuji <unk> he had walked along the great wall he likes to travel as long as it doesn 't involve a cruise ship and i thought <unk> [MASK] done it i 've cracked the code i have just found the jewish prince charming[MASK] of my family 's dreams there was only one problem <unk> [MASK] he didn 't like me back <unk> [MASK] and i guess the one variable that i haven 't considered is the competition who are all of the other women on these dating sites <unk> [MASK] <unk> as teacher she said she is silly nice and friendly she likes to make people laugh alot [MASK] at this moment i knew <unk> clicking profile after profile after profile that looked like this that i needed to do some market research <unk> so[MASK] i created ten fake male profiles now before i lose all of you [MASK] <unk> that i did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system <unk> i didn 't carry on crazy catfish style relationships with anybody <unk> [MASK] i really was just scraping their data <unk> but i didn 't want everybody 's data <unk> i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really really wanted to marry[MASK] when i released these men into the wild i did follow some rules <unk> so i didn 't reach out to any woman first[MASK] <unk> just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract [MASK] and mainly what i was looking at was two different data sets so i was looking at qualitative data <unk> so what was the humor the tone <unk> the voice the communication style that these women shared in common <unk>[MASK] and also quantitative data <unk> so what was the average length of their profile how much time was spent between messages <unk> [MASK] <unk> i wanted to figure out how to maximize my own[MASK] profile online well one month later <unk> i had[MASK] a lot of data and i was able to do another analysis <unk> and as it turns out <unk> content matters a lot so smart people tend to write a lot three thousand four thousand five thousand words about[MASK] <unk> which may all be very very interesting the challenge here though is that the popular men and women are sticking to ninety seven words on average[MASK] that are written very very well <unk> even though it may not seem like it all the time[MASK] <unk> the other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they 're using non specific language <unk> so in my case the english patient is my most favorite movie ever[MASK] <unk> but[MASK] it doesn 't work[MASK] <unk> to use that in a profile because that 's a superficial data point and somebody may disagree and decide they don 't want to go out because they didn 't like sitting through the three hour movie [MASK] also optimistic language matters a lot so this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women words like fun and girl and love [MASK] and what i realized was not that i had to dumb down my own profile remember i 'm somebody who said that i speak fluent[MASK] <unk> and i know javascript and i was okay with that the difference is that it 's about being more approachable[MASK] and and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you [MASK] and as it turns out timing is also really really important just because you have access to somebody 's mobile phone number or their instant message account[MASK] and it 's two o 'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake doesn 't mean that that 's a good time to to communicate with those people the popular women on on these online sites[MASK] spend an average of twenty three hours in between each communication[MASK] and that 's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship <unk> and finally[MASK] there were the photos all of the women who were popular showed some skin[MASK] they all looked really great <unk> which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had uploaded [MASK] <unk> as it turns out[MASK] <unk> telling them about this fabulous news and they say this is wonderful how soon are you going out [MASK] i said actually i 'm not going to go out with anybody because remember in my scoring system they have to reach a minimum threshold of seven hundred points and none of them have done that they said [MASK] what you 're still being too damn picky well not too long after that i found this guy [MASK] <unk> and he said that he was culturally jewish <unk> he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter <unk> which i thought was very clever[MASK] he talked[MASK] in detail about travel he made a lot of really interesting cultural references he looked and talked exactly like what i wanted [MASK] and immediately he scored eight hundred and fifty points it was enough for a date [MASK] three weeks later we met up in person for[MASK] <unk> that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant and when he dropped me back off at my house that night i re scored him [ one thousand and fifty points ][MASK] thought you know what this entire time i haven 't been picky enough well a year and a half after that we were non cruise ship traveling[MASK] through petra jordan <unk> when he got down on his knee and[MASK] <unk> year after that we were married and about a year and a half after that our daughter petra was born audience oh [ what it means[MASK] obviously i 'm having a fabulous life so [MASK] the question is what does all of this mean for you well <unk> as it turns out <unk> there is an algorithm for love it 's just not the ones that we 're being presented with online <unk> in fact[MASK] it 's something that you write yourself so whether you 're looking for a husband or a wife or you 're trying to find your passion or you 're trying to start a business [MASK] all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules and feel free to be as picky as you want [MASK] well on my wedding day i had a conversation again with my grandmother and she said [MASK] all right maybe i was wrong it looks like you did come up with a really really great system[MASK] <unk> now your matzah balls <unk> they should be fluffy not hard and i 'll take her advice on[MASK]
