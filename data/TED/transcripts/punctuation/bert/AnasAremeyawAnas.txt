 <unk> am sorry i cannot show you my face because if i do the bad guys will come for me [MASK] my journey started fourteen years ago <unk>[MASK] <unk> i was a young reporter i had just come out of college then i got a scoop the scoop was[MASK] quite a very simple story <unk> police officers were taking bribes[MASK] from hawkers who were hawking on the streets [MASK] as a young reporter i thought that i should do it in a different way <unk> so that it has a maximum impact <unk> since everybody knew that it was happening <unk> and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system[MASK] so i decided to go there[MASK] and[MASK] act[MASK] as a seller as part of selling <unk> i was able to document the hard core evidence <unk> [MASK] the impact was great <unk> [MASK] it was fantastic [MASK] this was what[MASK] many call immersion[MASK] <unk> i am an undercover journalist [MASK] my journalism is hinged on three basic principles <unk> naming <unk> shaming[MASK] and jailing journalism is about results it 's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive[MASK] <unk> i have worked on this for over fourteen years and i can tell you the results are very good one story that comes to mind[MASK] in my undercover pieces[MASK] is spirit child it was about children[MASK] who were born with deformities <unk> and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities <unk> they were not good enough[MASK] <unk> live in the society so they were given some concoction to take[MASK] and as a result they died <unk> so i built a prosthetic baby <unk> and i went into the village <unk> pretended as though[MASK] this baby[MASK] had been born with a deformity <unk> and here was the guys who do the killing they got themselves ready [MASK] in their bids to kill i got the police on standby[MASK] <unk> they came that fateful morning[MASK] to come and kill the child <unk> [MASK] i recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction they[MASK] put it on fire it was boiling hot <unk> getting ready to give to the kids <unk> [MASK] whilst this was going on the police i had alerted they were on standby <unk> [MASK] and just as the concoction was ready <unk> and they were about to give it[MASK] <unk> i phoned the police and fortunately[MASK] they came and busted them <unk> [MASK] as i speak now they are before the courts don 't forget the key principles <unk> naming <unk> shaming and jailing <unk> [MASK] the court process is taking place <unk> and i 'm very sure at the end of the day we will find them and we will[MASK] put them where they belong too [MASK] another key story that comes to mind which relates to[MASK] this spirit[MASK] <unk> child phenomenon is the spell of the albinos i[MASK] 'm sure most of you may have heard in tanzania children who are born with albinism[MASK] are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society their bodies are chopped[MASK] <unk> to be used for some concoctions or some potions[MASK] for people to get money or so many many stories people would tell about it it was time to go undercover again <unk> so i went undercover[MASK] as a man who was interested in this particular business of course <unk> again a prosthetic arm was built for the first time <unk> [MASK] i filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this[MASK] and they were ready to buy the arm[MASK] and they were ready to use it to prepare those[MASK] potions for people [MASK] i am glad today the tanzanian government has taken action but the key issue is that the tanzanian government could only take action[MASK] because the evidence was available [MASK] <unk> to do what is the essence of journalism if it doesn 't benefit society <unk> [MASK] my kind of journalism is a product of my society [MASK] i know[MASK] <unk> he brought out some money from his pockets and[MASK] <unk> utter a word but my colleagues didn 't know so after[MASK] after collecting the money when he left we were waiting for him to bring the goods <unk>[MASK] <unk> left i told my colleagues that since i was the leader of the group <unk> i told my colleagues that if they come we will arrest them second official i don 't even[MASK] <unk> i 've never stepped there before so i 'm surprised <unk> you see[MASK] a hand[MASK] counting money just in front of me the next moment <unk> you see the money[MASK] in my hands counting whereas i have not come into contact with anybody i have not done any business with anybody reporter when metro news contacted investigative reporter anas aremeyaw anas for his[MASK] <unk> he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen <unk> [MASK] the officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled anas aremeyaw[MASK] anas this was another story on anticorruption <unk> and here was him denying but you see when you have the hard core evidence you[MASK] <unk> able to affect society <unk> sometimes these are some of the headlines that come[MASK] <unk> leading the customs officers into temptation i 'm telling you ghana is not going to say[MASK] any good things to you about this aaa that was my president <unk> [MASK] i thought that i couldn 't come here without giving you something special <unk> i have a piece[MASK] i 'm excited that i 'm sharing it for the first time with you here <unk> i have been undercover[MASK] in the prisons <unk> i have been there[MASK] for a long time <unk> and i can tell you [MASK] what i saw is not nice <unk> but again <unk> i can only affect society and affect government if i bring out the hard core evidence[MASK] many times <unk> the prison authorities have denied[MASK] ever having issues of drug abuse issues of sodomy so many issues they would deny that it ever happens [MASK] how can you obtain the hard core evidence <unk> [MASK] so i was in the prison [ nsawan prison ][MASK] now <unk> what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies now i happen to have followed[MASK] one of my inmates one of my friends from his sick bed till death <unk> and i can tell you it was not a nice thing at all [MASK] there were issues of[MASK] bad food being served as[MASK] i recall that some of the food i ate is just not good for a human being [MASK] toilet facilities very bad[MASK] i mean you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend and that 's what i call proper when four of us are on a <unk>[MASK] it is something that if you narrate it to somebody the person wouldn 't believe it [MASK] the only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence of course drugs[MASK] <unk> to get cannabis heroin and cocaine <unk> faster even in the prison than outside the prison <unk> evil in the society[MASK] is an extreme disease [MASK] if you have extreme diseases <unk> you need to get extreme remedies [MASK] my kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries <unk> but i can tell you it works in my part of the continent of africa <unk> because usually[MASK] <unk> when people talk about corruption they ask where is the evidence show me the evidence i say this is the evidence [MASK] and that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars <unk> [MASK] you see we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions [MASK] that is why i was particularly excited when we launched our africa investigates series where we investigated a[MASK] <unk> of african countries <unk> [MASK] as a result of the success of the africa investigates series we are moving on to world investigates <unk> [MASK] by the end of it a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars [MASK] this will not stop i 'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism <unk> because i know[MASK] <unk> i have some questions for you how did you end up in jail this was just a few weeks ago i believe yeah aaa [MASK] sure you know undercover is all about setting the priorities right so we got people to take me to[MASK] <unk> so i went through the very legal process because at the end of the day the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not [MASK] and that 's how i got in there ca so someone someone sued you in court and they took you there and you were in remand custody for part of it[MASK] <unk> your life at risk[MASK] how do you do that aaa you see undercover is always a last resort [MASK] before we go undercover we follow the rules <unk> and i 'm only comfortable and i 'm purged of fear whenever i am sure that all the steps[MASK] have been taken <unk> i don 't do it alone i have a backup team who help ensure that the safety and all the systems[MASK] <unk> are put in place but you 've got to take very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening <unk> if you don 't you will end up losing your life so yes when the backup systems are put in place i 'm okay i go in risky yes but[MASK] it 's a hazard of a profession i mean everybody has their hazard <unk> and[MASK] once you say that is yours you 've got to take it as and when it comes ca [MASK] well you 're an amazing human and you 've done amazing work and you 've taught us a story like no story i think any of us have heard before and[MASK] we 're appreciative we salute you thank you so much[MASK]
