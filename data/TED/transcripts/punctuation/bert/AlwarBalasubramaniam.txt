 <unk> so many memories come back to me [MASK] it 's like after every exam when i walk out the teacher would say hey come how did you do[MASK] <unk> i would say with a great smile i will definitely pass and i didn 't understand why in one hand they say speak the truth in the other hand when you say the truth they hated you <unk> [MASK] so it went on like that and i didn 't know where else to find myself <unk> so i remember those nights i used to go to sleep with[MASK] asking help from [ the ] unknown[MASK] because for some reason i couldn 't believe what my father and mother hanged in the puja room as a god because my friend 's family[MASK] <unk> had something else as a god <unk> so <unk> i thought i guess i 'll pray to [ the ] unknown and ask help and[MASK] started getting help from everywhere each and every corner of my life at that time my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting [MASK] then when i was in eighth standard[MASK] <unk> job in one of the signboard artists called putu and then[MASK] school also started supporting me oh he 's bad at studies but let him send to the drawing competitions so[MASK] it was good to survive with that little tool that i found to find my own place in school [MASK] and one of those competitions i just won a small little transistor philips radio and[MASK] <unk> didn 't have the patience to wait until i reached home <unk> [MASK] so i just switched on in the train loudly if you travel in indian trains you can see people listening to radio and you know <unk> [MASK] even from their mobiles <unk> so at that time <unk> and i was thirteen and i was listening to[MASK] just radio and someone happened to sit next to me like these three people are sitting here you know like[MASK] <unk> college of arts i think you should[MASK] study in a school of art you just quit school and come there [MASK] so <unk> why i 'm telling you this you know maybe <unk> you know <unk> whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life it 's possible [MASK] it is that we need we need to be open and fine tuned [MASK] so that 's what made me[MASK] ] college of arts after three attempts[MASK] and just continue to inquire what i really want to do with art work or art[MASK] and finally i 'm here in front of you when i look back you know <unk> on what happened between that time and now[MASK] here the last ten fifteen years i can see that most of the works[MASK] revolve around three[MASK] <unk> subjects <unk> but it was not intentional <unk> and i just start out with a trace because[MASK] i was thinking what really makes us you know it 's actually [ the ] past what makes a person <unk> so i was thinking but[MASK] when you[MASK] look at the past the way to understand the past is only by the traces available because we cannot go back [ to ] the past[MASK] <unk> it can be ruins or it can be music <unk> or it can be painting or drawing or writing whatever it is but it is just a[MASK] kind of trace of that time and that fascinated me to explore that[MASK] territory <unk> so i was working on the[MASK] line but instead of[MASK] working about traces <unk> i started capturing traces <unk> so here are some of the works i would like to show you[MASK] so[MASK] this is called self in progress it 's just a trace of being in this body <unk> [MASK] so here what happened then you know what i really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a[MASK] trace of myself <unk> [MASK] it 's almost like a 3d photograph <unk> so there is an element of performance and there is an element of sculpture and there is an element of feeling one 's self <unk> so close to one 's[MASK] <unk> so it 's almost like fossils for the future <unk> and then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces <unk> [MASK] so this is what i was talking about while molding <unk> it 's such a great experience because we have freedom of like walking or moving my hand or [MASK] moving around in the space but the moment this becomes solid[MASK] <unk> move even an inch because this is plaster of paris so the moment you pour it it 's like liquid but after twenty minutes it 's almost like a hard stone <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because <unk> knowingly or unknowingly whatever we do you know we leave our traces here <unk> so i just thought i 'm going to capture[MASK] <unk> this is the trace of fire [MASK] this is the trace of sun <unk> [MASK] because when i was capturing traces you know this thought comes to me always [MASK] is it only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace or is there other ways to capture it [MASK] so this work is nothing but like because of the focal length of the[MASK] <unk> what is on the other side <unk> so[MASK] i just put the paper on the focal length which was an etching print then i got the portrait of [ the ] sun from sunlight <unk> [MASK] this is called dawn to dawn what i did here i just put like ten feet [ of ] paper[MASK] then put a coconut rope and just burnt it so it took about twenty four hours to get this line <unk> [MASK] so wherever the fire is eating the paper that 's what becomes the work[MASK] detail[MASK] even though we have traces when we try to understand them <unk> [MASK] the perception and context play a major role to understand it <unk> so do we really understand what it is or are we trying to get[MASK] what we think it[MASK] <unk> then move towards questioning the perception because even though there are traces when you try to understand them you know you play a major role [MASK] so like let 's say even a simple act how many of you saw a cow crossing in india[MASK] while you were coming from bangalore to mysore can you just raise the hand if you just ask an opinion of how[MASK] everyone can interpret it like let 's say if a schoolteacher says <unk> she 'll simply say to get to the other side why the cow was crossing the road[MASK] <unk> the answer can be so different if potter said it he would say for the greater good [MASK] martin luther king would say i imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road <unk> [MASK] without having their motives called into question [MASK] imagine moses comes now <unk> and he sees the same cow walking around the street he would definitely say[MASK] <unk> god came down from heaven <unk> and he said unto the cow ' thou shalt cross the road[MASK] ' and cow crossed the road <unk> and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow [MASK] freud would say the fact that you 're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity[MASK] <unk> einstein <unk> he would say whether the cow crossed the road <unk> or the road moved underneath the cow depends on your frame of reference [MASK] or buddha if he saw the same cow <unk> he would say asking this question denies your own nature[MASK] and most of the time <unk> we don 't see what it is it just all depends on one 's perception and[MASK] context what is really context you know i could just show you this little piece of paper <unk> because i always think meaning doesn 't really exist <unk> [MASK] the meaning of what we create in this world doesn 't exist <unk> it 's just created by the mind if you look at this piece of paper[MASK] this is the breadth and this is called length <unk> this is how we 've been taught in school <unk> [MASK] but if you tear it in the middle[MASK] now i didn 't touch this breadth but still the meaning of this changes <unk> [MASK] so what we conceive as a meaning is always not there it 's on the other side <unk> [MASK] even when we say dark light[MASK] <unk> tall short all meaning it doesn 't exist in reality it 's just that being a human <unk> the way we train to[MASK] perceive the reality creates this meaning <unk> so this work from this period is mostly like you know this is[MASK] a work called light makes dark it 's just captured through from the lamp <unk> so[MASK] <unk> the lamp is not just giving a light it 's also giving a darkness so this is a work of art which is just[MASK] trying to explore that [MASK] this is called limit out this shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch do we really see [MASK] this is an exact negative it 's about six inches deep in the wall <unk> but[MASK] it just appears like it 's coming out of the wall[MASK] you know the wall[MASK] <unk> almost like[MASK] this is the first skin and this is the second and there 's a third and each creates a meaning and we 're just pulling the wall off the gallery <unk> [MASK] again inward out it 's a full figure cast from myself it 's about eight inches deep [MASK] when i was doing that i always wondered since i 've worked with creators and now you know i 've[MASK] moved to questioning the perception[MASK] whenever i see the bird flying in the sky <unk> it just makes me feel like[MASK] there anything behind are there any traces up there <unk> which as a human we don 't see them is there any way to capture the thought[MASK] into visual art <unk> i couldn 't find it <unk> but[MASK] a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about[MASK] seven months in the restroom when i was changing the air freshener[MASK] that goes from solid substance to vapor <unk> it 's called odonil <unk> this is the work i made out of that material <unk> [MASK] the process to get to make the sculpture was interesting because i wrote to balsara who produces that air freshener called odonil <unk> saying dear sir i am an artist this is my catalogue will you help me to make this sculpture [MASK] <unk> wrote back to me <unk> then i thought i will go to the small scale industries facilitating unit and ask help so i told them i 'd like to start an air freshener company [MASK] they said of course <unk> this is the fee for the project report and we will give you all the details and they gave <unk> finally [MASK] i went back to them and said it 's not for starting the company it 's just to make my own work please come for the show [MASK] and they did[MASK] <unk> devi art foundation in delhi [MASK] in india <unk> nobody really talks about works of art they always talk about the appreciation of art you buy this for three thousand rupees it 'll become thirty thousand in two months <unk> [MASK] this is the craft that was going on but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate <unk> [MASK] and this was collected by anupam which is like finally in the end he will not have anything because[MASK] <unk> so this is after a few weeks <unk> [MASK] this is after a few months <unk> it 's just all about questioning the preconceptions so if someone says oh i see the portrait [MASK] it may not be the portrait after a few months <unk> and if they say it 's solid <unk> it will not be solid <unk> it will evaporate <unk> [MASK] and if they say they don 't get it <unk> that 's also not true <unk> [MASK] <unk> it 's in the air it 's in the same gallery or in the same museum so[MASK] they inhaled it <unk> but they are not aware of it [MASK] while i was doing that work [MASK] my mom and my dad they were looking at it and they said [MASK] why do you deal with negative subjects all the time and i was like what do you mean light makes dark[MASK] and now evaporating self don 't you think it remained something about[MASK] <unk> of course not for me i 'm thinking this is tucked in some small solid <unk> but the moment it evaporates <unk> it 's merged with the whole [MASK] but she said no still i don 't like it can you make something from nothing as a sculptor i said no mom it can 't be <unk> because[MASK] we can[MASK] create a sculpture by gathering dust together <unk> or we can break the sculpture and get the dust [MASK] but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe[MASK] so i did this work for her <unk> it 's called emerging angel this is the first day[MASK] it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other [MASK] so the same sculpture after a few days <unk> [MASK] this is after fifteen twenty days <unk>[MASK] <unk> through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one [MASK] this gave me a greater faith that evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [ the ] invisible <unk> [MASK] so what you see now[MASK] is called shadow foreshadow and what i 'd like to tell you[MASK] is we don 't see shadow <unk> and we don 't see light too <unk> we see the source of the light <unk> we see where it 's bouncing but we don 't see[MASK] <unk> they exist you know that 's why the night sky we see the sky as dark <unk> but it 's filled with light all the time <unk> [MASK] when it 's bounced on the moon we see it the same thing in the darkroom the little dust particle will[MASK] again <unk> reflect the light and we realize[MASK] the existence of light <unk> so we don 't see dark <unk> we don 't see light <unk> we don 't see gravity <unk> we don 't see electricity[MASK] <unk> i just started[MASK] doing this work to inquire[MASK] further about how to sculpt[MASK] the space between this object[MASK] and there because as a visual artist if i 'm seeing this and i 'm seeing that[MASK] but how to sculpt this you[MASK] if we sculpt this this has two reference points <unk> the skin of this is also representing this and skin at the other end also represents the floor [MASK] i did this as[MASK] <unk> experiment of casting the shadow so this is a corrugated box and its shadow <unk> then the second one the moment you bring any[MASK] invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence so that produced a shadow <unk> then i thought okay let me sculpt that [MASK] then again that becomes an object again <unk> throwing light[MASK] <unk> then the third one <unk> so what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow <unk> [MASK] and then again at that point there is no shadow i thought oh good work is finished [MASK] you can see the detail <unk> [MASK] this is called[MASK] <unk> false wall which contains like one hundred and ten cubic feet <unk> so that hole actually[MASK] makes the air come out and go in [MASK] so where it 's happening we can see but what is happening will remain invisible only this is from the show called invisible at talwar gallery <unk> this is called kaayam [MASK] detail <unk> [MASK] and what i 'd like to tell you[MASK] <unk> our senses are so limited we cannot hear everything we cannot see everything we don 't feel i am touching the air but if the breeze is a little more faster then i can feel it <unk> [MASK] so all of our[MASK] construction of reality is through these limited senses so[MASK] my request was like is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign and to really get to the point we should[MASK] <unk> move beyond you know go to the other side of the wall like illogic like are invisible <unk> [MASK] because when we see someone walks we see the footprint <unk> but if we 're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints and the footprints are nothing but passing time <unk> [MASK]
