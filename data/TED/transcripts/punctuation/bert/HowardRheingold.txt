 <unk> i 'm here to enlist you[MASK] in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things[MASK] <unk> here is the old story we 've already heard a little bit about it <unk> biology[MASK] is war[MASK] in which only the fiercest survive businesses[MASK] and nations succeed only[MASK] by defeating <unk> destroying and dominating[MASK] <unk> is about your side winning[MASK] at all costs <unk> [MASK] but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge [MASK] it 's a narrative spread across[MASK] a number of different disciplines <unk> [MASK] <unk> survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room <unk> [MASK] i started thinking about the relationship between[MASK] communication[MASK] media and[MASK] collective action when i wrote smart mobs and i found that when i finished the book i kept thinking about it <unk> [MASK] in fact <unk> if you look back [MASK] human communication media and[MASK] the ways in which we organize[MASK] <unk> for quite a long time humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately ten thousand years of[MASK] settled agricultural civilization[MASK] in small family groups <unk> nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food [MASK] the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive <unk> [MASK] but at some point[MASK] <unk> they banded together to hunt bigger game and we don 't know exactly how they did this although[MASK] they must have solved some collective action problems [MASK] it only makes sense that you can 't hunt mastodons while you 're fighting with the other groups <unk> [MASK] and again we have no way of knowing but it 's clear that a new form of wealth[MASK] <unk> wealth must have emerged more protein than a hunter 's family could eat before it rotted <unk> [MASK] so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms [MASK] did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families <unk> and[MASK] <unk> how did they make arrangements again we can 't know but[MASK] we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved of[MASK] course with agriculture came the first big civilizations <unk> the first cities built of mud and brick the first empires <unk> and it was the administers of these empires[MASK] who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine[MASK] that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks marks on clay in that time[MASK] <unk> not too much longer after that the alphabet was invented [MASK] and this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite[MASK] <unk> who kept track[MASK] of accounts for the empires <unk> and then another communication technology enabled new media the printing press came along and within decades <unk> [MASK] millions of people became literate <unk> [MASK] and from literate populations new forms of collective action emerged in in the spheres of knowledge[MASK] and politics we saw scientific revolutions <unk> the protestant reformation <unk> constitutional democracies[MASK] possible where they had not been possible before not created by the printing press <unk> but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy <unk> [MASK] <unk> new forms of wealth emerged <unk> [MASK] now commerce is ancient <unk> markets are as old as the crossroads <unk> [MASK] but capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old [MASK] enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies such as the joint stock ownership company <unk> shared liability insurance double entry bookkeeping <unk> [MASK] now of course <unk> the enabling technologies[MASK] are based[MASK] <unk> on the internet and in the[MASK] era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community[MASK] or a marketplace <unk> [MASK] evolution is speeding up [MASK] more recently that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops <unk> and very very quickly[MASK] <unk> to see a significant proportion if not the majority of the human race <unk> walking around[MASK] holding <unk> [MASK] carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today <unk> [MASK] now when i started looking into collective action the considerable literature on it[MASK] is based on what sociologists call social dilemmas and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas i 'm going to[MASK] talk briefly about two of them the prisoner 's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons <unk> [MASK] now when i talked about this with kevin kelly he assured me that everybody in this audience[MASK] pretty much knows the details of the prisoner 's dilemma[MASK] <unk> so i 'm just going to go over that very very quickly if you have more questions about it ask kevin kelly later [MASK] laughter the prisoner 's dilemma is actually a story that 's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory[MASK] in the early years of thinking about nuclear war two players who couldn 't trust each other <unk> [MASK] let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner 's dilemma <unk> person with the[MASK] <unk> goods <unk> person with the money because they can 't trust each other are not going to exchange neither one wants to be the first one[MASK] or they 're going to get the sucker 's payoff but both lose of course <unk> because they don 't get what they want if they could only agree if they could only turn a prisoner 's dilemma into[MASK] a different payoff matrix called an assurance game they could proceed[MASK] <unk> twenty years ago robert axelrod used the prisoner 's dilemma as a probe of the biological question [MASK] if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors how does cooperation exist at all he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner[MASK] <unk> 's dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise that a very very simple strategy won[MASK] it won the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won [MASK] it won the second tournament that 's known as tit for tat [MASK] another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner 's dilemma is the ultimatum game[MASK] <unk> and it 's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about[MASK] the way people make economic transactions here 's how the game is played [MASK] there are two players they 've never played the game before they will not play the game again <unk> they don 't know each other <unk> and they are in fact <unk> in separate rooms first player is offered a hundred dollars[MASK] and is asked to propose a split <unk>[MASK] <unk> that player wants to propose the second player[MASK] either accepts the split both[MASK] players are paid and the game is over[MASK] or rejects the split neither player is paid and the game is over [MASK] now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it 's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don 't know in another room is[MASK] <unk> going to get ninety nine yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students [MASK] a significant percentage would reject any offer that 's not close to fifty fifty <unk> and although[MASK] they were screened and didn 't know about the game and had never played[MASK] <unk> to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to fifty fifty <unk> [MASK] now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures[MASK] and discovered to their surprise that[MASK] <unk> agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures each had radically[MASK] <unk> different ideas of what is fair which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness that somehow the basis of our economic transactions transactions[MASK] can be influenced by[MASK] our social institutions whether we know that or not the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons[MASK] <unk> garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s he used the[MASK] example of a common grazing area in which each person[MASK] by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource <unk> he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource[MASK] <unk> in which people cannot be restrained from using it <unk> [MASK] now elinor ostrom a political scientist in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask <unk> which is is[MASK] it really true that humans will always despoil commons so she went out and looked at what data she could find she looked at thousands of[MASK] of humans sharing watersheds <unk> forestry resources <unk> fisheries and discovered that yes <unk> in case after case humans[MASK] <unk> destroyed the commons that they depended on but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner 's dilemma[MASK] <unk> the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner 's dilemma and she said that people are only prisoners[MASK] if they consider themselves to be [MASK] they escape by creating institutions for collective action and she discovered i think most interestingly that[MASK] among those institutions that worked <unk> there were a number of common design principles[MASK] <unk> and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don 't work [MASK] i 'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines <unk> in biology the notions of symbiosis <unk> [MASK] group selection evolutionary psychology are contested to be sure [MASK] but there is really no longer any major debate[MASK] over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level[MASK] of the cell to the level of the ecology <unk> and again our notions of individuals as economic beings[MASK] have been overturned <unk> rational <unk>[MASK] <unk> not always the dominating factor <unk> in fact people[MASK] will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselves <unk> and most recently[MASK] <unk> neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games[MASK] show activity in the reward centers of their brain which led one scientist[MASK] to declare that altruistic punishment[MASK] may be the glue that holds societies[MASK] <unk> i 've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms <unk> [MASK] commerce is ancient <unk> markets are very old capitalism is fairly recent socialism emerged as a reaction to that [MASK] and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging[MASK] <unk> jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler 's paper about open source <unk> pointing to a new form of production <unk> peer to peer production <unk> [MASK] <unk> i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth we may be <unk>[MASK] <unk> moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones [MASK] <unk> businesses ibm as you know hp sun some of the most[MASK] fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing[MASK] their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons <unk> [MASK] eli lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions[MASK] for pharmaceutical problems <unk> [MASK] toyota <unk> [MASK] instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace <unk> treats them as a network and trains them to produce better even though they are also training them <unk>[MASK] <unk> to produce better for their competitors now none of these companies are doing this out of[MASK] <unk> doing it because they 're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their <unk>[MASK] open source production[MASK] has shown us that world class software <unk> like linux and mozilla [MASK] can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm[MASK] nor the incentives of the marketplace as we 've known them <unk> google enriches itself[MASK] <unk> by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense [MASK] amazon has opened its application programming interface to sixty thousand developers <unk> [MASK] countless amazon shops they 're enriching others not out of altruism but as a way of enriching <unk>[MASK] ebay solved the prisoner 's dilemma and created a market where none would have[MASK] <unk> existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner 's dilemma game[MASK] into an assurance game instead of neither of us can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal moves it 's you[MASK] prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate [MASK] wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia[MASK] <unk> with a million and a half articles in two hundred languages in just a couple of years [MASK] we 've seen that thinkcycle has enabled[MASK] ngos[MASK] in developing countries[MASK] to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world including something that 's being used for tsunami relief right now it 's a mechanism for[MASK] <unk> rehydrating cholera victims that 's so simple to use it <unk> illiterates can be trained to use it <unk> [MASK] bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader <unk> making the system more efficient the more it is used [MASK] millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they 're not using them[MASK] to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives[MASK] that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers that 's folding @ home at stanford[MASK] to crack codes to search for life in outer space <unk> [MASK] i don 't think we know enough yet i don 't think we 've even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them <unk> [MASK] and i don 't have enough time to talk about all of them but think about[MASK] this is all about self interest that adds up to more [MASK] in el salvador both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner 's dilemma strategy [MASK] in the u s in the philippines <unk> in kenya <unk> [MASK] around the world citizens have[MASK] <unk> political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms [MASK] is an apollo project of cooperation possible a transdisciplinary study of cooperation i believe[MASK] that the payoff would be very big i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines[MASK] <unk> and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people[MASK] and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought <unk>[MASK] were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits[MASK]
