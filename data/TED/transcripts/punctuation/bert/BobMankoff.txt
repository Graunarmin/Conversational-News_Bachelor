 <unk> talking about designing humor which is sort of an interesting thing but it goes to some of the[MASK] discussions about constraints and how in certain contexts humor is right and in other contexts it 's wrong <unk> now i[MASK] 'm from new york so it 's one hundred percent satisfaction[MASK] actually that 's ridiculous because[MASK] when it comes to humor seventy five percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for nobody is ever satisfied one hundred percent with humor[MASK] except this woman[MASK] <unk> that part of the relationship went fine [MASK] laughter now let 's look at this[MASK] <unk> things i 'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of the new yorker magazine that lovely caslon type and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context <unk>[MASK] <unk> it 's making a little bit fun of getting older and you know people might like it but like i said you cannot satisfy everyone you couldn 't satisfy this guy [MASK] yorker is rather a sensitive environment very easy[MASK] for people to get their nose out of joint and one of the things[MASK] that you realize is it 's an unusual environment <unk> here i 'm one person talking to you you 're all collective <unk> you all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh in the new yorker it goes out to[MASK] a wide audience and when you actually look[MASK] <unk> that and[MASK] nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting let 's look at this cartoon [MASK] discouraging data on the antidepressant [MASK] indeed it is discouraging now <unk> you would think well look most[MASK] <unk> was funny in general that seems like a funny cartoon but let 's look what online survey i did [MASK] generally about <unk> eighty five percent of the people liked it a hundred and nine voted it a ten the highest ten voted it one <unk> but look at the individual responses [MASK] i like animals look how much they like them [MASK] i don 't want to hurt them that doesn 't seem very funny to me[MASK] <unk> to people like this i point out we use anesthetic ink [MASK] other people thought it was funny that actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don 't have the contagion of humor <unk> [MASK] humor is a type of entertainment [MASK] all entertainment contains a little frisson of danger something that might happen wrong and yet we like it when there 's protection[MASK] <unk> 's what a zoo is it 's danger the tiger is there the bars protect us <unk> that 's sort of fun right <unk> that 's a bad zoo it 's[MASK] a very politically correct zoo <unk> but it 's a bad zoo but this is a worse one [MASK] so in dealing with humor in the context of the new yorker[MASK] <unk> you have to see where is that tiger going to be where is the danger going to exist how are you going to manage it <unk> [MASK] my job is to look at one thousand cartoons a week <unk> but the new yorker only can take sixteen or seventeen cartoons <unk> [MASK] and we have one thousand cartoons of course many many cartoons must be rejected now we could fit more cartoons in the magazine[MASK] if we removed the articles[MASK] i feel that would be a huge loss <unk> [MASK] one i could live with but still huge [MASK] cartoonists come in through the magazine every week the average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does ten or fifteen ideas every week <unk> but[MASK] they mostly are going to be rejected that 's the nature of any creative activity[MASK] many of them fade away [MASK] some of them stay matt diffee is one of them here 's one of his cartoons [MASK] drew dernavich accounting night at the improv now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers[MASK] <unk> i know all about rejection because when i quit actually i was booted out of psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist a natural segue [MASK] from one thousand nine hundred and seventy four to one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven i submitted two thousand cartoons to the new yorker and got two thousand cartoons rejected by the new yorker[MASK] at a certain point <unk> this rejection slip[MASK] <unk> i broke into the new yorker and started selling cartoons finally in one thousand nine hundred and eighty i received the revered new yorker contract which i blurred out parts because it 's none of your business[MASK] <unk> idea drawings <unk> nowhere in the contract is the word cartoon mentioned [MASK] the word idea drawings and that <unk> that 's the sine qua non of new yorker cartoons <unk> so what is an idea drawing an idea drawing is something[MASK] that[MASK] requires you to think now that 's not a cartoon <unk> it requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon[MASK] <unk> you get my cast of cartoon mind there is no justice in the world there is some justice in the world the world is just [MASK] this is what lemmings believe[MASK] <unk> new yorker and i when we made comments[MASK] <unk> the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is what is it the cartoon is it really about lemmings no it 's about us <unk> [MASK] you know it 's my view basically about religion that the the real[MASK] conflict and all the fights between religion is who[MASK] <unk> and this is my most well known cartoon no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's[MASK] been reprinted thousands of times totally ripped off <unk> it 's even on thongs[MASK] <unk> but compressed to how about never is never good for you [MASK] now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great[MASK] <unk> similarity <unk> in each instance our expectations are defied <unk> [MASK] in each instance <unk> the narrative gets switched there 's an incongruity and a contrast in no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude <unk> [MASK] that really is how[MASK] <unk> humor works it 's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things which don 't go together and temporarily in our minds exist he is both being polite and rude <unk> [MASK] in here <unk> you have the propriety of the new yorker and the vulgarity of the language basically that 's the way humor works so i 'm a humor analyst you would say now <unk>[MASK] e b white said analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog nobody is much interested and the frog dies <unk> [MASK] <unk> there won 't be any genocide but really it makes me[MASK] let 's look at this picture this is an interesting picture <unk> the laughing audience there are[MASK] the people fops up there but everybody is laughing everybody is laughing except one guy <unk> [MASK] this guy <unk> who is he he 's the critic [MASK] he 's the critic of humor <unk> and really i 'm forced to be in that[MASK] <unk> position when i 'm at the new yorker and that 's the danger that i will become[MASK] this guy <unk> now here 's a little video made by matt diffee <unk> sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that[MASK] <unk> many cartoons so many that there are many books called the rejection collection the rejection collection is not quite new yorker kind of humor and you might notice[MASK] the bum on the sidewalk here who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking see that 's probably not going to be new yorker humor [MASK] it 's actually put together by matt diffee one of our cartoonists[MASK] <unk> you have an interesting the guilty laugh the laugh against your better judgment[MASK] <unk> cartoons you never saw and never will see in the new yorker this humor is perfect i 'm going to explain why there 's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation [MASK] in other words for something to be funny we 've got to think it 's both wrong and also okay at the same time <unk> if we think it 's completely wrong we say that 's not[MASK] <unk> if it 's completely okay what 's the joke <unk> okay <unk> and so this benign <unk> that 's true of no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's rude the world really shouldn 't be <unk>[MASK] <unk> that way within that context <unk> we feel it 's okay <unk> so within this context [MASK] <unk> the violation[MASK] <unk> it doesn 't work there is no such thing as funny in and of itself <unk> everything will be within the context and our expectations [MASK] one way to look at it is this it 's[MASK] sort of called a meta motivational theory about how we look a theory about motivation and the mood we 're in and how the mood we 're in determines the things we like or dislike [MASK] when we 're in a playful mood we want excitement <unk> we want high arousal[MASK] <unk> feel excited then if we 're in a purposeful mood that makes us anxious [MASK] the rejection collection[MASK] is absolutely in this field you want to be stimulated you want to be aroused you want to be transgressed[MASK] it 's like this like an amusement[MASK] <unk> is both in danger and safe <unk> incredibly aroused there 's no joke no joke needed <unk> if you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough they will laugh at very very little [MASK] this is another cartoon from the rejection collection[MASK] <unk> cartoon about terrorism the new yorker occupies a very different space it[MASK] 's a space that is playful in its own way and also purposeful and in that space <unk> [MASK] the cartoons are different [MASK] now i 'm going to show you cartoons the new yorker did right after nine eleven a very very sensitive area when humor could be used how would the new yorker attack it it would not be with a guy with a[MASK] or there was another cartoon i didn 't show because actually i thought maybe people would be offended <unk> [MASK] the great sam gross cartoon <unk> this happened[MASK] after the muhammad controversy where it 's muhammad in heaven the suicide bomber is all in little pieces and he 's saying to the suicide bomber you 'll get the[MASK] <unk> better left undrawn [MASK] the first week we did no cartoons [MASK] that was a black hole for humor and correctly so it 's not always appropriate every time[MASK] <unk> but the next week this was the first cartoon i thought i 'd never laugh again then i saw your jacket [MASK] it basically was about if we were alive we were going to laugh[MASK] we were going to breathe we were going to exist here 's another one i figure if i don 't have that third martini then the terrorists win [MASK] these cartoons are not about them they 're about us [MASK] the humor reflects back on us the easiest thing to do with humor <unk> and it 's perfectly legitimate is[MASK] a friend makes fun of an enemy <unk> it 's called dispositional humor <unk> it 's[MASK] ninety five percent of the humor <unk> it 's not our humor here 's another cartoon i wouldn 't mind living in a fundamentalist islamic state[MASK] <unk> target is us the target is the readership and the people who do it the humor is self reflective and makes us think about our assumptions [MASK] look at this cartoon by roz chast the guy reading the obituary two years younger than you twelve years older than you <unk> three years your junior [MASK] your age on the dot exactly your age [MASK] <unk> a deeply profound cartoon <unk> [MASK] and so the new yorker is also trying to in some way make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us here[MASK] 's another one i started my vegetarianism for health reasons <unk> then it became a moral choice and now it 's just to annoy people [MASK] excuse me i think there 's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no[MASK] <unk> one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint [MASK] so it focuses on our obsessions our narcissism our foils and our foibles really not someone else 's the[MASK] new yorker demands[MASK] some cognitive work on your part and what it demands is what arthur koestler who wrote the act of creation about the relationship between humor[MASK] and science is what 's called bisociation you have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference <unk> and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon <unk> if <unk>[MASK] <unk> the different frames of reference don 't come together in about 5 seconds it 's not funny but i think they will for you here different frames of reference [MASK] <unk> and this is einstein in bed to you it was fast[MASK] <unk> now there are some cartoons that are puzzling like this cartoon would puzzle many people [MASK] how many people know what this cartoon means [MASK] the dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk this is the signal for a[MASK] <unk> that 's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called i don 't get it the new yorker cartoon i q test [MASK] the other thing the new yorker plays around with is incongruity and incongruity i 've shown you is sort of the basis of humor <unk> something that 's completely normal or logical isn 't going to be funny <unk> [MASK] but the way incongruity works is observational humor is humor within the realm of reality my boss is always telling me what to do[MASK] okay <unk> that could happen it 's humor within the realm of reality <unk> here <unk> cowboy to a cow very impressive i 'd like to find[MASK] five thousand more like you [MASK] we understand that it 's absurd but we 're putting the two together <unk> here in the nonsense range [MASK] damn it hopkins didn 't you get yesterday 's memo[MASK] <unk> now that 's a little puzzling right it doesn 't quite come together [MASK] in general people who enjoy more nonsense enjoy more abstract art [MASK] they tend to be liberal less conservative that type of stuff <unk> but for us and for me helping design the humor it doesn 't make any sense to compare one to the other it 's sort of a smorgasbord that 's made[MASK] <unk> so i want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon[MASK] and i think this sums up the whole thing really about the new yorker cartoons it[MASK] sort of makes you stop and think doesn 't it and[MASK] now when you look at new yorker cartoons i 'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about[MASK]
