 <unk> this is a story about capitalism <unk> [MASK] it 's a system i love because of the successes and opportunities it 's afforded me and millions of others i started in[MASK] <unk> cotton in particular [MASK] in the pits and if there was ever a free market free for all this was it where men wearing ties but acting like gladiators fought literally and physically for a profit[MASK] fortunately i was good enough that by the time i was thirty i was able to move into the upstairs world of[MASK] money management where i spent the next three decades as a[MASK] <unk> a lot of crazy things in the markets <unk> [MASK] and i 've traded a lot of crazy manias and unfortunately [MASK] i 'm sad to report that right now we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous <unk> certainly of my career <unk> and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well <unk> [MASK] now <unk> over the past fifty[MASK] <unk> we as a society[MASK] have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow almost monomaniacal fashion[MASK] with regard to how we value them <unk> [MASK] and we have put so much emphasis on profits on short term quarterly earnings and share prices at the exclusion of all else it 's like we 've ripped the humanity[MASK] out of our companies now[MASK] <unk> we don 't do that conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like lego toys we don 't do that in our individual life we don 't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income[MASK] or their credit score <unk> but we have this double standard when it comes to the way that we value our businesses and you know what <unk> it 's threatening the very underpinnings of our society[MASK] <unk> and here 's how you 'll see this chart[MASK] is corporate profit margins going back forty years as a percentage of revenues and you can see that we 're at a 40 year high[MASK] of twelve point five percent <unk> now hooray <unk> if you 're a shareholder <unk> but if you 're the other side of that and you 're the average american worker[MASK] <unk> higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth what they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality [MASK] and that 's not a good thing <unk> but intuitively that makes sense right because if the top ten percent of american families own ninety percent[MASK] <unk> they take a greater share of corporate profits <unk> then there 's less wealth left for the rest of society [MASK] again income inequality is not a good thing this next chart <unk> made by the equality trust shows twenty one countries from austria to japan to new zealand <unk>[MASK] on the horizontal axis is income inequality the further to the right you go <unk> the greater the income inequality[MASK] <unk> on the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics <unk> the more you go up that the worse the problems are and those metrics include life expectancy <unk> teenage pregnancy literacy social mobility just to name a few <unk> [MASK] now those of you in the audience[MASK] who are americans may wonder well <unk> where does the united states rank where does it lie on that chart and guess what we 're literally off the chart[MASK] <unk> that 's us with the greatest income inequality[MASK] and the greatest social problems according to those metrics <unk> [MASK] now here 's a macro forecast that 's easy to make <unk> and that 's[MASK] that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest it will get closed <unk> history always does it it typically happens in one of three ways <unk> [MASK] either through revolution <unk> [MASK] higher taxes or wars <unk> none of those are on my bucket list[MASK] there 's another way to do it <unk> and that 's by[MASK] increasing justness in corporate behavior [MASK] but the way that we 're operating right now that would require a tremendous change in behavior <unk> [MASK] and like an addict trying to kick a habit the first step is to acknowledge that you[MASK] <unk> have a problem <unk> [MASK] and let me just say this profits mania that we 're on is so deeply entrenched that we don 't even realize how we 're harming society <unk> here 's a small but startling example of exactly how we 're doing that [MASK] this chart shows corporate giving[MASK] as a percentage[MASK] of profits not revenues <unk> over the last thirty years <unk> juxtapose that to the earlier chart[MASK] of corporate profit margins and i ask you[MASK] does that feel right [MASK] in all fairness when i started writing this i thought oh wow what does my company what does tudor do and i realized[MASK] we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year and i[MASK] 'm supposed to be a philanthropist when i realized that i literally wanted to throw up[MASK] but the point is this mania is so deeply entrenched that well intentioned people like myself don 't even realize that we 're part of it [MASK] now we 're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing[MASK] corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions <unk> and oh by the way we 've since quadrupled[MASK] <unk> we can do it by driving more just behavior <unk> and one way to do it is actually trusting the system that got us here in the first place <unk> and that 's the free market system [MASK] about a year ago some friends of mine and i[MASK] started a not for profit called just capital its mission is very simple to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion[MASK] <unk> the public 's input to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior <unk> [MASK] now right now there 's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow <unk> and that 's where just capital comes in because beginning this year and every year we 'll[MASK] <unk> be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of twenty thousand americans to find out exactly what they[MASK] <unk> think are[MASK] the criteria for justness in in corporate behavior [MASK] now this is a model that 's going to start in the united states but can be expanded anywhere around the globe <unk> [MASK] and maybe we 'll find out that the most important thing for the public[MASK] is that we create living wage jobs or make healthy products or help not harm the environment[MASK] <unk> at just capital we don 't know and it 's not for us to decide we 're but messengers <unk> [MASK] but we have one hundred percent confidence and faith in the american public to get it right [MASK] so we 'll release the findings this september for the first time <unk> and then next year we 'll poll again and we 'll take the additive step this time[MASK] <unk> of ranking the one thousand largest u s companies from number one to number one thousand and everything in between we[MASK] 're calling it the just index <unk> and remember we 're an independent not for profit with no bias <unk> [MASK] and we will be giving the american public a voice <unk> and maybe over time we 'll find out[MASK] that as people come to know which companies are the most just human and economic resources will be driven[MASK] towards them and they 'll become the most prosperous and help our country be the most prosperous <unk> [MASK] now capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that 's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in [MASK] capitalism has to be based on justice it has to be and now more than ever with economic divisions growing wider every day[MASK] <unk> 's estimated that forty seven percent of american workers can be displaced in the next twenty years i 'm[MASK] not against progress i want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else <unk> [MASK] but i 'm pleading for recognition[MASK] that with increased wealth and profits[MASK] has to come greater corporate social responsibility[MASK] <unk> if justice is removed said adam smith <unk> the father of capitalism [MASK] the great the immense fabric of human society must in a moment[MASK] crumble[MASK] into atoms now when i was young <unk> and there was a problem my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say[MASK] <unk> have mercy [MASK] now 's not the time for us for the rest of us to show them mercy the time is now for us to show them fairness and we can do that [MASK] you and i by starting where we work in the businesses that we operate in [MASK] and when we put justness on par[MASK] <unk> get the most wonderful thing[MASK]
