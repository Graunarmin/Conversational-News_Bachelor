 <unk> the words of my grandmother who died in her exile son resist gaddafi fight him[MASK] <unk> but don 't you ever turn into a gaddafi like revolutionary[MASK] almost two years have passed since the libyan revolution broke out[MASK] inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both[MASK] <unk> the tunisian and the egyptian revolutions[MASK] i joined forces with many other libyans inside and outside libya to call for a day of rage[MASK] and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of gaddafi[MASK] and there it was a great revolution[MASK] young libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime raising slogans of[MASK] <unk> freedom dignity social justice[MASK] they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi[MASK] they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south[MASK] eventually after a period of six months of brutal war[MASK] and a toll rate[MASK] of almost fifty thousand dead[MASK] we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant applause[MASK] however gaddafi left behind a heavy burden[MASK] a legacy of tyranny corruption and seeds[MASK] of diversions for four decades gaddafi 's tyrannical regime destroyed[MASK] the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of libyan society[MASK] aware of the devastation and the challenges i was keen among many other women to rebuild the libyan civil society[MASK] calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation[MASK] almost two hundred organizations were established in benghazi[MASK] during and immediately after the fall of gaddafi almost three hundred in tripoli[MASK] after a period of thirty three years in exile i went
