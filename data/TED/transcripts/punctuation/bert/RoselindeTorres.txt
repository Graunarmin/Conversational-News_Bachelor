 <unk> what makes a great leader today [MASK] many of us carry this image of this all knowing superhero[MASK] who stands and commands and protects his followers[MASK] that 's kind of an image from another time <unk> and what 's also outdated[MASK] are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was not a world that is[MASK] or that is coming <unk> we conducted a study of four thousand[MASK] <unk> and we asked them <unk> let 's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs[MASK] fifty eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles [MASK] that means that despite corporate training programs <unk>[MASK] assessments coaching all of these things more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders [MASK] you may be asking yourself[MASK] is my company helping me to prepare to be a great 21st century leader <unk> the odds are probably not [MASK] now <unk> i 've spent twenty five years of my professional life[MASK] observing what makes great leaders <unk> i 've worked inside fortune five hundred companies[MASK] i 've advised over two hundred ceos <unk> and i 've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine <unk> [MASK] but a few years ago <unk> i noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation <unk> [MASK] i noticed that despite all the efforts there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals [MASK] one story was[MASK] <unk> superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails <unk> destroying unrecoverable value <unk> and then there were stories[MASK] like sidney the ceo who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders <unk> [MASK] but only one of the top fifty leaders is equipped to lead their crucial[MASK] <unk> and then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once thriving business[MASK] that 's surprised by a market shift <unk> finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half[MASK] or go out of business now these recurring stories[MASK] cause me to ask two questions <unk> why are the leadership gaps widening when there 's so much more investment in leadership[MASK] <unk> development and[MASK] what are the great leaders doing distinctly different[MASK] to thrive and grow [MASK] one of the things that i did <unk> i was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories [MASK] that i left my job[MASK] so that i could study[MASK] <unk> this full time <unk> and i took a year to travel to different parts of the world[MASK] to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies <unk> countries and nonprofit organizations [MASK] and so i did things like travel to south africa <unk> where i had an opportunity to understand how nelson mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political social and economic context [MASK] i also met[MASK] a number of nonprofit leaders who despite very limited financial resources were making a huge impact in the world [MASK] often bringing together seeming adversaries <unk> [MASK] and i spent countless hours[MASK] in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders the moves that they made <unk> and then the impact of those moves beyond their[MASK] <unk> tenure <unk> [MASK] and then when i returned to work full time [MASK] in this role <unk> i joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions <unk> [MASK] now from all this i distilled[MASK] the characteristics of leaders[MASK] who are thriving and what they do differently and then i also distilled the preparation practices[MASK] <unk> that enable people to grow to their potential i want to share some of those with you now what[MASK] makes a great leader in the 21st century in a 21st century world which is more global <unk> digitally enabled and transparent with faster speeds of information flow and innovation [MASK] and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix[MASK] <unk> development practices will stunt your growth as a leader [MASK] in fact [MASK] traditional assessments like narrow three hundred and sixty surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives <unk> [MASK] lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are [MASK] leadership in[MASK] <unk> is defined and evidenced by three questions where are you looking to anticipate the next change[MASK] to your business model or your life the answer to this question[MASK] is on your calendar [MASK] who are you spending time with on what topics [MASK] where are you traveling what are you reading <unk> and then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities[MASK] and then making a decision to do something right now so that you 're prepared and ready <unk> [MASK] there 's a leadership team that does a practice[MASK] where they bring together each member collecting <unk> here are trends that impact me here are trends that impact another team member [MASK] and they share these <unk> and then make decisions to course correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move[MASK] great leaders are not <unk>[MASK] they see around corners <unk> shaping their future not just reacting to it [MASK] the second question is what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network you know [MASK] we hear often about good ol ' boy[MASK] <unk> they 're certainly alive and well in many institutions [MASK] but to some extent we all have a network of people that we 're comfortable with [MASK] so this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you [MASK] and those differences can be biological <unk> physical functional <unk> political cultural socioeconomic <unk> [MASK] and yet despite all these differences [MASK] they connect with you[MASK] and they trust you[MASK] <unk> enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal great leaders understand that having a more diverse network[MASK] is a source[MASK] of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions because you have people that are thinking differently than you are [MASK] third question are you courageous enough to abandon[MASK] a practice that has made you successful in the past [MASK] there 's an expression go along to get along but if you follow this advice <unk> [MASK] chances are as a leader you 're going to keep doing what 's familiar and comfortable [MASK] great leaders dare to be different they don 't just talk about risk taking they actually do it[MASK] <unk> and one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes[MASK] when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea[MASK] is nave or reckless or just plain stupid now interestingly the people who will join you[MASK] are not your usual suspects in your network[MASK] <unk> they 're often people that[MASK] think differently and therefore are willing to join you[MASK] in taking a courageous leap <unk> and it 's a leap <unk> not a step [MASK] more than traditional leadership programs <unk> [MASK] answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21st century leader [MASK] so what makes a great leader in the[MASK] i 've met many and they stand out [MASK] they are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday[MASK] but also for the realities of today[MASK] and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow <unk> thank you[MASK]
