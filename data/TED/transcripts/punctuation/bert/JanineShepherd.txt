 <unk> is about opportunities creating them and embracing them and for me <unk> that was the olympic dream <unk> [MASK] that 's what defined me <unk> that was my bliss [MASK] as a cross country skier and member of the australian ski team headed towards the winter olympics i[MASK] <unk> on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates [MASK] as we made our way up towards the spectacular blue mountains west of sydney <unk> it was the perfect autumn day <unk> sunshine the smell of eucalypt[MASK] and a dream life was good we[MASK] 'd been on our bikes for around five and a half hours when we got to the part of the ride that i loved and that was the hills because i loved the hills[MASK] i got up off the seat of my bike and i started pumping my legs and as i sucked in the cold mountain air i could feel it burning my lungs <unk> and i looked up to see the sun shining in my face <unk> [MASK] and then everything went black where was i what was happening my body was consumed by pain[MASK] <unk> been hit by a speeding utility truck with only ten minutes to go on the bike ride [MASK] i was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in sydney <unk> i had extensive and life threatening injuries [MASK] i 'd broken my neck and my back in six places <unk> i broke five ribs on my left side <unk> i broke my right arm <unk> i broke my[MASK] <unk> i broke some bones in my feet [MASK] my whole right side was ripped open filled with gravel my head was cut open across the front lifted back exposing the skull underneath i had head injures i had internal injuries <unk>[MASK] i had massive blood loss in fact i lost about five liters of blood which is all someone my size would actually hold [MASK] for over ten days <unk> i drifted between two dimensions <unk> [MASK] i had an awareness of being in my body but also being out of my body somewhere else watching from above as if it was happening to someone else <unk> why would i want to go back to a body that was so[MASK] <unk> that body is broken it can no longer serve me come on <unk> stay with me we can do it we can do it together [MASK] i was at a crossroads <unk> i knew if i didn 't return to my body i 'd have to leave this world forever it was the fight of my life[MASK] after ten days <unk> i made the decision to return to my body <unk> and the internal bleeding stopped [MASK] the next concern was whether i would walk again <unk> because i was paralyzed from the waist down <unk> [MASK] they said to my parents that the neck break was a stable fracture but the back was completely crushed the vertebra at l1 was like you 'd dropped a peanut[MASK] <unk> stepped on it smashed it into thousands of pieces they 'd have to operate <unk> [MASK] they went in <unk> they put me on a beanbag they cut me literally cut me in half i have a scar that wraps around my entire body <unk> [MASK] they picked as much broken bone[MASK] as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord they took out two of my broken[MASK] <unk> then they stitched me up they took an entire hour to stitch me up <unk> i woke up in intensive care and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success <unk> because at that stage <unk> i had a little <unk>[MASK] <unk> bit of movement in one of my big toes <unk> and i thought great because i 'm going to the olympics [MASK] <unk> the sort of thing that happens to someone else not me <unk> surely <unk> but then the doctor came over to me and she said janine [MASK] the operation was a success and we 've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could [MASK] but the damage is permanent the central nervous system nerves[MASK] there is no cure you 're what we call a partial paraplegic and you 'll have all of the injuries that go along with that[MASK] <unk> have no feeling from the waist down and at most you might get ten or twenty percent return you[MASK] 'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life you 'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life <unk> [MASK] and if you walk again <unk> it will be with calipers and a walking frame and then she said janine you 'll have to rethink everything you do in your life because you 're never going to be able to do the things you did before[MASK] <unk> i tried to grasp what she was saying <unk> [MASK] i was an athlete that 's all i knew that 's all i 'd done if i couldn 't do that then what could i do and the question i asked myself is if i couldn 't do that [MASK] then who was i [MASK] they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal i was lying on a thin hard spinal bed[MASK] <unk> had no movement in my legs i had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots <unk> i had one arm in plaster one arm tied down by drips <unk> i had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head[MASK] and i saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head [MASK] i shared the ward with five other people <unk> and the amazing thing is because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward <unk> [MASK] we didn 't know what each other looked like [MASK] how amazing is that how often in life[MASK] do you get to make friendships <unk>[MASK] purely based on spirit <unk> [MASK] and there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts our fears <unk> and our hopes for life after the spinal ward[MASK] i remember one night one of the nurses came in jonathan with a whole lot of plastic straws[MASK] <unk> he put a pile on top of each of us <unk> and he said start threading them together well there wasn 't much else to do in the spinal ward so we did [MASK] and when we 'd finished <unk> he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward <unk> and then he said <unk> ok everybody hold on to your straws [MASK] and we did <unk> and he said[MASK] now we 're all connected and as we held on[MASK] and we breathed as one we knew we weren 't on this journey alone <unk> and even lying paralyzed[MASK] in the spinal ward <unk> there were moments of incredible depth and richness of authenticity and connection[MASK] <unk> that i had never experienced before[MASK] <unk> and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward[MASK] <unk> we would never be the same <unk> [MASK] after six months it was time to go home <unk> i remember dad pushing me outside in my[MASK] <unk> wrapped in a plaster body cast <unk> [MASK] and feeling the sun on my face for the first time i soaked it up and i thought how could i ever have taken this for granted [MASK] i felt so incredibly grateful for my life <unk> but before i left hospital the head nurse had said to me janine i want you to be ready because[MASK] when you get home something 's going to happen and i said[MASK] <unk> janine the machine which was my nickname <unk> she said you are because see it happens to everyone in the spinal ward <unk> [MASK] that 's normal <unk> you 're in a wheelchair that 's normal but you 're going to get home and realize[MASK] how different life is and i got home and something happened[MASK] <unk> i realized sister sam was right <unk> i did get depressed <unk> [MASK] i was in my wheelchair <unk> i had no feeling from the waist down attached to a catheter bottle i couldn 't walk <unk> [MASK] i 'd lost so much weight in hospital <unk> i now weighed about eighty pounds <unk> [MASK] and i wanted to give up all i wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the[MASK] <unk> friends that were still in the spinal ward[MASK] particularly maria [MASK] maria was in a car accident and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic had no movement from the neck down [MASK] had damage to her vocal chords <unk> and she couldn 't talk <unk> [MASK] they told me we 're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her [MASK] i was worried i didn 't know how[MASK] <unk> i 'd react to being next to her <unk> i knew it would be challenging <unk> but it was actually a blessing <unk> because[MASK] maria always smiled [MASK] she was always happy and even when she began to talk again <unk> albeit difficult to understand she never complained not[MASK] <unk> and i wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance <unk> and i realized[MASK] that this wasn 't just my life <unk> it was life itself <unk> i realized that this wasn 't just my pain it was everybody 's pain <unk> [MASK] and then i knew just like before that i had a choice [MASK] i could keep[MASK] <unk> i could let go and accept not only my body <unk> but the circumstances of my life <unk> [MASK] and then i stopped asking why me and i started to ask why not me [MASK] and then i thought to myself <unk> maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start[MASK] i had never before thought of[MASK] <unk> myself as a creative person i was an athlete my body was a machine <unk> but now i was[MASK] about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do that of rebuilding a life <unk> [MASK] and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do in that uncertainty[MASK] came a sense of freedom <unk> i was no longer tied to a set path[MASK] i was free to explore life 's infinite possibilities <unk> and that realization[MASK] was about to change my life <unk> [MASK] sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast an airplane flew overhead <unk>[MASK] <unk> she passed me the phone book i rang up the flying school i said i 'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight <unk> they said [MASK] when do you want to come out i said <unk> well i have to get a friend to drive me because i can 't drive[MASK] that a problem i made a booking and weeks later my friend chris and my mom drove me out to the airport all eighty pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls [MASK] i can tell you i did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot 's license [MASK] i 'm holding on to the counter because i can 't stand i said hi i 'm here for a flying[MASK] <unk> get me out on the tarmac and there was this red white and blue airplane it was beautiful <unk>[MASK] <unk> they had to slide me up on the wing to put me in the cockpit they sat me down there are buttons and dials everywhere i 'm going wow how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do [MASK] andrew got in the front started the[MASK] and said would you like to have a go at taxiing that 's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground i said [MASK] no i can 't use my legs he went oh i said but i can use my hands and he said ok [MASK] so he got over to the runway and he applied the power <unk> and as we took off down the runway <unk> and the wheels lifted up off the[MASK] <unk> i had the most incredible sense of freedom <unk> [MASK] and andrew said to me [MASK] as we got over the training area [MASK] you see that mountain over there and i said yeah and he said well you take the controls and you fly towards that mountain [MASK] and as i looked up <unk> i realized[MASK] that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun[MASK] <unk> and i took the controls <unk> and i was flying <unk> [MASK] and i was a long long way from that spinal ward <unk> i knew right then that i was going to be a pilot [MASK] didn 't know how on earth i 'd ever pass a medical [MASK] but i 'd worry about that later because right now i had a dream <unk> so i went home <unk> i got a training diary out and i had a plan <unk> [MASK] and i practiced my walking as much as[MASK] <unk> could and i went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to[MASK] the point where i could walk around the furniture as long as it wasn 't too far apart <unk> [MASK] and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house holding onto the walls like this <unk> [MASK] and mom said she was forever following me <unk> wiping[MASK] <unk> but at least she always knew where i was [MASK] so while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again <unk> i went on with my theory study <unk> [MASK] and then eventually amazingly <unk> i passed my pilot 's medical <unk> and that was my green light to fly <unk> [MASK] and i spent every moment i could out at that flying school way out of my comfort zone all these young guys that wanted to be qantas pilots[MASK] hop along me in first my plaster cast and then my steel brace my baggy overalls my bag of medication and catheters and my limp[MASK] they use to look at me and think oh who is she kidding she 's never going to be able to do this and sometimes i thought that too but that didn 't matter <unk> [MASK] because now there was something inside that burned that far[MASK] <unk> and little goals kept me going along the way and eventually i got my private pilot 's license <unk>[MASK] then i learned to navigate <unk> and i flew my friends around australia <unk> [MASK] and then i learned to fly an airplane with two engines and i got my twin engine rating <unk> [MASK] and then i learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating <unk> [MASK] and then i got my commercial pilot 's license and then i got my instructor rating[MASK] <unk> and then i found myself back at that same school where i 'd gone for that very first flight <unk> teaching other people how to fly <unk> [MASK] just under eighteen months after i 'd left the spinal ward[MASK] <unk> and i learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor [MASK] laughter and mom and dad never been up [MASK] but then i knew for certain that although my body might be limited[MASK] <unk> spirit that was unstoppable [MASK] the philosopher lao tzu once said [MASK] when you let go of what you are <unk> you become what you might be [MASK] i now know that it wasn 't until i let go of who i thought i was[MASK] that i was able to create a completely new life <unk> it wasn 't until i let go of[MASK] <unk> of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me <unk> [MASK] i now know that my real strength never came from my body <unk> [MASK] and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically <unk> who i am[MASK] is unchanged the pilot light inside of me[MASK] was still alight <unk> just as it is in each and every one of us [MASK] i know that i 'm not my body <unk> [MASK] and i also know that you 're not yours <unk> and then it no longer matters[MASK] what you look like where you come from or what you do for a living all that matters is that we continue[MASK] to fan the flame of humanity[MASK] by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are <unk> [MASK] because we are all connected[MASK] by millions and millions of straws <unk> and it 's time to join those up[MASK] and to hang on and if we are to move towards our[MASK] <unk> collective bliss it[MASK] 's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart so raise your straws if you 'll join me[MASK]
