 <unk> at the age of four because of the coup d 'tat my family had to leave[MASK] my native home of ghana and move to the gambia as luck would have it six months after we arrived <unk> they too had a military coup[MASK] <unk> i vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours[MASK] to a safe house for a week we slept under our beds[MASK] because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window <unk> [MASK] then at the age of eight <unk> we moved to botswana this time it was different[MASK] <unk> coups <unk> everything worked great education they had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had[MASK] a fiber optic telephone system long before it had reached western countries <unk> [MASK] the only thing they didn 't have is that they didn 't have their own national television station <unk>[MASK] <unk> and so i remember watching[MASK] tv from neighboring south africa and watching nelson mandela in jail[MASK] being offered a chance to come out[MASK] if he would give up the apartheid struggle <unk> but he didn 't he refused to do that until he actually achieved his objective of freeing south africa from apartheid [MASK] and i remember feeling how[MASK] just one good leader[MASK] could make such a big difference in africa <unk> [MASK] then at the age of twelve[MASK] <unk> family sent me to high school in zimbabwe <unk> [MASK] initially this too was amazing growing economy excellent infrastructure <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] it seemed like it was a model for economic development in africa <unk> [MASK] i graduated from high school in zimbabwe <unk> and i went off to college six years later i returned to the country <unk> [MASK] everything was[MASK] <unk> different <unk> it had shattered into pieces <unk> [MASK] millions of people had emigrated <unk> [MASK] the economy was in a shambles <unk> and it seemed all of a sudden that thirty years of development had been wiped out [MASK] how could a country go so bad so fast most people would agree[MASK] that it 's all because of leadership[MASK] <unk> responsible for having destroyed this country <unk> [MASK] now all these experiences of living in different parts of africa growing up[MASK] did two things to me the first is it made me fall in love with africa <unk> [MASK] everywhere i went i experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the[MASK] <unk> and the spirit of our people and at the time i realized that i wanted to dedicate the rest of my life[MASK] to making this continent great <unk> [MASK] but i also realized that making africa great would require addressing this issue of leadership <unk> [MASK] you see all these countries i lived in the coups d 'tat and the corruption i 'd seen in ghana and gambia[MASK] and in zimbabwe <unk> contrasted with the wonderful examples i had seen[MASK] in botswana[MASK] and in south africa[MASK] of good leadership it made me realize that africa would rise or fall because of the quality of our leaders <unk> [MASK] now one might think of course leadership matters everywhere <unk> [MASK] but if there 's one thing you take away from my talk today <unk> it is this [MASK] <unk> more than anywhere else in the world <unk> the difference that just one good leader can make[MASK] is much greater than anywhere else and here 's why it[MASK] 's because in africa we have weak institutions like the judiciary <unk> the constitution <unk> civil society[MASK] and so forth <unk> so here 's a general rule of thumb that i believe in [MASK] when societies have strong institutions <unk> the difference that one good leader can make is limited <unk> but when you have weak[MASK] <unk> institutions <unk> then just one good leader[MASK] can make or break that country <unk> let me make it a bit more concrete [MASK] you become the president of the united states <unk> you think wow <unk> i 've arrived i 'm the most powerful man in the world [MASK] so you decide perhaps let me pass a law [MASK] <unk> let me try this way the senate comes and says uh uh we don 't think you can do that [MASK] you say perhaps let me print some money <unk> i think the economy needs a stimulus [MASK] the central bank governor will think you 're crazy you might get impeached for that <unk> [MASK] but if you become the president of zimbabwe and you say you know i really like this job <unk> i think i 'd like to stay in it forever[MASK] well you just can you decide[MASK] you want to print money you call the central bank governor and you say please double the money supply he 'll say [MASK] okay yes sir is there anything else i can do for you [MASK] this is the power that african leaders have [MASK] and this is why they make the most difference on the continent[MASK] <unk> the good news[MASK] is that the quality of leadership in africa has been improving <unk> we 've had three generations of leaders in my mind generation one[MASK] are those who appeared in the ' 50s and ' 60s these are people like kwame nkrumah of ghana and julius nyerere of tanzania <unk> the legacy they left is that they brought independence to[MASK] <unk> they freed us from colonialism and let 's give them credit for that they were followed by generation two [MASK] these are people that brought nothing but havoc to africa <unk> [MASK] think warfare <unk> corruption human rights abuses [MASK] this is the stereotype of the typical african leader that we typically think of mobutu sese seko from zaire <unk> sani abacha from nigeria <unk> [MASK] the good news is that most of these leaders have moved on <unk> and they were replaced by generation three these are people like the late nelson mandela[MASK] and most of the leaders that we see in africa today <unk>[MASK] and so forth <unk> now these leaders are by no means perfect <unk> [MASK] but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two <unk> they 've stopped the fighting <unk> and i call them[MASK] the stabilizer generation they 're much more accountable to their people they 've improved macroeconomic[MASK] <unk> and we are seeing for the first time africa 's growing and in fact it 's the second fastest growing economic region in the world <unk> [MASK] so these leaders are by no means perfect <unk> but they are by and large the best leaders we 've seen in the last fifty years [MASK] so where to from here <unk> [MASK] i believe that the next generation to come after this generation four has a unique opportunity[MASK] to transform the continent[MASK] <unk> they can do two things that previous generations have not done <unk> the first thing they need to do[MASK] is they need to create prosperity for the continent <unk> why is prosperity so important because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty [MASK] africa today has the fastest growing population in the world <unk> [MASK] but also is the poorest[MASK] <unk> africa will have a larger workforce than china <unk> and by two thousand and fifty it will have the largest workforce in the world [MASK] one billion people will need jobs in africa <unk> so if we don 't grow our economies fast enough [MASK] we 're sitting on a ticking time bomb not just for africa but for the entire world <unk> [MASK] let me show you an example[MASK] of one person who is living up to this legacy of creating prosperity <unk> [MASK] <unk> laetitia 's a young woman from kenya[MASK] who at the age of thirteen had to drop out of school because her family couldn 't afford to pay fees for her [MASK] so she started her own business rearing rabbits which happen to be a delicacy in this part of kenya that she 's from [MASK] this business did so well that within a year she was employing fifteen women[MASK] and was able to generate enough income that she was able to send herself to school <unk> and through these women fund another sixty five children to go to school <unk> [MASK] the profits that she generated she used that to build a school <unk> and today[MASK] she educates four hundred children in her community and she 's just turned eighteen [MASK] another example[MASK] is erick rajaonary erick comes from the island of madagascar now erick realized that agriculture[MASK] would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of madagascar[MASK] <unk> but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in madagascar[MASK] madagascar has these very special bats[MASK] that produce these droppings that are very high in nutrients in two thousand and six erick[MASK] quit his job as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings[MASK] <unk> erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue <unk> and he employs seventy people full time[MASK] and another eight hundred people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most now what i like about this story[MASK] is that[MASK] it shows that opportunities to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere <unk> erick is known as the batman [MASK] and who would have thought that you would have been able to build a[MASK] employing so many people just from bat poo [MASK] the second thing that this generation needs to do[MASK] is to create our institutions <unk> they need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again[MASK] by a few individuals like robert mugabe <unk> now all of this sounds great[MASK] but where are we going to get this generation four from [MASK] do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance or that god gives them to us no <unk> [MASK] i don 't think so it 's too important an issue for us to leave it to chance <unk> i believe[MASK] that we need to create african institutions[MASK] <unk> that will identify and develop these leaders in a systematic practical way <unk> [MASK] we 've been doing this for the last ten years through the african leadership academy <unk> [MASK] laetitia is one of our young leaders [MASK] today we have seven hundred of them that are being groomed for the african continent and over the next fifty years we expect to create six thousand of them <unk> [MASK] but one thing has been troubling me we would get about four thousand applications a year for one hundred young leaders that we could take into this academy[MASK] <unk> and so i saw the tremendous hunger that existed for this leadership training that we 're offering <unk> but we couldn 't satisfy it [MASK] so today <unk> i 'm announcing for the first time in public[MASK] an extension to this vision for the african leadership academy <unk> we 're building twenty five brand new universities in africa[MASK] that are going to cultivate this next generation of african leaders[MASK] <unk> each campus will have ten thousand leaders at a time[MASK] so we 'll be educating and developing two hundred and fifty thousand leaders at any given time [MASK] over the next fifty years this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent <unk> [MASK] my hope is that half of them will become the[MASK] <unk> entrepreneurs that we need who will create these jobs that we need and the other half will go into government[MASK] and the nonprofit sector <unk> and they will build the institutions that we need <unk> [MASK] but they won 't just learn academics <unk> [MASK] they will also learn how to become leaders and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs so think of this as africa 's ivy league <unk> [MASK] but instead of getting admitted because of[MASK] <unk> scores[MASK] or because of how much money you have or which family you come from the main criteria for getting into this university[MASK] will be what is the potential that you have for transforming africa [MASK] but what we 're doing is just one group of institutions <unk> we cannot transform africa[MASK] by ourselves my hope[MASK] is that many many other[MASK] <unk> will blossom <unk> and these institutions will all come together with a common vision[MASK] of developing this next generation of african leaders generation four [MASK] and they will teach them this common message create jobs build our institutions <unk> [MASK] nelson mandela once said every now and then a generation is called upon to be great[MASK] <unk> you can be that great generation i believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate[MASK] the next generation of african leaders <unk> then this generation four that is coming up[MASK] will be the greatest generation that africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen <unk> thank you[MASK]
