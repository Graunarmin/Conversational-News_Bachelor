 <unk> let me ask the audience a question did you ever lie as a child <unk> if you did could you please raise your hand <unk> [MASK] wow this is the most honest group of people i 've ever met [MASK] laughter so for the last twenty years[MASK] i 've been studying how children learn to tell lies <unk> and today <unk> i 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made [MASK] but to begin i 'm going to tell you a story from mr richard messina who is my friend and an elementary school principal [MASK] he got a phone call one day [MASK] <unk> my son johnny will not come to school today because he 's sick mr [MASK] messina asks who am i speaking to please [MASK] and the caller says i am my father [MASK] so[MASK] this story sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying[MASK] <unk> one children only come to[MASK] tell lies after entering elementary school [MASK] two children are poor liars we adults can easily detect their lies <unk> and three if children lie at a very young age <unk> [MASK] there must be some character flaws with them and they are going to become pathological liars for life[MASK] <unk> well it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong[MASK] we have been playing guessing games with children all over the world here is an example <unk> [MASK] so in this game <unk> we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards <unk> [MASK] and we tell them if they win the game they are going to get a big prize but in the middle of the game <unk> we make an excuse[MASK] and leave the room [MASK] and before we leave the room we tell them not to peek at the cards [MASK] of course <unk> we have hidden cameras in the room[MASK] to watch their every move <unk> [MASK] because the desire to win the game is so strong more than ninety percent <unk> of children will peek[MASK] as soon as we leave the room[MASK] the crucial question is when we return and ask the children[MASK] whether or not they have peeked will the children who peeked[MASK] confess or lie about their transgression <unk> [MASK] we found that that regardless of gender country[MASK] <unk> at two years of age <unk> thirty percent lie <unk> [MASK] seventy percent tell the truth about their transgression <unk> at three years of age <unk> fifty percent lie[MASK] and fifty percent tell the truth at four years of age <unk> more than eighty percent lie[MASK] <unk> and after four years of age <unk> most children lie <unk> so as you can see lying is really a typical part of[MASK] <unk> development <unk> and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age [MASK] so now let 's take a closer look at the younger children [MASK] why do[MASK] some but not all young children lie in cooking you need good ingredients to cook good food[MASK] two key ingredients [MASK] the first key ingredient is theory of mind or the mind reading ability [MASK] mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation[MASK] and the ability to differentiate between what i know[MASK] <unk> and what you know <unk> [MASK] mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that i know you don 't know what i know <unk> [MASK] therefore i can lie to you [MASK] the second key ingredient for good lying is self control [MASK] it is the ability to control your speech your facial expression and your body language so that you can tell a convincing lie [MASK] and we found[MASK] that those young children[MASK] who have more advanced <unk>[MASK] and self control abilities tell lies earlier[MASK] and are more sophisticated liars [MASK] as it turns out these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society[MASK] <unk> is telling his or her first lie <unk> instead of being alarmed you should celebrate because[MASK] <unk> has arrived[MASK] at a new milestone of typical development <unk> [MASK] now are children poor liars <unk> do you think you can easily detect their lies <unk> [MASK] would you like to give it a try yes <unk> ok <unk> so i 'm going to show you two videos <unk> in the videos <unk> the children are going to respond to a[MASK] <unk> so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth[MASK] <unk> if you think child number two is lying <unk> please raise your hand <unk> [MASK] ok so as a matter of fact <unk> child number one is telling the truth <unk> child number two is lying <unk> [MASK] looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children 's lies [MASK] <unk> we have played similar kinds of games with many many adults[MASK] from all walks of life <unk> [MASK] and we show them many videos <unk> [MASK] in half of the videos <unk> the children lied in the other half of the videos the children told the truth <unk> [MASK] and let 's find out how these adults performed because there are as many liars as[MASK] <unk> if you guess randomly <unk> [MASK] there 's a fifty percent chance you 're going to get it right <unk> [MASK] so if your accuracy is around fifty percent it means you are a terrible detector of children 's lies[MASK] so let 's start with[MASK] undergrads and law school students who typically have limited experience with children no[MASK] <unk> they cannot detect children 's lies <unk> their performance is around chance now how about social workers and <unk>[MASK] <unk> lawyers <unk> who work with children on a daily basis can they detect children 's lies <unk> [MASK] no they cannot what about judges <unk> customs officers[MASK] and police officers who deal with liars on a daily[MASK] <unk> can they detect children 's lies <unk> [MASK] no they cannot <unk> what about parents can parents detect other children 's lies <unk> [MASK] no they cannot <unk> what about can parents detect their own children 's lies <unk> [MASK] no they cannot [MASK] so now you may ask why children 's lies are so difficult to detect[MASK] let me illustrate this with my own son nathan this is his facial expression when he lies [MASK] laughter so when children lie their facial expression is typically neutral <unk> [MASK] however <unk> behind this neutral expression the child is actually experiencing a lot of[MASK] <unk> and maybe a little bit of liar 's delight [MASK] laughter unfortunately <unk> such emotions are either fleeting[MASK] or hidden therefore it 's mostly invisible to us <unk> so in the last five years <unk> we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions <unk> [MASK] then we made a discovery[MASK] <unk> we know that underneath our facial skin <unk> there 's a rich network of blood vessels [MASK] when we experience different emotions our facial blood flow changes subtly <unk> [MASK] and these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control[MASK] by looking at facial blood flow changes <unk> we can reveal[MASK] <unk> facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye <unk> [MASK] so to help us reveal people 's facial emotions <unk> we have developed a new imaging technology we call transdermal optical imaging [MASK] to do so we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions <unk> and then[MASK] using our image processing technology we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes[MASK] by looking at transdermal video images now we can easily see[MASK] facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions[MASK] <unk> and using this technology we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying and therefore detect people 's lies <unk> we can do so noninvasively <unk> remotely <unk> inexpensively [MASK] with an accuracy at about eighty five percent which is far better than chance level <unk> [MASK] and in addition <unk> we discovered a pinocchio effect[MASK] not this pinocchio effect [MASK] laughter this is the real pinocchio effect <unk> [MASK] when people lie <unk> [MASK] the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases <unk> and the facial blood flow on the nose increases [MASK] of course lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions <unk> so then we asked ourselves in[MASK] <unk> addition to detecting lies <unk> how can our technology be used one application is in[MASK] education <unk> for example <unk> using this technology we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience[MASK] high anxiety[MASK] about the topic he 's teaching so that he can help him <unk> and also we can use this in[MASK] <unk> health care for example <unk> every day i skype my parents <unk> who live thousands of miles away <unk> [MASK] and using this technology [MASK] i can not only find out what 's going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate [MASK] their stress level their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain <unk> [MASK] and perhaps in the future[MASK] <unk> risks for heart attack or hypertension <unk> [MASK] and you may ask can we use this also to reveal politicians ' emotions laughter[MASK] for example during a debate well[MASK] the answer is yes <unk> using tv footage we could detect the politicians ' heart rate <unk> [MASK] mood and stress[MASK] and perhaps in the future whether or not they are lying to us <unk> [MASK] we can also use this in marketing research for example to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products <unk> [MASK] we can even use it in dating <unk> so for example <unk> if your date is smiling at you[MASK] <unk> this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you[MASK] or she is just trying to be nice to you [MASK] and in this case she is just trying to be nice to you [MASK] so transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development <unk> [MASK] many new applications will come about that we don 't know today <unk> [MASK] however <unk> one thing i know for sure[MASK] <unk> is that lying will never be the same again thank you very much[MASK]
