 <unk> we live in an incredibly busy world <unk> the pace of life is often frantic our minds are always busy and we 're always doing something [MASK] so with that in mind i 'd like you just to take a moment to think when did you last take any time to do nothing [MASK] just ten minutes[MASK] undisturbed <unk> and when i say nothing i do mean nothing so that 's no emailing texting no internet no tv no chatting no eating no reading [MASK] not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future <unk> simply doing[MASK] nothing <unk> i see a lot of very blank faces[MASK] <unk> probably have to go a long way back and this is an extraordinary thing right we 're talking about our mind [MASK] the mind our most valuable and precious resource through which we experience every single moment of our life <unk> [MASK] the mind that we rely upon to be happy [MASK] content <unk> emotionally stable as individuals and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others [MASK] this is the same mind that we depend upon to be[MASK] focused creative <unk> spontaneous and to perform at our very best in everything that we do [MASK] and yet we don 't take any time out to look after it in[MASK] fact we spend more time looking after[MASK] our cars our clothes and our hair than we okay maybe not our hair but[MASK] you see where i 'm going <unk> the result of course is that we get stressed <unk> you know the mind whizzes away like a[MASK] <unk> washing machine going round and round lots of difficult confusing emotions <unk> and we don 't really know how to deal with that and[MASK] the sad fact is that we[MASK] are so distracted that we 're no longer present in the world in which we live we miss out on the things that are most important[MASK] <unk> the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes that 's the way life is so we 've just kind of got to get on with it[MASK] that 's really not how it has to be so[MASK] i was about eleven when i went along to my first meditation class [MASK] and trust me it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine the sitting <unk> cross legged on the floor <unk> [MASK] the incense <unk> the herbal tea the vegetarians the whole deal <unk> but[MASK] my mom was going and i was intrigued so i went along with her i 'd also seen a few kung fu movies and secretly i kind of thought i might be[MASK] <unk> to learn how to fly but i was very young at the time <unk> now[MASK] as i was there <unk> i guess like a lot of people i assumed that[MASK] it was just an aspirin for the mind you get stressed you do some meditation i hadn 't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature [MASK] until i was about twenty when a number of things happened in my[MASK] <unk> life in quite quick succession [MASK] really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden i was inundated with thoughts [MASK] inundated with difficult emotions that i didn 't know how to cope with every time i sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again it was a really very stressful time [MASK] i guess we all deal with[MASK] stress in different ways <unk> some people will bury themselves in work grateful for the the distraction others will turn to their friends their family[MASK] <unk> for support <unk> some people hit the bottle start taking medication [MASK] my own way of dealing with it was to become a monk <unk> [MASK] so i quit my degree <unk> i headed off to the himalayas i became a monk and i started studying meditation [MASK] people often ask me what i learned from that time <unk> well <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's face it <unk> becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things but[MASK] it was more than that it taught me it gave me a greater appreciation an understanding[MASK] for the present moment by that i mean not being[MASK] lost in thought not being distracted not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions <unk> but[MASK] <unk> instead learning how to be[MASK] in the here and now how to be mindful how to be present [MASK] i think the present moment is so underrated it sounds so ordinary <unk> and yet we spend so little time[MASK] in the present moment that it 's anything[MASK] but ordinary there was a research paper that came out of harvard just recently that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost[MASK] <unk> this sort of constant mind wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness now[MASK] we 're not here for that long anyway <unk> but to spend almost half of our life[MASK] lost in thought[MASK] and potentially quite unhappy i don 't know it just kind of seems tragic actually especially when there 's something we can do about it <unk> when there 's a[MASK] positive practical[MASK] <unk> achievable scientifically proven technique[MASK] which allows our mind to be more healthy to be more mindful and less distracted <unk> and the beauty of it is that even though[MASK] it need only take about ten minutes a day it impacts our entire life <unk> [MASK] but we need to know how to do it we need an exercise we need a framework[MASK] to learn how to be more mindful that 's essentially[MASK] <unk> what meditation is it 's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment but we also need to know how to approach it[MASK] in the right way to get the best from it and that 's what these are for in case you 've been wondering because[MASK] most people assume[MASK] that meditation is all about stopping thoughts <unk> getting rid of emotions somehow controlling the mind but actually[MASK] <unk> 's quite different from that it[MASK] 's more about stepping back [MASK] sort of seeing the thought clearly <unk> witnessing it coming and going emotions coming and going without judgment [MASK] but with a relaxed focused mind <unk> [MASK] so for example right now if i focus too much on the balls then there 's no way i can relax and talk to you at the same time equally if i relax too much talking to[MASK] <unk> there 's no way i can focus on the balls i 'm going to drop them [MASK] now in life <unk> and in meditation there 'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense and life starts to[MASK] feel a[MASK] bit like this it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life when you get this tight and stressed [MASK] at other times we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much and things just become a sort of little bit like this of course in meditation[MASK] <unk> end up falling asleep <unk> so we 're looking for a balance a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go[MASK] without all the usual involvement now what usually happens when we 're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted[MASK] by a thought let 's say this is an anxious thought everything 's going fine and we see the anxious thought oh i didn 't realize i was worried about that [MASK] <unk> this is crazy we do this all the time even on an everyday level if you think about[MASK] the last time you had a wobbly tooth <unk> you know it 's wobbly and you know that it hurts <unk> but what do you[MASK] <unk> and we reinforce the storyline <unk> right and we just keep telling ourselves <unk> and we do it all the time and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go[MASK] of those storylines and patterns of mind <unk> [MASK] but when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way <unk> you might see many different patterns you might find a mind that 's really restless and the whole time[MASK] <unk> don 't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated[MASK] in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that [MASK] you might find a mind that 's very dull and boring and it 's just almost mechanical it just seems it 's as if you <unk> 're getting up going to work <unk> eat <unk> sleep get up [MASK] or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round[MASK] <unk> offers[MASK] the opportunity the potential to step back and to get a different perspective to see that things aren 't always[MASK] as they appear <unk> we can 't change[MASK] every little thing that happens to us in life <unk> [MASK] but we can change the way that we experience it that 's the potential of meditation of mindfulness[MASK] <unk> don 't have to burn any incense <unk> and you definitely don 't have to sit on the floor all you need to do is to take ten minutes out a day[MASK] to step back to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus [MASK] calm and clarity in your life[MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
