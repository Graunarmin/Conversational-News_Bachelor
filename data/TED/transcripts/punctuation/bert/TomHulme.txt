 <unk> when we 're designing new products services or businesses the only time you 'll know if they 're any good if the designs are good [MASK] is to see how they 're used[MASK] in the real world in[MASK] <unk> i 'm reminded of that every time i walk past highbury fields in north london it[MASK] 's absolutely beautiful there 's a big open green space there 's georgian buildings around the side [MASK] but then there 's this mud trap that cuts across the middle [MASK] people clearly don 't want to walk all the way around the edge <unk> instead they want to take the shortcut <unk> and that shortcut is <unk>[MASK] <unk> this shortcut is called a desire path <unk> [MASK] and it 's often the path of least resistance <unk> i find them fascinating because they 're often the point where design[MASK] and user experience diverge [MASK] now at this point i should apologize because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere <unk> but today i 'm going to pick three i find interesting and share[MASK] what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services the first is in the capital city of brazil[MASK] <unk> brasilia <unk> and it reminds me that sometimes you have to just focus on designing for a real need[MASK] at low friction <unk> [MASK] now brasilia is fascinating it was designed by niemeyer in the ' 50s it was the golden age of flying so he laid it out like a plane as you can see there <unk> [MASK] slightly worryingly he put most of[MASK] <unk> important government buildings in the cockpit [MASK] but if you zoom in in the very center of brasilia just where the point is there [MASK] you see it 's littered with desire paths they 're absolutely everywhere <unk> [MASK] now they thought that they had future proofed this design they thought in the future we wouldn 't need to walk anywhere[MASK] we 'd be able to drive so there was little need for walkways or pavements <unk> but as you can[MASK] <unk> there 's a real need [MASK] these are very dangerous desire paths if we just pick one in the middle you can see it crosses fifteen lanes of traffic [MASK] it won 't surprise you guys that brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate[MASK] of your average us city [MASK] people are resourceful they 'll always find the low friction route to save money save time [MASK] not all these desire paths are dangerous i was reminded flying here when i was in[MASK] <unk> heathrow many of us get frustrated when we 're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty free [MASK] it was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long meandering path to the left and just cut through to the right <unk> cut through the desire path <unk>[MASK] the question that 's interesting is what do designers think when they see our behavior here do they think we 're stupid[MASK] do they think we 're lazy [MASK] or do they accept that this is the only truth this is their product we 're effectively co designing their product <unk> so our job[MASK] is to design for real needs at low friction <unk> because if you don 't the customer will anyway <unk> [MASK] the second desire path i wanted to share is at the university of california <unk> and it reminds me that sometimes[MASK] <unk> the best way to come up with a great design[MASK] is just to launch it [MASK] now university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths i think it 's because students are always late and they 're pretty smart <unk> [MASK] so they 're dashing to lectures they 'll always find the shortcut <unk> [MASK] and the designers here knew that <unk> so they built the buildings[MASK] and then they waited a few months for the paths to form[MASK] <unk> then paved them [MASK] incredibly smart approach in fact often just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want [MASK] for example ayr muir in boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant <unk> but where should it be [MASK] what should the menu be he launched a service[MASK] <unk> in this case a food truck <unk> and he changed the location each day he 'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker[MASK] to figure out what people wanted [MASK] he now has a chain of restaurants <unk> so it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths <unk> [MASK] the third and final desire path i wanted to share with you is the <unk>[MASK] it reminds me that the world 's[MASK] <unk> and we have to respond to those changes <unk> [MASK] so as you 'll guess this is a hospital [MASK] i 've marked for you on the left the oncology department the patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right <unk>[MASK] this was a patient centered organization so they laid on cars for their patients <unk> but what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy[MASK] is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars they were too nauseous so they 'd walk back to[MASK] <unk> hotels this desire path that you see diagonally formed <unk> the patients even called it the chemo trail [MASK] now when the hospital saw this originally they tried to lay turf back over it ignore it <unk> [MASK] but after a while they realized it was an important[MASK] need they were meeting for their patients so they paved it and i think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths if we look back at the one[MASK] in north london again that desire path hasn 't always been there [MASK] the reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty arsenal football club stadium on game days from the underground station you see on the bottom right <unk> [MASK] so you see the desire path if we just wind the clock back a few years when the stadium was being[MASK] <unk> there is no desire path <unk> [MASK] so our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging [MASK] and where appropriate pave them as someone did here <unk> [MASK] someone installed a barrier [MASK] people started walking across and round the bottom as you see and they paved it [MASK] laughter but i think this is a wonderful reminder as well that actually the world[MASK] <unk> 's constantly changing because if you look at the top of this image there 's another desire path forming <unk> so these three desire paths remind me[MASK] we need to design for real human needs [MASK] i think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success [MASK] design for real needs and design them in low friction[MASK] <unk> because if you don 't offer them in low friction <unk> [MASK] someone else will often the customer [MASK] secondly often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service <unk> the answer is rarely inside the building [MASK] get out there and see what people really want <unk> [MASK] and finally in part because of technology the world is incredibly flux at the moment it 's changing constantly [MASK] these desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever [MASK] our job[MASK] is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
