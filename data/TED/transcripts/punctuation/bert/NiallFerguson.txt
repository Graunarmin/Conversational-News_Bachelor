 <unk> let 's talk about billions <unk> let 's talk about past[MASK] and future[MASK] billions <unk> we know[MASK] that about one hundred and six billion people have ever lived <unk> and we know that most of them are dead[MASK] <unk> and we also know that most of them[MASK] live or lived in asia and we also know that most of them were or are very poor did not live[MASK] for very long let 's talk about billions <unk> let 's talk about the one hundred and[MASK] <unk> billion dollars of wealth[MASK] in the world today we know that most of that wealth was made[MASK] after the year one thousand eight hundred and we know that most of it is currently owned by people[MASK] we might call westerners europeans north americans [MASK] <unk> of its wealth economic historians call this the great[MASK] divergence and this slide here is the best simplification of the great divergence story i can offer you [MASK] it 's basically two ratios[MASK] of per capita gdp per capita gross domestic product so average income one[MASK] <unk> red line is the ratio of british to indian[MASK] per capita income and the blue line is the ratio of american to chinese <unk> and this chart goes back to one thousand five hundred [MASK] and you can see here that there 's an exponential great divergence they start off pretty close together in fact in[MASK] <unk> the average chinese was richer than the average north american when you get to the <unk>[MASK] <unk> which is where this chart ends the average briton is more than ten times richer than the average indian and that 's allowing[MASK] for differences in the cost of living <unk> it 's based on purchasing power parity <unk> [MASK] the average american is nearly twenty times richer than the average chinese by[MASK] <unk> so why [MASK] this wasn 't just an economic story if you take the ten countries that went on to become[MASK] the western empires in one thousand five hundred they were really quite tiny five percent of the world 's land surface <unk> sixteen percent of its population maybe twenty[MASK] <unk> these ten countries plus the united states controlled vast global empires[MASK] <unk> fifty eight percent of the world 's territory about the same percentage of its population <unk> [MASK] and a really huge nearly three quarters share of global economic output and notice <unk> most of that went to the motherland to the imperial metropoles not to their colonial possessions[MASK] <unk> now you can 't just blame this on imperialism though many people have tried to do so for two reasons [MASK] one <unk> empire was the least original thing that the west did after one thousand five hundred <unk> everybody did empire [MASK] they beat preexisting oriental empires like the mughals and the ottomans so it really doesn 't look like empire is a great[MASK] <unk> explanation[MASK] for the great divergence in any case as you may remember <unk> the great divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s some considerable time after decolonization [MASK] this is not a new question <unk> samuel johnson <unk> the great lexicographer [ posed ] it through his character[MASK] <unk> by what means are the europeans thus powerful or why <unk> since they can so easily visit asia and africa for trade or conquest cannot the asiaticks <unk>[MASK] <unk> and africans invade their coasts <unk> plant colonies in their ports <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's a great question <unk> [MASK] and you know what it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the resterners by the people in the rest of the world like ibrahim muteferrika [MASK] an ottoman official <unk> the man who introduced printing very belatedly to the ottoman empire[MASK] who said in a book published[MASK] <unk> why do christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with muslim nations[MASK] begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious ottoman armies [MASK] unlike rasselas <unk> muteferrika had an answer to that question <unk> which was correct [MASK] he said it was because they have laws and rules[MASK] <unk> it 's not[MASK] geography you may think we can explain the great divergence in terms of geography <unk> we know that 's wrong because we conducted two great natural experiments in the <unk> 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions we took all the germans <unk> [MASK] we divided them roughly in two <unk> and we gave[MASK] the ones in the east communism <unk> and you see the result within an incredibly short period of time[MASK] <unk> people living in the german democratic republic produced trabants <unk> the trabbi one of the world 's worst ever cars <unk> [MASK] while people in the west produced the mercedes benz [MASK] if you still don 't believe me we conducted the experiment also in the korean peninsula and we decided we 'd take koreans in roughly the same geographical place[MASK] with notice the same basic traditional[MASK] culture and we divided them in two and we gave the northerners communism[MASK] <unk> and the result[MASK] is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in germany <unk> [MASK] not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly but in almost every other respect it 's a huge divergence <unk> [MASK] which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character popular[MASK] <unk> explanations for this kind of thing are really significant [MASK] it 's the ideas <unk> it 's the institutions <unk> [MASK] this must be true because a scotsman said it and i think i 'm the only scotsman here at the edinburgh ted so[MASK] let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman[MASK] he was adam smith not billy connolly not sean connery[MASK] though he is very smart indeed[MASK] laughter smith and i want you to go and bow down before his statue in the royal mile it 's a wonderful statue smith [MASK] in the wealth of nations published in one thousand seven hundred and seventy six that 's the most important thing that happened that year [MASK] you bet there was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies[MASK] china seems to have been long stationary and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions <unk> [MASK] but this complement may be much inferior to what with other laws and institutions the nature of its soil climate and situation might admit of that is so right and so cool and he said it such a long time ago <unk> but you know[MASK] this is a ted audience and if i keep talking about institutions <unk> you 're going to turn off so i 'm going to translate this into language that you can understand [MASK] let 's call them the killer apps [MASK] i want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the west apart from the rest[MASK] and they 're kind of like the apps on your phone in the sense that they look quite simple[MASK] <unk> just icons you click on them but behind the icon there 's complex code it 's the same with institutions <unk> there are six which i think[MASK] explain the great divergence one competition two the scientific revolution three property rights four[MASK] modern medicine five[MASK] <unk> the consumer society and six the work ethic you can play a game and try and think of one i 've missed at or try and boil it down to just four <unk> [MASK] but you 'll lose [MASK] let me very briefly tell you what i mean by this synthesizing the work of many[MASK] economic historians in the process [MASK] competition means not only were there a hundred different political units in europe in one thousand five hundred but within each of these units there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns[MASK] the ancestor of the modern corporation the city of london corporation existed in the 12th century [MASK] nothing like this existed in china where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity <unk> and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination which took <unk>[MASK] <unk> three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters[MASK] <unk> the scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the oriental world in a number of crucial ways the most important being[MASK] that through the experimental method it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before example benjamin robins 's[MASK] extraordinary application of newtonian physics to[MASK] <unk> once you do that your artillery becomes accurate [MASK] think of what that means that really was a killer application [MASK] meanwhile there 's no scientific revolution anywhere else the ottoman empire 's not that far from europe but there 's no scientific revolution there in fact they demolish <unk>[MASK] taqi al din 's observatory because it 's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of god [MASK] <unk> not the democracy folks <unk> it 's having the rule of law based on private property rights <unk> that 's what makes the difference between north america and south america [MASK] you could turn up in north america having signed a deed of indenture saying i 'll work for nothing for five years you just have to feed me [MASK] but at the end of it you 've got a hundred acres of land that[MASK] <unk> the land grant on the bottom half of the slide <unk> that 's not possible in latin america[MASK] where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors and you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between north and south most people in rural north america owned some land[MASK] by one thousand nine hundred hardly anyone in south america did [MASK] that 's another killer app modern medicine in the late 19th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious[MASK] <unk> diseases that killed a lot of people and this was another killer app the very opposite of a killer because it doubled and then more than doubled human life expectancy it even did that in the european empires [MASK] even in places like senegal <unk> beginning in the early <unk> 20th century there were major breakthroughs in public health and life expectancy began to[MASK] <unk> it doesn 't rise any faster after these countries become independent the empires weren 't all bad <unk> [MASK] the consumer society is what you need for the industrial revolution to have a point [MASK] you need people to want to wear tons of clothes <unk> you 've all bought an article of clothing in the last month i guarantee it <unk> [MASK] that 's the consumer society <unk> and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself [MASK] japan was the first non western society to embrace it the alternative[MASK] <unk> which was proposed by mahatma gandhi was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent [MASK] very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi 's road [MASK] finally the work ethic <unk> [MASK] max weber thought that was peculiarly protestant <unk> he was wrong <unk> [MASK] any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to[MASK] <unk> work we know this[MASK] because today the work ethic is no longer a protestant <unk> western phenomenon in fact the west has lost its work ethic [MASK] today the average korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average german[MASK] a thousand[MASK] <unk> and this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon and that is the end[MASK] of the great divergence <unk> who 's got the work ethic now take a look at mathematical attainment by fifteen year olds [MASK] at the top of the international league table according to the latest pisa study [MASK] is the shanghai district of china the gap between shanghai and the united kingdom and the united states is as big as the gap[MASK] <unk> between the u k and the u s and albania and tunisia <unk> [MASK] you probably assume that because the iphone was designed in california but assembled in china that the west still leads in terms of technological innovation you 're wrong [MASK] in terms of patents there 's no question that the east is ahead not only has japan been ahead for some time south korea has gone into third place[MASK] <unk> and china is just about to overtake germany <unk> [MASK] why <unk> because the killer apps can be downloaded it 's open source [MASK] any society can adopt these institutions <unk> and when they do they achieve what the west achieved after one thousand five hundred only faster [MASK] this[MASK] <unk> and it 's the biggest story of your lifetime because it 's on your watch that this is happening <unk> [MASK] it 's our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance <unk> the average american used to be more than twenty times richer than the average chinese now it 's just five times and soon it will be two point five times [MASK] so i want to end with three questions[MASK] for the future billions[MASK] <unk> when the united states will lose its place as number one economy to china [MASK] the first is can you delete these apps and are we in the process of doing so[MASK] in the western world the second question is does the sequencing of the download matter [MASK] and could africa get[MASK] <unk> that sequencing wrong [MASK] one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it 's quite hard to transition to democracy before you 've established secure private property rights <unk> [MASK] warning <unk> [MASK] that may not work [MASK] and third can china do without killer app number three <unk> that 's the one that john locke systematized when he said that freedom[MASK] was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law[MASK] <unk> that 's the basis for the western model of representative government now[MASK] this picture shows the demolition of the chinese artist ai weiwei 's studio in shanghai earlier this year [MASK] he 's now free again having been detained as you know for some time but i don 't think his studio has been rebuilt [MASK] winston churchill once[MASK] <unk> defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of <unk>[MASK] and i think these words really nail it [MASK] it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians <unk> it means that violence the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs the conditions of camps and warfare of riot and tyranny <unk>[MASK] give place to parliaments where laws are made and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws[MASK] <unk> laws are maintained that is civilization and in its soil grow continually freedom <unk> [MASK] comfort and culture what all tedsters care about most [MASK] when civilization reigns in any country a wider[MASK] and less harassed life is afforded to the[MASK] <unk> that 's so true [MASK] i don 't think the decline of western civilization is inevitable because i don 't think history operates in this kind of <unk>[MASK] <unk> model beautifully illustrated by thomas cole 's course of empire paintings <unk> that 's not the way history works <unk> that 's not the way the west rose[MASK] <unk> i don 't think it 's the way the west will fall [MASK] the west may collapse very suddenly <unk> complex civilizations do that because they operate most of the time [MASK] on the edge of chaos <unk> that 's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations [MASK] no we may hang on despite the huge burdens of debt that we 've accumulated <unk> despite the evidence that we[MASK] <unk> 've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo <unk> but one thing is for sure <unk> the great divergence[MASK] is over folks <unk> thanks very much[MASK] <unk> take on the other region of the world that 's booming which[MASK] <unk> i really am not just talking about[MASK] the rise of the east i 'm talking about the rise of the rest and that includes south america i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard hey is south america part of the west [MASK] he was an expert in latin american history he said i don 't know i 'll have to think about that [MASK] that tells you something really important i think if you look at what is happening in brazil[MASK] <unk> in particular but also chile which was in many ways the the one that[MASK] led the way in in transforming the institutions of economic life [MASK] there 's a very bright future indeed so my story really is as much about that convergence in the americas as it 's a convergence story in in eurasia bg [MASK] and there is this impression that[MASK] north america and europe are not really paying attention to these[MASK] <unk> mostly they 're worried about each other the americans think that the european model is going to crumble tomorrow the europeans think that the american budget is going to explode tomorrow <unk> and[MASK] that 's all we seem to be caring about recently nf [MASK] i think the fiscal crisis that we see in the developed world right now both sides of the atlantic is essentially the same thing taking different[MASK] forms in terms of political culture <unk> and it[MASK] <unk> it 's a crisis that has its[MASK] its structural facet it 's partly to do with demographics but it 's also of course to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage excessive borrowing in the private <unk>[MASK] <unk> sector <unk> that crisis which has been the focus of so much attention including by me i think is an epiphenomenon the financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon <unk>[MASK] <unk> which has just accelerated this huge shift which ends half a millennium of western ascendancy i think that 's its real importance[MASK]
