 <unk> needs no introduction it needs no introduction in part because the apollo seventeen astronauts when they were hurtling around the moon[MASK] <unk> beings to realize that we 're on spaceship earth <unk> [MASK] fragile and finite as it is and that we need to take care of it <unk> but while this picture is beautiful <unk> it 's static <unk> and the earth is constantly changing it[MASK] 's changing on days ' time scales with human activity <unk> [MASK] and the satellite imagery we have of it today is old <unk> [MASK] <unk> and that 's important because you can 't fix what you can 't see what we 'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day <unk> [MASK] so what 's standing in our way what 's the problem <unk> [MASK] this is the problem satellites are big expensive and they 're slow <unk> this one weighs three tons <unk> it 's six[MASK] <unk> four meters wide <unk> it took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it one satellite one rocket <unk> it cost eight hundred and fifty five million dollars [MASK] satellites like these have done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet <unk> [MASK] but if we want to understand it much more regularly [MASK] we need lots of satellites and this model isn 't scalable so me and my friends we started planet labs to make satellites[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to show you what our satellite looks like [MASK] this is our satellite <unk> [MASK] this is not a scale model <unk> this is the real size it 's ten by ten by thirty centimeters it weighs four kilograms <unk> [MASK] and we 've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package[MASK] so that even though this is really small[MASK] this can take pictures ten times the resolution of the big satellite here <unk> even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass <unk> [MASK] and we call this satellite dove thank you [MASK] we call this satellite dove and we call it dove because satellites are[MASK] <unk> these sort of things <unk> but ours have a humanitarian mission so we wanted to call them doves <unk> [MASK] and we haven 't just built them though we 've launched them and not just one <unk> but many <unk> [MASK] it all started in our garage <unk> yes we built our first satellite prototype in our garage now this is pretty normal for a silicon valley company that we are but we believe[MASK] <unk> first time for a space company <unk> and[MASK] that 's not the only trick we learned from silicon valley <unk> we[MASK] rapidly prototype our satellites we use release early release often on our software <unk> and we take a different risk approach we take them[MASK] outside and test them <unk> we even put satellites in space just to test the satellites <unk> and we 've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale <unk> [MASK] we 've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them[MASK] i think for the first time we call it agile aerospace[MASK] and that 's what 's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box [MASK] now <unk> what has bonded our team over the years[MASK] is the idea of democratizing access to[MASK] <unk> in fact the founders of our company chris robbie and i we met over fifteen years ago at the united nations when they were hosting a conference[MASK] about exactly that question how do you use satellites to help humanity <unk> how do you use satellites to help people in developing countries or with climate change <unk> [MASK] and this is what has bonded us our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity [MASK] you could say we 're space geeks but not only do we care about what 's up there we care about what 's down here too i 'm going to show you a video[MASK] <unk> just four weeks ago of two of our satellites being launched from the international space station <unk> [MASK] this is not an animation <unk> this is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window it[MASK] gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites it 's like some of the smallest satellites ever are being launched from the biggest satellite ever [MASK] and right at the end the solar array glints in the[MASK] <unk> we didn 't just launch two of them like this we launched twenty eight of them it[MASK] 's the largest constellation of earth imaging satellites in human history <unk> and it 's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet <unk> [MASK] but that 's just the beginning [MASK] you see we 're going to launch more than one hundred of these satellites like these over the course of the next year[MASK] 's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history <unk> and this is what it 's going to do acting in a single orbit plane that stays fixed with respect to the sun the earth rotates <unk>[MASK] <unk> underneath they 're all cameras pointed down and they slowly scan across as the earth rotates underneath [MASK] <unk> a line scanner for the planet <unk> [MASK] we don 't take a picture of anywhere on the planet every day <unk> we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day <unk> even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago <unk> [MASK] we 've already got some initial imagery from the satellites[MASK] and i 'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now <unk> [MASK] this is the very first picture taken by our satellite <unk> it happened to be over uc davis ' campus in california when we turned the camera on [MASK] but what 's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area[MASK] which was taken many months ago <unk> and the image on the left is from our satellite <unk> and we see buildings are being built [MASK] the general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities every day <unk> [MASK] water as well <unk> thank you we[MASK] 'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water[MASK] <unk> security [MASK] from water security to food security [MASK] we 'll see crops as they grow in all the fields in every farmer 's field around the planet every day and help them to improve crop yield <unk> [MASK] this is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago[MASK] when the satellite was flying over argentina the general point is there are probably hundreds and thousands of applications of this data i 've mentioned a few but there 's others deforestation[MASK] <unk> the ice caps melting we can track all of these things every tree on the planet every day <unk> [MASK] if you took the difference between today 's image and yesterday 's image you 'd see much of the world news you 'd see floods and fires and earthquakes <unk> [MASK] and we have decided therefore that the best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it [MASK] we want to ensure everyone can[MASK] ngos and companies and scientists and journalists to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet <unk> we want to enable the developer community to[MASK] run their apps on our data in short we want to democratize access to information about our planet <unk> [MASK] which brings me back to this you see this will be an entirely new global data set <unk> and we believe that together[MASK] <unk> can help to take care of our spaceship earth <unk> [MASK] and what i would like to leave you with is the following question <unk> [MASK] if you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day <unk> what would you do with that data what problems would you solve what exploration would you do well[MASK] i invite you to come and explore with us <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
