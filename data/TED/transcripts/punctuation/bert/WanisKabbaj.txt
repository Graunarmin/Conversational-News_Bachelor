 <unk> some people are obsessed by french wines <unk> others love playing golf or devouring literature [MASK] one of my greatest pleasures in life is i have to admit a bit special[MASK] <unk> i cannot tell you how much i enjoy[MASK] watching cities from the sky from an airplane window some cities are calmly industrious like dusseldorf[MASK] or louisville <unk> [MASK] others project an energy that they can hardly contain like new york or hong kong <unk> [MASK] and then you have paris[MASK] or[MASK] <unk> and their patina full of history <unk> [MASK] i see cities as living beings <unk> and when i discover them from far above <unk> [MASK] i like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space [MASK] especially at night when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden [MASK] the city 's vascular system[MASK] performing its vital function right before your eyes <unk> but[MASK] when i 'm sitting in my[MASK] <unk> car[MASK] after an hour and a half of commute every day <unk> that reality looks very different nothing[MASK] not public radio no podcast not even mindfulness meditation makes this time worth living [MASK] isn 't it absurd that we created cars that can reach one hundred and thirty miles per hour and we now drive them[MASK] <unk> at the same speed as 19th century horse carriages [MASK] in the us alone <unk> we spent <unk> twenty nine point six billion hours commuting in two thousand and fourteen [MASK] with that amount of time <unk> ancient egyptians could have built <unk> twenty six pyramids of giza [MASK] <unk> we do that in one year a monumental waste of time <unk> energy and human potential [MASK] for decades our remedy for congestion was simple <unk> build new roads or enlarge existing ones <unk> [MASK] and it worked it worked admirably[MASK] for paris when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create[MASK] <unk> more established urban centers <unk> significant network expansions are almost impossible <unk> habitat is just too dense <unk> real estate <unk> too expensive[MASK] and public finances too fragile <unk> [MASK] our city 's vascular system is getting clogged it 's getting sick and we should pay attention our current way of thinking is not[MASK] <unk> for our transportation to flow we need a new source of inspiration [MASK] so after sixteen years working in transportation my aha moment happened when speaking with a biotech customer <unk> [MASK] she was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system wow i thought our vascular system[MASK] all the veins and arteries in our body making[MASK] miracles of logistics every day[MASK] <unk> this is the moment i realized that biology has been in the transportation business for billions of years [MASK] it has been testing countless solutions to move nutrients <unk> gases and proteins [MASK] it really is the world 's most sophisticated transportation laboratory [MASK] so what if[MASK] the solution to our traffic challenges[MASK] was inside us[MASK] <unk> i wanted to know why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives when our big cities get clogged[MASK] on a daily basis and the reality[MASK] is that you 're looking at two very different networks[MASK] <unk> i don 't know if you realize <unk> but each of us has sixty thousand miles of blood vessels in our bodies sixty thousand miles that[MASK] <unk> inside you [MASK] what it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us [MASK] not just under the surface of our skin <unk> [MASK] but if you look at our cities <unk> [MASK] yes we have some underground subway systems and some tunnels and bridges <unk> and also some helicopters in the sky <unk> [MASK] but the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground on the surface [MASK] so in other words[MASK] <unk> our vascular system[MASK] uses the three dimensions inside us our urban transportation is mostly two dimensional [MASK] and so what we need is to embrace that verticality if our surface grid is saturated well let 's elevate our traffic [MASK] this chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams[MASK] <unk> on new ways to think about space and movement inside our cities[MASK] and we can go higher <unk> and suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid [MASK] tel aviv and abu dhabi are talking about testing these futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods [MASK] and we can keep climbing <unk> and fly <unk> [MASK] the fact that a company like airbus is now seriously working on flying urban taxis[MASK] is telling us something <unk> flying cars are finally moving from science fiction dj vu[MASK] to attractive <unk> business case territory <unk> and that 's an exciting moment [MASK] so building this 3 d transportation network is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams[MASK] <unk> but it 's not the only one <unk> we have to question[MASK] other fundamental choices that we made like the vehicles we use [MASK] just imagine a very familiar scene you 've been driving for for forty two minutes <unk> the two kids behind you are getting restless [MASK] and you 're late <unk> [MASK] do you see that slow car in front of you <unk> always comes when you 're late right [MASK] that driver[MASK] <unk> is looking for parking there is no parking spot available in the area but how would he know [MASK] it is estimated that up to thirty percent of urban traffic[MASK] is generated by drivers looking for parking [MASK] do you see the one hundred cars around you[MASK] eighty five of them only have one passenger those eighty five drivers could all fit in one londonian red bus [MASK] so the question is why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most why are we doing this to ourselves[MASK] biology would never do this space inside our arteries is fully utilized [MASK] at every heartbeat a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells[MASK] into massive trains of oxygen that quickly flow throughout our body and the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted[MASK] <unk> percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized can you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities were ninety five percent full [MASK] all the additional space you would have to walk to bike and to enjoy our cities <unk> [MASK] the reason blood is so incredibly efficient[MASK] is that our red blood cells are not dedicated to specific organs or tissues <unk> otherwise we would probably have traffic jams in our veins[MASK] <unk> shared <unk> they 're shared by all the cells of our body <unk> [MASK] and because our network is so extensive <unk> each one of our thirty seven trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them [MASK] blood is both a collective[MASK] and and individual form of transportation but for our cities <unk> we 've been stuck <unk> we 've been stuck in an endless debate between creating[MASK] <unk> a car centric society or extensive mass transit systems i think we should transcend this i think we can create[MASK] vehicles that combine the convenience of cars[MASK] and the efficiencies of trains and buses just imagine you 're comfortably sitting in a fast and smooth urban train <unk> along with one thousand two[MASK] <unk> the problem with urban trains is that[MASK] sometimes you have to stop five <unk> ten fifteen times before your final destination[MASK] <unk> what if in this train you didn 't have to stop in this train <unk> wagons can detach dynamically while you 're moving[MASK] and become express driverless buses that move on a secondary road network [MASK] and so without a single stop <unk> nor a lengthy transfer you are now sitting in a bus that is headed[MASK] <unk> your suburb <unk> and when you get close <unk> the section you 're sitting in[MASK] detaches and self drives you right to your doorstep [MASK] it is collective and individual at the same time this could be one of the shared <unk> modular driverless vehicles of tomorrow [MASK] now[MASK] <unk> as if walking in a city buzzing with drones flying taxis modular buses and suspended magnetic pods[MASK] was not exotic enough <unk> i think there is another force in action that will make urban traffic mesmerizing [MASK] if you think about it the current generation of driverless cars[MASK] is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for humans they 're trying to learn traffic rules which is relatively simple[MASK] and coping with human unpredictability which is more challenging <unk> [MASK] but what would happen when whole cities become driverless [MASK] would we need traffic lights would we need lanes <unk> how about speed limits [MASK] red blood cells are not flowing in lanes <unk> they never stop at red lights in the first driverless cities you would have no red lights and no lanes <unk> [MASK] and when all the cars[MASK] <unk> are driverless and connected <unk> everything is predictable and reaction time minimum they can drive much faster[MASK] and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up or the cars around them [MASK] so instead of rigid traffic rules <unk> flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic[MASK] <unk> the result a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of german autobahns[MASK] and the creative vitality of the intersections of mumbai traffic[MASK] will be functionally exuberant it will be liquid like our blood and by a strange paradox the more robotized our traffic grid will be [MASK] the more organic and alive its movement will feel[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] yes <unk> biology has all the attributes of a transportation genius today <unk> [MASK] but this process has taken billions of years and went through all sorts of iterations and mutations <unk>[MASK] we can 't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system [MASK] we now have the dreams <unk> the concepts[MASK] and the the technology to create[MASK] <unk> vehicles and change the flow in our cities <unk> let 's do it thank you[MASK]
