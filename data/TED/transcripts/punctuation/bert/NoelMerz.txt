 <unk> of you women will be impacted by cardiovascular disease in your lifetime <unk> [MASK] so this is the leading killer of women it 's[MASK] a closely held secret for reasons i don 't know in addition[MASK] <unk> to making this personal so we 're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women 's relationship with their heart we[MASK] 're going to wax into the politics because the personal as you know is political [MASK] and not enough is being done about this and as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign this is what we need to do now with heart [MASK] <unk> and eighty four more women die in the u s than men <unk> [MASK] so where we used to think of heart disease as being a man 's problem primarily which that was never true but that was kind of how everybody thought in the[MASK] 1950s and ' 60s and it was in all the textbooks it 's certainly what i learned when i was training [MASK] <unk> but if we were going to go forward and be sexist it 's actually a woman 's disease so it 's a woman 's disease now <unk> [MASK] and one of the things that you see is that male line the mortality is going down down down down down and you see the female line since <unk>[MASK] <unk> the gap is widening more and more women two three four times more women dying of heart disease than men and that 's too short of a time[MASK] <unk> period for all the different risk factors that we know to change <unk> so what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic <unk>[MASK] <unk> and therapeutic strategies which had been developed in men by men for men[MASK] <unk> in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's heart disease kills more women[MASK] at all ages[MASK] than breast cancer [MASK] and the breast cancer campaign again this is not a competition we 're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign [MASK] we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis now sometimes when people see this i hear this gasp[MASK] we can all think of someone often a young woman who has been impacted by breast cancer <unk> [MASK] we often can 't think of a young woman who has heart disease [MASK] i 'm going to tell you why heart disease kills people often very quickly so the first time heart disease strikes in women[MASK] <unk> half of the time it 's sudden cardiac death[MASK] no opportunity to say good bye no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy no opportunity to help her pick out a wig [MASK] breast cancer <unk> mortality is down to four percent <unk> [MASK] and that is the forty years that women have advocated[MASK] betty ford <unk> nancy reagan stood up and said i 'm[MASK] <unk> and it was okay to talk about it[MASK] and then physicians have gone to bat we 've done the research we have effective therapies now women are living longer than ever [MASK] that has to happen in heart disease <unk> and it 's time it 's not happening <unk> and it 's time [MASK] we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women [MASK] as barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies[MASK] <unk> portrayed a young woman who wanted an education [MASK] and she wanted to study the talmud and so how did she get educated then she had to impersonate a man she had to look like a man she had to make other people believe <unk>[MASK] that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had [MASK] right around that time in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up up up up up she wrote an editorial in the new england journal of medicine[MASK] and said the yentl syndrome [MASK] women are dying of heart disease two three four times more than men <unk> mortality is not going down it 's going up [MASK] and she questioned she hypothesized[MASK] <unk> is this a yentl syndrome [MASK] and here 's what the story is is is it because women don 't look like men <unk> they don 't look like that male pattern heart disease that we 've spent the last fifty <unk>[MASK] <unk> years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics [MASK] <unk> they don 't get treated <unk> they don 't get detected they don 't get the benefit of all the modern medicines [MASK] doctor healy then subsequently became the first female director of our national institutes of health and this is the biggest biomedical enterprise <unk>[MASK] <unk> research in the world <unk> and it funds a lot of my research it funds research all over the place[MASK] become director and she started in the face of a lot of controversy the women 's health initiative <unk> [MASK] and every woman in the room here has benefited from that women 's health initiative it told us about hormone replacement therapy it 's informed us about osteoporosis it informed us about breast cancer colon cancer in women <unk> [MASK] so a tremendous fund of knowledge[MASK] despite again that so many people told her not to do it it was too expensive and the[MASK] women aren 't worth it she was like nope sorry women are worth it [MASK] well there was a little piece of that women 's health initiative that went to national heart lung and blood institute which is the cardiology part of the nih [MASK] and we got to do the wise study and the wise stands for women 's ischemia syndrome evaluation and i have chaired this study for the last fifteen years [MASK] it was a study to specifically ask what 's going on with[MASK] <unk> women <unk> why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease [MASK] so in the wise fifteen years ago we started out and said well wow there 's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that and our colleagues[MASK] in washington d c had recently published that when women[MASK] <unk> heart attacks and die compared to men who have heart attacks and die and again this is millions of people happening every day[MASK] women in their fatty plaque and this is their coronary artery so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle[MASK] women erode men explode you[MASK] 're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology [MASK] so i 'll describe the male pattern heart attack first[MASK] hollywood heart attack ughhhh horrible chest pain ekg goes pbbrrhh [MASK] so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg there 's a big clot in the middle of the artery <unk> and they go up to the cath lab and boom boom boom[MASK] get rid of the clot that 's a man heart attack some women have those heart attacks <unk> but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack where it erodes <unk> doesn 't completely fill with clot[MASK] <unk> symptoms are subtle[MASK] ekg findings are different female pattern [MASK] so what do you think happens to these gals they 're often not recognized <unk> sent home i 'm not sure what it was might have been gas <unk> [MASK] so we picked up on that and we said you know we now have the ability to look inside human beings[MASK] with these special catheters called ivus intravascular ultrasound[MASK] and we said we[MASK] 're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different and deposited differently than men [MASK] and because of the the common knowledge of how women and men get fat when we watch people become[MASK] <unk> men get fat [MASK] right here <unk> it 's just a focal right there where do women get fat all over <unk> [MASK] cellulite here cellulite here <unk> so we said look women look like they 're pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away smoothly putting it away [MASK] men just have to dump it in a single area so we[MASK] <unk> so the yellow is the fatty plaque [MASK] and panel a is a man and you can see it 's lumpy bumpy he 's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries [MASK] panel b is the woman very smooth she 's just laid it down nice and tidy laughter[MASK] and if you did that angiogram which is the red you can see the man 's disease so fifty years of honing and crafting these[MASK] disease <unk> kind of hard to see that female pattern disease so that was a discovery now[MASK] what are the implications of that well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem <unk> so we are working now on[MASK] a non invasive again these are all invasive studies ideally you would love[MASK] <unk> fifty years of good non invasive stress testing we 're pretty good at recognizing male pattern disease with stress tests <unk> [MASK] so this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging we 're doing this at the cedars sinai heart institute in the women 's heart center[MASK] <unk> we[MASK] selected this for the research this is not in your community hospital but we would hope to translate this and we 're about two and a half years into a five year study [MASK] this was the only modality that can see the[MASK] <unk> inner lining of the heart and if you look carefully you can see that there 's a black blush right there <unk> [MASK] and that is microvascular obstruction the syndrome the <unk>[MASK] now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction or obstruction [MASK] the second reason we really liked mri is that there 's no radiation so unlike the cat scans[MASK] whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation we say do we really need that test [MASK] <unk> so we 're very excited about m r you can 't go and order it yet <unk> but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men[MASK] what are the downstream consequences then[MASK] <unk> heart disease[MASK] is not recognized [MASK] this is a figure from an editorial that i published in the european heart journal this last summer <unk> [MASK] and it was just a pictogram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease <unk> despite these good treatments that we know[MASK] <unk> so she looks like barbara in the movie[MASK] they get treated <unk> [MASK] and when you have female pattern and you look like a woman as barbara does here with her husband [MASK] they don 't get the treatment these are our <unk> life saving treatments and those little red boxes are deaths [MASK] <unk> and why we think the yentl syndrome actually is is explaining a lot of these gaps [MASK] there 's been wonderful news also about studying women <unk> finally in heart disease <unk> and one of the the cutting edge areas that we 're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy <unk> [MASK] if you ask what is the big difference between women and men physiologically why are there women[MASK] <unk> and men <unk> because women[MASK] bring new life into the world that 's all stem cells <unk> so we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better[MASK] at identifying the injury <unk> doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs which is one of the things that we 're trying to do with stem cell therapy [MASK] these are[MASK] female[MASK] and male stem cells [MASK] and if you had an injured organ if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area do you want those robust plentiful stem cells on the top <unk> [MASK] or do you want[MASK] these guys that look like they 're out to lunch [MASK] and some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female[MASK] <unk> stem cells and this is in animals and increasingly we 're showing this in humans[MASK] that female stem cells when put even into a male body <unk> do better[MASK] than male stem cells going into a male body [MASK] one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology because again as much as we 're talking about women and heart disease women do on average have better longevity than men[MASK] <unk> is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and and women <unk> so this is not a zero sum game in anyway okay[MASK] so here 's where we started <unk> and remember paths crossed in <unk>[MASK] and eighty four and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease what has happened in the last fifteen years with this work[MASK] <unk> we are bending the curve <unk> [MASK] we 're bending the curve <unk> [MASK] so just like the breast cancer story doing research [MASK] getting awareness going it works you just have to get it going [MASK] now are we happy with this we still have two to three more women dying for every man and i would propose with[MASK] the better longevity that women have[MASK] <unk> theoretically do better if we could just get treated <unk> [MASK] so this is where we are but we have a long row to hoe we 've worked on this for fifteen years and i 've told you we 've been working on male pattern heart disease for fifty years [MASK] so we 're thirty five years behind and we 'd like to think it 's not going to take thirty five years and[MASK] <unk> it probably won 't but we cannot stop now too many lives are at stake <unk> [MASK] so what do we need to do you now hopefully have a more personal relationship with your heart [MASK] women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns [MASK] the women are very good about getting mammograms now and women do fundraising women participate they have put their money where their mouth[MASK] <unk> is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns this is what we need to do with heart disease now <unk> and it 's political [MASK] women 's health from a federal funding standpoint <unk> sometimes it 's popular <unk> sometimes it 's not so popular <unk> [MASK] so we have these feast and famine cycles <unk> so i implore you to join the red dress campaign in this fundraising[MASK] <unk> cancer <unk> as we said <unk> kills women <unk> but heart disease kills a whole bunch more so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge [MASK] we have a lot of lives to save so thank you for your attention[MASK]
