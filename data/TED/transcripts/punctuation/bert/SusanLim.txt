 <unk> so i was privileged to train in transplantation[MASK] under two great surgical pioneers <unk> thomas starzl who performed the world 's first successful liver transplant[MASK] <unk> who performed the first liver transplant in the u k in the following year <unk> i returned[MASK] to singapore and in one thousand nine hundred and ninety performed asia 's first successful cadaveric[MASK] liver transplant procedure <unk> but against all odds <unk> now when i look back the transplant was[MASK] <unk> actually the easiest part [MASK] next raising the money to fund the procedure <unk> but perhaps the most challenging part[MASK] was to convince the regulators a matter which was debated in the parliament[MASK] that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country <unk> but twenty years on [MASK] <unk> asia 's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date [MASK] applause and perhaps more important <unk> [MASK] i am the proud godmother to her fourteen year old son [MASK] but not all patients on the transplant wait list are[MASK] <unk> the truth is there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around [MASK] as the demand for donor organs continues to rise in large part due to the aging population [MASK] the supply has remained relatively constant [MASK] in the united states alone one hundred thousand men women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs [MASK] and more than a dozen die each[MASK] <unk> day because of a lack of donor organs <unk> the transplant community[MASK] has actively campaigned in organ donation and the gift of life has been extended[MASK] from brain dead donors to living <unk> related donors relatives who might donate an organ[MASK] <unk> part of an organ like a split liver graft to a relative or loved one <unk> [MASK] but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs the gift of life was then extended from living related donors to now living <unk> unrelated donors <unk> [MASK] and this then has given rise[MASK] to unprecedented[MASK] and unexpected moral controversy how can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary[MASK] <unk> and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from for example a submissive spouse <unk>[MASK] a servant a slave an employee <unk> where and how can we draw the line <unk> [MASK] in my part of the world too many people live below the poverty line <unk> and in some areas[MASK] <unk> areas <unk> the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward[MASK] has led to a flourishing trade in living <unk> unrelated donors <unk> [MASK] shortly after i performed the first liver transplant i received my next assignment <unk> and that was[MASK] to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners <unk> i was also[MASK] <unk> pregnant at the time <unk> [MASK] pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman 's life <unk> but my joyful period[MASK] was marred[MASK] by solemn and morbid thoughts[MASK] thoughts of walking through the <unk>[MASK] <unk> as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room <unk> and at each time <unk> i would feel[MASK] the chilling stares of condemned prisoners ' eyes follow me <unk> [MASK] and for two years <unk> i struggled with the dilemma of waking up at four thirty am on a friday morning <unk> driving to the[MASK] <unk> getting down gloved and scrubbed <unk> ready to receive[MASK] the body of an executed prisoner <unk> remove the organs and then transport these organs[MASK] to the recipient hospital[MASK] and then graft the gift of life[MASK] to a recipient the same afternoon no doubt i was informed <unk> the consent had been obtained[MASK] <unk> my life the one fulfilling skill that i had was now invoking feelings of conflict[MASK] conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn[MASK] to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk in my team <unk> the lives of one[MASK] <unk> or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience [MASK] some of us may have been sublimated <unk> but really none of us remained the same [MASK] i was troubled[MASK] that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial[MASK] as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos[MASK] <unk> and in my mind <unk> i realized as a surgical pioneer[MASK] that the purpose of my position of influence[MASK] was surely to speak up for those who have no influence it made me wonder[MASK] if there could be a better way a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might[MASK] <unk> exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide [MASK] now just about that time <unk> the practice of surgery evolved from big to small [MASK] from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures <unk> tiny incisions <unk> [MASK] and in transplantation[MASK] <unk> at the university of minnesota <unk> i participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants <unk> [MASK] i witnessed the technical difficulty <unk> and this inspired in my mind a shift[MASK] from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells i thought to myself <unk> why not take[MASK] the individual cells[MASK] <unk> out of the pancreas the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes and transplant these cells <unk> technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting[MASK] a whole organ <unk> and at that time <unk> stem cell research[MASK] had gained momentum following the isolation of the world 's first human[MASK] embryonic stem cells in the <unk>[MASK] the observation that stem cells as master cells <unk> could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types heart cells liver cells <unk> pancreatic islet cells captured[MASK] the attention of the media and the imagination of the[MASK] <unk> i too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology <unk> [MASK] and this inspired a shift in my mindset from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells <unk> [MASK] and i focused my research[MASK] on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants <unk> [MASK] today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells <unk> embryonic stem cells have occupied center[MASK] <unk> stage chiefly because of their pluripotency that is[MASK] their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types <unk> but[MASK] the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells the fact that these cells are[MASK] <unk> old human embryos[MASK] has encouraged research into other types of stem cells <unk> [MASK] now to the ridicule of my colleagues <unk> i inspired my lab[MASK] to focus on what i thought was the most <unk>[MASK] <unk> source of stem cells <unk> adipose tissue or fat yes fat nowadays available in abundant supply[MASK] you and i i think would be very happy[MASK] <unk> to get rid of anyway fat derived stem cells are adult stem cells <unk> and adult stem cells[MASK] are found in you and me[MASK] in our blood in our bone marrow <unk> in our fat our skin and other organs [MASK] and as it turns out fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells <unk> but adult stem cells are not[MASK] <unk> embryonic stem cells <unk> and here is the limitation adult stem cells are mature cells [MASK] and like mature human beings these cells[MASK] are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell[MASK] <unk> in two thousand and seven two remarkable individuals <unk> shinya yamanaka of japan and jamie thomson of the united states made an astounding discovery <unk> [MASK] they discovered[MASK] that adult cells <unk> taken from you and me <unk> could be reprogrammed[MASK] <unk> and so guess what scientists around the world and in the labs[MASK] are racing to convert aging adult cells[MASK] aging adult cells from you and me they are racing to reprogram these[MASK] <unk> in our lab we are focused on taking fat[MASK] and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells[MASK] cells that we may use to then form other more specialized cells <unk> which one day may be used as[MASK] <unk> if this research is successful it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice[MASK] human embryos <unk> [MASK] indeed there is a lot of hype <unk> but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions [MASK] heart disease stroke[MASK] <unk> spinal cord injury muscular

a robotic operation <unk> [MASK] but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room i realized that my left visual field[MASK] was fast collapsing into[MASK] <unk> darkness[MASK] earlier that week <unk> i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing yes i fell <unk> [MASK] and i started to see floaters and stars which i casually dismissed as too much <unk> high altitude sun exposure [MASK] what happened to me might have been catastrophic if not for the fact[MASK] that i was in reach of good surgical access <unk> and i had my vision restored[MASK] but not before a prolonged period of convalescence three months in a head down position this experience[MASK] taught me to empathize more with my patients and especially those with retinal diseases <unk>[MASK] thirty seven million people worldwide[MASK] are blind[MASK] <unk> and one hundred and twenty seven million more suffer from impaired vision stem <unk>[MASK] <unk> retinal transplants <unk> now in a research phase [MASK] may one day restore vision or part vision to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide <unk> [MASK] indeed we live in both challenging[MASK] as well as exciting times as the world population ages[MASK] <unk> scientists are racing to discover new ways[MASK] to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells <unk> it is a fact[MASK] that when our organs or tissues are injured [MASK] our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation and these stem cells[MASK] then float in the bloodstream and hone[MASK] <unk> in to damaged organs to release growth factors[MASK] to repair the damaged tissue [MASK] stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body [MASK] or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver [MASK] as we speak there are one hundred and seventeen or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver[MASK] <unk> diseases what lies ahead [MASK] heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide one point one million americans suffer heart attacks[MASK] yearly four point eight million suffer cardiac failure stem cells may be used to
