 <unk> looking deeply inside nature <unk> through the magnifying glass of science <unk> designers extract principles processes and materials[MASK] that are forming the very basis of design[MASK] <unk> synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials [MASK] to computational methods that emulate neural processes nature is driving design [MASK] design is also driving nature <unk> [MASK] in realms of genetics regenerative medicine and synthetic biology <unk> designers are growing novel technologies not foreseen or[MASK] <unk> the interplay between biology and design as you can see my legs are bionic <unk> [MASK] today i will tell human stories[MASK] of bionic integration how <unk>[MASK] attached to the body <unk> and implanted inside the body[MASK] are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability between[MASK] human limitation[MASK] and human potential bionics has defined my physicality [MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite incurred during a mountain climbing accident at[MASK] that time i didn 't view my body as broken <unk> [MASK] i reasoned that a human being[MASK] can never be[MASK] technology is broken technology is inadequate <unk> [MASK] this simple but powerful idea was a call to arms <unk> to advance technology[MASK] for the elimination of my own disability and ultimately the disability of others <unk> [MASK] i began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world[MASK] <unk> of rock and ice climbing i quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable able to take on any form <unk> any function[MASK] a blank slate[MASK] for which to create <unk> perhaps structures that could extend beyond biological capability <unk> [MASK] i made my height adjustable i could be as short as five feet or as tall as i 'd like[MASK] <unk> so when i was feeling[MASK] bad about myself <unk> insecure i would jack my height up [MASK] but when i was feeling confident and suave i would knock my height down a notch just to give the competition a chance [MASK] applause narrow edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures where the human foot cannot penetrate and spiked[MASK] enabled me to climb vertical ice walls without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue <unk> [MASK] through technological innovation <unk> i returned to my sport stronger and better technology had eliminated my disability [MASK] and allowed me a new climbing prowess as a young man i imagined a future world where technology[MASK] so advanced could rid the world of disability a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see [MASK] a world in which the paralyzed could walk via body exoskeletons <unk> [MASK] sadly because of deficiencies in technology disability is rampant in the world this gentleman is missing three limbs [MASK] as a testimony to current technology <unk> he is out of the wheelchair but we need to do a better job in bionics [MASK] to allow one day full rehabilitation for[MASK] <unk> a person with this level of injury at the mit media lab we 've established the center for extreme bionics the mission of the center[MASK] is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans across a broad range[MASK] <unk> 'm going to tell you how my legs function how they work as a[MASK] case in point for this center now i made sure to shave my legs last night because i knew i 'd be showing them off [MASK] bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces there 's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs mechanical how my limbs are attached to my[MASK] <unk> how they move like flesh and bone <unk> and electrical how they communicate with my nervous system i 'll begin with mechanical interface <unk> [MASK] in the area of design we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically <unk> [MASK] it 's extraordinary to me that in this day and age one of the most mature oldest technologies in the human timeline the[MASK] <unk> us blisters how can this be we have no idea how to attach things to our bodies <unk> this is the beautifully[MASK] lyrical design work of professor neri oxman at the mit media lab showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances shown here by color variation in this <unk>[MASK] model imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it when you need it for optimal support and flexibility[MASK] <unk> without ever causing discomfort [MASK] my bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations [MASK] that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics <unk> [MASK] to achieve that mirroring we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb to that end we used imaging tools such as mri <unk> to look inside my body to figure out the[MASK] <unk> geometries and locations of various tissues we also took robotic tools here 's a <unk>[MASK] circle that goes around the biological limb <unk> [MASK] the actuators come in find the surface of the limb measure its unloaded shape [MASK] and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point [MASK] we combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my[MASK] <unk> biological limb shown on the left you see a bunch of points or nodes at each node there 's a color that represents tissue compliance we then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin shown on the right <unk> [MASK] and we 've discovered optimality is where the body is stiff the synthetic skin should be soft where the body[MASK] is soft the synthetic skin is stiff and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances with[MASK] <unk> this framework we 've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs i 've ever worn <unk> clearly in the future [MASK] our clothing our shoes our braces our prostheses will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies but rather data driven quantitative frameworks in that future[MASK] <unk> our shoes will no longer give us blisters <unk> [MASK] we 're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins this is a material developed by sri international <unk> california [MASK] under electrostatic effect it changes stiffness <unk> so under zero voltage <unk> the material is compliant it 's floppy like paper then the button 's pushed a voltage is applied and it becomes stiff as a board[MASK] <unk> into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body [MASK] when i walk here it 's no voltage my interface is soft and compliant the button 's pushed voltage is applied and it stiffens offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb we[MASK] 're also building exoskeletons this exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle to protect the biological[MASK] <unk> joints from high impacts and degradation <unk> in the future we 'll all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities such as running <unk> [MASK] next <unk> dynamic interface how do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone [MASK] at my mit lab we study how humans with normal physiologies stand walk and run <unk> what are the muscles[MASK] <unk> and how are they controlled by the spinal cord [MASK] this basic science motivates what we build we 're building bionic ankles knees and hips we 're building body parts from the ground up [MASK] the bionic limbs that i 'm wearing[MASK] are called bioms they 've been fitted to nearly one thousand patients <unk> [MASK] four hundred of which have been wounded u s soldiers how does it work at heel strike under computer control[MASK] <unk> the system controls stiffness to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground then at mid stance the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person <unk>[MASK] <unk> into the walking stride comparable to how muscles work in the calf region [MASK] <unk> something[MASK] everyone should be able to do go up and down their steps at home [MASK] bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats here 's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway [MASK] this is steve martin not the comedian[MASK] who lost his legs in a bomb blast in afghanistan we 're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles that wrap around[MASK] <unk> the biological limb <unk> this gentleman does not have[MASK] any leg condition any disability <unk> he has a normal physiology <unk> so these exoskeletons are applying[MASK] <unk> and powers <unk> so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers <unk> [MASK] this is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking it[MASK] <unk> significantly reduces metabolic cost <unk> it 's so profound in its augmentation [MASK] that when a normal healthy person wears the device for forty minutes and then takes it off [MASK] their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward <unk> [MASK] we 're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and[MASK] faster and more efficient [MASK] moving on to electrical interface how do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system [MASK] across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles that 's communicated to the bionic limb <unk> so when i think about moving my phantom limb <unk> [MASK] the robot tracks those movement desires <unk> [MASK] this diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled[MASK] <unk> so we model the missing biological limb <unk> and we 've discovered what reflexes[MASK] occurred how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles and that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb <unk> [MASK] what we 've done then is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex <unk> the modeled spinal reflex with the neural signal <unk> [MASK] so when i relax my muscles[MASK] in my[MASK] <unk> i get very little torque and power but the more i fire my muscles the more torque i get and i can even run <unk> [MASK] and that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command[MASK] <unk> feels great [MASK] we want to go a step further we want to actually close the loop[MASK] between the human and the bionic external limb we 're doing[MASK] <unk> experiments where we 're growing nerves transected nerves <unk> through channels or micro channel arrays on the other side of the channel [MASK] the nerve then attaches to cells skin cells and muscle cells [MASK] in the motor channels we can sense how the person wishes to move that can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb <unk> [MASK] then [ sensory information ] on the bionic limb[MASK] can be converted to[MASK] <unk> channels <unk> sensory channels <unk> so when this is fully developed and for human use <unk> [MASK] persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like[MASK] flesh and bone <unk> but actually feel like flesh and bone <unk> this video shows lisa <unk> mallette shortly after being fitted with[MASK] <unk> bionics is making a profound difference in people 's lives[MASK] <unk> next week i 'm visiting the center for medicare and medicaid services[MASK] <unk> and i 'm going to try to convince cms to grant appropriate code language and pricing so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it thank you [MASK] it 's not well appreciated but over half of the world 's population suffers from some form[MASK] <unk> sensory or motor condition and because of poor technology too often conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life [MASK] basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights <unk> every person should have the right[MASK] to live life without disability if they so choose[MASK] the right to live life without severe depression the right to see a loved[MASK] <unk> the right to walk or to dance <unk> in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation [MASK] as a society we can achieve these human rights <unk> if we accept the proposition[MASK] that humans[MASK] are not disabled [MASK] a person can never be broken <unk> our built environment our technologies are broken and disabled[MASK] <unk> we the people need not accept our limitations [MASK] but can transcend disability through technological innovation <unk> indeed through fundamental advances in bionics in this century [MASK] we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience <unk> and we will end disability i 'd[MASK] like to finish up with one more story a beautiful story <unk> the story of[MASK] <unk> adrianne lost her left leg in the boston terrorist attack[MASK] <unk> met adrianne when this photo was taken at spaulding rehabilitation
