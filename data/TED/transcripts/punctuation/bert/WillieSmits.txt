 <unk> was walking in the market one day with my wife <unk> and somebody stuck a cage in my face and in between those slits[MASK] were the saddest eyes i 've ever seen there was a very sick orangutan baby my first encounter that evening i came back to the market in the dark and[MASK] and sure enough i found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap of[MASK] course the cage was salvaged i took up the little baby <unk> massaged her forced her to drink until she finally started[MASK] breathing normally <unk> this is uce she 's now living in the jungle of sungai wain <unk> and this is matahari her[MASK] <unk> by the way is also the son of the second orangutan i rescued <unk> dodoy [MASK] that changed my life quite dramatically and as of today <unk> i have almost one thousand babies in my two centers [MASK] applause no <unk> no no wrong [MASK] it 's horrible it 's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild it[MASK] 's not good <unk> this is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together[MASK] just now like victims for every baby six have disappeared from the forest <unk> [MASK] the deforestation <unk> especially for oil palm to provide biofuel for western countries is what 's causing these problems and those are the peat swamp forests on <unk>[MASK] twenty meters of peat the largest accumulation of organic material in the world when you open this for growing oil palms you 're creating[MASK] <unk> volcanoes that are emitting so much co2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world after china and the united <unk>[MASK] <unk> states <unk> and we don 't have any industry at all it 's only because of this deforestation <unk> and these are horrible images i 'm not going to talk too long about it [MASK] to live out there in the forest that still have to go through that process and i don 't know anymore where to put them so i decided that i had to come up with a solution for her[MASK] but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing in that way the loss of habitat and all those victims[MASK] <unk> so i created the place samboja lestari and the idea was [MASK] if i can do this on the worst possible place that i can think of where there is really nothing left <unk> [MASK] no one will have an excuse to say yeah but no everyone should be able to follow this so we 're in east borneo this is the place[MASK] <unk> i started as you can see there 's only yellow terrain there 's nothing left just a bit of grass there [MASK] in two thousand and two we had about fifty percent of the people jobless there there was a huge amount of crime people spent so much of their money on[MASK] health[MASK] issues and drinking water <unk> there was no agricultural productivity left this was the poorest district in the whole province and[MASK] it was a total extinction of wildlife this was like a biological desert when i stood there in the[MASK] <unk> grass it 's hot not even the sound of insects just this waving grass <unk> [MASK] still <unk> four years later we have created jobs for about three thousand people [MASK] the climate has changed i will show you no more flooding no more fires it 's no longer the poorest district and there is a huge development of biodiversity we 've got over one thousand species we have[MASK] <unk> as of today we have thirty species of reptiles so what happened here <unk> we created a huge economic failure in this forest [MASK] so basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm <unk> but[MASK] we saw the same thing we had slash and burn agriculture people cannot afford[MASK] <unk> so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there <unk> [MASK] the fires become more frequent <unk> and after a while you 're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left there are no trees left <unk> [MASK] still in this place <unk> in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill <unk> four years later <unk> there is this one green blop on the earth 's surface [MASK] <unk> all these people happy <unk> and there 's this economic value so how 's this possible it was quite simple <unk> if you 'll look at the steps we bought the land <unk> we dealt with the fire <unk> and then only we <unk>[MASK] <unk> started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary but we made sure <unk>[MASK] <unk> that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside[MASK] <unk> forces would be able to interfere with that the people would become the defenders of that forest so we do the people <unk> profit planet principles but we do it in addition <unk>[MASK] to a sure legal status because if the forest belongs to the state people say it belongs to me it belongs to everyone [MASK] <unk> what we did was we formulated recipes how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation <unk> you formulate a recipe based upon <unk>[MASK] the factors you can control whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the[MASK] you also have the cost you also know how much labor is needed <unk> if you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil on a clay soil on a steep slope on flat soil you put those different recipes if you combine them [MASK] out of that comes a business plan comes a work plan and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have and you can do it[MASK] <unk> this is how it looks like in practice we have this grass we want to get rid of it exudes [ unclear ] like compounds from the roots[MASK] the acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro climate to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses and after eight years they might actually yield <unk>[MASK] <unk> some timber that is if you can preserve it in the right way <unk> which we can do with bamboo peels it 's an old[MASK] temple building technique from japan but bamboo is very <unk>[MASK] <unk> so if we would plant that in the beginning we would[MASK] have a very high risk of losing everything again so we plant it later along the waterways to filter the water provide the raw products just in time <unk> for when the timber becomes available so the idea is [MASK] how to integrate these flows in space over time and with the limited means you have so[MASK] <unk> plant the trees we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between to reduce the competition for the trees <unk> the crop fertilizer organic material is useful <unk>[MASK] <unk> for the agricultural crops for the people but also helps the trees the farmers have free land [MASK] <unk> regeneration while even saving some money <unk> so beautiful what a theory but is it really that easy not really because if you looked at what happened <unk>[MASK] the fire started this is an area of about fifty million hectares <unk> january <unk> february <unk> [MASK] march <unk> [MASK] april <unk> may <unk> we lost five point five million hectares in just a matter of a few months <unk> this is because we have ten thousand of those[MASK] <unk> fires that you also have in pennsylvania here in the united states and once the soil gets dried you 're in a dry season you get cracks oxygen goes in flames come out and the problem starts all <unk>[MASK] <unk> over again so how to break that cycle fire is the biggest problem this is what it looked like for three months for three months the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark <unk> we lost all the crops no[MASK] <unk> children gained weight for over a year they lost twelve iq points it was a disaster for orangutans and people <unk> so these fires are really the first things to work on [MASK] <unk> that was why i put it as a single point up there and you need the local people for that because these grasslands once they start burning <unk> it goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall going to the sea[MASK] killing off the coral reefs there <unk> [MASK] so you have to do it with the local people [MASK] that is the short term solution but you also need a long term solution so what we did is we created a ring of sugar palms around the area <unk> these sugar palms turn out to be fire resistant also <unk>[MASK] <unk> by the way and they provide a lot of income for local people this is what it looks like the people have to tap them[MASK] <unk> twice a day just a millimeter slice and the only thing you harvest is sugar water <unk> [MASK] carbon dioxide <unk> rain fall and a little bit of sunshine <unk> [MASK] in principle you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells <unk> [MASK] and you can create so much energy from this they produce three times more energy per hectare per year <unk> because you can tap them on a daily basis you don 't need to harvest[MASK] unclear ] or any other of the crops <unk> so this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics which is still unexploited and doing it in combination <unk>[MASK] <unk> with technology but also your legal side needs to be in very good order <unk> so we bought that land [MASK] <unk> and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil and we were actually monitoring measuring <unk>[MASK] every single tree in these two thousand hectares five thousand acres <unk> [MASK] <unk> the ground it can make better use of the available light it can store more carbon in the system it can provide more functions but it 's more complicated <unk> it 's not that simple and you have to work with the people <unk> [MASK] <unk> just like nature <unk> we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that we grow the slower growing[MASK] <unk> forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light then [MASK] what is just as important get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within twenty four hours <unk> [MASK] and they become like nutrient pumps you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen and[MASK] without those microorganisms you won[MASK] <unk> any performance at all <unk> [MASK] and then we started planting only one thousand trees a day we could have planted many many more but we didn 't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable we didn 't want to lose the people that[MASK] are going to work in that plantation <unk> and we do a lot of work here we use indicator plants to look at what soil types or what vegetables[MASK] <unk> what trees will grow here <unk> [MASK] and we have monitored every single one of those trees from space <unk> this is what it looks like in reality you have this irregular ring around it with strips of <unk>[MASK] <unk> one hundred meters wide with sugar palms that can provide income for six hundred and forty eight families it 's only a small part of the area <unk> the nursery in here is quite different <unk> if you look at[MASK] <unk> the number of tree species we have in europe for instance from the urals up to england you know how many[MASK] in this nursery we 're going to grow ten times more than the number of species can you imagine you do need to know what you are working with but it 's that diversity <unk>[MASK] which makes it work that you can go from this zero situation <unk> by planting the vegetables and the trees or directly the trees in the lines in that grass there <unk> putting up the buffer zone producing your[MASK] <unk> compost <unk> [MASK] and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used in the beginning maybe pineapples and beans and corn in the second phase there will be bananas and papayas later on there will be[MASK] chocolate and chilies and then slowly the trees start taking over bringing in produce from the fruits from the timber [MASK] from the fuel wood and finally the sugar palm forest[MASK] takes over and provides the people with permanent income [MASK] on the top left <unk> underneath those green stripes you see some white dots those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space <unk> [MASK] and in that area we started growing some[MASK] acacia trees that you just saw before so this is after one year <unk> and this is after two years [MASK] and that 's green if you look from the tower[MASK] <unk> this is when we start attacking the grass we plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas the papayas all the crops for the local people but the trees are growing up fast in between as well <unk> [MASK] and three years later one hundred and thirty seven species of birds are living here [MASK] so we lowered air temperature three to five degrees celsius air humidity[MASK] <unk> is up ten percent cloud cover i 'm going to show it to you is up rainfall is up and all these species and income <unk> [MASK] this ecolodge that i built here three years before was an empty yellow field <unk> [MASK] this transponder that we operate with the european space agency it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon[MASK] <unk> the forest is developing <unk> [MASK] and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation we can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and <unk>[MASK] <unk> the same technology we actually have it already with google earth if you would use a little bit of your[MASK] <unk> sustainably produced which company is stealing the timber and you could save so much more carbon than with any[MASK] measure of saving energy here <unk> [MASK] so this is the samboja lestari area you measure how the trees grow back <unk> [MASK] but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back and biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced how many[MASK] medicines can be kept here[MASK] and finally i made it into the rain machine because[MASK] this forest is now creating its own rain this nearby city of balikpapan has a big problem with water <unk> it 's eighty percent surrounded by seawater and we have now a lot of intrusion there <unk> [MASK] now we looked at the clouds above this forest we looked at the reforestation area [MASK] <unk> area and the open area and look at these images [MASK] i 'll just run them very quickly through in the tropics <unk> raindrops are not formed from ice crystals which is the case in the temperate zones you need the trees with [ unclear ] chemicals <unk>[MASK] <unk> that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops <unk> so you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate <unk> and you have the trees to initiate the rain <unk> and look [MASK] <unk> after three years <unk> if you look at rainfall it was already up twenty percent at that time let 's look at the next year <unk> and you can see that that trend is continuing where <unk>[MASK] at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall that cap is now widening and getting higher <unk> [MASK] <unk> it used to be the driest place but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there so you can actually change the climate when there are <unk>[MASK] <unk> trade winds of course the effect disappears <unk> but afterwards as soon as the wind stabilizes <unk> you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above <unk>[MASK] <unk> this area <unk> so to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do because we actually can make that difference[MASK] <unk> if you integrate the various technologies <unk> [MASK] and it 's nice to have the science but it still depends mostly upon the people on your education we have our farmer schools <unk> [MASK] but the real success of course is our band because if a baby is born we will play so everyone 's our family and you don 't make trouble with your family <unk> [MASK] <unk> we have this road going around the area which brings the people electricity and water from our own area we have the zone with the sugar palms and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans[MASK] that we provide with a place to live in the middle and the people apart and inside we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material <unk>[MASK] <unk> alive because for the last twelve years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up[MASK] <unk> because the climatic triggers have disappeared all the seeds get eaten <unk> so now we do the monitoring on the inside from towers satellites ultralights <unk> [MASK] each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back and it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees you have the shade trees planted in year one then <unk>[MASK] <unk> you underplanted with the sugar palms and you plant this thorny fence <unk> and after a few years[MASK] <unk> can remove some of those shade trees the people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel <unk> and they can build a house they have some fuel wood to cook <unk>[MASK] <unk> with and they can start producing from the trees as many as they like they have enough income for three families <unk> [MASK] <unk> cultural values there is no simple one recipe for one place you also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt that it 's transparent [MASK] like here in samboja lestari <unk> we divide that ring in groups of twenty families <unk> if one member trespasses the agreement and does cut down[MASK] <unk> the other nineteen members have to decide what 's going to happen to him if the group doesn 't take action the other thirty three groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn 't comply <unk>[MASK] with those great deals that we are offering them in north sulawesi it is the cooperative they have a democratic culture there <unk> so there you can use the local justice system <unk>[MASK] <unk> to protect your system in summary if you look at it in year one the people can sell their land to get income but they get jobs back in the construction[MASK] <unk> and the reforestation the working with the orangutans and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft they also get free land in between the trees where they can grow their crops they can now <unk>[MASK] sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project they get building material for houses a contract for selling the sugar so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally they get all these other benefits[MASK] <unk> money they get education it 's a great deal and everything is based upon that one thing[MASK] make sure that forest remains there <unk> [MASK] so if we want to help the orangutans what i actually set out to do we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit [MASK] now i think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer is integration[MASK] <unk> i hope if you want to know more[MASK]
