 <unk> two years ago here at ted i reported[MASK] that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small[MASK] saturnine[MASK] <unk> moon enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in the cassini image taken in two thousand and five [MASK] this is the south polar region with the famous <unk> tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole <unk> and seen just recently in late two thousand and eight here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere[MASK] is experiencing the onset of august and eventually winter <unk> and i also reported that we 'd made this[MASK] once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole <unk> consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane [MASK] and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the[MASK] <unk> surface but we weren 't really sure <unk> [MASK] however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself[MASK] were so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on enceladus we 've flown the cassini spacecraft[MASK] by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these[MASK] <unk> jets into the denser regions of these jets so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements <unk> and we have found that the organic compounds coming from <unk>[MASK] this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported while they 're not amino acids we 're now finding things like propane and benzene[MASK] <unk> hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde [MASK] and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from[MASK] pockets of liquid water but that that liquid water is in contact with rock <unk> [MASK] and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain[MASK] <unk> we are very encouraged by these results [MASK] and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon [MASK] under the south pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms [MASK] whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter <unk> and that will have to await the arrival back[MASK] at[MASK] <unk> of the spacecrafts <unk> hopefully some time in the near future <unk> specifically equipped[MASK] to address that particular question but in the meantime i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to[MASK] the saturnine system and visit the enceladus interplanetary geyser park just because we can <unk> thank you[MASK]
