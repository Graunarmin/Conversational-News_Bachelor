 <unk> i was sitting with my girls and joy said dang [MASK] i wish he 'd get off my back my daddy <unk> he calls me all the time lucky for you he calls at all[MASK] <unk> from my dad in years at this moment <unk> i knew the girls needed a way[MASK] to connect with their fathers [MASK] at camp diva my <unk> non profit organization we have these types of conversations all the time[MASK] as a way to help girls of african descent prepare for their passage into womanhood these girls[MASK] just needed[MASK] a way to invite their fathers into their lives[MASK] on their own terms <unk> so i asked the girls how can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers[MASK] <unk> quickly backed her up <unk> they started dreaming about the decorations <unk> [MASK] invitations the dresses they were going to wear <unk> and what their fathers could and could not wear [MASK] it was off and running before i could even blink my eyes but even if i could have slowed down those[MASK] <unk> wouldn 't have because one thing that i have learned from over a decade of working with girls[MASK] is that they already know what they need the[MASK] wisdom lives inside of them [MASK] as long as they have infrastructure <unk> mentorship and resources <unk> they can build[MASK] what they need not only to[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] we had a dance[MASK] <unk> and girls and their fathers came in multitudes <unk> they were dressed to the nines <unk> [MASK] they acted sweet [MASK] they acted silly <unk> they really enjoyed each other 's company it was a huge success[MASK] <unk> and the girls decided to make it an annual event [MASK] so as the seasons changed <unk> and it was time to plan the dance again one girl named brianna spoke up <unk> [MASK] and she said [MASK] my dad can 't come to the dance <unk> and this whole thing[MASK] <unk> can he just get out for a day one of the girls asked [MASK] and come in shackles [MASK] that 's worse than not having him here at all at this moment[MASK] <unk> i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion[MASK] and to become their own heroes <unk> so i asked what do you think we should do about this [MASK] we want every girl to experience the dance <unk> right [MASK] so the girls thought for a moment <unk> and one girl suggested why don 't we just take the dance in the jail [MASK] <unk> to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in spongebob suits because that 's what they called them[MASK] <unk> a letter was written to the richmond city sheriff <unk> signed collectively by each girl [MASK] and i would have to say he is a very special sheriff <unk> he contacted me immediately[MASK] and said <unk> whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside[MASK] <unk> his doors are always open <unk> [MASK] because one thing he did know that when fathers are connected to their children it is less likely that they will return <unk> [MASK] so <unk> sixteen inmates[MASK] and eighteen girls were invited the girls were dressed in their sunday best[MASK] and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties [MASK] they hugged they shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish <unk> [MASK] they laughed together it was beautiful[MASK] <unk> the fathers and daughters[MASK] even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection [MASK] something that a lot of them didn 't even have for a while fathers were in a space where they were[MASK] able to make their daughters play <unk> and pull out her chair[MASK] and extend his hand for a[MASK] <unk> dance even the guards cried <unk> but[MASK] after the dance we all realized that[MASK] dad still would be in jail <unk> [MASK] so we needed to create something that they could take with them <unk> [MASK] so we brought in flip cams and we had them look at the[MASK] flip cams and just interview each other[MASK] <unk> messages their thoughts this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other[MASK] and feel disconnected they could reconnect[MASK] through this image i 'll never forget[MASK] that one girl looked in her father 's eyes with that camera and said daddy when you look at me what[MASK] do you see [MASK] because our daddies[MASK] are our mirrors[MASK] that we reflect back on[MASK] when we decide about what type of man we deserve <unk> and how they see us for the rest of our lives [MASK] i know that[MASK] <unk> was one of the lucky girls i have had[MASK] my father[MASK] in my life always [MASK] he 's even here today [MASK] and that is why it is extremely special[MASK] <unk> special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers especially those who are separated[MASK] because of barbed wires and metal doors we have just created a form[MASK] for girls who have heavy questions on their heart[MASK] to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions[MASK] and given the fathers the freedom to answer because we know[MASK] that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought what type of woman[MASK] am i preparing to put in the world <unk> because a father is locked in[MASK] <unk> not mean he should be locked out of his daughter 's life[MASK]
