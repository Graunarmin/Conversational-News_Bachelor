 <unk> in the space that used to house one transistor we can now fit one billion [MASK] that made it so that a computer the size of an entire room now fits in your[MASK] <unk> you might say the future is small [MASK] as an engineer <unk> i 'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers [MASK] as a physician i wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost[MASK] due to one of the <unk>[MASK] <unk> diseases on earth cancer <unk> [MASK] now when i say that what most people hear me say is that we 're working on curing cancer <unk> and we are but it turns out that there[MASK] <unk> 's an incredible opportunity to save lives through the early detection and prevention of cancer <unk> [MASK] worldwide over two thirds of deaths due to cancer are fully preventable using methods that we already have in hand today <unk> [MASK] things like vaccination <unk> timely screening and of course <unk> stopping smoking <unk> [MASK] but even with the best tools and technologies that we have today[MASK] <unk> tumors can 't be detected until ten years[MASK] after they 've started growing when they are fifty million cancer cells strong [MASK] what if we had better technologies to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner when they could be removed when they were just getting started [MASK] let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there [MASK] this is a microscope in a typical lab[MASK] that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen like a biopsy or a pap smear [MASK] this $ seven thousand microscope would be used by somebody with years of specialized training to spot cancer cells [MASK] this is an image from a colleague of mine at rice university <unk> rebecca richards kortum what she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope into this $ ten[MASK] <unk> part <unk> and it fits on the end of an optical fiber <unk> [MASK] now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient and sending it to the microscope you can bring the microscope to the patient [MASK] and then instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images you can train the computer to score normal[MASK] <unk> versus cancerous cells <unk> [MASK] now this is important <unk> because what they found working in rural communities is that even when they have a mobile screening van that can go out into the community and perform <unk>[MASK] <unk> exams and collect samples and send them to the central hospital for analysis [MASK] because they can 't afford the trip <unk>[MASK] with the integrated microscope and computer analysis rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment <unk>[MASK] <unk> setup and what that means is that they can do a diagnosis and perform therapy on the spot so no one is lost to follow up [MASK] <unk> now as engineers we think of this as straight up miniaturization you took a big thing and you made it little [MASK] but what i told you before about computers was that they transformed our lives when they became small enough for us to take them everywhere <unk> [MASK] so what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine <unk> [MASK] well <unk> [MASK] what if you had a detector that was so small that it could circulate in your body <unk> find the tumor all by itself[MASK] and send a signal to the outside world [MASK] it sounds a little bit like science fiction <unk> but actually <unk> nanotechnology allows us to do just that [MASK] nanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector from the width of a human hair <unk> which is one hundred microns to a thousand times smaller[MASK] <unk> which is one hundred nanometers <unk> and that has profound implications [MASK] it turns out that materials actually change their properties at the nanoscale [MASK] you take a common material like gold <unk> and you grind it into dust into gold nanoparticles and it changes from looking gold to looking red [MASK] if you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide forms a big black crystal[MASK] if you make nanocrystals out of this material and[MASK] <unk> put it in a liquid <unk> and you shine light on it [MASK] they glow and they glow blue green <unk> yellow <unk> orange <unk> red <unk> depending only on their size it[MASK] 's wild can you imagine an object like that in the macro world it would be like all the denim jeans in your closet[MASK] are all made of cotton <unk> but they are different colors[MASK] <unk> colors depending only on their size [MASK] so as a physician what 's just as interesting to me is that it 's not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale [MASK] the way they travel in your body also changes [MASK] and this is the kind of observation that we 're going to use to make a better cancer detector <unk> so let me show you what i mean[MASK] this is a blood vessel in the body <unk> surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor we[MASK] 're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel and watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor <unk> [MASK] now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor [MASK] whether they leak out depends on their[MASK] <unk> size <unk> so in this image the smaller hundred nanometer blue nanoparticles are leaking out and the larger <unk>[MASK] <unk> red nanoparticles are stuck in the bloodstream <unk> [MASK] so that means as an engineer <unk> depending on how big or small i make a material i can change where it goes in your body [MASK] in my lab we recently made[MASK] <unk> cancer nanodetector that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors [MASK] we designed it to listen for tumor invasion the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread [MASK] for a tumor to break out of the tissue that it 's born in it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues[MASK] we designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes [MASK] one enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour <unk> now in engineering we call that <unk>[MASK] ratio a form of amplification and it makes something ultrasensitive so[MASK] <unk> but how do i get this activated signal to the outside world where i can act on it [MASK] for this we 're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology <unk> and that has to do with the kidney[MASK] the kidney is a filter its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine [MASK] it turns out that what the kidney filters is also dependent on size[MASK] <unk> in this image what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood through the kidney into the urine <unk> [MASK] and everything else that 's bigger is retained <unk> [MASK] ok <unk> so if i make[MASK] <unk> 100 nanometer cancer detector i inject it in the bloodstream it can leak into the tumor where it 's activated by tumor enzymes[MASK] <unk> to release a small signal that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine [MASK] i have a signal in the outside world that i can detect <unk> [MASK] ok but there 's one more problem this is a tiny little signal so how do i detect it well the signal is just a[MASK] <unk> they 're molecules that we designed as engineers they 're completely synthetic <unk> and we can design them so they are compatible with our tool of choice [MASK] if we want to use a really sensitive <unk> fancy instrument called a mass spectrometer then we make a molecule with a unique mass [MASK] or maybe we want make something that 's more inexpensive and portable <unk> [MASK] then we make molecules that we can trap on paper like a pregnancy test in fact there 's a whole world of[MASK] <unk> paper tests that are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics alright where are we going with this [MASK] what i 'm going to tell you next as a lifelong researcher <unk> represents a dream of mine i can 't say that 's it 's a promise it 's a dream <unk> [MASK] but i think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward even and maybe especially cancer researchers[MASK] i 'm going to tell you what i hope will happen with my technology that my team and i will <unk>[MASK] <unk> put our hearts and souls into making a reality <unk> ok here goes <unk> i dream[MASK] that one day <unk> instead of going into an expensive screening facility[MASK] to get a colonoscopy or a mammogram <unk> or a pap smear that you could get a shot[MASK] wait an hour <unk> and do a urine test on a paper strip <unk> i imagine[MASK] that this could even happen without the need for steady electricity <unk> or a medical professional in the room [MASK] maybe they could be far away and connected only by the image on a smartphone <unk> [MASK] now i know this sounds like a dream but in the lab we already have this working in mice where it works better than[MASK] <unk> existing methods for the detection of lung <unk> colon and ovarian cancer and i hope that what this means is that one day[MASK] we can detect tumors in patients sooner than ten years after they 've started growing [MASK] in all walks of life all around the globe <unk> and that this would lead to earlier treatments <unk> and that we could save more lives[MASK] <unk> lives than we can today <unk> with early detection thank you[MASK]
