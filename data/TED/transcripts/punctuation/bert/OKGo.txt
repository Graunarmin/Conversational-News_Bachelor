 <unk> 's eyes[MASK] <unk> we are ok go and[MASK] we 've been together as a band since one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight [MASK] but in the last decade we 've become known as much for the elaborate music videos like the one we just saw as for the songs they accompany <unk> so we will play[MASK] <unk> along with another one of those in a few minutes but in the meantime we want to address this question that we get asked all the time[MASK] but we <unk> we 've really never come up with an adequate answer for it and that is how do we think of those ideas <unk> [MASK] the videos are not all rube goldberg machines by the way last year we did a dance in zero gravity <unk> and once we set up[MASK] an obstacle course out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert and then played them by stunt driving a car through them for one of the videos we[MASK] <unk> choreographed hundreds of people with umbrellas in an abandoned parking lot outside tokyo <unk> and then[MASK] filmed them from a drone a half a mile in the air <unk> so it 's all of these ideas that people are curious about [MASK] and the reason we 've had so much trouble describing how we think of these ideas is that it doesn 't really feel like we think of them at all [MASK] it feels like we find them [MASK] and by way of explanation[MASK] well i have[MASK] a compulsive habit i play[MASK] parallax and perspective games with my eyes pretty much all the time and it 's something i 've been doing since i was a teenager and i think the big contributing factor may have been that this is how i decorated my high school bedroom [MASK] laughter and being a teenager what[MASK] <unk> i did in there of course was just talk on the phone for[MASK] staggering amounts of time so i was in this visual maelstrom just pretty much usually sitting in one place <unk> and[MASK] i guess just the overload in general my my brain kind of tried to make sense of it and i would[MASK] if i could move my head off to one side a little bit the edge of the desk would line up just perfectly with that poster on the opposite wall or if i put my thumb out i could close first my left eye and then my right <unk> and my thumb would bounce back and forth between jimi hendrix 's left eye[MASK] and his right it was not a conscious thing of course this is just[MASK] kind of the equivalent of doodling while you 're talking <unk> and it 's still something i do all the time this is my wife kristin [MASK] yeah woo [MASK] and it 's not uncommon that we are out at dinner and in the middle of a great conversation she 'll just stop <unk> mid sentence and when she stops is when i[MASK] <unk> that i 'm the one who 's acting weird because i 'm like bobbing and weaving and what i 'm trying to do is get that ficus back there to stick out of her head like a ponytail [MASK] laughter the point of telling you all this is that for me this is what it feels like to have an idea it 's like they 're made of these disparate[MASK] parts these disparate chunks sort of floating out there and if[MASK] <unk> and crucially if you 're in exactly the right place you can get them to just[MASK] line up <unk> so if you get used to if it 's your job to think of ideas this way they 'll start[MASK] beckoning to you the way that jimi 's eyes beckoned from that poster or the ficus beckons from behind kristin 's head[MASK] writing music feels like that process just over and over again like you 've got a[MASK] bunch of sounds or a groove or a chord progression and you 're just looking for that[MASK] thing on the other side [MASK] that little chunk over there that puzzle piece that clicks right in and when it does click <unk> it doesn 't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece it feels like[MASK] you found it like like it was a set of relationships that you unlocked <unk> [MASK] but with the videos in particular <unk> we 're usually looking for this specific feeling which is wonder <unk> and there 's always a component of surprise to wonder[MASK] <unk> so we 're not just looking for good ideas we 're looking for good ideas that surprise us in some way <unk> and this causes something of a problem <unk> because [MASK] the process that we all use to make stuff it actually has a very strong bias against surprising ideas the process i 'm talking about is the one you all know we all do it all the time [MASK] you think of an idea you just sit and think of your brilliant idea and then you come up with a plan[MASK] <unk> for how you 're going to make that idea happen and then with that plan in mind you go back and double check your original idea and maybe revise it and then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan the plan and the idea eventually you come up with a truly great plan [MASK] and then once you have that and only then do you go out[MASK] and you execute <unk> and this is like[MASK] <unk> this is sort of a flawless system in terms of maximizing your resources because this[MASK] super cheap <unk> [MASK] thinking usually costs very little but this is really expensive most of the time so by the time you get there you want to make sure you 're super prepared and you can squeeze every last drop out of what you 've got <unk> [MASK] but there are problems with this and math will help us reveal the biggest one [MASK] go back to that video[MASK] that we just showed you that rube goldberg machine it had about one hundred and thirty interactions in it that was one[MASK] <unk> hundred and thirty things[MASK] that we had to have go according to our plan <unk> so let 's let 's assume that we want to make a new video now similarly complex one hundred and thirty moving parts [MASK] if we 're really good planners in that system it seems like[MASK] maybe we could be good enough to get every part of that system to be ninety percent reliable <unk> ninety percent sounds good right[MASK] <unk> well <unk> it 's not it 's terrible actually the numbers say so [MASK] the chance of getting all one hundred and thirty things to not fail at the same time is 9 for ninety percent to the 130th power so calculate that out and you get[MASK] <unk> literally one in a million [MASK] i mean that 's not a gamble i want to take so let 's ratchet up that reliability to ninety nine percent <unk>[MASK] <unk> power is[MASK] <unk> percent significantly less daunting like this might even[MASK] be usable but really think about that how many parts of your lives are <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent reliable <unk> and could you really get one hundred and thirty of them all in one place at once and if you really could [MASK] doesn 't it seem like you deserve to succeed like that is[MASK] that thing is going to work right but no <unk> it actually fails three times more often than it succeeds so the upshot of all this is that[MASK] <unk> if your project is pretty complex like [MASK] you know every ambitious project is if you 've got a lot of moving parts you 're basically constrained to just reshuffling[MASK] ideas that have already demonstrably proven that they 're one hundred percent reliable <unk> [MASK] so now go back to me sitting with my thumb in the air trying to line up something surprising [MASK] if the only things i 'm allowed to consider in the first place are ideas that have already been done over and over and over again i am screwed[MASK] however there are ways around this because we all know that there are tons of untried ideas still out there and plenty of them will turn out to be every bit as reliable as we need it 's just that we don 't yet know they are reliable when we are at this planning phase <unk> [MASK] so what we do is we try to identify some place where there might just be a ton of those untried ideas we try to find a sandbox[MASK] <unk> gamble a whole bunch of our resources on getting in that sandbox and playing [MASK] because we have to trust that it 's the process in the sandbox that will reveal to us which ideas are not only surprising but surprisingly reliable <unk> [MASK] so some of the sandboxes that we 've started videos with [MASK] let 's play[MASK] with optical illusions let 's try to dance on moving surfaces let 's[MASK] <unk> 's try to make toast with a laser cutter or[MASK] let 's do something in one of those zero gravity airplanes but then instead of actually trying to sit there and think out what that something is we spent a full third of our budget <unk>[MASK] getting in an actual vomit comet and bouncing off the walls for a week <unk> [MASK] <unk> at this point we don 't yet know what our idea is we don 't have a plan[MASK] to be testing <unk> so we 're[MASK] just we 're just playing we 're just trying everything we can think of because we need to get this idea space filled up with a chaos like the one in my high school bedroom <unk> [MASK] because then if we can do the bob and weave thing if we can put our thumbs up and get just a few things to line up[MASK] <unk> are no one else has ever made those same things line up before <unk> and when we 're done with that project people will ask us again how we thought of that idea and we 'll be stumped <unk> because[MASK] from our perspective it doesn 't feel like we thought of it at all it just feels like we found it [MASK] so we 'll play another video for you now and the song along with it this is for the song the one moment and for this one the sandbox was[MASK] ballistics and math[MASK] i spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this it was like my playspace was four hundred lines long and twenty five columns wide[MASK] which i presume that if anybody is going to understand that it 's this crowd nothing is better than a giant spreadsheet right well [MASK] <unk> very much we are ok go and this is called the one moment[MASK] <unk> reclaims our footprints <unk> and while our bones keep looking back at the overgrowth that 's swallowing the path[MASK] <unk> the grace of god go[MASK] <unk> we remember and this will be the one moment[MASK]
