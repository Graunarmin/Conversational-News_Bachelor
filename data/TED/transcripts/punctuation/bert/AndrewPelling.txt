 <unk> i 've got a confession <unk> [MASK] i love looking through people 's garbage[MASK] <unk> now it 's not some creepy thing <unk> i 'm usually just looking for old electronics stuff i can take to my workshop and hack <unk> <unk> [MASK] <unk> each one 's got three different motors <unk> so now you can build things that move <unk> there 's switches so you can turn things on and off there 's even a freaking laser so you can make a cool robot[MASK] into an awesome robot [MASK] now i 've built a lot of stuff out of garbage <unk> and some of these things have even been kind of useful <unk> but here 's the thing for[MASK] <unk> is just a chance to play to be creative and build things to amuse myself this is what i love doing <unk> so i just made it part of my day job <unk> [MASK] i lead a <unk> university based biological research lab where we value curiosity and exploration above all else we aren 't focused on any particular problem <unk> and we 're not <unk>[MASK] <unk> trying to solve any particular disease this is just a place where people can come and ask fascinating questions and find answers <unk> [MASK] <unk> i challenge people to build the equipment they need out of the garbage i find it 's a great way to foster creativity <unk> [MASK] and what happened was that artists and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just because we value unconventional ideas it 's because we test and validate them with scientific rigor <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] one day i was[MASK] <unk> it apart and i had this sudden idea [MASK] could i treat biology like hardware <unk> could i dismantle a biological system mix and match the parts and then put it back together in some new and creative way[MASK] my lab started working on this and i want to show you the result [MASK] can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is[MASK] <unk> now <unk> i actually want you to notice as well that this is a lot redder than most apples <unk> and that 's because we grew human cells into it we took[MASK] a totally innocent macintosh apple removed all the apple cells and dna[MASK] and then implanted human cells and what we 're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold this is the stuff that gives plants their[MASK] <unk> shape and texture <unk> and these little holes that you can see this is where all the apple cells used to be [MASK] so then we come along we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue <unk> what happens is these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold[MASK] as weird as this is [MASK] it 's actually really reminiscent of how our own[MASK] <unk> you can implant these scaffolds into the body and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive [MASK] this is the point when people started asking me andrew can you make body parts out of apples [MASK] and i 'm like you 've come to the right place i actually brought this up with my wife she 's a musical instrument maker <unk> and she does a lot of wood[MASK] <unk> carving for a living so i asked her [MASK] could you like <unk> literally carve some ears out of an apple for us and she did <unk> so[MASK] i took her ears to the lab we then started preparing them <unk> yeah i know laughter[MASK] it 's a good lab man [MASK] and then we grew cells on them[MASK] and this is the result <unk> listen my lab is not in the[MASK] business <unk> [MASK] people have actually been working on this for decades here 's the issue <unk> [MASK] commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic <unk> because they 're sourced from proprietary products animals or cadavers[MASK] we used an apple[MASK] and it cost pennies[MASK] <unk> what 's also really cool here is it 's not that hard to make these things [MASK] the equipment you need can be built from garbage and the key processing step only requires soap and water <unk> [MASK] so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source [MASK] and then we[MASK] <unk> founded a mission driven company <unk> and we 're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home what i 'm really curious <unk>[MASK] <unk> about is if one day it will be possible to repair rebuild and augment our own bodies[MASK] <unk> they 're tasty and they make your pee smell funny [MASK] now <unk> i was in my kitchen <unk> and i was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus what you can see are all these tiny little vessels [MASK] and when we image them in the lab you can see how the cellulose forms these structures [MASK] this image reminds me of two things our blood vessels[MASK] and the structure and organization of our nerves[MASK] and spinal cord <unk> so here 's the question [MASK] can we grow axons and neurons down these channels because if we can then maybe we can use asparagus[MASK] to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves or maybe even a spinal cord <unk>[MASK] <unk> don 't get me wrong this is exceptionally challenging and really hard work to do and we are not the only ones working on this [MASK] but we are the only ones using asparagus laughter[MASK] right now we 've got really promising pilot data and we 're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons to find out what 's actually possible [MASK] so listen all of the work i 've shown[MASK] <unk> the stuff that i 've built that 's all around me on this stage and the other projects my lab is involved in are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage [MASK] play[MASK] play[MASK] is a key part of my scientific practice it 's how i train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative[MASK] and to decide to make human apple ears so the next time[MASK] <unk> i want you to think of me <unk> [MASK] because i want it seriously <unk> please find any way to get in touch with me <unk> and let 's see what we can build [MASK] thank you[MASK]
