 <unk> i walked into a prison in cambodia and i met a 12 year old boy[MASK] who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel <unk> and as i looked into his eyes i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written[MASK] for political prisoners[MASK] <unk> that i would never have written a letter for him <unk> [MASK] because he was not a <unk> 12 year old boy who had done something important for anybody he was not a political prisoner he was a <unk> 12 year old boy[MASK] who had stolen a bicycle what i also realized at that point was that it was not only cambodia <unk> but of the one hundred and thirteen developing[MASK] <unk> these countries have all passed laws[MASK] that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity[MASK] for us as a world community to come together[MASK] and end torture as an investigative tool we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent of torture today is not for political prisoners it is for people[MASK] who are in broken down legal systems <unk> and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation it 's cheaper than having a legal system cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel[MASK] it is what happens most of the time [MASK] i believe today that it is possible for us as a world community if we make a decision to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in[MASK] <unk> our lifetime <unk> [MASK] but it will require three things <unk> first is the training <unk> empowerment and connection of defenders worldwide <unk> the second[MASK] is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel <unk> and the third is commitment <unk> so in the year two thousand[MASK] <unk> i began to[MASK] wonder what if we came together could we do something for these ninety three countries <unk> [MASK] and i founded international bridges to justice[MASK] which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool[MASK] and implementing due process rights in the ninety three countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in[MASK] <unk> did come from cambodia and at the time i remember first coming to cambodia and there were in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four still less than ten attorneys in the country[MASK] because the khmer rouge had killed them all and even twenty years later there was only ten lawyers in the country so consequently you 'd walk into a prison and[MASK] not only would you meet 12 year old boys you 'd meet women and you 'd say why are you here women would say well i 've been here for ten years because my husband committed a crime but they can 't find him[MASK] <unk> place where there was no rule of law the first group of defenders came together and i still remember [MASK] as i was training i said okay what do you do for an investigation [MASK] and there was silence in the class and finally one woman stood up [ inaudible name ] and she said khrew which means teacher [MASK] she said i have defended[MASK] more than[MASK] a hundred[MASK] <unk> i 've never had to do any investigation because they all come with confessions [MASK] and we talked about as a class the fact that number one <unk> the confessions might not be reliable <unk> [MASK] but number two we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this <unk> especially as it was now against the law <unk> [MASK] and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other[MASK] in implementing these laws <unk> and i still remember the first cases where they[MASK] <unk> came all twenty five together she would stand up and they were in the back <unk> and they would support her <unk> and the judges kept saying no no no no we 're going to do things[MASK] the exact same way we 've been doing them but one day the perfect case came and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller she was sitting outside of a house [MASK] she said she actually saw the person[MASK] run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was but the police came they got her there was nothing on her[MASK] she was pregnant at the time she had cigarette burns on her she 'd miscarried <unk> [MASK] and when they brought her case to the judge for the first time he stood up and he said yes there 's no evidence except for your torture confession[MASK] and you will be released and the defenders[MASK] began to take cases over and over again and you will see they have step by step began to change the course of history in cambodia[MASK] <unk> cambodia is not alone i used to think well is it cambodia <unk> or is it other countries <unk> [MASK] but it is in so many countries in burundi i walked into a prison and it wasn 't a[MASK] <unk> diapers[MASK] and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison and when i walked up to the prison director i said you 've got to let her out [MASK] a judge would let her out and he said okay <unk> we can talk about it but look at my prison <unk> [MASK] eighty percent[MASK] of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer what can we do so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can[MASK] <unk> take cases <unk> but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers <unk> but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference for example in cambodia <unk> [MASK] it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had twenty four lawyers with her who stood up together and in the same way in china they always tell me it 's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together[MASK] <unk> in zimbabwe where i remember innocent <unk> [MASK] after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said i 've been here for one year eight years twelve years without a lawyer he came and we had a training together[MASK] and he said i have heard it said because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling i have heard it said that we cannot[MASK] help to create justice because we do not[MASK] <unk> and then he said but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice [MASK] and with that he successfully organized <unk> sixty eight lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases <unk> the key that we see though is training[MASK] and then early access i was recently in egypt and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers <unk> and what they told me is that they said hey[MASK] <unk> we don 't have police on the streets now the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution they were torturing everybody all the time and[MASK] i said but there 's been tens of millions of dollars[MASK] <unk> that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here what 's going on i met with one of the development agencies <unk> [MASK] and they were training prosecutors and judges which is the normal[MASK] <unk> as opposed to defenders <unk> [MASK] and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual i said i 'm gonna copy this it had everything in it [MASK] lawyers can come at the police station it was perfect prosecutors were perfectly trained [MASK] but i said to them i just have one question <unk> which is by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor 's office what had happened to them [MASK] and after a pause they said they had been tortured [MASK] so the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers but us finding a way to[MASK] <unk> systematically implement early access to counsel because they are the safeguard in the system[MASK] for people who are being tortured and as i tell you this i 'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like oh okay it sounds like[MASK] we could do it but can we really do it because it sounds big <unk> [MASK] and there are many reasons why i believe it 's possible the first reason is the people on the ground[MASK] who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment it 's not only innocent who i told you about in in zimbabwe <unk> [MASK] but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces we have a program called justicemakers <unk> [MASK] and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things <unk> but how can we support them <unk> [MASK] so it 's an online contest where it 's only five thousand dollars if you come[MASK] <unk> up with and innovative way of implementing justice and there are thirty justicemakers throughout the world from sri lanka to[MASK] swaziland to the drc [MASK] who with five thousand dollars do amazing things through sms programs through paralegal programs <unk> through whatever they can do <unk> and it 's not[MASK] <unk> but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward <unk> [MASK] so in china for instance great laws came out where it says police[MASK] cannot torture people or they will be punished <unk> and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers [MASK] and said how can we get this out <unk> how can we make sure that this is implemented this is fantastic and he said to me[MASK] you have money and i said [MASK] and he said that 's okay <unk> we can still figure it out [MASK] and on december four <unk> he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league from fourteen of the top law schools [MASK] who organized themselves <unk> developed posters with the new laws <unk> and went to the police stations and began what[MASK] <unk> legal revolution to protect citizen rights [MASK] so i talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders we need to systematically implement early access to counsel <unk> but the third and most important thing[MASK] is that we make a commitment to this <unk> [MASK] and people often say to me you know this is great <unk> but it 's wildly idealistic never going to happen [MASK] and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were[MASK] <unk> used for people who decided they would end slavery [MASK] or end apartheid <unk> it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit [MASK] now there 's one of our favorite poems from the defenders <unk> which they share from each other is take courage friends <unk> the road is often long the path is never clear <unk> [MASK] and the stakes are very high <unk> [MASK] but deep down you are not alone [MASK] and i believe that if we can come together[MASK] <unk> as a world community to support not only defenders but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it we can end torture as an investigative tool [MASK] i end always because i 'm sure the questions are and i 'd be happy to talk to you at any point but what can i really do well i would say this first of all you know what you can do <unk> [MASK] but second of all i would[MASK] leave you with the story of vishna who actually was my inspiration[MASK] <unk> for starting international bridges to justice [MASK] vishna was a 4 year old boy when i met him who was born in a cambodian prison in kandal province <unk> [MASK] but because he was born in the prison [MASK] everybody loved him <unk> including the guards <unk> so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars so you know there 's bars <unk> and by the[MASK] <unk> vishna was getting bigger <unk> which means what gets bigger your head gets bigger <unk> [MASK] so he would come to the first bar <unk> the second bar and then the third bar and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through <unk> and come back third second first and he would grab my pinkie <unk> [MASK] because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit you know he never quite made it to all of them every day <unk> but he wanted to visit all one hundred and fifty six prisoners <unk> [MASK] and i would lift him and he would put his fingers through <unk> or if they were dark cells it was like iron corrugated and he would put his fingers through[MASK] <unk> and most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine and they looked forward to him <unk> and i was like here 's vishna he 's a 4 year old boy he was born in a prison with almost nothing no material goods <unk> but he had a sense of his own heroic journey which i believe we are all born into [MASK] he said probably[MASK] i can 't do everything <unk> but i 'm one i can do something and i will do the one thing that i can do so i thank you for having the prophetic[MASK] <unk> imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together and invite you into this journey with us[MASK]
