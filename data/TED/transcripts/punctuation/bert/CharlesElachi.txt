 <unk> telling you or showing you[MASK] the people who started [ jet propulsion lab ] [MASK] when they were a bunch of kids they were kind of very imaginative very adventurous as they were trying at caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more [MASK] well i don 't recommend that you try to do that now <unk> [MASK] naturally they blew up a shack and caltech[MASK] well then hey you go to the arroyo and really do all your tests in there so that 's what we call our first five employees during the tea break <unk> you know in here[MASK] as i said they were adventurous people as a matter of fact <unk> one of them who[MASK] was kind of <unk> part of a cult which was not too far from here on orange grove and[MASK] unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best[MASK] chemicals so that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there we try to avoid blowing ourselves <unk> up this one i thought i 'd show you guess which one is a jpl employee[MASK] in the heart of this crowd [MASK] i tried to come like him this morning but as i walked out then it was too cold and i said i 'd better put my shirt back on but more importantly the reason i wanted to show this picture look where the other people are looking and look where he is looking[MASK] <unk> wherever anybody else looks look somewhere else and go do something different you know [MASK] and doing that and that 's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing and i want to tell you a quote from ralph emerson that one of my colleagues <unk> you know put on my wall in my office <unk>[MASK] and it says do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail[MASK] <unk> that 's my recommendation to all of you look what everybody is doing what they are doing go do something completely different don 't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing because that doesn 't get you very far[MASK] in our early days we used to work a lot on rockets <unk> but we also used to have a lot of parties <unk> you know as you can see one of our parties you know a few years ago but then[MASK] a big difference happened about fifty years ago after sputnik was launched we launched the first american satellite and that 's the one you see on the left in there <unk> and here we made one hundred[MASK] <unk> eighty degrees change [MASK] we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house <unk> and that was done over a period of a couple of years and now we are the leading organization <unk> you know exploring space on <unk>[MASK] on all of your behalf <unk> but even when we did that we had to remind ourselves <unk> sometimes there are setbacks <unk> so you see on the bottom that rocket was supposed to go[MASK] <unk> somehow it ended going sideways <unk> [MASK] so that 's what we call the misguided missile but then also just to celebrate that we started an event at jpl for miss guided missile [MASK] so we used to have a celebration every year and select[MASK] there used to be competition and parades and so on [MASK] it 's not very appropriate to do it now some people tell me to do it i think well that 's not really proper <unk> you know these days so we do something a little bit more[MASK] <unk> and that 's what you see in the last rose bowl you know when we entered one of the floats <unk> that 's more on the play side and on the right side[MASK] <unk> that 's the rover just before we finished its testing[MASK] to take it to the cape to launch it these are the rovers up here that you have on mars now <unk> so that kind of tells you about kind of the fun things <unk> [MASK] you know and the serious things that we try to do <unk> but i said i 'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind[MASK] <unk> beware of safety is an instrumental rock band it branches on more the experimental side there 's the improvisational side of jazz there[MASK] as an instrument and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live mixing electronics and acoustics <unk> the music 's half of me[MASK] but the other half[MASK] i landed probably the best gig of all i work for the jet propulsion lab i 'm building the next mars rover some of the most brilliant engineers i know are the[MASK] <unk> from the play stuff to the serious stuff always people ask why do we explore why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them <unk> well <unk> the way i think about it is fairly[MASK] <unk> somehow thirteen billion years ago there was a big bang and you 've heard a little bit about you know the origin of the universe but somehow what strikes everybody 's imagination or lots of people 's imagination somehow <unk>[MASK] <unk> from that original big bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today <unk> you look outside you have all that beauty that you see all that life that you see around you and here we have intelligent people like you and i who are having a conversation here <unk> all that started from that big bang[MASK] so the question is how did that[MASK] happen how did that evolve how did the universe form how did the galaxies form how did the planets form <unk> why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved is that very common is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars <unk> [MASK] so we literally are all made out of stardust <unk> we started from those[MASK] <unk> are made of stardust so <unk> next time you are really depressed look in the mirror and you can look and say hi i 'm looking at a star here you can skip the dust part <unk>[MASK] but literally we are all made of stardust so what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today <unk> [MASK] and one of the first or the easiest <unk> places we can go and explore that is to go towards mars <unk> and the reason mars takes particular attention it 's not very far from us you know it 'll take us only six months to get there[MASK] <unk> six to nine months at the right time of[MASK] of the year <unk> it 's a planet somewhat similar to earth <unk> it 's a little bit smaller but the land mass on mars is about the same as the land mass on earth <unk> you know if you don 't take the oceans into account it has polar <unk>[MASK] <unk> caps <unk> it has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours <unk> so it has weather <unk> so it 's very similar to some extent and you can see some of the features[MASK] is like the grand canyon on earth except a hell of a lot larger <unk> so it 's about the size you know of the united states it has volcanoes on it <unk> [MASK] and that 's[MASK] mount olympus on mars which is a kind of huge[MASK] volcanic shield on that planet and if you look at the height of it and you compare it[MASK] <unk> give you an idea of how large that mount olympus you know is relative to mount everest [MASK] so it basically dwarfs <unk> you know mount everest here on earth so that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or or volcanic events which have happened on that planet <unk> [MASK] recently from one of our satellites this shows that it 's earth like we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening <unk> [MASK] so it is a dynamic planet <unk> and activity is going on as we speak today[MASK] <unk> rovers people wonder now what are they doing today so i thought i would show you a little bit what they are doing <unk> [MASK] this is one very large crater geologists love craters <unk> because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it and you can see what 's below the surface so this is called victoria crater which is about a few football fields[MASK] in size and[MASK] <unk> if you look at the top left you see a little teeny dark dot this picture was taken from an orbiting satellite [MASK] if i zoom on it you can see <unk> that 's the rover on the surface <unk> so that was taken from orbit we had the camera zoom on the surface <unk> and we actually saw the rover on the surface and we actually used <unk>[MASK] <unk> the combination of the satellite images and the rover to actually conduct science because we can observe large areas and then you can get those rovers to move around[MASK] is that rover is going down in that crater as i told you <unk> geologists love craters <unk> and the reason is many of you went to the grand canyon and you see in the wall of the grand canyon you see these layers [MASK] and what these layers that 's what the surface used to be a million years ago <unk> ten million years ago one hundred million years ago and you get deposits on top[MASK] <unk> so if you can read the layers it 's like reading your book <unk> and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location <unk> so what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall <unk>[MASK] of that crater <unk> and the rover is going down now measuring <unk> you know the properties and analyzing the rocks as it 's going down <unk> you know that canyon <unk> now <unk> it 's kind of <unk>[MASK] <unk> a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this if you were there you wouldn 't do it yourself <unk> but we really made sure we tested those rovers before we got them down[MASK] <unk> that rover and made sure that it 's all working well <unk> [MASK] now when i came last time shortly after the landing i think it was like a hundred days after the landing i told you i was surprised that those rovers are lasting even a hundred days <unk> [MASK] well here we are four years later and they 're still working now you say charles you are really lying to us and so on but that 's not true we really believed they were going to[MASK] <unk> last ninety days or one[MASK] hundred days because they are solar powered [MASK] and mars is a dusty planet <unk> so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface and after a while we wouldn 't have enough power you know to keep them warm [MASK] well i always say it 's important that you are smart but every once in a while it 's good to be lucky <unk> [MASK] and that 's what we found out it turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on mars as you are seeing here and when the[MASK] dust devil comes over the rover it just cleans it up it is like a brand new[MASK] car that you have <unk> and that 's literally why they have lasted so long <unk> and now we designed them reasonably well[MASK] <unk> <unk> but that 's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing[MASK] all the science data <unk> now the two rovers each one of them is kind of getting old <unk> you know one of them one of the wheels is stuck is not working one of the front wheels so what we are doing we are driving it backwards[MASK] and the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint you know it 's not working very[MASK] <unk> well so it 's walking like this and we can move the arm you know that way but still they are producing a lot of scientific data <unk> [MASK] now during that whole period a number of people got excited you know <unk> outside the science community[MASK] about about these rovers so i thought i 'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these rovers are being viewed by people other than[MASK] than the science community so let me go on the next short video[MASK] this video is pretty accurate of[MASK] <unk> let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet <unk> as i said earlier it looked very much like earth so you see sand dunes <unk> it looks like i could have told[MASK] <unk> these are pictures taken from the sahara desert or somewhere and you 'd have believed me but these are pictures taken from mars <unk> but one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region you know [MASK] of mars close to the north pole because we see ice caps <unk> and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding[MASK] <unk> so it 's very much like you have in northern canada <unk> and we wanted to find out and we see all kinds of glacial features on it so we wanted to find out actually what is that ice made of [MASK] and could that have embedded in it some organic[MASK] <unk> so we have a spacecraft which is heading towards mars called phoenix <unk> and that spacecraft will land seventeen days seven hours[MASK] and twenty seconds from now so you can adjust your watch <unk> so it 's on may twenty five[MASK] around just before five o 'clock our time here on the west coast actually we will be landing on another planet <unk> and as you can see this is a picture[MASK] <unk> the spacecraft put on mars but i thought that just in case you 're going to miss that show you know in seventeen days i 'll show you kind of a little bit of what 's going to happen video[MASK] that 's what we call the seven minutes of[MASK] <unk> actually heat them and look what gases will come from it so this was launched about nine months ago we[MASK] 'll be coming in at twelve thousand miles per hour and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don 't break[MASK] <unk> the first mission that 's going to try to land near the north pole of mars and it 's the first mission that 's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet lynn craig where there tends[MASK] <unk> to be water at least on earth there tends to be life and so it 's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet[MASK] <unk> surface of mars and our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell eb looks kind of like an ice cream cone [MASK] more or less bc and on the front of it is this heat shield this saucer looking thing that has about a half inch of essentially what 's cork on the front of it [MASK] which is our heat shield now this is really special cork and this cork is what 's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we 're about to experience rob grover [MASK] friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft[MASK] <unk> the friction when it[MASK] 's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down bc from this point we 're going to decelerate from twelve thousand five hundred miles an hour[MASK] down to nine hundred miles an hour eb the outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the sun rg the[MASK] temperature of the heat shield can reach two thousand six hundred degrees fahrenheit eb[MASK] the inside doesn 't get very hot it probably gets about room temperature[MASK] this window of opportunity[MASK] within which we can deploy the parachute eb if[MASK] you fire the ' chute too early the parachute itself could fail the fabric and the stitching could just pull apart and[MASK] that would be bad bc [MASK] in the first fifteen seconds after we deploy the parachute we 'll decelerate from nine hundred miles an hour to a relatively slow two hundred and fifty miles[MASK] <unk> we no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry <unk> so we jettison the heat shield exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of mars lc after[MASK] the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect[MASK] how far phoenix really is from the ground[MASK] to where we want to be but that last one percent as it always seems to be is the tricky part eb now the spacecraft actually has to[MASK] decide when it 's going to get rid of its parachute bc we separate from the lander going one hundred and twenty five miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of mars three thousand two hundred feet [MASK] that 's like taking two empire state buildings and stacking them on top of one another eb that 's when we[MASK] <unk> it 's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it 's in the right position to land eb and then it has to light up its engines <unk> [MASK] right itself and then[MASK] <unk> earth and mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes[MASK] for a signal from mars to get to earth [MASK] and edl itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes so by the time you even hear from the lander that edl has started it 'll already be over eb [MASK] we have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft[MASK] so that it can land itself safely [MASK] bc edl is this immense technically challenging problem it 's about getting a spacecraft that 's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of mars at zero miles an hour[MASK] it 's this immensely exciting and challenging problem [MASK] hopefully it[MASK] <unk> in here so it will be a very a very tense moment you know as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet <unk> [MASK] so now let me talk about the next things that we are doing <unk> so we are in the process as we speak of actually designing the next rover that we are going to be sending to mars so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you kind of the steps[MASK] we go through it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product <unk> as you saw a little bit earlier <unk> when we were doing the phoenix one we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing <unk> so we have to study all[MASK] <unk> kinds of different materials the shape that we want to do in general we don 't try to please the customer here what we want to do is to make to make sure we have an effective <unk> you know an efficient[MASK] kind of machine first we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can <unk> [MASK] and we really love being close to the art center because we have as a matter of fact one of the alumni from the art center eric nyquist[MASK] <unk> design or spacecraft design room just to get people to think wildly[MASK] about things we have a bunch of legos so as i said <unk> this is a playground for adults where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different[MASK] designs <unk> then we get a little bit more serious so we have what we call our cad cams and all the engineers who are involved or scientists who are involved who know about thermal properties know about design know about atmospheric[MASK] <unk> interaction <unk> parachutes all of these things which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent so to see does that meet the requirement[MASK] that we need on the right also we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going if you are going to jupiter you have a very high radiation you know [MASK] environment it 's about the same radiation environment close by jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor so just imagine you take your[MASK] <unk> and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work so these are kind of some of the little challenges you know [MASK] that we have to face if we are doing entry we have to do tests of parachutes <unk> you saw in the video a parachute breaking that would be a bad day you know if[MASK] that happened so we have to test because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds we are coming at[MASK] <unk> high speeds and we are deploying them to slow us down so we have to do all kinds of tests to give you an idea of the size you know [MASK] of that parachute relative to the people standing there next step we go and actually build some kind of test models[MASK] and actually test them[MASK] you know in the lab at jpl in what we call our mars yard we kick them we hit them we drop them <unk> just to make sure we understand how where would they break <unk> and then we back[MASK] <unk> you know from that point[MASK] and then we actually do the actual building and and the flight <unk> and this next rover that we 're flying is about the size of a car [MASK] that big shield that you see outside that 's a heat shield which is going to protect it <unk> and that will be basically built over the next year and it will be launched june a year from now now in that case because it was a very big[MASK] <unk> we couldn 't use airbags and i know many of you kind of last time afterwards said well that was a cool cool thing to have those airbags unfortunately this rover is like ten times the size of the you know[MASK] mass wise of the other rover or three times the mass so we can 't use airbags so we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it <unk> and we didn 't want to[MASK] take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn 't want to contaminate the surface we wanted the rover to immediately land on its legs <unk> so we came up with this ingenious idea which[MASK] <unk> is used here on earth for helicopters actually the lander will come down to about one hundred feet and hover[MASK] above that surface for one hundred feet and then we have a sky crane which will take that rover and land it down on the surface <unk> hopefully it all will work <unk> you know it will work that way <unk> [MASK] and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist what we are going to be doing with that rover as it drives around it 's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks so it will have[MASK] <unk> arm which will take samples put them in an oven crush and analyze them <unk> but also if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff we have a little laser system <unk>[MASK] <unk> which will actually zap the rock <unk> evaporate some of it and actually analyze what 's coming from that rock so it 's a little bit like star wars you know <unk> but it 's real it 's real stuff[MASK] <unk> train that rover to actually in addition to do this to actually serve cocktails <unk> you know also on mars <unk> so that 's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of <unk> [MASK] you know fun things we are doing on mars i thought i 'd go to the lord of the rings now and show you some of the things we have there now the lord of the rings [MASK] has two things played through it <unk> one it 's a very attractive[MASK] <unk> just has the beauty of the rings and so on but for scientists also the rings have a special meaning because we believe they represent on a small scale <unk> how the solar system actually formed[MASK] some of the scientists believe that the way the solar system formed that the sun when it collapsed and actually created the sun [MASK] a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together and they formed[MASK] <unk> the idea is by watching saturn we 're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale so it 's like a test bed for it so let me show you a little bit on[MASK] what that saturnian system looks like first i 'm going to fly you over the over the rings by the way all of this is real stuff <unk> this is not animation or anything like this this is actually taken[MASK] from the satellite that we have in orbit around saturn the cassini[MASK] and you see the amount of detail that is in those rings which are the particles some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles so that 's why you have these gaps is because a small satellite you know is being formed in that location <unk> [MASK] now you think that those rings are very large objects yes they are very large in one dimension in the other dimension they are paper thin [MASK] very very thin what you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on saturn itself <unk> and that 's one of the[MASK] satellites which was actually formed on that one so think about it as <unk>[MASK] huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles <unk> [MASK] which is rotating [MASK] and we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form each one looking very different and very odd and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this and telling nasa we need more money so we can explain what these things look like or why they formed that way[MASK] <unk> satellites which were particularly interesting one of them is called enceladus <unk> it 's a satellite which was all made of ice <unk> and we measured it from orbit made of ice but there was something bizarre <unk>[MASK] <unk> about it <unk> if you look at these stripes in here <unk> what we call tiger stripes when we flew over them all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature [MASK] <unk> back and guess what we saw geysers coming out so this is a yellowstone you know [MASK] of saturn we are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet which indicate that most likely there is an ocean <unk> you know below the surface and somehow through some dynamic effect we 're having these geysers which are being you know [MASK] emitted from it and the[MASK] <unk> reason i showed the little arrow there i think that should say thirty miles <unk> [MASK] we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure[MASK] <unk> the material that it is made of that was [ unclear ] also you know <unk> because we were worried about the risk of it but it worked pretty well <unk> we flew at the top of it[MASK] and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice <unk> and over the next few years as we keep orbiting[MASK] <unk> to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements <unk> [MASK] now <unk> another satellite also attracted a lot of attention and that 's titan <unk> and the reason titan is particularly interesting <unk> it 's a satellite bigger than our moon [MASK] and it has an atmosphere <unk> and that atmosphere is very as dense as our own atmosphere so if you were on titan <unk> you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here <unk> [MASK] except it 's a lot colder and[MASK] <unk> that atmosphere is heavily made of methane <unk> now methane gets people all excited because it 's organic material so immediately people start thinking could life have evolved[MASK] in that location when you have a lot of organic[MASK] material <unk> so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre biotic planet <unk> because it 's so cold[MASK] <unk> organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material and therefore life could have evolved on it <unk> so it could be earth <unk> frozen three billion years ago before life <unk>[MASK] actually started on it <unk> so that 's getting a lot of interest and to show you some example of what we did in there we actually dropped a probe which was developed by our colleagues in europe <unk> we dropped a probe as we were[MASK] <unk> looked like the coast of california for me you see the rivers which are coming along the coast <unk> and you see that white area which looks like catalina island and that looks like an ocean <unk> [MASK] and then with an instrument we have on board a radar instrument we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here so it looks very much like earth it looks like there are rivers on it there are oceans or lakes we know there are[MASK] <unk> we think it 's raining also on it so it 's very much like the cycle on earth except[MASK] because it 's so cold it could not be water you know[MASK] because water would have frozen <unk> [MASK] what it turned out that all that we are seeing all this liquid [ is made of ] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane similar to what you put in your car so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our earth <unk> [MASK] but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material <unk> so if you were on mars[MASK] sorry on titan you don 't have to worry about[MASK] <unk> drive to the nearest lake stick your hose in it and you 've got your car filled up on the other hand if you light a match the whole planet will blow up [MASK] so in closing i said i want to close by a couple of pictures and just to kind of put us in perspective <unk> this is a picture of saturn taken with a spacecraft <unk>[MASK] from behind saturn looking towards the sun the sun is behind saturn so we see what we call[MASK] <unk> scattering so it highlights all the rings [MASK] and i 'm going to zoom there is a i 'm not sure you can see it very well but on the top left around ten o 'clock there is a little teeny dot <unk> and that 's earth <unk> [MASK] you barely can see ourselves <unk> so what i did i thought i 'd zoom on it <unk> so as you zoom in you know[MASK] you can see earth you know just in the middle here so we zoomed all the way on the art center[MASK]
