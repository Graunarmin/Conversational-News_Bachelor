 <unk> at every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we 're going to become and then when we become those people we 're not always thrilled <unk>[MASK] <unk> with the decisions we made so young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good[MASK] <unk> money to get middle aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry[MASK] older adults work hard to lose what middle aged adults worked hard to gain on and on and on the question is as a psychologist that fascinates me is why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret[MASK] <unk> i think one of the reasons i 'll try to convince you today is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time [MASK] every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan that your your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year <unk> [MASK] but what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl is it teenage years is it middle age is it old[MASK] <unk> age the answer it turns out for most people is now <unk> wherever now happens to be [MASK] what i want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion an illusion[MASK] that history our personal history <unk> has just come to an end that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives[MASK] <unk> me give you some data to back up that claim so[MASK] here 's a study of change in people 's personal values over time here 's three values everybody here holds all of them but you probably know that as you grow as you[MASK] <unk> age the balance of these values shifts so how does it do so well we asked thousands of people we asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next ten years <unk> and the others to[MASK] <unk> us how much their values had changed in the last ten years <unk> and this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people say <unk> eighteen <unk>[MASK] <unk> years old to the reports of people who were twenty eight and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan here 's what we found <unk> first of all you are right change does slow[MASK] <unk> it doesn 't slow nearly as much as we think at every age from eighteen to sixty eight in our data set people vastly underestimated how much change <unk>[MASK] they would experience over the next ten years <unk> we call this the end of history illusion [MASK] <unk> it 's not just values it 's all sorts of other things for example personality <unk> many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality <unk> [MASK] neuroticism <unk> openness to experience agreeableness <unk> extraversion and conscientiousness again we asked people how much they expected to change over the next ten years <unk> and also how much they[MASK] <unk> had changed over the last ten years and what we found well you 're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over because once again the rate of change does slow as we age <unk> but at every <unk>[MASK] age <unk> people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade <unk> [MASK] <unk> you can ask people about their likes and dislikes their basic preferences for example [MASK] name your best friend your favorite kind of vacation what 's your favorite hobby [MASK] what 's your favorite kind of music people can name these things we ask half of them to tell us do you think that that will change over the next ten years and half of them to tell us did that change over the last ten years and what we[MASK] <unk> you 've seen it twice now and here it is again [MASK] people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they 'll have in ten years the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they 'll enjoy in ten years <unk> and yet people who are ten years older all say eh you know that 's really changed [MASK] does any of this matter is this just a form of mis prediction that doesn 't have consequences no it matters quite a bit and i 'll give you an example of why [MASK] <unk> in important ways bring to mind right now for yourself your your favorite musician today and your favorite musician ten years ago i put mine up on the screen to help you along <unk>[MASK] now we asked people to predict for us to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert ten years from now and on average people[MASK] said they would pay one hundred and twenty nine dollars for that ticket <unk> [MASK] and yet when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite ten years ago perform today [MASK] they say only eighty dollars now in a perfectly rational world these should be the same number but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability why does this[MASK] <unk> not entirely sure but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining most of us can remember who we were ten years ago but we find it hard to imagine who we 're going to be [MASK] and then we mistakenly think that because it 's hard to imagine it 's not likely to happen <unk> sorry when people say i can 't imagine that they 're usually talking about their own lack <unk>[MASK] <unk> of imagination and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they 're describing [MASK] <unk> is time is a powerful force it transforms our preferences it reshapes our values it alters our personalities [MASK] we seem to appreciate this fact <unk> but only in retrospect only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade <unk> it 's as if for most of us the[MASK] <unk> is a magic time it 's a watershed on the timeline <unk> it 's the moment at which we finally become ourselves [MASK] human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they 're finished [MASK] the person you are right now is as transient as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you 've ever been [MASK] the one constant in our life[MASK] is change thank you[MASK]
