 <unk> i can remember i have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean <unk> [MASK] and at this age my personal idol was flipper the dolphin[MASK] <unk> and when i first learned about endangered species i was truly[MASK] distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this earth forever <unk> [MASK] and i wanted to do something to help but i always wondered what could one person possibly do to make a difference <unk> and it would be thirty years but i would eventually get the answer to that question [MASK] when these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the gulf of mexico last year during the[MASK] <unk> horrific bp oil spill [MASK] a german biologist by the name of silvia gaus was quoted as saying [MASK] we should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released [MASK] and i could not disagree more[MASK] in addition i believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life and i want to tell you why i feel so strongly[MASK] <unk> about this [MASK] on june twenty three two thousand a ship named the treasure sank off the coast of cape town south africa <unk> spilling one thousand three hundred tons of fuel which polluted the habitats of[MASK] nearly half the entire world population of african penguins <unk> [MASK] now the ship sank between robben island to the south[MASK] <unk> a ship named the apollo sea sank near dassen island <unk> oiling ten thousand penguins <unk> half of which died [MASK] now when the treasure sank in two thousand it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the african penguin which at the time was listed as a threatened[MASK] <unk> species <unk> and soon nearly twenty thousand penguins were covered with this toxic oil the local seabird rescue center named sanccob immediately launched <unk>[MASK] <unk> a massive rescue operation and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken[MASK] <unk> aquarist at the new england aquarium [MASK] and exactly eleven years ago yesterday <unk> [MASK] the phone rang in the penguin office and with that call my life would change forever <unk> [MASK] it was estelle van der merwe calling from sanccob saying please come help we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing but completely <unk>[MASK] <unk> inexperienced volunteers <unk> and we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them so two days later i was on a[MASK] <unk> plane headed for cape town with a team of penguin specialists[MASK] <unk> and the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal in fact many people compared it to a war zone[MASK] last week a 10 year old girl asked me what did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw[MASK] <unk> and this is what happened i was instantly transported back to that moment in time [MASK] penguins are very vocal birds and really really noisy so i expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking [MASK] but instead when we stepped through those doors and into the building[MASK] <unk> so it was very clear these were stressed sick <unk> traumatized birds <unk> [MASK] the other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers <unk> up to one thousand people a day came to the rescue center eventually over the course of this rescue more than <unk>[MASK] thousand volunteers came from all over the world to cape town to help save these birds and the amazing thing was[MASK] <unk> that not one of them had to be there [MASK] yet they were so for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe inspiring [MASK] so the day after we arrived two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two[MASK] room two had more than four thousand oiled penguins in it now mind you three days earlier[MASK] <unk> we had sixty penguins under our care so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified at least i was [MASK] personally i really didn 't know if i was capable of handling such a monstrous task <unk> and collectively we really didn 't know if we could pull this off <unk> because we all knew that just[MASK] <unk> half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued [MASK] and only half of them had survived so would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins we just did not know [MASK] but what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers three of whom here are force feeding penguins you may notice they 're wearing very thick gloves and what you[MASK] <unk> and before long our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins <unk> [MASK] now the day after we arrived a new crisis began to unfold the oil slick was now moving north towards dassen island <unk> and the rescuers despaired because they knew if the oil hit [MASK] it would not[MASK] be possible to rescue any more oiled birds and there really were no good solutions but then finally one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea he said ok why don 't we <unk>[MASK] <unk> try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled they collected twenty thousand and we 'll ship them five hundred miles up the coast[MASK] <unk> three of those penguins peter pamela and percy wore satellite tags and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home the oil would be cleaned up from their islands <unk> [MASK] <unk> and luckily the day they arrived <unk> it was so it had been a huge gamble <unk> but it had paid off and so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills <unk> [MASK] <unk> rescue as in life we learn from each previous experience <unk> and we learn from both our successes and our failures <unk> [MASK] and the main thing learned during the apollo sea rescue <unk>[MASK] was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once <unk> [MASK] <unk> six years between these two oil spills they 've built thousands of these well ventilated boxes and as a result during the treasure rescue just one hundred and sixty <unk>[MASK] <unk> penguins died during the transport process as opposed to five thousand so this alone was a huge victory [MASK] <unk> these training boxes and we used this technique again during the treasure rescue <unk> but[MASK] an interesting thing was noted during the training process <unk> [MASK] the first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the apollo sea spill six years earlier <unk> [MASK] so penguins learn from previous experience too [MASK] so all of those[MASK] <unk> penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin[MASK] when you clean a penguin you first have to spray it with a degreaser <unk> and this brings me to my favorite story from the treasure rescue [MASK] about a year prior to this oil spill a[MASK] <unk> student had invented a degreaser <unk> and they 'd been using it at sanccob with great success so they began using it during the treasure rescue <unk> but partway through they ran out <unk> [MASK] so in a panic estelle from sanccob called the student and said please you have to make more so he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds <unk> so i <unk>[MASK] <unk> just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of[MASK] <unk> animals <unk> [MASK] so what happened to those twenty thousand oiled penguins and was silvia gaus right should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway <unk> [MASK] well she could not be more wrong [MASK] after half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor more than ninety percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild[MASK] and we know from follow up studies that they have lived just as long as never oiled penguins and bred nearly as successfully [MASK] and in addition about three thousand penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised and again we know from long term monitoring that more of these <unk>[MASK] chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do[MASK] armed with this knowledge sanccob has a <unk> chick bolstering project and every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks and they have a very impressive <unk> eighty percent success rate this is critically important because[MASK] one year ago the african penguin was declared endangered [MASK] and they could be extinct in less than ten years if we don 't do something now to protect them[MASK] so what did i learn from this intense and unforgettable experience <unk> personally i learned that i am capable of handling so much more than i ever dreamed possible <unk>[MASK] <unk> and i learned that one person can make a huge difference just look at that 17 year old [MASK] <unk> so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have <unk> [MASK] so i 'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge if you will [MASK] my mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins <unk> [MASK] but why should any of you care about penguins <unk> well you should care because they 're an indicator species <unk> and simply put if penguins are[MASK] <unk> dying it means our oceans are dying <unk> and we ultimately will be affected because as sylvia earle says the oceans are our life support system [MASK] and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming and these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about [MASK] so if we each do our part together we can make a difference[MASK] and we can help keep penguins from going extinct humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins <unk> but we are now their only hope <unk> thank you[MASK]
