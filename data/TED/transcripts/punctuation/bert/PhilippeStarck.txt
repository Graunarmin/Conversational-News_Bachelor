 <unk> 's good for you because you can can have a break after all these fantastic people[MASK] i must tell you i am like that[MASK] <unk> very comfortable[MASK] because usually in life i think my job is absolutely useless i mean i feel useless[MASK] now after[MASK] carolyn and all the other guys i feel like shit[MASK] and definitively i don 't know why[MASK] i am here but you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you you must sing[MASK] i don 't know[MASK] so[MASK] so because i have nothing to show[MASK] nothing to say we shall try to speak about something else[MASK] <unk> we can start if you want by understanding it 's just to start it 's not interesting but[MASK] how i work when somebody comes to me and ask[MASK] for what i am known i mean yes lemon squeezer[MASK] toilet brush[MASK] toothpick beautiful toilet seats and[MASK] <unk> not a toothbrush[MASK] i don 't try to design the toothbrush i don 't try to say[MASK] oh that will be a beautiful object or something like that that doesn 't interest me because there is different types of design[MASK] the one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented[MASK] <unk> who said what is ugly is a bad sale la laideur se vend mal which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for <unk>[MASK] <unk> marketing for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more it 's shit it 's obsolete it[MASK] i call that the cynical design after there is[MASK] the narcissistic design it[MASK] fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers[MASK] after there is people like me who try to deserve to exist[MASK] and who are so ashamed to make this useless job who try to do it in[MASK] <unk> make the object for the object but for the result for the profit profit for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush[MASK] i don 't think about the toothbrush i think what will be the effect[MASK] of the brush[MASK] in the mouth and to understand[MASK] <unk> what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth i must imagine who owns this mouth what is the life of the owner of this mouth[MASK] in what society this guy live[MASK] what civilization creates this society what animal species[MASK] creates this civilization when i arrive and i take one minute i am not so intelligent when i arrive at the level of animal[MASK] <unk> species that becomes real interesting me i have strictly no power to change anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today[MASK] to not do it it 's more positive than do it[MASK] or how i shall do it[MASK] but to come back where[MASK] i am at the animal[MASK] <unk> species there is things to see there is things to see there is the big challenge the big challenge in front of us[MASK] because there is not a human production which exists[MASK] outside of what i call the big image the big image is our story[MASK] <unk> our life we must remember and we can see that in any book of my son of ten years old[MASK] that life appears[MASK] four billion years ago around four billion point two voice offstage four point five yes point five ok ok ok[MASK] i 'm a designer that 's all of christmas gifts[MASK] and before there was this soup called soupe primordiale[MASK] this first soup bloop bloop bloop sort of dirty mud no life nothing so then pshoo shoo[MASK] lightning pshoo arrive pshoo shoo makes life bloop bloop and that dies[MASK] some million years[MASK] <unk> at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so[MASK] so stupid the most stupid bacteria[MASK] even i think we we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean and something of oh no forget it[MASK] after we become a fish[MASK] after we become a frog[MASK] after we become a monkey after we become what we are today a super monkey and the fun is[MASK] the super monkey we are today is at half of the story[MASK] can you imagine from that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an ipod four billion years[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> and we know and especially carolyn that when the sun will implode[MASK] the earth will burn explode i don 't know what and this is scheduled for four four billion years[MASK] yes she said something like that ok that means we are at half[MASK] <unk> of the story fantastic[MASK] it 's a beauty can you imagine it 's very symbolic because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today[MASK] and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years[MASK] and this territory is fantastic that is our poetry[MASK] that is our our beautiful story it 's our romanticism mu ta tion we are mutants[MASK] and if we don 't deeply understand if we don 't integrate that we are mutants[MASK] we completely miss the story[MASK] because every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man[MASK] the final man you know we mutate during four billion years before but now[MASK] because it 's me we stop fin for the end for the eternity it is one with a red jacket something like that[MASK] i am i am not sure of that because[MASK] because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is[MASK] <unk> is obliged to be a genius[MASK] but everybody is obliged to participate[MASK] and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of exercise a[MASK] minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do[MASK] is the duty of[MASK] <unk> vision i can explain you i shall try if you walk like that[MASK] it 's ok it 's ok you can walk[MASK] but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole and you will fall and you will die dangerous[MASK] that 's why perhaps you[MASK] try to have this angle of vision ok i can see if i found something up up[MASK] and they continue up up up up i raise the angle of vision[MASK] but it 's still very selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish[MASK] you you you survive it 's ok[MASK] if you[MASK] <unk> of your eyes a little more you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can i can help you[MASK] i can design for you a new toothbrush new toilet brush something like that i live in society i live in community it 's ok you start to be[MASK] <unk> this level[MASK] the more you can raise[MASK] this angle of view the more you will be important for the society the[MASK] more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise[MASK] to to see far and[MASK] <unk> like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation[MASK] that means intelligent people are in this angle that is intelligence[MASK] from this to here that it 's genius[MASK] ptolemy eratosthenes einstein things like that nobody 's obliged to be a genius it 's better but nobody[MASK] take care in this[MASK] <unk> to be a good mutant there is some danger there is some trap one trap the vertical because at the vertical of us if you look like that ah my[MASK] god there is god ah god god is a trap god is the answer[MASK] when we don 't know the answer that means[MASK] <unk> come back because after there is another trap if you look like that you look to the past or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it 's called schizophrenia and you are dead also[MASK] that 's why every morning now because you[MASK] <unk> good mutant you will raise your angle of view[MASK] out more of the horizontal you are an intelligence never forget[MASK] like that like that it 's very very very important[MASK] what[MASK] what what else we can say about that why do that it 's because[MASK] we if we look from far we see our[MASK] line of evolution[MASK] this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth[MASK] like that but if you take a lens[MASK] like that this line is[MASK] <unk> ack ack like that it 's made of[MASK] of light and shadow we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria[MASK] and it 's very important to know where we are because some some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and[MASK] you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle[MASK] that means[MASK] we can imagine i don 't say it was fantastic but in the eightys there was not too much war[MASK] like that[MASK] it was we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized[MASK] <unk> in this case people like me[MASK] are acceptable we can say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to i don 't know what[MASK] speak about art and things like that it 's ok[MASK] we are in the light but sometimes like today[MASK] we fall we fall so fast so fast to shadow[MASK] <unk> with many many many many face of barbaria because it 's not the barbaria[MASK] we have today it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think there is different type of barbaria that 's why we must adapt[MASK] that means that means when barbaria is back[MASK] forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful hotel forget design even i 'm sorry to say forget art forget all that there is priority[MASK] <unk> there is urgence you must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization i 'm sorry if that[MASK] that even i do it the best possible that 's why i 'm the best[MASK] it 's nothing because it 's not the right time that 's why i say that i say that[MASK] because i repeat[MASK] nothing exist if it 's not in the good reason the reason of our[MASK] beautiful dream of this civilization and because[MASK] <unk> we must all work to finish this story because the scenario of this civilization about love progress <unk>[MASK] and things like that it 's ok but there is so many other different other scenarios[MASK] <unk> powerful[MASK] intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now[MASK] we are it 's almost done we have just to finish the story[MASK] that is very very important[MASK] and when you don 't understand really what 's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that you[MASK] <unk> future[MASK] back back back back back like that and you can fall and it 's very dangerous no you must really understand that[MASK] because we have almost finished i 'll repeat this story and the beauty of this[MASK] in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization and offer[MASK] to our[MASK] <unk> children[MASK] the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new romanticism with billions of people who have been born worked lived and[MASK] died before us these people who have worked so much we have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many[MASK] <unk> our children ok[MASK] done that was our story that passed now you have a duty[MASK] invent a new story invent a new poetry the only rule is[MASK] we have not to have any idea about the next story[MASK] <unk> and now do it that 's why i continue to work even if it 's for toilet brush[MASK]
