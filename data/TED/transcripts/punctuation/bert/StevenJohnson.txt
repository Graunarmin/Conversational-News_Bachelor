 <unk> i want to take you back basically to my hometown and to a picture of my hometown of the week that emergence came out <unk> and it 's a picture we 've seen several times[MASK] i live[MASK] right there in the west village so the plume was luckily blowing west away from us we had a <unk>[MASK] baby in the house that was ours we hadn 't taken it from somebody else[MASK] <unk> the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a of a book and a baby <unk> and having this event happen so close[MASK] that my first thought when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building was[MASK] that i 'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i 'd just written because so much of that book was a celebration of the[MASK] <unk> potential of density of largely urban density of connecting people and putting them together in one place and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together [MASK] and it seemed to me looking at that[MASK] that tower burning and then falling those towers burning and falling that in fact one of the lessons here was that density kills <unk> and that of all the technologies that were exploited[MASK] to to make that carnage[MASK] come into being[MASK] <unk> probably the single group of technologies that that cost the most lives were those that enable fifty thousand people to live[MASK] in two buildings one hundred and ten stories above the ground[MASK] <unk> if they hadn 't been crowded you compare the loss of life at the pentagon to the to the twin towers and you can see that very powerfully <unk> and so i started[MASK] <unk> you know density density i 'm not sure if you know this was the right call[MASK] <unk> and i kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days <unk> and then about two days later the wind started to change a little bit and you could[MASK] you could sense that the air was not healthy <unk> and so even though there were no cars still[MASK] in the west village where we lived my wife sent me out to buy a you know a large air filter at the bed bath and beyond [MASK] which was located about twenty blocks away north[MASK] <unk> and so i went out and obviously i 'm physically a very strong person as you can tell so i[MASK] wasn 't worried about carrying this thing twenty blocks and i walked out and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north[MASK] to buy this air filter <unk> which was that the streets were completely alive[MASK] <unk> there was an incredible it was you know a beautiful day as it was for about a week after <unk> [MASK] and the west village had never seemed more lively i walked up along hudson street where jane jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what i was writing in emergence[MASK] past the white horse tavern that great old bar where[MASK] dylan thomas drank himself to death and the bleecker street playground was filled with kids and all the people who lived in the[MASK] <unk> owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood were all out there had them all open people were out there were no cars so it seemed even better in some ways <unk> and[MASK] it was a beautiful urban day <unk> and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working [MASK] the city was there all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating they were all on display there[MASK] on those streets <unk> and i[MASK] <unk> this is the power of a city i mean the power of the city we talked about cities as being centralized in space but what makes them so strong most of the time is they 're decentralized in function [MASK] they don 't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail <unk> if they did it probably was right there at ground zero i mean you know the emergency bunker was right there was destroyed by the <unk>[MASK] by the attacks and obviously the the damage done to the building and the lives but nonetheless just twenty blocks north two days later <unk> the city had never looked more[MASK] <unk> alive if you 'd gone into the minds of the people well you would have seen a lot of trauma and you would have seen a lot of heartache [MASK] and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover but the system itself of this city[MASK] was thriving <unk> so i took heart in seeing that so[MASK] i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works[MASK] <unk> so well and how some of those reasons kind of map on[MASK] to where the web is going right now the question that i found myself asking to people when i was talking about the book afterwards is when you 've talked about emergent behavior when you 've talked about collective intelligence <unk> the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask [MASK] who builds a neighborhood <unk> [MASK] who decides that soho should have this personality and that the latin quarter should have this personality well there are some kind of executive decisions but mostly the answer is everybody and nobody everybody contributes a little bit[MASK] no single person is really the the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood <unk> same thing to the question of who was keeping the streets alive[MASK] post 9 eleven in my neighborhood well it was the whole city the whole system kind of working on it and everybody contributing a small little part <unk> [MASK] and this is increasingly what we 're starting to see on the web[MASK] <unk> in a bunch of interesting ways most of which weren 't around actually except in very experimental things when i was writing emergence and when the book came out so it 's been a very[MASK] optimistic time i think and i want to just talk about a few of those things <unk> i think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that 's starting to emerge online right now and the old one[MASK] looked like this this is not the future[MASK] king of england although it looks like it it 's some guy it 's a geocities homepage of some guy that i found[MASK] <unk> online who 's interested if you look at the bottom in soccer and jesus and garth brooks and clint beckham and my hometown those are his links <unk> but nothing really says this model of interactivity which was so <unk>[MASK] <unk> exciting and captures the the real the web zeitgeist of one thousand nine hundred and ninety five than [MASK] <unk> put up a picture of your dog and link to it and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link <unk> and you know i don 't want to belittle that that in a sense to[MASK] reference[MASK] what jeff was talking about yesterday that was in a sense the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the[MASK] the explosion of interest in the web that you could put up a link and somebody could click on it and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go <unk> but it 's still a very one to one kind of relationship there 's one person[MASK] <unk> putting up the link and there 's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not [MASK] the new model is much more like this and we 've already seen a couple of references to this [MASK] this is what happens when you search steven johnson on google about two months ago <unk> i had the great breakthrough one of my great kind[MASK] <unk> shining achievements which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson[MASK] <unk> there 's some theoretical physicist at mit named steven johnson who has dropped two spots i 'm happy to say [MASK] and you know [MASK] i mean i 'll look at a couple of things like this but google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing <unk> it 's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you[MASK] <unk> creating this page obviously and we all know this but it 's worth just thinking about it is not some person deciding that i am the the number one[MASK] answer for steven johnson <unk> [MASK] but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it and google just sitting there and running the numbers[MASK] <unk> so there 's this collective decision making that 's going on this page is effectively collectively authored by the web[MASK] and google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place <unk> now they 're more innovative well google 's pretty innovative but there are some new[MASK] twists on this there 's this incredibly interesting new site technorati that 's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these and these are[MASK] looking in the in the blog world and the[MASK] <unk> he 's analyzed basically[MASK] all the weblogs out there that he 's tracking and he 's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs <unk> [MASK] and so you have kind of an authority a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it[MASK] <unk> and so at any given time on any given page on the web actually you can say what does the weblog community think about this page[MASK] and you can get a list this is what they think about my site it 's ranked by blog authority you can also rank it by the latest posts[MASK] so when i was talking in emergence i talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that basically you could link to somebody else but they wouldn 't necessarily know that you were pointing to them [MASK] and that was one of the reasons why the web wasn 't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two way linking you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things well something like technorati[MASK] <unk> what 's interesting here is that this is a quote from dave weinberger where he talks about everything being[MASK] purposive in the web there 's nothing artificial he has this line where he says you know you 're going to[MASK] put up a link there if you see a link somebody decided to put it there and he says the link to one site didn 't just grow on the the other page like a tree fungus [MASK] and in fact i think that 's not entirely true anymore[MASK] i could put up a feed of all those links[MASK] generated by technorati on the right hand side of my page and they would change as the overall[MASK] <unk> ecology of the web changes that little list there would change i wouldn 't really be directly in control of it so it 's much closer in a way to a data fungus in a sense wrapped around that page than[MASK] it is to a deliberate link that i 've placed there <unk> [MASK] now what you 're having here is basically a global brain that you 're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it 's thinking[MASK] <unk> and there are all these interesting tools google does the google zeitgeist[MASK] which looks at search requests to test what 's going on what people are interested in and they publish it with lots of fun graphs <unk> [MASK] and i 'm saying a lot of nice things about google so i 'll be i 'll be saying one little critical thing there 's a problem with the google zeitgeist which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures <unk> [MASK] which is not necessarily news the columbia blows up suddenly there are a lot of searches on columbia well you know we should expect to see that[MASK] <unk> 's not necessarily something we didn 't know already <unk> so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream[MASK] the question is are you finding out something new and one of the things that i[MASK] experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically <unk> you take an abstract term <unk> and[MASK] you search google for that term <unk> and then you search the results that you get[MASK] <unk> back for somebody 's name <unk> [MASK] so basically the number of pages that mention this term <unk> that also mention this page the percentage of those pages is that person 's google share of that term <unk> [MASK] so you can do kind of interesting contests like for instance this is a google share of the ted conference <unk> so[MASK] richard saul wurman has about a fifteen percent google share of the ted conference our good friend chris[MASK] has about a six percent but with a bullet i might add [MASK] but the interesting thing is you can broaden the search a little bit and it turns out actually that forty two percent is the the mola mola fish i had no idea no that 's not true [MASK] i made that up because i just wanted to put up a slide of the mola[MASK] <unk> i also did and i don 't want to start a little fight in the next panel but i did a google share analysis of evolution and natural selection[MASK] <unk> so right here now this is a big category you have smaller percentages so this is zero point seven percent[MASK] dan dennett who 'll be speaking shortly right below him zero point five percent steven pinker <unk> so dennett 's in[MASK] <unk> lead a little bit there <unk> but what 's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of of what else is out there so[MASK] gary bauer is not too far behind has slightly different theories about about evolution and natural selection <unk> and right behind him is[MASK] l ron hubbard so [MASK] you can see we 're in the ascot which is always good and by the way chris that would 've been a really good panel <unk> i think[MASK] <unk> hubbard apparently started to reach but besides that i think it would be good next year[MASK] <unk> another quick thing this is a slightly different thing but this analysis some of you may have seen it just came out this is bursty words looking at the[MASK] historical record of state of the union addresses <unk> [MASK] so these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere so they 're kind of <unk> you know memes that start taking off that didn 't have a lot of historical precedent before <unk> [MASK] so the first one is[MASK] <unk> these are the bursty words around 1860s slaves emancipation slavery rebellion kansas <unk> that 's britney spears i mean you know <unk> ok interesting they 're talking about slavery in one thousand eight hundred and sixty [MASK] one thousand nine hundred and thirty five relief depression recovery banks and ok i didn 't learn anything new there as well that 's pretty obvious one thousand nine hundred and eighty five right at the center of the reagan years[MASK] that 's[MASK] <unk> all have a lot of syllables so you know you can actually download it 's hard to remember those[MASK] but seriously actually what you can see there in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise is reagan reinventing the political language of the country[MASK] and and shifting to a much more intimate much more folksy much more telegenic contracting all those verbs you know twenty years before it was still[MASK] <unk> what you can do but with reagan it 's that 's where there 's nancy and i that kind of language <unk> [MASK] and so something we kind of knew but you didn 't actually notice syntactically what he was doing i 'll[MASK] go very quickly the question now and this is the really interesting question is what kind of higher level shape is emerging right now in the overall web ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of[MASK] at the cutting edge[MASK] <unk> think what happens there will also happen in the wider system now there was a very interesting article by clay shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago <unk> and this is basically the distribution of links[MASK] on the web to all these various different blogs[MASK] <unk> it follows a power law so that there are a few extremely well linked to popular blogs and a long tail of blogs with very few links <unk> so twenty percent of the blogs get eighty[MASK] <unk> percent of the of the links[MASK] <unk> now this is a very interesting thing it 's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man one modem democracy where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard[MASK] <unk> and so the question is why is this happening it 's not being imposed by fiat from above it 's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now <unk> [MASK] <unk> what 's great about it is that people are working on within seconds of clay publishing this piece people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape <unk>[MASK] <unk> would start appearing and basically the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage if you 're the first site there everybody links to you if you 're the second site there <unk> most people link to you and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future and then you get this kind of[MASK] <unk> and so what dave sifry at technorati started working on literally as shirky started[MASK] after he published his piece was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers <unk> and he started looking at interesting newcomers that don 't have a lot of links that suddenly get[MASK] a bunch of links in the last[MASK]
