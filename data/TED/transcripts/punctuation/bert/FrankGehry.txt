 <unk> 'm going to go right into the slides and all i 'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff and[MASK] my ideas are in my head anyway they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on[MASK] <unk> problem solving for clients[MASK] i either[MASK] convince clients at the end that that i solve their problems or i really do solve their problems because usually they[MASK] seem to like it let me go right into[MASK] the slides can you turn off the[MASK] <unk> in the dark <unk> i don 't want you to see what i 'm doing up here anyway i did this house in santa monica <unk> and it[MASK] got a lot of notoriety in fact <unk> it appeared in a porno comic book <unk> which is the slide on the right[MASK] <unk> this is in venice <unk> i just show it because i want you to know i 'm concerned about context on the left hand side <unk> [MASK] i had the context of those little houses <unk> and i tried to build a building that fit into that context when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird <unk> [MASK] and my premise is that[MASK] they make a lot more[MASK] <unk> sense when they 're photographed or seen[MASK] in in that space <unk> and then <unk> once i deal with the context <unk> i then try to make a[MASK] a[MASK] place that 's comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope you 'll find that slide on the right[MASK] <unk> and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown <unk> l a i was concerned about making a place for the study of law[MASK] <unk> and we continue to work with with this client the building on the[MASK] right at the top is now under construction <unk> the[MASK] garage on the right the gray structure will be torn down finally and[MASK] <unk> several small classrooms will be placed along this[MASK] avenue that we 've created this campus <unk> and[MASK] it all related to the clients and the and the students[MASK] from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place they wanted a sense of place <unk> and so the whole idea here was to create[MASK] that kind of space in downtown[MASK] <unk> in a neighborhood that[MASK] was difficult to to fit into <unk> and it was my[MASK] theory or my point of view that one didn 't[MASK] upstage the neighborhood one made accommodations i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the[MASK] <unk> they were buildings i liked or not [MASK] in the ' 60s i started working with paper furniture[MASK] and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in bloomingdale 's [MASK] we even made flooring walls and everything out of cardboard <unk> [MASK] and the success of it threw me for a loop <unk> i couldn 't deal with the success of furniture i wasn 't[MASK] secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made[MASK] <unk> furniture that nobody would like [MASK] so nobody would like this and it was in this[MASK] <unk> preliminary to these pieces of furniture that ricky and i worked on[MASK] furniture by the slice <unk> and[MASK] after we failed i just kept failing[MASK] the piece on the left[MASK] and that ultimately led to the piece on the right happened when the[MASK] kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket <unk> [MASK] and i put a piece of tape around it as you see there <unk> and realized you could sit[MASK] <unk> on it and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on so it was an accidental discovery[MASK] i got into fish [MASK] <unk> i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism at po mo and[MASK] said that fish were five hundred million years earlier than man [MASK] and if you 're going to go back we might as well go back to the beginning <unk> and so i started[MASK] making these funny things <unk> and they[MASK] <unk> started to have a life of their own[MASK] and got bigger[MASK] as the one glass at the walker <unk> and then [MASK] i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and and tried to translate what i was learning about[MASK] the form of the fish and the movement and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it accidental again it was it was[MASK] an[MASK] <unk> intuitive kind of thing and i just kept going with it and made this proposal for a building which was only a proposal [MASK] i did this building in japan <unk> i was[MASK] taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed <unk> and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff [MASK] <unk> i was really drunk[MASK] i was asked to do some sketches on napkins [MASK] and i made some sketches on napkins little boxes and morandi like things that i used to do <unk> [MASK] and the client said why no fish and so i made a[MASK] <unk> it 's harder to do it[MASK] <unk> i work with a little once in a while told me i couldn 't do it <unk> and so that made it even more[MASK] exciting <unk> but he was right i couldn 't do the tail i started to get the head ok but the tail[MASK] i couldn 't do it was pretty hard the thing on the right is a snake form a ziggurat[MASK] <unk> and i put them together and you walk between them <unk> it was a dialog with the context[MASK] again now if you saw a picture of this as it was published in architectural record[MASK] they didn 't show the context so you would think god what a pushy guy this is but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering[MASK] <unk> as for craft and technology and all those things that you 've all been talking about [MASK] i was thrown for a complete loop this was built in six months the way we sent drawings to[MASK] <unk> magic computer in michigan that does carved models <unk> and we used to make foam models <unk> which that thing scanned <unk> we made the drawings of the fish and the[MASK] scales and[MASK] when i got there <unk> everything was perfect[MASK] except the tail [MASK] so i decided to cut off the head and the[MASK] <unk> and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker <unk> and it 's one of the nicest pieces i 've ever made i think and then jay[MASK] <unk> and client asked me to do his[MASK] headquarters building in l a for reasons[MASK] we don 't want to talk about it got delayed <unk> toxic waste i guess is the[MASK] <unk> so we built a temporary building i 'm getting good at temporary and we put a conference room in that 's a fish [MASK] and finally jay dragged me to my hometown toronto canada and[MASK] there is a story it 's a real story about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday bringing it home putting it[MASK] <unk> when i went to sleep the next day it wasn 't there and the next night we had gefilte fish [MASK] and so i set up this[MASK] interior for jay 's offices[MASK] and i made a pedestal for a sculpture <unk> and he didn 't buy a sculpture so i made one i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my[MASK] <unk> we 've been friends for a long time <unk> and we 've started to work on things a few years ago <unk> we did a[MASK] <unk> those two little boys are my sons <unk> and they were claes ' assistants in the play he was the[MASK] swiss army knife <unk> he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter[MASK] <unk> and i was frankie p toronto <unk> p for palladio dressed up like the at & t building by claes [MASK] with a fish hat <unk> [MASK] the highlight of the performance was at the at the end [MASK] this beautiful object the swiss army knife <unk> which[MASK] i get credit for participating in[MASK] i can tell you it 's totally an oldenburg i had nothing to do with it the only[MASK] thing i did was [MASK] i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal because i love sailing we made it[MASK] into a sailing craft [MASK] i 've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing i do it because it 's a[MASK] curious thing in the culture[MASK] <unk> are made in such great quantities absorbed in such great quantities <unk> and there 's so much denial about them [MASK] people hate it and i 'm fascinated with that which like the paper furniture it 's one of those materials and i 'm always drawn to that [MASK] and so i did a lot of[MASK] dirty things with chain link which nobody will forgive me for but claes made homage to it in the loyola law school <unk> and that chain[MASK] <unk> link is really expensive it 's in perspective and everything [MASK] and then we did a camp together for children with cancer <unk> [MASK] and you can see we[MASK] started making a building together of course the milk can is his [MASK] but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other like a morandi like the little bottles[MASK] <unk> composing them like a still life <unk> and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together[MASK] then jay chiat asked me to do this building <unk>[MASK] on this funny lot in venice <unk> and i started with this three piece[MASK] <unk> and you entered in the middle and jay asked me what i was going to do with the piece in the middle <unk> and he pushed that and one day i had a oh well [MASK] the other way i had the binoculars from claes and i put them there and i could never get rid of them after that[MASK] oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of[MASK] the real proposal <unk> it made my building look sick <unk> and it was this[MASK] <unk> interaction between[MASK] that kind of up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting it led to the building on the left [MASK] and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars[MASK] i have a hard time connecting with[MASK] the craft the whole[MASK] thing about my house the whole use of[MASK] rough carpentry and everything was the frustration with the crafts available i said if i can 't get the craft[MASK] that i want i 'll use the craft i can get there were plenty of models for that in rauschenberg and jasper johns and many artists who were[MASK] <unk> making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials[MASK] i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture[MASK] and it was all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls[MASK] the metalworkers for the most part do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff i was given an opportunity[MASK] <unk> design an exhibit for the metalworkers ' unions of america and canada[MASK] in washington <unk> and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all[MASK] future metal buildings <unk> etc etc and it 's working very well to have these[MASK] people these[MASK] <unk> i just tell the stories it 's a way of connecting at least with some of those[MASK] people that are so important to the realization[MASK] of architecture [MASK] the metal continued into a building herman miller in sacramento <unk> and it 's just a complex[MASK] <unk> herman miller has this philosophy of having a place a people place i mean it 's kind of a trite[MASK] thing to say but it is[MASK] real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the people would come and where the people working would[MASK] interact so it 's out in the middle of[MASK] nowhere[MASK] <unk> approach it <unk> it 's copper and galvanize i used the galvanize and copper in a very[MASK] light gauge so it would buckle <unk> i spent a lot of time[MASK] undoing richard meier 's aesthetic <unk> everybody 's trying to get the panels perfect and i[MASK] <unk> to get them[MASK] sloppy and fuzzy and they end up looking like stone <unk> this is the[MASK] central area there 's a ramp and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman stanley was[MASK] instrumental in my getting this job <unk> and when i[MASK] was awarded the contract i at the very beginning asked the client if they would[MASK] let stanley do a cameo piece with me because these were ideas that we were talking about[MASK] <unk> things next to each other making it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city maybe [MASK] and so stanley did the little dome thing <unk> and we did it over the phone and by fax he would send me a fax and[MASK] show me something he 'd made a building with a dome[MASK] <unk> with a simpler building <unk> but he put[MASK] some funny details on it and[MASK] he moved it closer to my building and so i decided to put him in a[MASK] in a depression i put him in a hole and made a kind of a[MASK] hole that he sits in and so then he put two bridges this all happened on the fax going back and forth over a couple[MASK] <unk> weeks ' period and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it <unk> and so then i put this big billboard behind it and[MASK] it was a very prominent building off the freeway and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of[MASK] i thought the language of the neighborhood <unk> which had these cornices projecting cornices mine got a little exuberant[MASK] but i[MASK] used[MASK] <unk> which is a beautiful material <unk> and it turns green in one hundred years instead of like copper in ten or fifteen[MASK] <unk> we redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space and[MASK] it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved because they have very strict kind of design guideline[MASK] and they wouldn 't normally think i would fit them <unk> [MASK] the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making[MASK] panels and[MASK] fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building [MASK] <unk> ramblas for some film festival i did the hollywood sign going and coming made a building out of it <unk> and[MASK] they built it i flew in one night and took this picture but[MASK] they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me <unk> [MASK] and then more metal and[MASK] <unk> in santa monica a little shopping center <unk> [MASK] and this is a laser laboratory at the university of iowa[MASK] in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back <unk> it 's the[MASK] the support labs which by some coincidence[MASK] required no windows and[MASK] the shape[MASK] fit perfectly i just joined the points <unk> in the curved part there 's all the mechanical equipment <unk>[MASK] that solid wall behind it is a[MASK] pipe chase a pipe canyon and so it was an opportunity that i seized because i didn 't have to have any protruding ducts[MASK] <unk> or vents or things in this form it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it [MASK] this is a small house[MASK] somewhere[MASK] <unk> they 've been building it so long i don 't remember where it is it[MASK] 's in the west valley <unk> and we started with the stream[MASK] and built the house[MASK] <unk> along the stream dammed it up to make a lake <unk> these are the models the[MASK] reality with the lake the workmanship is pretty bad [MASK] and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house when you have to do something really cheaply[MASK] it 's hard to get[MASK] perfect corners and[MASK] that big metal thing is a passage[MASK] <unk> you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom which is on the right it[MASK] 's kind of like a whole built town <unk> [MASK] i was asked to do a[MASK] hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at yale i thought it was fitting for me to[MASK] <unk> be doing that [MASK] this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota[MASK] <unk> the owners[MASK] had a dilemma they asked philip to do it he was too busy <unk> he[MASK] <unk> ended up having to make it a sculpture because the dilemma was how do you build a building[MASK] that doesn 't look like the language is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub divided etc etc <unk> you 've got the idea and so we finally ended up making it these people are art collectors <unk> [MASK] and we finally made it[MASK] so it appears very sculptural from the[MASK] the main house and all the windows are on the other side[MASK] <unk> and the building is very[MASK] sculptural as you walk around it it 's made of metal and the brown stuff is[MASK] <unk> 't work i keep trying to make it work in this case we learned how to detail it [MASK] in cleveland <unk> there 's[MASK] burnham mall on the left it 's never been finished going out to the lake[MASK] <unk> you can[MASK] <unk> and we had the opportunity to build a[MASK] building on this site there 's a railroad track this is the[MASK] city hall over here somewhere and the courthouse <unk> and[MASK] the centerline of the mall goes out burnham had[MASK] designed a railroad station that was never built and so we followed sohio is on the axis here <unk> and we followed the axis and[MASK] <unk> kind of goalposts <unk> and this is our building which is a[MASK] corporate headquarters for an insurance company <unk> we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top folded[MASK] the health[MASK] <unk> you drive down so it 's about a 10 story c clamp [MASK] and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and[MASK] an idea for a very fancy automobile entry this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries <unk> [MASK] and this would be a hotel so the centerline of this thing[MASK] we 'd preserve it <unk> and it would start to work[MASK] <unk> with the scale of the new buildings by pelli and kohn pederson fox <unk> etc that are underway[MASK] it 's hard to do high rise i[MASK] i feel much more comfortable down here <unk> this is a piece of property in brentwood and[MASK] a long time ago about ' eighty two or something after my house i designed a house for myself that would be a[MASK] village of several pavilions around a courtyard and and[MASK] the owner of this lot[MASK] worked for me and built that actual model on the left and she came back[MASK] <unk> guess wealthier or something something happened and[MASK] asked me to design a house for her on this site [MASK] and[MASK] following that basic idea of the village <unk> [MASK] we changed it as we got into it <unk> i locked the the house into the site by cutting the back end here you see on the photographs[MASK] <unk> of the site[MASK] slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom which i designed like a kind of a barge <unk> [MASK] looking like a boat and[MASK] <unk> the dome was a request from the client she wanted a dome somewhere in the house she didn 't care where [MASK] when you sleep in this bedroom i hope i mean i haven 't slept in it yet i 've offered to marry her so i could sleep there <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] she said i didn 't have to do that but[MASK] <unk> you feel like you 're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake and it 's very private the landscape is being built around to create a private garden <unk> and then up above[MASK] there 's a garden[MASK] on this side of the living room and one on the other[MASK] <unk> know how to do it from here focus the one on the right it[MASK] 's up there <unk> left it 's my right <unk> [MASK] anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees that 's the living[MASK] <unk> you enter into the living room and then so on [MASK] this is the bedroom you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here[MASK] going into the lake and the[MASK] bed is back in this space with windows looking out onto the lake these[MASK] <unk> things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow[MASK] lot [MASK] the material is lead copper like in the building in boston [MASK] and so it was an intent to[MASK] make this small piece of land it 's one hundred by two hundred and fifty[MASK] into a kind of an estate[MASK] by separating these areas and[MASK] making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it[MASK] and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table[MASK] <unk> looks like i got a baldessari painting for free but the idea is the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house[MASK] outside eventually this will be screened these trees will come up[MASK] and it will be very private and you[MASK] feel like you 're in your own kind of village <unk> [MASK] this is for[MASK] <unk> michael eisner disney we 're doing some work for him <unk> and this is in[MASK] anaheim california <unk> and it 's a freeway building you go go under this bridge[MASK] at about sixty five miles an hour <unk> and there 's another bridge here and you 're through this room in a split second <unk> and the building will sort of[MASK] <unk> on the backside it 's much more humane entrance <unk> dining hall etc <unk> and then this thing here[MASK] i 'm hoping as you drive by you 'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it kind of a[MASK] fun thing to do [MASK] i 'm doing a building in switzerland basel <unk> which is an office building for a furniture company <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] we struggled with the image[MASK] these are the early studies but[MASK] they have to sell furniture to normal people so if i did the building[MASK] and it was too fancy then people might say well the furniture looks ok in his thing but no it ain 't going to look good in my normal building [MASK] so we 've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here <unk> and we 've taken the conference facilities and made a villa[MASK] out of them so that the communal space is[MASK] <unk> very sculptural and separate <unk> and you 're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of[MASK] interaction between these pieces <unk> this is in paris along the <unk>[MASK] <unk> over here the minister of finance the guy that moved from the louvre goes in here <unk> there 's a new library across the river[MASK] <unk> and back in here in this already treed park <unk> we 're doing a very dense building called the american center which has a theater[MASK] apartments <unk> dance school an art[MASK] museum <unk> restaurants and all kinds of it 's a very dense program bookstores[MASK] <unk> in a very tight small this is the ground level and the french have this[MASK] extraordinary way of[MASK] screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off they call it the plan coupe <unk> and[MASK] i struggled with that thing[MASK] how to get around the corner <unk> these are the models for[MASK] <unk> this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing[MASK] so i understood the problem i was trying to get around this plan coupe how do you do it apartments etc[MASK] <unk> kind of study models we did [MASK] and the one on the left is pretty awful <unk> you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was[MASK] built <unk> but out of it came finally this resolution where the[MASK] elevator piece worked frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here and then this kind of[MASK] <unk> with this balcony and the skirt kind of like a ballerina[MASK] lifting her skirt to let you into the[MASK] foyer the restaurants here the apartments[MASK] and the theater etc so it would all be built in stone in french limestone <unk> except for this metal piece and[MASK] it faces into a park and the idea was to make this express[MASK] the energy of this [MASK] on the side[MASK] <unk> facing the street it 's much[MASK] more normal except i slipped a few mansards down so that coming on the point these housing units[MASK] made a gesture to the corner <unk> [MASK] <unk> you guys have any ideas for it please contact me i don 't know what to do <unk> [MASK] jay chiat is a glutton for punishment and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons <unk> [MASK] and it 's got a fish <unk> and i keep thinking this is going to be the last fish [MASK] it 's like a drug addict i say i 'm not going to do it anymore i don 't want to do it anymore i 'm not going to do it[MASK] <unk> i do it there it is but it 's the living room and this piece here is[MASK] i don 't know what it is i just added it so that we 'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out[MASK] <unk> and i 've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier <unk> we 've had a lot of fun working together i think[MASK] i 'm from mars for them and they are for me but somehow we all manage to work together and[MASK] and the hotel that tony baxter 's group is doing[MASK] out here <unk> and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants and[MASK] another restaurant <unk> <unk> what i did because of the paris skies being quite dull i made a light grid[MASK] that 's perpendicular to the train station to the route of the train <unk> it looks like it[MASK] <unk> it 's kind of[MASK] been there <unk> and then crashed all these simpler forms into it the light grid will have a light be lit up[MASK] at night and and give a kind of light ceiling[MASK] <unk> rhine across from basel <unk> we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum <unk> [MASK] and i tried to there 's a nick grimshaw building over here there 's an oldenburg sculpture over here i tried to make a[MASK] relationship urbanistically and i don 't gave good slides to show it 's just been completed but[MASK] this piece here is this building and these pieces here and here and as you pass by it 's always[MASK] <unk> part you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall[MASK] neighborhood[MASK] <unk> it 's plaster and just zinc <unk> [MASK] and you wonder if this is a museum what it 's going to be like inside[MASK] <unk> going to be so busy and crazy that[MASK] you wouldn 't show anything <unk> and just wait i 'm so cunning and clever[MASK] i made it quiet and wonderful <unk> but on the outside it does[MASK] scream out at you a bit <unk> [MASK] it 's actually[MASK] basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff and from the building in the back you see it[MASK] <unk> iceberg floating by in the hills[MASK] down and becomes that one so it 's pretty quiet inside <unk> [MASK] this is the disney hall the concert hall <unk> it 's[MASK] a complicated project it has a chamber hall <unk> it 's related to an existing[MASK] chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and[MASK] <unk> and caring <unk> and it 's not a great building but i approached it optimistically that we would make a[MASK] compositional relationship between us[MASK] that would strengthen both of us and the plan of this it 's a concert hall this is the foyer[MASK] <unk> which is kind of a garden structure there 's commercial at the ground floor these are offices which really[MASK] in the competition we didn 't have to design but finally there 's a hotel there <unk> [MASK] these were the kind of relationships made to the chandler <unk> composing these elevations together[MASK] and relating them to the buildings that existed[MASK] <unk> in the competition gave us criteria which led to this compartmentalized[MASK] scheme <unk> which we found out after the competition would not work at all but[MASK] everybody liked these forms and liked the space and so that 's one of the problems of a competition you have to then try and[MASK] get that back in some way <unk> and we studied[MASK] many models <unk> this was our original model these were the three[MASK] buildings that were the ideal the concertgebouw boston and berlin <unk> everybody liked the surround[MASK] <unk> actually this is the smallest hall in size and it has more seats than any of[MASK] <unk> because it has double balconies our client doesn 't want balconies so[MASK] and when we met our new acoustician he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape <unk> and[MASK] we tried many shapes trying to get[MASK] the energy of the original design within an acoustical[MASK] acceptable format[MASK] <unk> finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the[MASK] sloping outside walls which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later[MASK] decided they weren 't but now we have them and[MASK] our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and and[MASK] out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room[MASK] <unk> the idea <unk> [MASK] and the corners would have skylights and[MASK] these columns would be structural <unk> and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit [MASK] and create[MASK] intimacy now [MASK] <unk> this is not a final design these are just[MASK] on the way to being and so i[MASK] wouldn 't take it literally except the feeling of the space <unk> we studied the acoustics with laser[MASK] stuff <unk> and they bounce them off this and see where it all works but you get the sense of the hall in section[MASK] most halls come straight down into a[MASK] <unk> this case we 're opening it back up[MASK] and getting skylights in the four corners and so it will be quite a different[MASK] shape [MASK] the[MASK] original building <unk> [MASK] because it was frog like fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well when you get into a box it 's harder to do it[MASK] and here we are struggling with how to put the hotel in[MASK] <unk> teapot i designed for alessi <unk> i just stuck it on there <unk> but[MASK] this is how i do work i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away and of course it 's not going to look like that but[MASK] it is the[MASK] crazy way i tend to work <unk> and then finally[MASK] <unk> i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate[MASK] bank tower the highest building in l a larry halprin is doing the stairs and[MASK] i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake [MASK] laughter it 's a public space and i made it kind of a garden structure and you can go in it it 's a kiva and larry 's putting some water in there <unk> and it[MASK] works much better than a fish in barcelona i was asked to do a fish and[MASK] <unk> 're working on that at the foot of a ritz carlton tower being done by skidmore owings and merrill and the <unk> ritz carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel[MASK] much like those old gas tanks <unk> and so we took the[MASK] language of this exposed steel and and used it perverted it into the form of the[MASK] and created a kind of a 19th century contraption that looks like [MASK] that will sit this is the beach and the harbor out in front <unk> and this is really a shopping center with department stores <unk> and we split these bridges[MASK] originally this was all solid with a hole in it we[MASK] cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel[MASK] <unk> this to the hotel people the other day <unk> and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz carlton anymore [MASK] because of this fish [MASK] and finally i just threw these in lou danziger i didn 't expect lou danziger[MASK] <unk> to be here but this is a building i did for him in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four i think a little studio and it 's[MASK] sadly for sale time goes on <unk> and this is my son[MASK] working with me on a small fast food thing[MASK] he designed the robot as the cashier[MASK] <unk> head moves and i did the rest of it and the food wasn 't as good as the stuff and so it[MASK] failed it should have been the other way around the food should have been good first it didn 't work[MASK]
