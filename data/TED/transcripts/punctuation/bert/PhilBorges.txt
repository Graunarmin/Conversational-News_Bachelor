 <unk> a linguist said that of the six thousand languages spoken on earth[MASK] <unk> three thousand aren 't spoken by the children so that in one generation we 're going to halve our cultural diversity [MASK] he went on to say that every two weeks an elder goes to the grave[MASK] carrying the last spoken word of that culture so an entire philosophy [MASK] a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically[MASK] <unk> gleaned over centuries goes away <unk> and this happens every two weeks [MASK] so for the last twenty years since my dental experience i[MASK] have been traveling the world and coming back[MASK] with stories about some of these people[MASK] <unk> what i 'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you <unk> this is tamdin she is a <unk>[MASK] nun she was thrown in prison in tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard[MASK] protesting the occupation of her country and when i met her she had just[MASK] taken a walk over the himalayas from lhasa the capital of tibet into nepal <unk> across to india[MASK] thirty days[MASK] to meet her leader the dalai lama the dalai lama lives in dharamsala india <unk> so i took this picture three days after she arrived <unk> [MASK] and she had this beat up pair of tennis shoes on with her toes sticking out and she crossed in march <unk> and there 's a lot of snow at eighteen thousand five hundred feet in march[MASK] <unk> his whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising when the dalai lama had to leave[MASK] tibet <unk> and he was beaten starved[MASK] <unk> tortured lost all his teeth while in prison <unk> and when i met him he was a kind gentle old man <unk> [MASK] and it really impressed me i met him two weeks after he got out of prison[MASK] that he went through that experience and ended up with the demeanor that he had <unk> [MASK] so i was in dharamsala meeting these people [MASK] and i 'd spent about five weeks there <unk> and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet into dharamsala[MASK] <unk> and it just so happened on the fifth week there was a public teaching by the dalai lama <unk>[MASK] <unk> and i was watching this crowd of monks and nuns many of which i had just interviewed and heard their stories <unk> [MASK] and i watched their faces <unk> and they gave us a[MASK] <unk> little fm radio and we could listen to the translation of his teachings and what he said was [MASK] treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels because it 's your enemies[MASK] that[MASK] build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment <unk>[MASK] that hit me so hard <unk> telling these people that had been through this[MASK] <unk> two months later i went into[MASK] tibet <unk> and i started interviewing the people there taking my photographs that 's what i do i interview and do portraits <unk> [MASK] and this is a little girl i took her portrait up on top of the jokhang temple <unk> [MASK] and i 'd snuck in because it 's totally illegal to have a picture of the dalai lama in tibet it 's the quickest way you can get arrested <unk> [MASK] so i snuck in a bunch of little[MASK] wallet sized pictures of the dalai lama <unk> and i would hand them out and when i gave them to the people [MASK] they 'd either hold them to their heart or they 'd hold them up to their head and just stay there <unk> and this is[MASK] well at the time i did this ten years ago that was thirty six years after the dalai lama had left <unk> so[MASK] i was going in interviewing these people and doing their portraits[MASK] <unk> is jigme and her sister sonam <unk> and they live up on the chang tang the tibetan plateau way in the western part of the country <unk> [MASK] this is at seventeen thousand feet <unk> [MASK] and they had just come down from the high pastures at eighteen thousand feet same thing gave her a picture she held it up to her forehead <unk> [MASK] and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these because i 'm setting up lights and checking my lights[MASK] <unk> lights <unk> and when i showed her her polaroid she screamed and ran into her tent <unk> [MASK] this is tenzin gyatso <unk> he was found to be the buddha of compassion at the age of two out in a peasant 's[MASK] house <unk> way out in the middle of nowhere at the age of four he was installed as the[MASK] <unk> dalai lama as a teenager he faced[MASK] the invasion of his country and had to deal with it he was the leader of the country <unk> eight years later <unk> when they discovered there was a plot to kill him [MASK] they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback and took the same trip that[MASK] tamdin did[MASK] and he 's never been back to his country since <unk>[MASK] <unk> to a severe political and human rights issue <unk> [MASK] and the young people young tibetans are starting to say listen this doesn 't work you know violence as a political tool is all the rage right now <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] he still is holding this line[MASK] <unk> so this is our icon to <unk>[MASK] in our world one of our living icons <unk> [MASK] this is another leader of his people this is moi this is in the ecuadorian amazon <unk> and moi is thirty five years old <unk> and[MASK] this area of the ecuadorian amazon[MASK] <unk> and in this period of time since that time[MASK] as much oil or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident [MASK] was spilled in this little area of the amazon and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move [MASK] and moi[MASK] belongs to the huaorani tribe and they 're known as very[MASK] <unk> they 've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil oil workers with spears and blowguns <unk> [MASK] and we spent i was with a team[MASK] two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt <unk> this was on a monkey hunt <unk> [MASK] hunting with curare tipped darts <unk> and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible[MASK] they could hear things smell things see things i couldn 't see and i couldn 't even see the monkeys that they were[MASK] getting with these darts <unk> this is yadira and yadira is[MASK] five years old she 's in a tribe that 's neighboring the huaorani and her tribe has had to move three times in the[MASK] <unk> last ten years because of the oil spills <unk> and we never hear about that and the latest[MASK] infraction against these people[MASK] is [MASK] as part of plan colombia we 're spraying paraquat or round up whatever it is we 're defoliating thousands of acres of the ecuadorian amazon in our war on drugs [MASK] and these people are the people who take the brunt of it[MASK] <unk> this is mengatoue he 's the shaman of the huaorani <unk> and[MASK] he said he said to us you know i 'm an older man now i 'm getting tired you know[MASK] i 'm tired of spearing these oil workers <unk> i wish they would just go away <unk> [MASK] and i was i usually travel alone when i do my work but i did this[MASK] <unk> hosted a program for discovery <unk> and when i went down with the team i was[MASK] quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people especially into the huaorani <unk> deep into the huaorani tribe and[MASK] as it turned out these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in[MASK] <unk> one of the things i did[MASK] just before nine eleven august of two thousand and one[MASK] i took my son <unk> dax who was sixteen at the time [MASK] and i took him to pakistan <unk> [MASK] because at first i wanted you know i 've taken him on a couple of trips <unk> but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less i

shamanism which is[MASK] is an interesting phenomenon <unk> but around the world[MASK] <unk> they go into trance in different ways and in pakistan [MASK] the way they do it is they burn juniper juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke <unk> [MASK] and they 're all praying to the mountain gods as they[MASK] <unk> getting kids used to different realities i think is so important what dan dennett said the other day[MASK] having a curriculum where they study different religions [MASK] just to make a mental flexibility give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place[MASK] <unk> and all the security issues they they cause us so one thing we did[MASK] five years ago we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the united states so we first hooked up a[MASK] spot in the navajo

rolling out all over this is our site <unk> in ollantaytambo peru four years ago <unk> where they first saw their first computers now they have computers in their classrooms <unk> [MASK] and the way we 've[MASK] done this we teach digital storytelling to these kids and we have them tell stories about issues[MASK] <unk> in their community that they care about and this is in peru where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up [MASK] and the way we do it is we do it in workshops and we bring people who want to learn <unk>[MASK] digital workflow and storytelling and have them[MASK] work with the kids [MASK] and just this last year we 've taken a group of teenagers in and this has worked the best so our dream is to bring teenagers together[MASK] <unk> community service

generator and a digital projector and we 're projecting it up against a barn and showing one of the movies that they made [MASK] <unk> the other thing i wanted to give indigenous people[MASK] a voice that was one of the big motivating factors <unk> but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country <unk> [MASK] national geographic just did a roper study of eighteen to twenty six year olds[MASK] in our country and in nine other industrialized countries it was a two million dollar study[MASK] <unk> united states came in second to last[MASK] in geographic knowledge seventy
