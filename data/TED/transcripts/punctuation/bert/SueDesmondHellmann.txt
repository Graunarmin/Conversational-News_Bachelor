 <unk> some introductions my mom jennie took this picture that 's my dad frank in the middle and on his[MASK] <unk> john patrick 's sitting on his lap and kevin michael 's on his right [MASK] and in the pale blue windbreaker <unk> susan diane me [MASK] i loved growing up in a big family <unk> and one of my favorite things was picking names <unk> [MASK] but by the time child number seven came along <unk> we had nearly run out of middle[MASK] <unk> names <unk> it was a long deliberation before we finally settled[MASK] on jennifer bridget every parent in this audience knows the joy[MASK] and excitement of picking a new baby 's name <unk> [MASK] and i was excited and thrilled to help my mom in that special ceremonial moment [MASK] <unk> it 's not like that everywhere <unk> [MASK] i travel a lot and i see a lot <unk> [MASK] but it took me by surprise to learn in an area of ethiopia <unk> parents delay picking the names for their new babies by a month or more [MASK] why delay why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time[MASK] <unk> delay because they 're afraid [MASK] they 're afraid their baby will die <unk> and this loss might be a little more bearable without a name [MASK] a face without a name[MASK] might help them feel just a little less attached <unk> so here we are in one part of the world a time of joy[MASK] <unk> dreaming of the future of that child[MASK] while in another world <unk> [MASK] parents are filled with dread not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks [MASK] how can that be how can it be that two point six million babies[MASK] die around the world before they[MASK] <unk> 're even one month old <unk> two point six million that 's the population of vancouver <unk> [MASK] and the shocking thing is why in too many cases we simply don 't know[MASK] <unk> now <unk> i remember recently seeing an updated pie chart <unk> and the pie chart was labeled[MASK] <unk> of death in children under five worldwide [MASK] and there was a pretty big section of that pie chart about forty percent forty percent was labeled neonatal [MASK] now neonatal is not a cause of death neonatal is simply an adjective an adjective that means that the[MASK] <unk> i 'm a scientist i 'm a doctor <unk> i want to fix things <unk> but you can 't fix what you can 't define [MASK] so our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents is to answer the question <unk> why are babies dying[MASK] <unk> talk about a new approach an approach that i feel will not only help us know why babies are dying <unk> [MASK] but is beginning to completely transform[MASK] the whole field of global health [MASK] it 's called precision public health for me precision medicine comes from a very special[MASK] <unk> place [MASK] i trained as a cancer doctor an oncologist <unk> i got into it because i wanted to help people feel better <unk> [MASK] but too often my treatments made them feel worse [MASK] i still remember young women being driven to my clinic[MASK] <unk> who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers [MASK] they were so weak from the treatment i had given them <unk> [MASK] but at the time in those front lines in the war on cancer <unk> we had few tools [MASK] and the tools we did have couldn 't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard[MASK] and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve[MASK] and so the side effects that you 're all very familiar with hair loss being sick to your stomach <unk> having a suppressed immune system so infection was a constant threat[MASK] were always[MASK] surrounding us [MASK] and then i moved to the biotechnology industry <unk> and i got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job[MASK] of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells it 's a drug called herceptin <unk> [MASK] and what herceptin allowed us to do is to precisely target[MASK] breast cancer at the time the scariest form of breast cancer <unk> and that precision let us hit hard the[MASK] <unk> cancer cells while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells [MASK] a huge breakthrough <unk> it felt like a miracle [MASK] so much so that today <unk> we 're harnessing all those tools[MASK] big data consumer[MASK] <unk> gene sequencing and more to tackle a broad variety of diseases [MASK] that 's allowing us to target individuals with the right remedies at the right time [MASK] precision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy everything changed <unk> [MASK] and i want everything to change again [MASK] so i 've been[MASK] <unk> asking myself why should we limit this smarter [MASK] more precise better way to tackle diseases to the rich world now[MASK] don 't misunderstand me i 'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like herceptin to the developing world <unk> although i 'd actually kind of like that[MASK] <unk> what i am talking about is moving from this precise targeting for individuals to tackle public health problems[MASK] in populations <unk> [MASK] now <unk> ok i know probably you 're thinking she 's crazy [MASK] you can 't do that that 's too ambitious [MASK] but here 's the thing [MASK] we 're already doing this in a limited way and it 's already starting to make a big difference[MASK] <unk> difference <unk> [MASK] so here 's what 's happening now[MASK] i told you i trained as a cancer doctor <unk> [MASK] but like many many doctors who trained in san francisco in the ' 80s i also trained as an aids doctor <unk> [MASK] it was a terrible time <unk> aids was a death sentence all my[MASK] <unk> things are better but hiv aids remains a terrible global challenge [MASK] worldwide about seventeen million women are living with hiv [MASK] we know[MASK] that when these women become pregnant they can transfer the virus to their baby <unk> [MASK] we also know in the absence of therapy <unk> half those babies will not survive until the age of two[MASK] <unk> but we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee that she will not transmit the virus to the baby <unk> so what do we do [MASK] <unk> approach kind of like that blast of chemo would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world that would do the job[MASK] <unk> not practical [MASK] so instead we target those areas where hiv rates are the highest <unk> [MASK] we know in certain countries in sub saharan africa we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest [MASK] this precision approach to a public health problem has cut by nearly half hiv transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years[MASK] screening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world is a powerful example[MASK] of how precision public health can change things on a big scale[MASK] <unk> how do we do that we can do that because we know <unk> we know who to target [MASK] what to target <unk> where to target and how to target and that for me are the important elements of precision public health [MASK] who what where and how [MASK] but[MASK] let 's go back to the two point six million babies who die before they 're one month old here 's the problem we just[MASK] <unk> don 't know [MASK] it may seem unbelievable [MASK] but the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality in those countries with the highest infant mortality is a conversation with mom [MASK] a health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child was the baby[MASK] <unk> did they have a fever and that conversation may take place as long as three months[MASK] after the baby has died <unk> now put yourself in the shoes of that mom [MASK] it 's a heartbreaking <unk> excruciating conversation and even worse[MASK] it 's not that helpful because we might know there was a fever or[MASK] <unk> know why [MASK] so in the absence of knowing that knowledge we cannot prevent that mom that family or other families in that community from suffering the same tragedy <unk> [MASK] but what if we applied a precision public health approach [MASK] let 's say for example we find out in certain areas of africa that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection transferred from the mother to the baby[MASK] <unk> as group b streptococcus [MASK] in the absence of treatment mom has a seven times higher chance that her next baby will die <unk> [MASK] once we define the problem <unk> we can prevent that death with something as cheap and safe as penicillin <unk> [MASK] we can do that because then[MASK] <unk> and that 's the point <unk> once we know we can bring the right interventions[MASK] to the right population in the right places to save lives [MASK] with this approach <unk> and with these interventions and others like them <unk> i have no doubt[MASK] that a precision public health approach can help our world achieve our[MASK] <unk> goal <unk> and that would translate into a million babies ' lives saved every single year [MASK] one million babies every single year <unk> [MASK] and why would we stop there [MASK] a much more powerful approach to public health imagine what might be possible why couldn 't we more effectively[MASK] <unk> tackle malnutrition [MASK] why wouldn 't we prevent cervical cancer in women [MASK] and why not eradicate malaria yes clap for that [MASK] so you know i live in two different worlds one[MASK] world populated by scientists and another world populated by public health professionals [MASK] the promise of precision public health is to bring these two worlds together <unk> [MASK] but you know <unk> we all live in two worlds the rich world[MASK] and the poor world and what i 'm most excited about about precision public health is bridging these two worlds[MASK] <unk> every day in the rich world we 're bringing incredible talent and tools everything at our disposal[MASK] to precisely target diseases in ways[MASK] i never imagined would be possible <unk> surely <unk> we can tap into that kind of talent and tools[MASK] <unk> to stop babies dying in the poor world if we did <unk> then every parent[MASK] would have the confidence to name their child the moment that child is born [MASK] daring to dream that that child 's life will be measured in decades not days <unk> thank you[MASK]
