 <unk> like you to come back with me[MASK] just for a few minutes to a dark night in china the night i met my husband it was a city so long ago that it was[MASK] <unk> so i[MASK] went to a party <unk> i sat down next to a stout middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie <unk> [MASK] and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar there in china specifically to study <unk> sino soviet relations [MASK] what a gift it was to the eager young foreign correspondent that i was then i 'd pump him for information[MASK] <unk> for the stories i plan to write i talk to him for hours <unk> only[MASK] months later <unk> i discover who he really was <unk> [MASK] he was the china representative for the american soybean association [MASK] i don 't understand soybeans <unk> you told me you were a fulbright scholar[MASK] <unk> you have talked to me if i told you we 're in soybeans[MASK] <unk> we did [MASK] and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be [MASK] he was a chinese scholar who later[MASK] <unk> a licensed pilot <unk> he had once been a san francisco cable car operator <unk> he was an expert in swine nutrition dairy cattle <unk> dixieland jazz <unk> film noir and we did travel the country <unk> [MASK] and the world [MASK] and we did have a lot of kids <unk> we followed my job and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn 't do <unk> [MASK] so when we[MASK] found the cancer it doesn 't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other <unk> we believed[MASK] that if we were smart enough[MASK] and strong enough and brave enough and we worked hard enough <unk> we could keep him from[MASK] <unk> and for years it seemed like we were succeeding <unk> [MASK] the surgeon emerged from the surgery what 'd he say he said what surgeons always say we got it all [MASK] then there was a setback when the pathologists[MASK] looked at the kidney cancer closely <unk> it turned out to be a rare exceedingly aggressive type with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in[MASK] in several weeks at most <unk> and yet[MASK] he did not die <unk> mysteriously <unk> he lived on [MASK] he coached little league for our son <unk> [MASK] he built a playhouse for our daughter[MASK] <unk> and meanwhile i 'm burying myself in the internet looking for specialists <unk> i 'm looking for a cure [MASK] so a year goes by[MASK] before the cancer as cancers do[MASK] <unk> and with it comes another death sentence this time nine months <unk> [MASK] so we try another treatment aggressive <unk> nasty <unk> it makes him so sick he has to quit it yet still he lives on [MASK] then another year goes by two years go by more specialists we take the kids to italy <unk> we take the kids to australia [MASK] and then more years pass[MASK] the cancer begins to grow [MASK] this time there 's new treatments on the horizon <unk> they 're exotic they 're experimental [MASK] they 're going to attack the cancer in new ways <unk> so he enters a clinical trial <unk> [MASK] and it works the cancer begins to shrink <unk> and for the third time [MASK] we 've dodged[MASK] <unk> now i ask you how do i feel[MASK] when the time finally comes[MASK] and there 's another dark night <unk> sometime between midnight and two a m this time it 's on the intensive care ward[MASK] when a twentysomething resident that i 've never met before[MASK] tells me that terence is dying <unk> perhaps tonight <unk> so what do i say when he says[MASK] <unk> what do you want me to do [MASK] there 's another drug out there it 's newer it 's more powerful he started it just two weeks ago <unk> [MASK] perhaps there 's still hope ahead <unk> [MASK] so what do i say i say keep him alive if you can [MASK] and terence died six days later <unk> [MASK] so we fought we struggled we triumphed[MASK] it was an exhilarating fight and i 'd repeat the fight today without a moment 's hesitation [MASK] we fought together <unk> we lived together <unk> it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life[MASK] into seven of the most glorious it was also an expensive fight[MASK] <unk> was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end of life care and of healthcare for all of us <unk> and[MASK] for me for us <unk> we pushed the fight right over the edge and i never got the chance to say to him[MASK] what i say to him now almost every day hey buddy it was a hell of a ride we never got the chance to[MASK] <unk> we never thought it was the end <unk> we always had hope <unk> [MASK] so what[MASK] do we make of all of this being a journalist <unk> [MASK] after terence died <unk> i wrote a book the cost of hope i wrote it because i wanted to know why i did what i did <unk> [MASK] why he did what he did <unk> [MASK] <unk> why everyone around us did what they did and what did i discover well one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to[MASK] what i did at the end was a piece of paper <unk> the advance directive [MASK] to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices yet[MASK] i had that piece of paper <unk> [MASK] we both did <unk> and they were readily available i had them right at hand <unk> both of them said the same thing[MASK] <unk> do nothing if there is no further hope [MASK] i knew terence 's wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own [MASK] yet[MASK] we never got to no further hope even with that clear cut paper in our hands <unk> we just kept redefining[MASK] <unk> i could keep him[MASK] from dying <unk> [MASK] and i 'd be embarrassed to say that if i hadn 't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way right up until days before his death <unk> [MASK] i felt strongly[MASK] and powerfully and you might say[MASK] <unk> could keep him from dying[MASK] ever [MASK] now what do the experts call this [MASK] they say it 's denial it 's a strong word isn 't it [MASK] yet i will tell you that denial isn 't even close to a strong enough word[MASK] to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through[MASK] and i hear the medical professionals[MASK] <unk> say well we 'd like to do such and such but the family 's in denial <unk> [MASK] the family won 't listen to reason they 're in denial <unk> [MASK] how can they insist on this treatment at the end it 's so clear yet they 're in denial now[MASK] i think this maybe isn 't a very useful way of thinking it[MASK] 's not just families either the medical professionals too <unk> you out there[MASK] you 're in denial too <unk> [MASK] you want to help you want to fix <unk> you want to do [MASK] you 've succeeded in everything you 've done <unk> and having a patient die <unk> [MASK] well that must feel like failure <unk> [MASK] i saw it firsthand just days before terence died[MASK] <unk> tell terence that better days are just ahead days before he died <unk> yet ira byock the director of palliative medicine at dartmouth[MASK] said you know <unk> the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal [MASK] so what the experts call denial i call[MASK] <unk> and i 'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design[MASK] <unk> you just redefine denial and hope <unk> and it becomes a feature of being human <unk> it 's not a bug <unk> [MASK] it 's a feature [MASK] laughter so we need to think more constructively about[MASK] <unk> it 's part of the human condition and yet our system and our thinking isn 't built to accommodate it [MASK] so terence told me a story on that long ago night and i believed it maybe i wanted to believe it [MASK] and during terence 's[MASK] <unk> to believe the story of our fight together too <unk> giving up the fight for that 's how it felt it felt like giving up meant[MASK] giving up not only his life but[MASK] also our story our story of us as fighters <unk> the story of us as invincible <unk> [MASK] and for the doctors the story of themselves as healers[MASK] <unk> so what do we need [MASK] maybe we don 't need a new piece of paper <unk> maybe we need a new story [MASK] not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness [MASK] but rather a story of victory and triumph [MASK] of a valiant battle[MASK] <unk> a graceful retreat a story that acknowledges[MASK] that not even the greatest general defeats every foe that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal <unk> [MASK] and that[MASK] no wife no matter how hard she tried has ever[MASK] <unk> and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go [MASK] people did mention hospice but i wouldn 't listen [MASK] hospice was for people who were dying and[MASK] terence wasn 't dying as a result he spent just four days in hospice which i 'm sure as you all know is a pretty typical outcome[MASK] and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end[MASK] <unk> we have a noble path to curing the disease <unk> patients and doctors alike <unk> [MASK] but there doesn 't seem to be a noble path to dying [MASK] dying is seen as failing <unk> and we had a heroic narrative[MASK] for fighting together[MASK] <unk> heroic narrative for letting go so[MASK] maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end and for saying goodbye <unk> [MASK] and maybe our new story will be about a hero 's fight and a hero 's goodbye terence loved[MASK] <unk> is one of my favorite poets <unk> so i 'll give you a couple lines from him this is a poem about mark antony <unk> you know mark antony the[MASK] conquering hero cleopatra 's guy <unk> actually one of cleopatra 's guys <unk> and[MASK] he 's been a pretty good general he 's won all the fights he 's eluded all the people that are out to get him <unk> [MASK] <unk> yet this time finally he 's come to the city of alexandria and realized he 's lost the people are leaving they 're playing instruments they 're singing <unk> and suddenly he knows he 's been defeated <unk> [MASK] and he suddenly knows he 's been deserted by the gods <unk> and it 's time to let go and[MASK] the poet tells him what to do <unk> he tells him how to say a noble goodbye a goodbye that 's fit for[MASK] <unk> becomes you who were worthy of such a city approach the window with a firm step <unk> and with emotion <unk> [MASK] but not with the entreaties[MASK] or the complaints of a coward as a last enjoyment listen to the sounds[MASK] <unk> exquisite instruments of the musical troops and bid her farewell the alexandria you are losing [MASK] that 's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life [MASK] a goodbye for a man for whom anything <unk> [MASK] well <unk> almost anything was possible [MASK] a goodbye for a man who kept[MASK] <unk> and isn 't that what we 're missing how can we learn that people 's decisions about their loved ones[MASK] are often based strongly powerfully many times irrationally on the slimmest of hopes <unk> [MASK] the overwhelming presence of hope[MASK] isn 't denial <unk> it 's part of our dna as humans <unk> and maybe it 's time our healthcare system doctors[MASK] started accounting for the power of that hope hope isn 't a bug <unk> it 's a feature[MASK]
