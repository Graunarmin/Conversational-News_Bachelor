 <unk> i was afraid of womanhood <unk> not that i 'm not afraid now but i 've learned to pretend i 've learned to be flexible[MASK] <unk> in fact i 've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear let me explain back in[MASK] the ' 50s and ' 60s when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft <unk> [MASK] and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy[MASK] really not quite clear what[MASK] <unk> all around us we had our mothers our aunts our cousins our sisters and of course the <unk>[MASK] <unk> ever present media bombarding us with images and words telling us how to be [MASK] now my mother was different [MASK] she was a homemaker but she and i didn 't go out and do girlie things together and she didn 't buy me pink outfits instead she knew what i needed and she bought me a book of cartoons <unk> [MASK] and i just ate it up i[MASK] <unk> drew and i drew and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family <unk> [MASK] i could draw do what i wanted to do and not have to perform not have to speak i was very shy and i could still get approval [MASK] i was launched as a cartoonist <unk> [MASK] now when we 're young <unk> we don 't always[MASK] <unk> we know there are rules out there but we don 't always know[MASK] we don 't perform them right <unk> even though we are imprinted at birth[MASK] with these things and we 're told what the most important color in the world is [MASK] we 're told what shape we 're supposed to be in [MASK] we 're told what to wear[MASK] <unk> the rules that i 'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture we 're being corrected and[MASK] the primary policemen are women because we are the carriers of the tradition we pass it down from from generation to generation[MASK] <unk> not only that we always have this vague notion that something 's expected of us <unk> and on top of all off these rules [MASK] they keep changing <unk> we[MASK] don 't know what 's going on half the time so it puts us in a very tenuous position [MASK] now if you don 't like these rules <unk> and many of us don 't i know i[MASK] i still don 't even though i follow them half the time not quite aware that i 'm following them[MASK] what better way than to change them [ than ] with humor [MASK] humor relies on the traditions of a society <unk> [MASK] it takes what we know and it twists it it takes the the codes of behavior and the codes of dress and it[MASK] <unk> that 's what elicits a laugh <unk> [MASK] now what if you put together women and humor <unk> i think you can get change because women are on the ground floor <unk> and we know the traditions so well we can bring a different voice to the table [MASK] now i started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos <unk> i grew up not far from here in washington d c during the civil rights movement the assassinations the[MASK] watergate hearings and then the[MASK] feminist movement and i think i was drawing trying to figure out what was going on and then also my family was in chaos <unk> and i drew to <unk>[MASK] try to bring my family together [MASK] it didn 't work my parents got divorced and my sister was arrested <unk> [MASK] but i found my place[MASK] i found that i didn 't have to wear high heels i didn 't have to wear pink <unk> and i could feel like i fit in now when i was a little older in my <unk>[MASK] <unk> i realized there are not many women in cartooning and i thought well maybe i can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning and so i did i became a cartoonist <unk> and then i thought[MASK] in my 40s i started thinking well why don 't i do something i always loved political[MASK] <unk> so why don 't i do something with the content of my cartoons to to make people think about the stupid rules that we 're following as well as laugh [MASK] now my perspective is a particularly[MASK] <unk> i can 't help it i live here <unk> even though i 've traveled a lot i still think like[MASK] an american woman <unk> but i believe that the rules that i 'm talking about are universal of course that each[MASK] <unk> culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the u s [MASK] consequently <unk> we have [MASK] women because we 're on the ground we know the tradition we have amazing antennae <unk> [MASK] now my work lately has been to collaborate with international[MASK] <unk> which i so enjoy <unk> and[MASK] it 's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to[MASK] to get at the truth to get at the issues quickly and succinctly <unk> and not only that it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect but through the heart [MASK] my work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world countries[MASK] <unk> and we have[MASK] sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties and these women are[MASK] working so hard to get their voices heard in in some some very difficult circumstances but i feel i feel blessed to be able to work with them <unk> and[MASK] we talk about how women have such strong perceptions because of our tenuous position and[MASK] <unk> we can have the great potential to be[MASK] and i think i truly believe that we can change this thing one laugh at a time <unk> thank you[MASK]
