 <unk> bobby riggs he was the former number one player he wasn 't just some hacker by the way he was one of my heroes[MASK] and i admired him <unk> and that 's the reason i beat him actually because i respected him[MASK] 's true my mom and especially my dad always said respect your opponent and never underestimate them <unk> ever [MASK] and he was correct <unk> he was absolutely correct <unk> [MASK] but i knew it was about social change [MASK] and i was really nervous whenever we announced it <unk> and i felt like the whole world was on my[MASK] <unk> 's going to put women back fifty years at least title ix had just been passed the year before june <unk>[MASK] and women 's professional tennis[MASK] there were nine of us who signed a <unk> one dollar contract in one thousand nine hundred and seventy now remember the match is in ' seventy three [MASK] so we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play have a place to compete and make a living <unk> so there were nine of us that signed that[MASK] <unk> our dream was for any girl born any place in the world[MASK] if she was good enough there would be a place for her to compete[MASK] and for us to make a living because before one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight we made fourteen dollars a day <unk> and we were under the control of organizations so we really wanted to break away from that but we knew it wasn 't really[MASK] <unk> our generation so much we knew it was about the future generations we do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us there is no question [MASK] but every generation has the chance to make it better [MASK] that was really on my mind <unk> [MASK] i really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to title ix title ix in case anybody doesn 't know which a lot of people probably don 't said that any federal funds[MASK] given to a high school <unk> college or[MASK] <unk> either public or private had to finally give[MASK] equal monies to boys and girls <unk> and that changed everything so[MASK] you can have a law but it 's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it <unk> [MASK] that 's when it really rocks <unk> totally <unk> so that was on my mind <unk> i wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds but two things[MASK] <unk> they actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise some women have waited[MASK] ten fifteen years to ask i said more importantly did you get it and they did and for the men[MASK] a lot of the men today don 't realize it but if you 're in your 50s 60s or[MASK] <unk> come up to me[MASK] and most times the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes it 's very interesting they go billie <unk> i was very young when i saw that match <unk> [MASK] and now i have a daughter <unk> and i am so happy i saw that as a young man[MASK] and one of those young men at twelve years old was president obama[MASK] <unk> and he actually told me that when i met him he said [MASK] you don 't realize it <unk> but i saw that match at twelve <unk> and now i have two daughters <unk> and it has made a difference in how i raise them <unk>[MASK] so both men and women got a lot out of it but different things pm [MASK] and now there are generations at least one or two who have experienced the[MASK] <unk> equality[MASK] that title ix and other fights along the way made possible and for women there are generations who have also experienced teamwork <unk> [MASK] they got to play team sports in a way they hadn 't before [MASK] so you you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete[MASK] <unk> a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the women 's sports foundation [MASK] what now are you looking to accomplish with[MASK] the billie jean king leadership initiative bjk i think it goes back to an epiphany i had at twelve <unk> at eleven i wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world [MASK] and a friend had asked me to play and i said what 's that [MASK] tennis was not in my family[MASK] basketball was other sports fast forward to twelve years old[MASK] and i 'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year so i was daydreaming[MASK] at the los angeles tennis club and i started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was but[MASK] also[MASK] that everybody who played wore white shoes white clothes played with white balls everybody who played was[MASK] <unk> sticking in my brain <unk> and that moment <unk> i promised myself i 'd fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls men and women the rest of my life <unk> [MASK] and that tennis if i was fortunate enough[MASK] to become number one and i knew being a girl it would be harder to have influence already at that age[MASK] i had this platform [MASK] and tennis is global [MASK] and i thought you know what [MASK] i 've been given an opportunity that very few people have had i didn 't know if i was going to make it this was only twelve <unk> i sure wanted it <unk> but making it is a whole other discussion[MASK] <unk> i just remember i promised myself <unk> and i really try to keep my word <unk> that 's who i truly am[MASK] <unk> fighting for people and <unk> unfortunately women[MASK] have had less <unk> [MASK] and we are considered less <unk> and so my attentions where did they have to go it was just you have to[MASK] and learn to stick up for yourself hear your own voice <unk> you hear the same words keep coming out all the[MASK] <unk> i got really lucky because i had an education <unk> and i think if you can see it you can be it you know if you can see it you can[MASK] be it you look at pat you look at other leaders you look at these speakers <unk> look at yourself <unk> because everyone everyone[MASK] can do something extraordinary every single person pm and your story billie has inspired so many women everywhere now with[MASK] <unk> the billie jean king leadership initiative you 're taking on[MASK] an even bigger cause because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice [MASK] working to find their way into leadership positions <unk> but what you 're talking about is even bigger than that it 's inclusive leadership[MASK] and this is a generation that has grown up thinking more[MASK] <unk> of it <unk> but the billie jean king leadership initiative is really about the workforce mostly and trying to change it so people can actually go to work[MASK] and be their authentic selves because most of us[MASK] have two jobs one to fit in i 'll give you a perfect example an african american woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work <unk> [MASK] straightens her hair in the bathroom goes to the bathroom[MASK] probably four five six times a day to keep straightening her hair to keep making sure she fits in [MASK] so she 's working two jobs she 's got this other job <unk> whatever that may be but she 's also trying to fit in [MASK] or this poor[MASK] man who kept his diploma he went to[MASK] university of michigan but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster <unk> ever just would not mention it so he made sure[MASK] <unk> and then you see a gay guy who has an nfl which means american football for all of you out there it 's a big deal it 's very macho and he talked about football all the time because he was gay and <unk>[MASK] my wish[MASK] for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self twenty four seven that would be the ultimate <unk> [MASK] and we catch ourselves i mean i catch myself to this day even being gay i catch myself[MASK] like [MASK] a little uncomfortable a little surge in my gut <unk> feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin [MASK] so i think you have to ask yourself[MASK] i want people to be themselves <unk> whatever that is just let it be pm <unk> and the first research the leadership initiative did showed[MASK] <unk> many of us have the problem of being authentic but what you 've just looked at is this millennial generation who have benefited from all these equal opportunities <unk>[MASK] which may not be equal but exist everywhere bjk first of all i 'm really lucky partnership with teneo a strategic company that 's amazing <unk>[MASK] i 'm able to do this <unk> i 've had two times in my life where i 've actually had men really behind me with power <unk> [MASK] and that was in the old days with philip morris with virginia slims <unk> and this is the second time in my entire life <unk> and then deloitte [MASK] the one thing i wanted was data[MASK] facts <unk> so deloitte sent out a survey and[MASK] <unk> going to get representation so if you walk into a room you see everybody represented that 's not good enough anymore <unk>[MASK] so the millennials are fantastic they want connection <unk>[MASK] <unk> just want you to tell us what you 're feeling what you 're thinking and get into the solution[MASK] <unk> you 've got the information at your fingertips compared to[MASK] when i was growing up pm [MASK] what did the research show you about millennials are they going to make a difference are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force <unk> bjk well in[MASK] <unk> percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials i think they are going to help[MASK] <unk> i think they have the wherewithal to do it i know they care a lot they have big ideas[MASK] and they can make big things happen i want to stay in the now with the young people[MASK] mini survey i 've been talking to the boomers who are their bosses and i go[MASK] <unk> and they don 't really care i just heard a story the other night a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers <unk> she gets a text from one of the workers[MASK] just starting she goes oh by the way i 'm going to be late because i 'm at the hairdresser 's[MASK] <unk> that 's what scares the boomers i 'm just telling you so i think it 's good for us to share no it[MASK] is good for us to share because we 're our authentic selves and what we 're really feeling so we 've got to take it both ways you know [MASK] but i have great faith because if you 've been in sports like i have[MASK] every generation gets better it 's a fact[MASK] with the women 's sports foundation being the[MASK] the advocates for title ix still because we 're trying to keep protecting the law because <unk> <unk> it 's in a tenuous position always [MASK] so we really are concerned and we do a lot of research <unk>[MASK] and i want to hear from people <unk> but we really have to protect what title[MASK] <unk> stands for worldwide and you heard president carter[MASK] talk about how title ix is protected and do you know that every single lawsuit[MASK] that girls at least in sports have gone up against whatever[MASK] institutions has won <unk> [MASK] title ix is there to protect us <unk> and it is amazing <unk> but we we still have to get the hearts and minds the[MASK] hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge[MASK] <unk> huge pm so what gets you up every morning <unk>[MASK] what keeps you sustaining your work sustaining the fight for equality <unk> extending it always exploring new areas trying to find new ways bjk well i always drove my parents crazy because i was always the curious one i[MASK] 'm highly motivated my younger brother was a major league baseball player my poor parents did not care[MASK] laughter and we drove them crazy because we pushed we pushed because we wanted to be the best and[MASK] i think it 's because of of what i 'm hearing today in ted talks <unk> i think[MASK] to listen to these different women to listen to different people to listen to president carter ninety years old by the way and he[MASK] <unk> these figures out that i would never i 'd have to go excuse me wait a minute i need to get a list out of these figures he was rattling off i mean <unk> that 's amazing i 'm sorry[MASK] <unk> these are things that for some people are very hard to hear but always remember every one of us is an individual a human being with a beating heart who cares[MASK] and wants to live their authentic life <unk> ok you don 't have to agree with somebody <unk> but everyone has[MASK] <unk> i think we all[MASK] have an obligation to continue[MASK] to keep moving the needle forward [MASK] always and these people have been so inspiring <unk> everyone matters <unk> and every one of you is an influencer <unk> you out there listening out there in the world plus the people here[MASK] every single person 's an influencer never ever forget that ok so don 't ever give up on yourself[MASK]
