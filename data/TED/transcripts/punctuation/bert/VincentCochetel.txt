 <unk> i cannot forget them <unk> their names were aslan[MASK] <unk> the list is longer [MASK] for many their existence their humanity <unk> has been reduced to[MASK] statistics <unk> coldly recorded as security incidents [MASK] for me they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers[MASK] <unk> tried to bring a bit of comfort[MASK] to the victims of the wars in chechnya in the ' 90s [MASK] they were nurses <unk> logisticians shelter experts paralegals <unk> interpreters [MASK] and for this service <unk> they were murdered their families torn apart [MASK] <unk> and their story largely forgotten <unk> no one was ever sentenced for these crimes <unk> [MASK] i cannot forget them <unk> they live in me somehow [MASK] their memories giving me meaning every day <unk> but they are also haunting the dark street of my mind <unk> [MASK] as humanitarian aid workers they made the choice to be at the side of the victim [MASK] to provide some assistance some comfort some protection[MASK] <unk> when they needed protection themselves <unk> it <unk>[MASK] <unk> you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in iraq or in syria aid worker abducted <unk> hostage executed[MASK] but who were they why were they there what motivated them <unk> how did we become so indifferent to these crimes[MASK] is why i am here today with you we need to find better ways to remember them <unk> [MASK] we also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives [MASK] we also need to demand justice [MASK] when in ' ninety six i was sent by the united nations high commissioner for refugees to the north caucasus i knew some of the[MASK] five colleagues had been killed three had been seriously injured <unk> seven had already been taken hostage <unk> so we were careful <unk> [MASK] we were using armored vehicles <unk> decoy cars <unk> changing patterns of travel changing homes all sorts of security measures <unk> [MASK] yet on a cold winter night of january[MASK] <unk> turn when i entered my flat in vladikavkaz with a guard <unk> we were surrounded by armed men <unk> [MASK] they took the guard they put him on the floor <unk> they beat him up in front of me tied him <unk> dragged him away <unk> [MASK] i was handcuffed <unk> blindfolded[MASK] <unk> gun pressed against my neck <unk> when it happens to you there is no time for thinking no time for praying [MASK] my brain went on automatic <unk> rewinding quickly the life i 'd just left behind <unk> [MASK] it took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me <unk> but[MASK] <unk> had ordered my kidnapping [MASK] then a process of dehumanization started that day <unk> i was no more than just a commodity <unk> [MASK] i normally don 't talk about this but i 'd like to share a bit with you some of those three hundred and seventeen days of captivity <unk> [MASK] i was kept in an underground[MASK] <unk> and then the guards would come normally two they would bring a big piece of bread a bowl of soup and a candle [MASK] that candle would burn for fifteen minutes <unk> fifteen minutes of precious light and then they would take[MASK] <unk> i was chained by a metal cable to my bed <unk> i could do only four small steps [MASK] i always dreamt of the fifth one [MASK] and no tv no radio no newspaper no one to talk to [MASK] i had no towel <unk> no soap <unk> no toilet paper just two metal buckets open one for water[MASK] one waste [MASK] can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic[MASK] or when they are just bored or drunk <unk> we are breaking my nerves very slowly <unk> [MASK] isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe how do you describe[MASK] <unk> nothing there are no words for the depths of loneliness i reached in that very thin border[MASK] between sanity and madness in the darkness sometimes i played[MASK] imaginary games of checkers <unk> i would start with the black play with the white back to the black trying to trick the other side[MASK] <unk> i don 't play checkers anymore[MASK] <unk> i was tormented by the thoughts of my family[MASK] and my colleague the guard edik i didn 't know what had happened to him i[MASK] was trying not to think <unk> i tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot <unk> [MASK] i tried to pray i tried all sorts of memorization games[MASK] but darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal [MASK] one part of your brain wants you to resist to shout to cry [MASK] and the other part of the brain orders you to <unk>[MASK] <unk> just go through it it 's a constant internal debate there is no one to arbitrate <unk> once a guard came to me[MASK] <unk> very aggressively and he told me today you 're going to kneel and beg for your food [MASK] i wasn 't in a good mood so i insulted him <unk> i insulted his mother i insulted his ancestors the[MASK] consequence was moderate he threw the food into my waste the day after he came back with the same demand [MASK] he got the same answer <unk> which had[MASK] <unk> same consequence <unk> [MASK] four days later the body was full of pain i didn 't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little [MASK] so[MASK] when the guards came down [MASK] i knelt <unk> i begged for my food[MASK] <unk> the only way for me to make it to another candle [MASK] after my kidnapping i was transferred from north ossetia to chechnya [MASK] three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars <unk> [MASK] and upon arrival i was interrogated for eleven days by a guy called ruslan [MASK] the routine was always the same a bit more light[MASK] <unk> he would come down to the cellar he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair and he would turn on the music loud <unk> [MASK] and then he would yell questions <unk> he would scream <unk> he would beat me i[MASK] 'll spare you the details there are many questions i could not understand and there are some questions i did not want to understand[MASK] <unk> of the interrogation was the duration of the tape <unk> fifteen songs forty five minutes <unk> i would always long for the last song [MASK] on one day one night in that cellar <unk> i don 't know what it was i heard a child crying above my head [MASK] a boy <unk> maybe two or three years old <unk> [MASK] footsteps <unk> [MASK] <unk> people running [MASK] so when ruslan came the day after <unk> [MASK] before he put the first question to me <unk> i asked him how is your son today is he feeling better ruslan was taken by surprise <unk> [MASK] he was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life [MASK] i kept talking about ngos supplying medicines to local clinics[MASK] that may help his son to get better and we talked about[MASK] <unk> we talked about families [MASK] he talked to me about his children <unk> i talked to him about my daughters and then he 'd talk about guns about cars about women and[MASK] i had to talk about guns about cars about women [MASK] and we talked until the last song on the tape <unk> [MASK] ruslan was the most brutal man i ever met[MASK] <unk> did not touch me anymore <unk> he did not ask any other questions i was no longer just a commodity <unk> two <unk>[MASK] <unk> days after i was transferred to another place there a guard came to me <unk> very close it was quite unusual and he said with a very soft[MASK] <unk> like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby dagestan [MASK] what could i possibly reply <unk> [MASK] it was so painful it was like a blade in the belly <unk> it took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile[MASK] the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier[MASK] of fortune he became <unk> he was young he was shy <unk> i never saw his face <unk> he probably meant well <unk> [MASK] but in those fifteen seconds <unk> he made me question everything we did [MASK] all the sacrifices <unk> [MASK] he made me think also how they see us <unk> until then i had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing[MASK] one cannot assume this[MASK] well explaining why we do this is not that easy <unk> even to our closest relatives <unk> [MASK] we are not perfect <unk> we are not superior <unk> we are not the world 's fire brigade <unk> we are not superheroes <unk> we[MASK] <unk> we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution <unk> [MASK] yet we do this because one life matters <unk> sometimes that 's the only difference you make one individual one family a small group of individuals[MASK] and it matters <unk> when you have a tsunami an earthquake or a typhoon you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the[MASK] <unk> searching for survivors for weeks why nobody questions this every life matters or[MASK] every life should matter [MASK] this is the same for us when we help refugees people displaced within their country by conflict or stateless persons <unk> [MASK] i know many people when they are confronted by[MASK] <unk> are so many ways people can help <unk> [MASK] we don 't stop with that feeling we try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance some protection some comfort <unk> [MASK] we have to we can 't do otherwise it 's what makes us feel i don 't know simply human[MASK] that 's a picture of me the day of my release <unk> months after my[MASK] <unk> release i met the then french prime minister [MASK] the second thing he told me you were totally irresponsible to go to the north caucasus you don 't know how many problems you 've created for us it[MASK] was a short meeting [MASK] i think helping people in danger is responsible in that war[MASK] <unk> war that nobody seriously wanted to stop and we have many of these today <unk> [MASK] bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity <unk> it was making a real difference for the people [MASK] why could he not understand this [MASK] we have a responsibility to try you 've heard about that concept responsibility to protect[MASK] <unk> outcomes may depend on various parameters [MASK] we may even fail but there is worse than failing it 's not even trying when we can [MASK] well if you are met this way if you sign up for this sort of job your life is going to be full of joy and sadness [MASK] because there are a lot of people we cannot help a lot of people we cannot protect a lot of people we[MASK] <unk> did not save <unk> i call them my ghost [MASK] and by having witnessed their suffering from close you take a bit of that suffering on yourself [MASK] many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness they are thrown into situations where they are witness <unk> [MASK] but they are powerless to bring any change they have to learn to accept it[MASK] and gradually turn this into positive energy <unk> it 's difficult many don 't succeed <unk> [MASK] but for those who do there is no other job like this you can see the difference you make every day [MASK] humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in[MASK] <unk> the sanctity of our life is fading [MASK] do you know that since the millennium the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled two thousand and[MASK] <unk> until the beginning of the civil war in somalia in the late ' 80s [MASK] humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages but by and large we were not[MASK] <unk> the target of these attacks[MASK] look at this picture baghdad august two thousand and three twenty four colleagues were killed <unk> gone are the days when a u n blue flag[MASK] or a red cross would automatically protect us <unk> criminal groups and some[MASK] <unk> over the last twenty years [MASK] and they 've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating [MASK] humanitarian principles are tested questioned and often ignored <unk> but perhaps more importantly <unk> [MASK] we have abandoned the search for justice there seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian[MASK] <unk> after my release i was told not to seek any form of justice it won 't do you any good that 's what i was told plus you 're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues <unk> [MASK] it took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated with my kidnapping <unk> [MASK] but this was the exception there was[MASK] <unk> the same all over the world [MASK] this is unacceptable this is inexcusable [MASK] attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law those crimes should not go unpunished <unk> [MASK] we must end this cycle of impunity <unk> we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid[MASK] <unk> workers are attacks against humanity itself that makes me furious i know i 'm very lucky[MASK] compared to the refugees i work for <unk> [MASK] i don 't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed <unk> i don 't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me <unk> [MASK] i don 't know what it is to lose the protection of my country[MASK] i also know that i 'm very lucky compared to other hostages <unk> four days before my eventful[MASK] release <unk> four hostages were beheaded[MASK] a few miles away from where i was kept in captivity <unk> why them <unk> [MASK] why am i here today [MASK] no easy answer[MASK] <unk> i was received with a lot of support that i got from my relatives from colleagues [MASK] from friends from people i didn 't know they have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness [MASK] not everyone was treated with the same attention how many of my colleagues after a traumatic incident [MASK] <unk> own life [MASK] i can count nine that i knew personally <unk> how many of my <unk>[MASK] <unk> difficult divorce after a traumatic experience[MASK] because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse i 've lost that count there[MASK] is a price for this type of life in russia all[MASK] <unk> no one is forgotten nothing is forgotten [MASK] i do not forget my lost colleagues i cannot forget anything <unk> [MASK] i call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better[MASK] <unk> we should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off [MASK] after my ordeal a lot of colleagues asked me but why do you continue why do you do this sort of job <unk> why do you have to go back to it [MASK] my answer was very simple <unk> [MASK] if i had quit [MASK] that would have meant my kidnapper had won <unk> they would have taken my soul and my humanity[MASK]
