 <unk> it 's not an easy question <unk> today we have adoption[MASK] <unk> many parents face tough questions[MASK] and tough decisions shall we tell our child about the sperm donation [MASK] if so when what words to use sperm donors are often referred to[MASK] as biological fathers but should we really be using the word father as a philosopher and[MASK] <unk> social scientist i have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood [MASK] but today i will talk to you about what i learned from talking to parents and children <unk> [MASK] i will show you that they know what matters most in a family even though their family looks a little different <unk> i will show you[MASK] their creative ways of dealing with tough questions[MASK] but i will also show you the parents ' uncertainties [MASK] we interviewed couples who received fertility treatment at ghent university hospital <unk> [MASK] using sperm from a donor in this treatment timeline you can see two points at which we conducted interviews[MASK] <unk> we included heterosexual couples where the man for some reason did not have good quality sperm and lesbian couples[MASK] who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere <unk> we also included children [MASK] i wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family [MASK] in fact that is what i asked them[MASK] <unk> only not in that way <unk> [MASK] i drew an apple tree instead [MASK] this way <unk> i could ask abstract philosophical questions in a way that did not make them run off [MASK] so as you can see the apple tree is empty <unk> [MASK] and that illustrates my research approach <unk> by designing techniques like this[MASK] <unk> i can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview <unk> because i want to hear that from them <unk> [MASK] i asked them [MASK] what would your family look like if it were an apple tree <unk> [MASK] and they could take a paper apple for everyone who in their view was a member of the family write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted <unk> and i would ask[MASK] <unk> questions [MASK] most children started with a parent or a sibling <unk> one started with boxer [MASK] the dead dog of his grandparents at this point none of the children started mentioning the donor <unk> [MASK] so <unk> [MASK] i asked them about their birth[MASK] <unk> before you were born it was just[MASK] your mom and dad or mom and mommy can you tell me how you came into the family [MASK] and they explained <unk> one said [MASK] my parents did not have good seeds <unk> [MASK] but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds they bring them to the hospital <unk> and they put them in a big jar [MASK] my mommy went there and she[MASK] <unk> took two from the jar <unk> one for me and one for my sister <unk> she put the seeds in her belly somehow[MASK] and her belly grew really big and there i was hmm [MASK] so only when they started mentioning the donor <unk> i asked questions about him using their own words[MASK] <unk> words <unk> i said if this would be an apple[MASK] for the friendly man with the seeds <unk> what would you do with it [MASK] and one boy was thinking out loud holding the apple and he said [MASK] i won 't put this one up there with the others he 's not part of my family <unk> [MASK] but i will not put him on the ground that 's too cold and too hard[MASK] <unk> i think he should be in the trunk <unk> [MASK] because he made my family possible [MASK] if he would not have done this that would really be sad because my family would not be here <unk> and i would not be here [MASK] so also parents constructed family tales tales to tell their children[MASK] <unk> couple explained their insemination by taking their children to a farm to watch a vet inseminate cows <unk> [MASK] and why not it 's their way of explaining their <unk>[MASK] <unk> with family narratives diy <unk> and we had another couple who made books a book for each child they were really works of[MASK] containing their thoughts and feelings throughout[MASK] the treatment they even had the hospital parking tickets in there [MASK] so it is diy <unk> finding ways words and images to tell your family story to your child [MASK] and these stories[MASK] were highly diverse but they all had[MASK] <unk> it was a tale of longing for a child[MASK] and a quest for that child <unk> it was about how special and how deeply loved their child was <unk> [MASK] and research so far shows that these children are doing fine they do not have more problems than other kids <unk> [MASK] <unk> these parents[MASK] also wanted to justify their decisions through the tales they tell [MASK] they hoped that their children would understand their reasons for making the family in this way <unk> [MASK] underlying was a fear[MASK] that their children might disapprove and would reject the non genetic parent <unk> and that fear is understandable because we live in a very[MASK] <unk> and geneticized society[MASK] a world that still believes that true families consist of one mom one dad and their genetically related children <unk> [MASK] well <unk> [MASK] i want to tell you[MASK] about a teenage boy he was <unk> donor conceived but not part of our study one day he had an argument with his father <unk> and he yelled you[MASK] 're telling me what to do you 're not even my father[MASK] that was exactly what the parents in our study feared [MASK] now the boy soon felt sorry <unk> and they made up <unk> but it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting [MASK] he said this outburst[MASK] had nothing to do with the lack of[MASK] <unk> it was about[MASK] puberty being difficult <unk> it 's what they do at that age <unk> it will pass [MASK] what this man shows us[MASK] is that when something goes wrong <unk> we should not immediately think it is because the family is a little different [MASK] these things happen in all families <unk> [MASK] and every now and then all parents may wonder[MASK] <unk> am i a good enough parent these parents too [MASK] they above all wanted to do what 's best for their child <unk> but they also sometimes wondered <unk> [MASK] am i a real parent <unk> [MASK] and their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents at the start of treatment <unk> when they first saw the counselor[MASK] they paid close attention to the counselor[MASK] <unk> because they wanted to do it right <unk> even ten years later they still remember the advice they were given[MASK] so when they thought about the counselor[MASK] and the advice they were given we discussed that and we saw one[MASK] <unk> when our son asks us ' do i have a dad '[MASK] we will say ' no you do not have a dad '[MASK] but we will say nothing more not unless he asks because he might not be ready for that the counselor said so [MASK] well i[MASK] don 't know that 's quite different from how we respond to children 's questions like milk is that made in a factory[MASK] we will say no <unk> it comes from cows and we will talk about the farmer and the way the milk ends up in the shop <unk> [MASK] we will not say [MASK] no milk is not made in a factory [MASK] so something strange happened here <unk> and of course these children noticed that one boy said[MASK] <unk> parents loads of questions <unk> but they acted really weird [MASK] so you know i have a friend at school <unk> and she 's made in the same way <unk> when i have a question <unk> i just go and ask her [MASK] clever guy <unk> problem solved <unk> [MASK] but his parents did not notice and it certainly was not what they had in mind nor what the counselor had in mind[MASK] when they were saying how important it is to be an[MASK] <unk> family <unk> [MASK] and that 's the strange thing about advice <unk> when we offer people pills we gather evidence first [MASK] we do tests we do follow up studies <unk> we want to know and rightly so what this pill is doing and how it affects people 's lives <unk> [MASK] and advice[MASK] <unk> it is not enough for advice or for professionals to give advice that is[MASK] theoretically sound <unk> or well meant it should be advice that there is evidence for[MASK] evidence that it actually improves patients ' lives <unk> so the philosopher in me would now[MASK] <unk> i will not end here with what went wrong <unk> i would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families [MASK] remember the books and the trip to the farmer <unk> when parents do things[MASK] work for them they do brilliant things what i want you to remember[MASK] as members of families in no matter what form or shape is that[MASK] what families need[MASK] are warm relationships <unk> and we do not need to be professionals to create those most of us do just fine[MASK] <unk> although it may be hard work and from time to time <unk> we can do with some advice [MASK] in that case <unk> bear in mind three things [MASK] work with advice that works for your family remember you 're the expert because you live your family[MASK] <unk> in your abilities and your creativity <unk> because you can do it yourself <unk> thank you[MASK]
