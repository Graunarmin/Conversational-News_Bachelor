what happens at ground level[MASK] <unk> far from the halls of power <unk> happens to ordinary citizens one by one <unk> [MASK] and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view [MASK] it gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice <unk> and as a reaction it stimulates public opinion and gives[MASK] <unk> impetus to public debate <unk> thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda much as they would like to [MASK] coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow
