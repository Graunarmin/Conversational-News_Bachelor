 <unk> talking about empowerment is odd <unk> because when we talk about empowerment what affects us most are the stories <unk> [MASK] so i want to begin with an everyday story what is it really like to be a young woman in india now [MASK] i 've spent the last[MASK] twenty seven years of my life in india <unk> lived in three small towns two major cities and i 've had several experiences <unk> [MASK] when i was seven a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics[MASK] molested me [MASK] he would put his hand up my skirt [MASK] he put his hand up[MASK] <unk> skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good[MASK] at seventeen a boy from my high school circulated an email[MASK] detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me[MASK] because i didn 't pay attention to him [MASK] at nineteen <unk> i helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older[MASK] <unk> man escape an abusive marriage [MASK] at twenty one when my friend and i were walking down the road one afternoon [MASK] a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us [MASK] we called people for help and nobody came [MASK] <unk> when i was walking home one evening <unk> [MASK] two men on a motorcycle attacked me <unk> i spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] throughout my life i 've seen women[MASK] family friends colleagues live through these experiences <unk> and they seldom talk about it [MASK] so in simple words life in india is not easy[MASK] but today i 'm not going to talk to you about this fear i 'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on [MASK] so what happened one night in december two thousand and twelve changed my life <unk> [MASK] so a young girl a 23 year old student <unk> boarded a bus in delhi with her male friend [MASK] there were six men on[MASK] <unk> the bus young men who you might encounter every day[MASK] in india <unk> and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the indian and international media [MASK] this girl was raped repeatedly <unk> [MASK] forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod <unk> beaten <unk> bitten and left to die [MASK] her friend was gagged attacked and knocked unconscious[MASK] she died on the 29th of december [MASK] and at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year india plunged into darkness [MASK] for the first time in our history men and women in indian cities[MASK] woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country[MASK] <unk> like many other young women i was absolutely terrified i couldn 't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital <unk> [MASK] i was angry and i was frustrated <unk> [MASK] but most of all i felt utterly completely helpless <unk> [MASK] but really what do you do right some write blogs some ignore it some join protests i did all of it in fact that was what everyone was doing two years ago[MASK] so the media was filled with stories about[MASK] all the horrific deeds that indian men are capable of [MASK] they were compared to animals sexually repressed beasts in fact so alien and unthinkable was this event in an indian mind[MASK] that the response from the indian media public and politicians proved[MASK] one point [MASK] no one knew what to do and no one wanted to be responsible for it [MASK] in fact these were a few insensitive comments which were made in the media by prominent people in response to sexual violence against women in general <unk> [MASK] so the first one is made by a member of parliament the second one is made by a spiritual leader <unk> and the third one was actually the defendants[MASK] <unk> when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away [MASK] now as a woman watching this day after day i was tired <unk> [MASK] so as a writer and gender activist i have written extensively on women [MASK] but this time i realized it was different because a part of me realized i was a part of that young woman too [MASK] and i decided i wanted to change this so[MASK] i did something spontaneous hasty <unk> i logged[MASK] <unk> citizen journalism platform called ireport <unk> [MASK] and i recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in bangalore <unk> [MASK] i talked about how i felt i talked about the ground realities and i talked about the frustrations of living in india <unk> [MASK] in a few hours <unk> the blog was shared widely[MASK] <unk> comments and thoughts poured in from across the world in that moment a few things occurred to me [MASK] one technology was always at hand for many young women like me [MASK] two like me most young women hardly use it to express their views <unk> [MASK] three <unk> i realized for the first time that my voice mattered <unk> so in the months that followed[MASK] i covered a trail of events in bangalore which had no[MASK] space in the mainstream news [MASK] in cubbon park which is a big park in bangalore <unk> i gathered with over one hundred others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape [MASK] when i reported about these[MASK] <unk> felt i had charge i felt like i had a channel to release all the emotions i had inside me <unk> [MASK] i attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying kill them hang them [MASK] you wouldn 't do this to your mothers or sisters [MASK] i went to a candlelight vigil where citizens gathered together to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly <unk> [MASK] <unk> the reactions confused me[MASK] <unk> while supportive comments poured in from across the world <unk> as did vicious ones <unk> so some called me a hypocrite some called me a victim a rape apologist some even said i had a political motive <unk> [MASK] but this one comment kind of describes[MASK] <unk> what we are discussing here today <unk> [MASK] but i was soon to learn that this was not all [MASK] as empowered as i felt with the new liberty that this citizen journalism channel gave me <unk> [MASK] i found myself in an unfamiliar situation [MASK] so sometime last august i logged onto facebook and i was looking through my news feed and i noticed there was a link that was being shared by my friends <unk> i clicked on the[MASK] <unk> it led me back to[MASK] a report uploaded by an american girl called michaela cross <unk> the report was titled india <unk> the story you never wanted to hear [MASK] and in this report she recounted her firsthand account of facing sexual harassment in india <unk> [MASK] she wrote there is no way to prepare for the eyes the eyes that every day stared[MASK] <unk> such entitlement at my body with no change of expression whether i met their gaze or not [MASK] walking to the fruit seller 's or the tailor 's i got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece [MASK] she called india a traveler 's heaven and a woman 's hell <unk> she said she was stalked <unk> groped and masturbated at <unk> now late that evening the[MASK] <unk> it was on[MASK] news channels across the world everyone was discussing it it had over a million views a thousand comments and shares <unk> [MASK] and i found myself witnessing a very similar thing [MASK] the media was caught in this vicious cycle of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever <unk> [MASK] so that night as i sat wondering how i should respond[MASK] <unk> i found myself filled with doubt you see as a writer i approached this issue as an observer[MASK] as an indian i felt embarrassment and disbelief [MASK] and as an activist i looked at it as a defender of rights <unk> but as a citizen journalist [MASK] i suddenly felt very vulnerable <unk> [MASK] i mean here she was a young woman[MASK] was using a channel to talk about her experience just as i was and yet i felt unsettled <unk> [MASK] you see no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act [MASK] empowerment is often made to sound as if it 's an ideal it 's a wonderful outcome when we talk about empowerment we often talk about[MASK] giving people access to materials[MASK] <unk> giving them access to tools <unk> but the thing is empowerment is an emotion it 's a feeling the first step to empowerment[MASK] is to give yourself the authority <unk> [MASK] the key to independent will <unk> and for women everywhere no matter who we are or where we come from [MASK] that is the most difficult step [MASK] we fear the sound of our own voice for it means admission but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment[MASK] <unk> this situation where i was faced with so many different kinds of realities <unk> i was unsure how to judge because i didn 't know what it would mean for me <unk> [MASK] i feared to judge because i didn 't know what it would be if i didn 't support the same view as this girl i didn 't know what it would mean for me if[MASK] i <unk> i was challenging someone[MASK] <unk> it was simple i had to make a decision should i speak up or should i stay quiet <unk> [MASK] so after a lot of thought [MASK] i recorded a video blog in response and i told michaela well there are different sides to india <unk> and i also <unk>[MASK] <unk> tried to explain that things would be okay and i expressed my regret for what she had faced and a few days later <unk> i was invited to talk on[MASK] <unk> air with her and[MASK] for the first time i reached out to this girl who i had never met who was so far away <unk> but yet i felt so close to [MASK] since this report came to light <unk> more young people than ever were discussing sexual harassment on the campus <unk> [MASK] and the university that michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed[MASK] <unk> the university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment <unk> [MASK] and for the first the time i felt i wasn 't alone [MASK] you see if there 's anything that i 've learned as an active citizen journalist[MASK] <unk> over the past few years it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard [MASK] we don 't realize that[MASK] when when we are standing up we are not just standing up as individuals <unk>[MASK] we are standing up for our communities our friends our peers most of us say that women are denied their rights <unk> but the truth[MASK] <unk> women deny themselves these rights in a recent survey in india ninety five percent of the women[MASK] who work in i t aviation hospitality and call centers said they didn 't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening [MASK] in bangalore where i come from this number is eighty five percent[MASK] <unk> rural areas in india <unk> [MASK] if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in badaun and acid attacks in odisha and aligarh are supposed to go by [MASK] we need to act really soon [MASK] don 't get me wrong the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real <unk> [MASK] but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media[MASK] <unk> blindly [MASK] today <unk> more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in india <unk> and this is a result of that courage [MASK] there is a sixfold increase in women reporting harassment and the government passed the criminal law act in two thousand and thirteen[MASK] <unk> to protect women against sexual assault as i end this talk i just want to say[MASK] that i know a lot of us in this room have our secrets <unk> [MASK] but let us speak up let us fight the shame and talk about it it could be[MASK] a platform a community your loved one whoever or[MASK] whatever you choose <unk> but let us speak up the truth is the end to this problem begins with us thank you[MASK]
