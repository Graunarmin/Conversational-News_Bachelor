 <unk> security is two different things <unk> it 's a feeling and it 's a reality and they 're different you could feel secure[MASK] even if you 're not <unk> and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it[MASK] really we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word[MASK] and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart[MASK] figuring out when they diverge and how they converge [MASK] and language is actually a problem here <unk> there aren 't a lot of good words for the concepts we 're going to talk about <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] if you look at security from economic terms [MASK] <unk> every time you get some security <unk> you 're always trading off something whether this is a personal decision whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home[MASK] or a national decision where you 're going to invade a foreign country you 're going to trade off something money or time convenience capabilities <unk> [MASK] maybe fundamental liberties <unk> [MASK] and the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not[MASK] whether this makes us safer but whether it 's worth the[MASK] <unk> in the past several years the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power that might be true <unk> but it 's not terribly relevant the question is was it worth it [MASK] and you can make your own decision and then you 'll decide whether the invasion was worth it that 's how you think about security <unk> in terms of the trade off [MASK] now <unk> there 's often no right or wrong here [MASK] some of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don 't[MASK] <unk> 'll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have how much we 're willing to accept the risk of of theft [MASK] in politics also <unk> there are different opinions [MASK] a lot of times these <unk> trade offs are about more than just security and i think that 's really important [MASK] now <unk> people have a natural intuition about these[MASK] <unk> every day <unk> last night in my hotel room when i decided to double lock the door or you in your car when you drove here[MASK] when we go eat lunch and decide the food 's not poison and we 'll eat it[MASK] <unk> we make these <unk> trade offs again and again [MASK] multiple times a day we often won 't even notice them they 're just part of being alive we all do it <unk> every species does it[MASK] imagine a rabbit in a field eating[MASK] <unk> grass and the rabbit sees a fox that rabbit will make a security trade off should i stay or should i flee [MASK] and if you think about it the rabbits that are good at making that trade off will tend to live and reproduce <unk> and the rabbits that are bad at it[MASK] will get eaten or starve <unk> so you 'd think that[MASK] <unk> as a successful species on the planet you me everybody[MASK] would be really good at making these trade offs yet it seems again and again that we 're hopelessly bad at it[MASK] and i think that 's a fundamentally interesting question i 'll give you the short answer [MASK] the answer is we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality <unk> [MASK] now <unk> most of the time that works[MASK] most of the time feeling and reality[MASK] <unk> are the same certainly that 's true[MASK] for most of human prehistory[MASK] we 've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense[MASK] one way to think of it is that we 're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in[MASK] small family groups in the east african highlands in one hundred thousand bc two thousand and ten new york not so much now there are[MASK] several biases in risk perception a lot of good experiments in this <unk> and you can see[MASK] certain biases that come up again and again i 'll give you four we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks[MASK] so flying versus driving[MASK] <unk> the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar[MASK] <unk> one example would be people fear kidnapping by strangers [MASK] when the data supports that kidnapping by relatives is much more common this is for children [MASK] third personified risks[MASK] are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks so bin laden is scarier because he has a[MASK] <unk> in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don 't control <unk> [MASK] so once you take up skydiving or smoking you downplay the risks [MASK] if a risk is thrust upon you terrorism is a good example[MASK] you 'll overplay it <unk> because you don 't feel like it 's in your control there are a bunch of other[MASK] <unk> these cognitive biases that affect our risk decisions [MASK] there 's the availability heuristic <unk> [MASK] which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind <unk> [MASK] so you can imagine how that works if you hear a lot about tiger attacks there must be a lot of tigers around you don 't hear about lion attacks there aren 't a lot of lions around [MASK] this works until you invent newspapers[MASK] because what newspapers do is[MASK] repeat again and again rare risks [MASK] i tell people if it 's in the news don 't worry about it <unk> because by definition news is something that almost never happens [MASK] laughter when something is so common it 's no longer news car crashes domestic violence those are the risks you worry about we[MASK] 're also a species of storytellers <unk> we respond to stories more than data[MASK] <unk> and there 's some basic innumeracy going on i mean [MASK] the joke one two three many is kind of right <unk> [MASK] we 're really good at small numbers one mango two mangoes three mangoes ten thousand mangoes one hundred thousand mangoes it 's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot <unk> [MASK] so one half one quarter one fifth we 're good at that one in a million one in a billion they 're both almost never [MASK] so we have trouble with the[MASK] <unk> that aren 't very common <unk> and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality[MASK] and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack they get different[MASK] now <unk> you either have a feeling you feel more secure than you are there 's a false sense of security <unk> or the other[MASK] <unk> a false sense of insecurity <unk> [MASK] i write a lot about security theater which are products that make people feel secure but don 't actually do anything there 's[MASK] no real word for stuff that makes us secure but doesn 't make us feel secure <unk> maybe it 's what the cia is supposed to do for us [MASK] so back to economics <unk> if economics if the market drives security[MASK] <unk> based on the feeling of security <unk> then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives is to make people feel secure [MASK] and there are two ways to do this one you can make people actually secure and hope they notice <unk> [MASK] or two you can make people just feel secure and hope they don 't notice[MASK] <unk> a couple of things understanding of the security of the risks the threats the countermeasures how they work but if you know stuff you 're more likely[MASK] to have your feelings match reality <unk> [MASK] enough real world examples helps <unk> we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood because we live there <unk> and we get a feeling about it[MASK] that basically matches reality[MASK] security theater is exposed when it 's obvious that it 's not working properly [MASK] ok <unk> so what makes people not notice <unk> well <unk> a poor understanding[MASK] if you don 't understand the risks you don 't understand the costs you 're likely to get the trade off wrong and your feeling doesn 't match[MASK] <unk> for example terrorism almost never happens <unk> it 's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter terrorist measures[MASK] this is why you keep sacrificing virgins and why your unicorn defenses are working just great[MASK] there aren 't enough examples of failures[MASK] also feelings that cloud the issues[MASK] <unk> issues the cognitive biases i talked about earlier fears folk beliefs basically an inadequate model of reality <unk> [MASK] so let me complicate things i have feeling and reality <unk> i want to add a third element i want to add model [MASK] feeling and model are in our head reality is the outside world it doesn 't change it 's real[MASK] <unk> feeling is based on our intuition model is based on reason [MASK] that 's basically the difference in a primitive and simple world there 's really no reason for a model[MASK] because feeling is close to reality <unk> you don 't need a model <unk> but in a modern and complex world <unk> you need models[MASK] <unk> to understand a lot of the risks we face [MASK] there 's no feeling about germs <unk> you need a model to understand them this model[MASK] is an intelligent representation of reality it 's of course limited by[MASK] science by technology <unk> [MASK] we couldn 't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them <unk> [MASK] it 's limited by our cognitive biases[MASK] it has the ability to override our feelings where do we get these models we get them from others <unk> we get them from[MASK] religion from culture <unk> teachers elders a[MASK] couple years ago i was in south africa on safari <unk> the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park he had some very complex models of how[MASK] <unk> and it depended on if you were attacked by a lion leopard rhino or elephant and when you had to run away when you couldn 't run away when you had to climb a tree <unk> when you could never climb a tree <unk> i would have died in a day[MASK] <unk> but he was born there and he[MASK] understood how to survive[MASK] i was born in new york city i could have taken him to new york and he would have died in a day [MASK] laughter because we had different models based on our different experiences[MASK] <unk> models can come from the media from our elected officials think of of models of terrorism child kidnapping[MASK] airline safety car safety <unk> models can come from industry the two i 'm following are surveillance cameras <unk> id[MASK] <unk> quite a lot of our computer security models come from there a lot of models come from science[MASK] health models are a great example think of cancer <unk> bird flu swine flu sars[MASK] <unk> all of our feelings of security about those diseases[MASK] come from models given to us really by science filtered through the media <unk> [MASK] so models can change models are not static as we become more comfortable in our environments[MASK] our model can move closer to our feelings <unk> [MASK] so an example might be if you go back one hundred years ago <unk> when electricity was first becoming common <unk> [MASK] there were a lot of fears about it there were people who were afraid to push doorbells because there was electricity in there and that was dangerous [MASK] <unk> we 're very facile around electricity we change light bulbs without even thinking about it[MASK] our model of of security around electricity[MASK] is something we were we were born into <unk> it hasn 't changed as we were growing up and we 're good at it or think of the[MASK] risks[MASK] on the internet across generations how your parents approach internet[MASK] <unk> versus how you do versus how our our kids will models eventually fade into the background [MASK] intuitive is just another word for familiar <unk> [MASK] so as your model is close to reality <unk> and it converges with feelings <unk> you often don 't even know it 's there[MASK] a nice example of this came from last year and swine swine flu <unk> [MASK] when swine flu first appeared the initial news caused a lot of overreaction[MASK] <unk> now it had a name <unk> which made it scarier than the regular flu even though it was more deadly <unk> [MASK] and people thought doctors should be able to deal with it [MASK] so there was that feeling of lack of control and those two things made the risk more than it was[MASK] as the novelty wore off and the months went by there was some amount of[MASK] <unk> people got used to it <unk> [MASK] there was no new data but there was less fear [MASK] by autumn people thought the doctors should have solved this already <unk> [MASK] and there 's kind of a bifurcation people had to choose between[MASK] fear[MASK] and[MASK] and acceptance[MASK] actually fear and indifference and they kind of chose suspicion and when the vaccine appeared last winter <unk> there were a lot of people[MASK] <unk> a surprising number who refused to get it and it[MASK] 's a nice example of how people 's feelings of security change how their model changes <unk> sort of wildly [MASK] with no new information with no new input [MASK] this kind of thing happens a lot[MASK] <unk> i have a very relativistic view of security i think it depends on the observer and most security decisions have[MASK] a variety of people involved and stakeholders with specific[MASK] <unk> trade offs will try to influence the decision <unk> and i call that their agenda[MASK] and you see agenda this is marketing this is politics[MASK] <unk> trying to convince you to have one model versus another trying to convince you to ignore a model and and[MASK] trust your feelings <unk> marginalizing people with models you don 't like this is not uncommon an[MASK] example a great example is the risk of smoking [MASK] in the history of the past fifty years the smoking risk shows how a model changes and it also shows how an industry fights[MASK] against a model it doesn 't like[MASK] compare that to the secondhand smoke debate[MASK] probably about twenty years behind [MASK] think about seat belts <unk> when i was a kid no one wore a seat belt <unk> nowadays no kid will let you drive if you 're not wearing a seat belt[MASK] compare that to the airbag debate probably about thirty years behind all examples of models[MASK] <unk> changing [MASK] what we learn is that changing models is hard [MASK] models are hard to dislodge if they equal your feelings <unk> you don 't even know you have a model [MASK] and there 's another cognitive bias i 'll call confirmation bias <unk> where we tend to accept data[MASK] that[MASK] confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs[MASK] <unk> so evidence against our model [MASK] we 're likely to ignore even if it 's compelling it has to get very compelling before we 'll pay attention [MASK] new models that extend long periods of time are hard global warming is a great example we 're terrible at models that span eighty years[MASK] we can do to the next[MASK] <unk> just not good at [MASK] so it 's a very hard model to accept <unk> [MASK] we can have both models in our head simultaneously[MASK] that kind of problem where we 're holding both beliefs[MASK] together the cognitive dissonance eventually the new model will replace the old model <unk> strong feelings can create a model[MASK] created a security model[MASK] in a lot of people 's heads also personal experiences with crime can do it <unk> personal health scare a health scare in the news you[MASK] 'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists[MASK] they can create a model instantaneously because they 're very emotive <unk> so in the technological world <unk> we don 't have experience[MASK] <unk> to judge models and we rely on others we rely on proxies and this works as long as it 's the correct others <unk> we rely on[MASK] government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals[MASK] are safe <unk> i flew here yesterday i didn 't check the airplane[MASK] i relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly <unk> we 're here[MASK] <unk> none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us not because we checked <unk> but because we 're pretty sure the building codes here are good[MASK] it 's a model we just accept[MASK] pretty much by faith <unk> and that 's ok <unk> [MASK] <unk> what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models [MASK] have it reflected in their feelings to allow them to make security <unk>[MASK] trade offs when these go out of whack <unk> you have two options one you can fix people 's feelings <unk> directly appeal to feelings <unk> [MASK] it 's manipulation <unk> but it can work <unk> [MASK] the second more honest way[MASK] is to actually fix the model <unk> change happens slowly[MASK] <unk> slowly <unk> the smoking debate took forty years and that was an easy one [MASK] some of this stuff is hard[MASK] really though information seems like our best hope[MASK] and i lied remember i said <unk> feeling model reality <unk> reality doesn 't change it actually does we live in a technological world reality changes all the time <unk> [MASK] <unk> might have for the first time in our species feeling chases model model chases reality reality 's moving they might never catch up[MASK] <unk> we don 't know[MASK] <unk> but in the long term both feeling and reality are important <unk> and i want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this[MASK] <unk> poisonings in the united states <unk> it 's a horrific story someone took a bottle of tylenol [MASK] put poison in it <unk> closed it up put it back on the shelf <unk> someone else bought it and died this terrified people [MASK] there were a couple of copycat attacks <unk> there wasn 't any real risk but people were scared <unk> and this is how[MASK] the tamper proof drug industry was invented[MASK] <unk> that came from this it 's complete security theater[MASK] as a homework assignment think of ten ways to get around it i 'll give you one a syringe[MASK] <unk> but it made people feel better it made their feeling of security more match the reality <unk> [MASK] last story a few years ago a friend of mine gave birth i visit her in the hospital it turns out [MASK] when a baby 's born now they put an rfid bracelet on the baby a corresponding one on the mother <unk> so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward[MASK] <unk> goes off <unk> i said well that 's kind of neat <unk> [MASK] i wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals i go home i look it up it basically never happens [MASK] but if you think about it if you are a hospital <unk> and you need to take a baby away from its mother out of the room to run some tests <unk> [MASK] you better have some good security theater or she 's going to rip your arm off[MASK] laughter so it 's important for us those of us who design security who look at security policy[MASK] or even look at public policy in ways that affect security [MASK] it 's not just reality <unk> it 's feeling and reality <unk> what 's important[MASK] is that they be about the same it 's important that if our feelings match reality <unk> we make better security[MASK]
