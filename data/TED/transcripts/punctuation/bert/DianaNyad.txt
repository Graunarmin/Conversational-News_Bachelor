 <unk> it 's the fifth time i stand on this shore <unk> the cuban shore looking out at that distant horizon[MASK] <unk> again that i 'm going to make it[MASK] all the way across that vast dangerous wilderness of an ocean [MASK] not only have i tried four times but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since one thousand nine hundred and fifty [MASK] and it 's still never been done <unk> [MASK] the team is proud[MASK] of our four attempts <unk> it 's an expedition of some thirty[MASK] <unk> people bonnie[MASK] is my best friend and head handler [MASK] who somehow summons will that last drop of will within me when i think it 's gone after many many hours and days out there [MASK] the shark experts are the best in the world large predators below[MASK] <unk> the box jellyfish the deadliest venom in all of the ocean is in these waters and i have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt <unk> [MASK] the[MASK] conditions themselves besides the sheer distance of over one hundred miles in the open ocean[MASK] the currents and whirling eddies and the gulf stream itself the most unpredictable of all of the planet earth[MASK] <unk> and by the way it 's amusing to me that[MASK] journalists and people before these attempts often[MASK] ask me well are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything and i 'm[MASK] thinking what are they imagining that i 'll just sort of do some celestial navigation and[MASK] carry a bowie knife in my mouth[MASK] <unk> fish and skin them alive and eat them and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water [MASK] yes i have a team [MASK] and the team is expert <unk> and the team is courageous <unk> and brimming with innovation[MASK] and scientific discovery as[MASK] <unk> is true of any major[MASK] expedition on the planet [MASK] and we 've been on a journey[MASK] and the debate has raged hasn 't it since the greeks of isn 't it what it 's all about isn 't life[MASK] about the journey not really the destination and here we 've been on this journey and the truth is it 's been thrilling we haven 't reached that other shore[MASK] <unk> and still our sense of pride and commitment unwavering commitment when i turned sixty <unk> [MASK] the dream was still alive[MASK] from having tried this in my 20s dreamed it and imagined it the most famous body of water on the earth today[MASK] <unk> was deep in my soul <unk>[MASK] when i turned sixty <unk> [MASK] it wasn 't so much about the athletic accomplishment it wasn 't the ego of i want to be the first that 's always there and it 's undeniable [MASK] but it was deeper it was how much life is there left let 's face it we 're all on a one way street aren 't we [MASK] and what are we going to do what are we going to do[MASK] as we go forward to have no regrets[MASK] <unk> looking back [MASK] and all this past year in training [MASK] i had that teddy roosevelt quote to paraphrase it floating around in my brain it says you go ahead <unk> [MASK] you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic you be the observer [MASK] while the brave one gets in the ring[MASK] and engages[MASK] and gets bloody and gets dirty and[MASK] <unk> fails over and over and over again but yet isn 't afraid and isn 't timid and lives life in a bold way [MASK] and so of course i want to make it across it is the goal <unk> and[MASK] i should be so shallow to say that this year <unk> the destination was even sweeter than the journey[MASK] <unk> itself was worthwhile taking <unk> [MASK] and at this point by this summer <unk> everybody scientists sports scientists[MASK] <unk> endurance experts <unk> neurologists [MASK] my own team <unk> bonnie[MASK] said it 's impossible <unk> it just[MASK] simply can 't be done and bonnie said to me but if you 're going to take the journey <unk> i 'm going to see you through to the end of it so i 'll be there [MASK] and now we 're there[MASK] as we 're looking out kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke standing on the rocks at marina hemingway <unk> [MASK] the cuban flag is flying above all my team is out in their boats [MASK] hands up in the air we 're here [MASK] we 're here for you[MASK] <unk> bonnie and i look at each other and say this year the mantra is and i 've been using it in training find a way <unk> you have a dream[MASK] and you have obstacles in front of you as we all do <unk> none of us ever get through this life without heartache <unk>[MASK] <unk> and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a[MASK] great human quality you find your way <unk> and bonnie grabbed my shoulders and she said let 's find our way to florida [MASK] and we started and for the next[MASK] <unk> it was an intense unforgettable life experience <unk> [MASK] the highs were high the awe i 'm not a religious person but i 'll tell you to be in the azure blue of the gulf stream as if as <unk>[MASK] <unk> you 're breathing <unk> you 're looking down miles and miles and miles [MASK] <unk> i have a playlist of about eighty five songs and especially in the middle of the night that night because we use no lights lights attract jellyfish lights attract sharks lights attract[MASK] baitfish that attract sharks <unk> so we go in the pitch black of the night you 've never seen black this black[MASK] <unk> am because there 's no visual at all and i 'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist [MASK] i 've got tight rubber caps i don 't hear a thing i 've got goggles and i 'm turning my head fifty times a minute and i 'm singing [MASK] imagine there 's no heaven doo[MASK] doo doo doo doo it 's easy if you try[MASK] doo doo doo doo doo and i can sing that song a thousand times in a row [MASK] now there 's a talent unto itself [MASK] and each time i get done with[MASK] <unk> and when i get through the end of a thousand of john lennon 's imagine i have swum nine hours and forty five minutes exactly [MASK] and then there are the crises of course there are and the vomiting starts <unk> the seawater you 're not well you 're wearing a[MASK] <unk> jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection <unk> it 's difficult to swim in it 's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth <unk> but the tentacles can 't get you <unk> [MASK] and the hypothermia sets in the water 's eighty five degrees and yet you 're losing weight and using calories and as you come over toward the side of the boat <unk>[MASK] <unk> not allowed to touch it not allowed to get out but bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and ask me[MASK] <unk> all right i am seeing the taj mahal [MASK] over here <unk> i 'm in a very different state [MASK] and i 'm thinking wow <unk> i never thought i 'd be running into the taj mahal out here <unk> it 's[MASK] <unk> we kind of have a cardinal rule that i 'm never told how far it is because we don 't know how far it is what 's going to happen to you between this point and that point what 's going to happen to the weather and the currents and [MASK] god forbid you 're stung when you don 't think you could be stung in all this armor[MASK] bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning[MASK] that i was suffering <unk> and[MASK] i was hanging on by a thread <unk> [MASK] and she said come here and i came close to the boat and she said look [MASK] look out there and i saw light [MASK] because the day is easier than the night and i thought we were coming into day <unk> i saw a stream of white light along the horizon <unk> and i said it 's going to be[MASK] <unk> soon and she said no those are the lights of key west [MASK] it was fifteen more hours <unk> which for most swimmers would be a long time [MASK] you have no idea how many 15 hour training swims i had done [MASK] so here we go and i somehow without a decision[MASK] went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting stephen hawking on the[MASK] parameters of the universe i just went into thinking about this dream and why[MASK] and how as i said when i turned sixty it wasn 't about that concrete[MASK] <unk> that 's the everyday machinations that 's the discipline and it 's the preparation and there 's a pride in that but[MASK] i decided to think as i went along about[MASK] you know the phrase usually is reaching for the stars and in my case it 's reaching for the horizon <unk> [MASK] and when you reach for the horizon <unk> as i 've proven you may not get[MASK] <unk> what a tremendous build of character and spirit[MASK] that you that you lay down what a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons[MASK] <unk> and now the shore is coming <unk> [MASK] and there 's just a little part of me that 's sad <unk> the epic journey is going to be over so many people come up[MASK] <unk> that little tracker on the computer when are you going to do the next one we can 't wait to follow the next one well they were just there for fifty three hours and[MASK] i was there for years <unk> and[MASK] so there won 't be another epic journey in the ocean but the point is and the point was that[MASK] every day of our lives is epic and i 'll tell you when i walked up onto that beach[MASK] <unk> up onto that beach i had so many times in a very <unk> puffed up ego way <unk> [MASK] rehearsed what i would say [MASK] on the beach when bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up she brought the medical team over to our boat to say she 's really beginning to have trouble breathing another twelve[MASK] <unk> saltwater the whole thing i just thought in my hallucinatory moment that i heard the word tracheotomy laughter[MASK] bonnie said to the doctor i 'm not worried about her not breathing if she can 't talk when she gets to the shore she 's going to be pissed off[MASK] <unk> that i had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation[MASK] it wasn 't like that it was a very real moment with that crowd with my team [MASK] we did it <unk> i didn 't do it we did it and we 'll never forget it it 'll always be part of us[MASK] the three things i did sort of blurt out when we got there was first never ever give up [MASK] <unk> it what 's the phrase from today from socrates audience to be is to do diana nyad [MASK] to be is to do so i don 't stand up and say don 't ever give up i didn 't give up <unk> [MASK] there was action behind these words the second is <unk> you can chase your dreams at any age you 're never too old <unk>[MASK] <unk> no one at any age any gender <unk> could ever do has done it and[MASK] <unk> doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today [MASK] yeah [MASK] thank you <unk> [MASK] and the third thing i said on that beach was it looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world and in many ways of course it is [MASK] and in other ways <unk> and the most important ways <unk> it 's a[MASK] <unk> team <unk> and if you think i 'm a badass you want to meet bonnie bonnie where are you <unk> where are you <unk> [MASK] there 's bonnie stoll [MASK] my buddy [MASK] the henry david thoreau quote[MASK] <unk> when you achieve your dreams it 's not so much what you get[MASK] as who you have become in achieving them [MASK] and yeah i stand before you now in the three months since that swim ended i 've sat down with oprah <unk> [MASK] and i 've been in president obama 's oval office [MASK] i 've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves i 've signed a wonderful major book contract all of that 's great and i don 't denigrate it i 'm[MASK] proud of it all but the truth is i 'm walking around tall because i am that bold[MASK] <unk> fearless person <unk> and i will be every day until it 's time[MASK] for these days to be done thank you very much and enjoy the conference [MASK]
