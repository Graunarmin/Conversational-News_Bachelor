 <unk> i 'm going to try to give you[MASK] a view of the world as i see it <unk> the problems and the opportunities that we face <unk> and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or[MASK] <unk> let you in on a secret which is why i am an incurable optimist <unk> let me start off[MASK] showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before now you 've all seen inconvenient[MASK] truth this is a little more inconvenient man [MASK] extremely dangerous questions because with our present[MASK] <unk> we have no idea what would happen [MASK] even now <unk> man may be unwittingly changing the world 's climate through the waste products of his civilization [MASK] due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide which helps air absorb heat from the sun[MASK] our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer <unk> this is bad well[MASK] it 's been calculated a few degrees ' rise in the earth 's temperature would melt the polar ice caps[MASK] and if this happens an inland sea would fill a good portion of the mississippi valley <unk> [MASK] tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of miami through one hundred and fifty feet of tropical[MASK] <unk> not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters <unk> [MASK] but with life itself larry brilliant should we feel good or should we feel bad[MASK] that fifty years of foreknowledge accomplished so little well it depends really on[MASK] what your goals are <unk> and i think <unk> as my goals i always go back to gandhi 's talisman[MASK] <unk> mahatma gandhi was asked how do you know if the next act that you are about to do[MASK] is the right one or the wrong one [MASK] he said consider the face of the poorest most vulnerable human being[MASK] that you ever chanced upon <unk> and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that[MASK] <unk> person <unk> and if it will be it 's the right thing to do and if not rethink it [MASK] for those of us in this room it 's not just the poorest[MASK] and the most vulnerable individual <unk> it 's the community <unk> it 's the culture <unk> it 's the world itself and the trends[MASK] the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society who are the poorest and the most vulnerable[MASK] the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism <unk> [MASK] but there 's also a wonderful case for optimism let 's review them both <unk> [MASK] first of all the megatrends [MASK] there 's two degrees or three degrees of climate change baked into the system <unk> [MASK] it will cause rising seas <unk> it will cause[MASK] saline[MASK] deposited into wells and into lands <unk> it will disproportionately harm the poorest[MASK] and the most vulnerable as will the increasing[MASK] rise of population even though we 've dodged paul ehrlich 's population bomb and we will not see twenty billion people[MASK] <unk> in this decade as he had forecast we eat as if we were twenty billion <unk> and we consume so much[MASK] that again a rise of six point five billion to nine point five billion in our grandchildren 's lifetime[MASK] will disproportionately hurt the poorest[MASK] and the most vulnerable that 's why they migrate to cities that 's why in june of this year we passed as a species[MASK] fifty one percent of us[MASK] living in cities and bustees and slums <unk> and shantytowns <unk> [MASK] the rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did the green revolution never reached africa [MASK] and with desertification <unk> sandstorms the gobi desert the[MASK] <unk> we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare[MASK] to produce as many calories as it did even fifteen years ago <unk> [MASK] so humans are turning more towards animal consumption in africa last year africans ate[MASK] six hundred million wild animals and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat and every kilogram of bush meat[MASK] contained hundreds[MASK] <unk> of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted <unk> the genomic sequences of which we don 't know their fitness[MASK] for creating pandemics[MASK] we are unaware of but we are ripe for[MASK] most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth <unk> but it has a dark side[MASK] <unk> one percent of us own forty percent of all the goods and services <unk> what will happen[MASK] if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day[MASK] <unk> rise to three billion in the next thirty years [MASK] the one percent will own even more than forty percent of all the world 's goods and services not because they 've grown richer <unk> [MASK] but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer [MASK] last week bill clinton[MASK] <unk> 's lots of reason for pessimism <unk> darfur is at its origin a resource war [MASK] last year there were eighty five thousand[MASK] riots in china two hundred and thirty a day that required police or military intervention most of them were about resources[MASK] <unk> we are facing an unprecedented number scale of disasters some are <unk>[MASK] related epidemics <unk> and the newly emerging diseases may make[MASK] <unk> and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come <unk> it 's a destabilized world[MASK] <unk> and unlike destabilized world in the past it will be broadcast to you on youtube [MASK] you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones[MASK] <unk> what will that lead to for some it will lead to anger <unk> religious and sectarian violence[MASK] and terrorism for others[MASK] <unk> where does it take us as social activists and entrepreneurs <unk> as we look at these trends do we become despondent [MASK] or will we become energized let 's look at one case the case of bangladesh[MASK] <unk> carbon dioxide emissions stopped today global warming would continue <unk> and even with global warming[MASK] if you can see these blue lines <unk> the dotted line shows that even if[MASK] emissions[MASK] of greenhouse gasses stopped today <unk> the next decades will see rising sea levels a minimum[MASK] of twenty to thirty inches[MASK] of increase in sea levels[MASK] is the best case that we can hope for and it could be ten times that [MASK] what will that do to bangladesh let 's take a look [MASK] so here 's bangladesh <unk> seventy percent of bangladesh[MASK] is at less than five feet above sea level[MASK] <unk> 's go up and take a look at the himalayas and we 'll watch as[MASK] global warming makes them melt more water comes down the deforested areas here in the tarai [MASK] will be unable to absorb the effluent because trees are like straws[MASK] that suck up the extra seasonal water <unk> now we 're looking down south through the kali gandaki many of you i think have probably trekked here[MASK] <unk> and we 're going to cruise down and take a look[MASK] at bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin[MASK] increases in water coming from the north <unk> and in the seas rising[MASK] from the south <unk> looking at the five major rivers[MASK] that feed bangladesh and now let 's look from the south <unk> looking up and let 's see this in[MASK] <unk> relief a[MASK] minimum of twenty to forty inches of[MASK] increase in seas <unk> coupled with increasing flows[MASK] from the himalayas <unk> and take a look at this [MASK] as many as one hundred million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate[MASK] into india and into china this is[MASK] the difficulty that one country faces <unk> but if you look at the globe all around[MASK] the earth <unk> wherever there is low lying area <unk> populated areas near the[MASK] <unk> you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life sub saharan africa <unk> and even our own san francisco[MASK] bay area <unk> we 're all in this together [MASK] this is not something that happens far away to people that we don 't know global warming is something[MASK] that happens to all of us all at once [MASK] <unk> as are these newly emerging communicable diseases <unk> [MASK] names that you hadn 't heard twenty years ago ebola lhasa fever monkey pox with the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans <unk> [MASK] we live in each other 's viral environment [MASK] do you remember twenty years ago no one had ever heard of west nile fever and then we watched as[MASK] one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year <unk> westwardly do you remember[MASK] <unk> one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in central africa from it <unk> [MASK] it 's just the beginning unfortunately there have been thirty novel[MASK] emerging communicable diseases[MASK] that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last thirty years it 's more than enough reason for pessimism[MASK] but now let 's look at the case for optimism [MASK] enough of the bad news <unk> [MASK] human beings have always risen to the challenge you just need to look at the list of nobel laureates to remind ourselves [MASK] we 've been here before <unk> paralyzed by fear <unk> [MASK] <unk> when some probably one of you in this room[MASK] jumped into the breach and created an organization like physicians for social responsibility <unk> which fought against[MASK] the nuclear threat [MASK] medicins sans frontieres [MASK] that renewed our commitment to disaster relief <unk> mohamed elbaradei <unk> and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us and our own[MASK] muhammad yunus[MASK] <unk> we 've seen the eradication of smallpox <unk> [MASK] we may see the eradication of polio this year <unk> last year there were only two thousand cases in the world <unk> [MASK] we may see the eradication of guinea worm[MASK] next year[MASK] there are only thirty five thousand cases left in the world <unk> twenty years ago <unk> there were three and a half[MASK] <unk> we 've seen a new disease not like[MASK] the thirty novel[MASK] emerging communicable diseases this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome [MASK] it 's an amazing phenomenon [MASK] all throughout the technology world we 're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome <unk> [MASK] but they 're using their wealth[MASK] in a way that their forefathers never did[MASK] <unk> they 're not waiting until they die to create foundations [MASK] they 're actively guiding their money their resources their hearts their commitments to make the world a better place <unk> [MASK] certainly nothing can give you more optimism[MASK] than that more reasons to be optimistic in the ' 60s and i am a creature of the[MASK] <unk> there was a movement <unk> we all felt that we were part of it that a better world was right around the corner that we were watching the birth[MASK] of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice [MASK] today there 's another kind of movement <unk> it 's a movement to save the earth <unk> it 's just beginning [MASK] five weeks ago a group of activists from the business community[MASK] gathered together to stop a texas utility[MASK] <unk> from building nine coal fired electrical plants[MASK] that would have contributed to destroying the environment <unk> six months ago <unk> a group of business activists[MASK] gathered together to join with the republican governor in california to pass ab thirty two the most far reaching legislation[MASK] in environmental history al gore[MASK] made presentations in the house and the senate[MASK] as an expert witness can you imagine we 're seeing an entente cordiale[MASK] between science and religion that five years ago i would not have believed as the evangelical community[MASK] has understood the desperate situation of[MASK] <unk> warming <unk> and now four thousand churches have joined the environmental movement it is something to be greatly optimistic about [MASK] the european <unk>[MASK] <unk> plan is an amazing breakthrough something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon[MASK] <unk> there will be step up day <unk> where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the united states on protest[MASK] against legislation[MASK] pushing for legislation to stop global warming and on july 7th around the world i learned only yesterday there will be global live[MASK] <unk> and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air now that doesn 't mean that people understand[MASK] that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most [MASK] that means that people are beginning the first step which is acting out of their own self interest [MASK] but i am seeing in the major funders in care rockefeller rockefeller brothers[MASK] fund <unk> hewlett mercy corps you guys[MASK] <unk> so many other organizations [MASK] a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming <unk> [MASK] but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming[MASK] on the poorest and the most vulnerable <unk> but for me i have another reason[MASK] to be an incurable optimist <unk> and you 've heard so many inspiring[MASK] <unk> stories here <unk> and i heard so many last night[MASK] that i thought i would share a little bit of mine [MASK] my background is not exactly conventional medical training <unk> [MASK] and i lived in a himalayan monastery <unk> and i studied with a very wise teacher <unk> who kicked me out of the[MASK] monastery one day and told me[MASK] <unk> it was my destiny it felt like yoda it is your destiny[MASK] to go to work for <unk> who and to help eradicate smallpox <unk> at a time when there was no smallpox program <unk> [MASK] it should make you optimistic[MASK] that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history <unk> in the last century[MASK] that 's the one that was seven years ago[MASK] half a billion people died from smallpox <unk> more than all the[MASK] <unk> wars in history <unk> more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world in the summer of love <unk>[MASK] two million people children died of smallpox <unk> it 's not ancient history <unk> when you read the biblical plague[MASK] <unk> of boils that was smallpox <unk> [MASK] pharaoh ramses the fifth whose picture is here <unk> died of smallpox to eradicate smallpox <unk> [MASK] we had to gather the largest united nations army in history <unk> we visited every house in india searching for smallpox[MASK] one hundred and twenty million houses <unk> once every month for nearly two years [MASK] in a cruel reversal after we had almost conquered smallpox and this is what you must learn[MASK] as a social entrepreneur the realm of the final inch when we had almost eradicated smallpox <unk> it came back again <unk> [MASK] because the company town of tatanagar drew laborers <unk> who could come there and get employment <unk> [MASK] and they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox [MASK] <unk> they went home to die and when they did they took smallpox to ten other countries[MASK] and reignited the epidemic and we had to start all over again <unk> [MASK] but in the end <unk> we succeeded and the last case of smallpox <unk> [MASK] this little girl rahima banu[MASK] barisal <unk> in bangladesh when she coughed or breathed and the last[MASK] <unk> virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun[MASK] killed that last virus <unk> thus ended a chain of transmission[MASK] of history 's greatest horror[MASK]
