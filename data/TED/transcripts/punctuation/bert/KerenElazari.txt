 <unk> four years ago a security researcher or as most people would call it a hacker [MASK] found a way to literally make atms throw money at him his name was barnaby jack [MASK] <unk> technique[MASK] was later called jackpotting in his honor i 'm here today because i think we actually need hackers <unk> [MASK] barnaby jack[MASK] could have easily turned into a career criminal or james bond villain[MASK] with his knowledge <unk> but he chose to show the world his research instead he believed that[MASK] <unk> sometimes[MASK] you have to demo a threat to spark a solution <unk> [MASK] and i feel the same way that 's why i 'm here today [MASK] we are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have they scare us <unk> [MASK] but the choices they make[MASK] have dramatic outcomes that influence us all[MASK] so i am here today because i think we need hackers <unk> and in fact <unk> they just might be the immune system[MASK] for the information age <unk> [MASK] sometimes they make us sick <unk> but they also find those hidden threats in our world and they make us[MASK] <unk> i knew that i might get hacked[MASK] for giving this talk [MASK] so let me save you the effort in true ted fashion here is my most embarrassing picture <unk> [MASK] but it would be difficult for you to find me in it <unk> because i 'm the one who looks like a boy[MASK] standing to the side i was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the dungeons and dragons team wouldn 't let me join[MASK] <unk> this is who i was but this[MASK] is who i wanted to be <unk> [MASK] angelina jolie <unk> she portrayed acid burn in the ' ninety five film hackers she was pretty and she could rollerblade <unk> [MASK] but being a hacker [MASK] that made her powerful and i wanted to be just like her so i started spending a lot of time on hacker chat[MASK] <unk> rooms and online forums <unk> i remember one late night i found a bit of php code <unk> i didn 't really know what it did but i <unk>[MASK] <unk> it and used it anyway to get into a <unk>[MASK] <unk> site like that open sesame[MASK] it was a simple trick <unk> and i was just a script kiddie back then but to me that trick <unk> it felt like this[MASK] <unk> like i had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips <unk> [MASK] this is the rush of power that hackers feel <unk> it 's geeks just like me[MASK] discovering they have access to superpower one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect <unk> but thankfully no[MASK] <unk> but with great power comes great responsibility <unk> and you all like to think that if we had such powers we would only use them for good but[MASK] what if you could read your ex 's emails or add a couple zeros to your bank account [MASK] what would you do then <unk> [MASK] indeed <unk> many hackers do not resist those temptations <unk> [MASK] and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year[MASK] to fraud malware or plain old identity theft which is a serious issue but there are other hackers hackers who just like to break things <unk> [MASK] and it is precisely those hackers[MASK] that can find the weaker elements in our world[MASK] and make us fix it <unk> this is what happened last year when[MASK] <unk> another security researcher called kyle lovett[MASK] discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office <unk> [MASK] he learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers [MASK] no password needed <unk> he reported it to the company of course <unk> but they ignored his report [MASK] perhaps they thought universal access was a feature not a[MASK] <unk> bug <unk> [MASK] until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people 's files <unk> [MASK] but they didn 't steal anything <unk> they left a note <unk> [MASK] your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world here 's what you should do to fix it we hope we helped [MASK] <unk> by getting into people 's files like that yeah they broke the law <unk> but they also forced that company to fix their product <unk> [MASK] making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure[MASK] in the hacker community <unk> [MASK] and it is controversial but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day <unk> [MASK] this is what[MASK] <unk> khalil is a palestinian hacker from the west bank <unk> and he found a serious privacy flaw on facebook[MASK] which he attempted to report through the company 's bug bounty program <unk> these are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers[MASK] disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code <unk> unfortunately <unk> due to some miscommunications his report was[MASK] <unk> frustrated with the exchange he took to use his own discovery[MASK] to post on mark zuckerberg 's wall <unk> [MASK] this got their attention all right <unk> and they fixed the bug [MASK] but because he hadn 't reported it properly <unk> he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries <unk> thankfully for khalil[MASK] <unk> group of hackers were watching out for him in fact <unk> they raised more than thirteen thousand dollars to reward him for this discovery <unk> [MASK] raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing <unk> [MASK] but i think there 's a greater story here still [MASK] even companies founded by hackers like facebook[MASK] <unk> still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers <unk> [MASK] and so for more conservative organizations <unk> it is going to take time and adapting[MASK] in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it <unk> [MASK] but i think it 's worth the effort <unk> because the alternative to blindly fight all[MASK] <unk> is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge <unk> [MASK] these are things that will come back and bite you [MASK] it is even more true[MASK] if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom[MASK] for ideals like the freedom of the web[MASK] especially in times like[MASK] <unk> like today even as governments and corporates[MASK] fight to control the internet i find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace[MASK] can become its voice of opposition <unk> its last line of defense even [MASK] perhaps someone like anonymous the leading brand of global hacktivism [MASK] this universal hacker movement needs no introduction today[MASK] but six years ago[MASK] they were not much more than an internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and internet trolling campaigns [MASK] their moment of transformation[MASK] was in early two thousand and eight when the church of scientology[MASK] attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites[MASK] <unk> this is when anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of internet dwellers <unk> it turns out [MASK] the internet doesn 't like it when you try to remove things from it and it will react[MASK] with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks[MASK] and with a series of organized protests all around the world from my hometown of tel aviv to[MASK] <unk> adelaide australia <unk> this proved that anonymous and this idea[MASK] can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets <unk> [MASK] and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world <unk> [MASK] since then[MASK] <unk> they 've gone after many targets they 've uncovered corruption <unk> abuse they 've hacked popes and politicians <unk> [MASK] and i think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or[MASK] even leak sensitive documents i think that like[MASK] robin hood <unk> they are in the business of redistribution <unk> but what they are after[MASK] isn 't your money <unk> it 's not your documents <unk> it 's your attention[MASK] they grab the spotlight for causes they support <unk> [MASK] forcing us to take note <unk> [MASK] acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be [MASK] they have been called many names from criminals to terrorists and i cannot justify[MASK] <unk> but the ideas they fight for[MASK] are ones that matter to us all [MASK] the reality is hackers can do a lot more than break things <unk> they can bring people together <unk> [MASK] and if the internet doesn 't like it when you try to remove things from it just watch what happens when you try to shut the internet down [MASK] this took place in egypt in january two thousand and eleven[MASK] hosni mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of cairo <unk> [MASK] he sent his personal troops down to egypt 's internet service providers[MASK] and had them physically kill the switch[MASK] on the country 's connection to the world overnight for a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented and for hackers[MASK] <unk> made it personal [MASK] hackers like the telecomix group were already active on the ground <unk> helping egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like morse code and ham radio <unk> [MASK] it was high season for low tech which the government couldn 't block <unk> [MASK] but when the net went completely[MASK] <unk> brought in the big guns <unk> they found european service providers that still had[MASK] <unk> analog dial up access infrastructure they opened up three hundred of those lines for egyptians to use [MASK] serving slow but sweet internet connection for egyptians [MASK] this worked <unk> it worked so well in fact <unk> one guy even used it to download an episode of how i met your mother[MASK] <unk> but while egypt 's future is still uncertain [MASK] when the same thing happened in syria just one year later telecomix were prepared with those internet lines [MASK] and anonymous they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the syrian military[MASK] by defacing their website <unk> but with this sort of power[MASK] it really depends on where you stand <unk> because one man 's hero[MASK] can be another 's villain <unk> [MASK] and so the syrian electronic army is a pro assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime <unk> [MASK] they 've taken down multiple <unk> high profile targets in the past[MASK] <unk> including the associated press 's twitter account in which they posted a a message[MASK] about an attack on the white house injuring president obama <unk> [MASK] this tweet was fake of course <unk> but the resulting drop in the dow jones index that day was most certainly not [MASK] and a lot of people lost a lot of money <unk> this[MASK] sort of thing is happening all over the world right now [MASK] in conflicts from the crimean peninsula to latin america from europe to the united states [MASK] hackers are a force for social <unk> political and military influence [MASK] as individuals or in groups volunteers or military conflicts there are hackers everywhere <unk> they come from all walks of life[MASK] <unk> and genders <unk> i might add they are now shaping the world 's stage [MASK] hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century <unk> this is because access to information[MASK] is a critical currency of power one which governments would like to control a thing they attempt to do by setting up[MASK] thing they need hackers for by the way <unk> and so the establishment has long had a love hate relationship when it comes to hackers <unk> [MASK] because the same people who demonize hacking[MASK] also utilize it at large <unk> two years ago <unk> i saw general keith alexander he 's the[MASK] <unk> commander <unk> [MASK] but instead of his four star general uniform <unk> he was wearing jeans and a t shirt [MASK] this was at def con the world 's largest hacker conference [MASK] perhaps like me general alexander didn 't see twelve thousand criminals that day in vegas [MASK] i think he saw untapped potential[MASK] <unk> he was there to give a hiring pitch in this room right here he said is the talent our nation needs well [MASK] hackers in the back row replied then stop arresting us [MASK] indeed <unk> for years hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence <unk> [MASK] but in light of what we know now [MASK] who is more watchful[MASK] of our online[MASK] <unk> world the rules of the game are not that clear anymore but hackers[MASK] are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data hoarding corporates on their own playing field [MASK] to me that represents hope [MASK] for the past three decades hackers have done a lot of things but they have also impacted civil liberties[MASK] <unk> innovation and internet freedom [MASK] so i think it 's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them <unk> because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys [MASK] how can they be the heroes too [MASK] my years in the hacker world have made me realize[MASK] both the problem[MASK] <unk> and the beauty[MASK] about hackers <unk> they just can 't see something broken in the world and leave it be they are compelled[MASK] to either exploit it or try and change it and so they find the vulnerable aspects[MASK] in our rapidly changing world they make us <unk> they force us to fix things or demand[MASK] <unk> i think we need[MASK]
