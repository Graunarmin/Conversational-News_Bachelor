 <unk> i woke up in the middle of the night[MASK] with the sound of heavy explosion <unk> [MASK] it was deep at night <unk> i do not remember what time it was i just remember the sound was so[MASK] heavy and so very shocking[MASK] <unk> everything in my room was shaking[MASK] my heart my windows my bed <unk> everything i looked out the windows[MASK] and i saw a full <unk>[MASK] of explosion <unk> i thought it was just like the movies but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that i was seeing[MASK] <unk> full of bright[MASK] red and orange and gray and a full circle of explosion and i kept[MASK] on staring at it until it disappeared <unk> [MASK] i went back to my bed <unk> and i prayed <unk> and i secretly thanked god[MASK] that that missile did not land on my family 's home[MASK] <unk> that it did not kill my family that night <unk> [MASK] thirty years have passed <unk> and i still feel guilty about that prayer [MASK] for the next day i learned that that missile landed on my brother 's friend 's home[MASK] and killed him and his father but did not kill his mother or[MASK] <unk> his sister [MASK] his mother showed up the next week at my brother 's classroom and begged <unk>[MASK] kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son for she had lost[MASK] this is not a story of a nameless[MASK] <unk> survivor of war and nameless refugees whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv[MASK] with tattered clothes <unk> dirty face scared eyes this is not[MASK] a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war who we do not know their hopes their dreams their accomplishments[MASK] families their beliefs their values this is my story <unk> i[MASK] was that girl <unk> i am another image and vision[MASK] of another survivor of war <unk> i am that refugee and i am[MASK] <unk> and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we 've only seen one side of it <unk> [MASK] we only talk about one side of it <unk> [MASK] but there 's another side[MASK] that i have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it <unk> i grew up with the colors[MASK] <unk> of war[MASK] the red colors of fire and blood <unk> [MASK] the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces[MASK] and the piercing silver of an exploded missile so bright[MASK] that nothing can protect your eyes from it <unk> i grew up with the sounds of war[MASK] <unk> the staccato sounds of gunfire <unk> [MASK] the wrenching booms of explosions ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens <unk> [MASK] these are the sounds you would expect but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds[MASK] screeching in the night the[MASK] high pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous[MASK] <unk> iraq[MASK] and founded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars[MASK] in my travels and in my work from congo[MASK] to afghanistan from sudan to rwanda i have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same <unk> but the fears of[MASK] <unk> you know there is a fear of dying <unk> [MASK] and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid it is very scary to go through that feeling of i am about to die or i could die in this explosion [MASK] but there 's also the fear[MASK] of losing loved ones and i think[MASK] <unk> too painful you don 't want to think about it but i think[MASK] the worst kind of fear is the fear as samia a bosnian woman once told me who survived the four years besiege of sarajevo she said the fear of losing the ' i ' in me <unk> [MASK] the fear of losing the ' i[MASK] <unk> that 's what my mother in iraq used to tell me it 's like dying from[MASK] a palestinian woman once told me it is not about the fear of one death she said sometimes i feel i die ten times[MASK] in one day as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets <unk> she said but it 's not fair[MASK] <unk> because there is only one life <unk> and there should only be one death [MASK] we have been[MASK] only seeing one side of war <unk> [MASK] we have only been discussing and consumed with high level preoccupations over troop levels <unk> drawdown timelines surges and sting operations <unk>[MASK] when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric[MASK] has been most torn [MASK] where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage[MASK] just to keep life going <unk> we have been so consumed[MASK] with seemingly objective discussions of politics tactics weapons dollars and[MASK] this is the language of sterility [MASK] how casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic [MASK] this is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities [MASK] eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children[MASK] <unk> of modern war casualties[MASK] are civilians seventy five percent of them are women and children how interesting <unk> [MASK] oh <unk> half a million women in rwanda get raped in one hundred days or as we speak now <unk> [MASK] hundreds of thousands of congolese women are getting raped and mutilated how interesting these just become numbers that[MASK] <unk> we refer to the front of wars is increasingly non human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies[MASK] from space guiding missiles toward unseen targets <unk> [MASK] while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone[MASK] attack hits a villager instead of an extremist[MASK] it is a chess game [MASK] you learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership <unk> checkmate <unk> [MASK] we are missing a completely other side of wars <unk> [MASK] we are missing my mother 's story who made sure with every siren with every raid[MASK] <unk> with every cut off of electricity she played puppet shows for my brothers and i so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions <unk> [MASK] we are missing the story of fareeda [MASK] a music teacher a piano teacher in sarajevo who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in sarajevo[MASK] and walked[MASK] to that school <unk> despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her and kept[MASK] the piano the violin the cello playing the whole duration of the war <unk> with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats [MASK] that was her fight that was her resistance <unk> [MASK] <unk> missing the story of nehia a palestinian woman in gaza who the minute there was[MASK] <unk> in the last year 's war she left out of home <unk> collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have in case there is no cease fire the day after <unk> [MASK] we are missing the stories of violet who despite surviving genocide in the church[MASK] <unk> she kept on going on burying bodies cleaning homes cleaning the streets <unk> [MASK] we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars [MASK] do you know[MASK] do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school[MASK] and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going and the ones[MASK] <unk> who are keeping that life are women [MASK] there are two sides of war <unk> [MASK] there is a side that fights <unk> and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open [MASK] there is a side that is focused on winning battles <unk> and there is a side that is[MASK] <unk> there is a side that leads the front line discussion and there is a side that leads the back line discussion <unk> [MASK] there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting [MASK] and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs <unk> [MASK] there is a side that is led by men <unk> and there is a side that is[MASK] <unk> led by women and in order for us[MASK] to understand how do we build lasting peace <unk> [MASK] we must understand war and peace from both sides <unk> we must have a full picture of what that means [MASK] in order for us to understand what actually[MASK] <unk> we need to understand as one sudanese woman once told me[MASK] is the fact that my toenails are growing back again [MASK] she grew up in sudan in southern sudan for twenty years of war <unk> [MASK] where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees [MASK] many women were taken as slaves by rebels and[MASK] <unk> as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers so that woman[MASK] walked for twenty years so she would not be kidnapped again [MASK] and only when there was some sort of peace her toenails grew back again <unk> [MASK] we need to understand peace from a toenail 's perspective[MASK] <unk> need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table <unk> [MASK] i find it amazing[MASK] that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping [MASK] and the group of people who are mostly though not exclusively who are keeping life going in the midst of war are not included in[MASK] <unk> the negotiating table <unk> [MASK] and i do argue that women lead the back line discussion but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion the doctors who are not fighting <unk> [MASK] the artists <unk> the students the men who refuse to pick up the guns they are too excluded from the negotiating tables [MASK] there is no way we can talk about a lasting peace building of democracy[MASK] <unk> sustainable economies any kind of stabilities if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table <unk> not one [MASK] but fifty percent [MASK] there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we we don 't start investing in women and girls [MASK] did you know[MASK] that one year of the world 's military[MASK] <unk> spending equals seven hundred years of the u n budget[MASK] and equals two thousand nine hundred and twenty eight years of the u n budget allocated for women [MASK] if we just reverse that distribution of funds <unk> perhaps[MASK] we could have a better lasting peace in this world[MASK] <unk> last but not least we need to invest in peace[MASK] and women not only because it is the right thing to do [MASK] not only because it is the right thing to do for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today <unk> but it is for the future [MASK] a congolese woman who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them[MASK] and saw[MASK] <unk> her raped in front of them[MASK] and mutilated in front of them and her children saw their nine year old sibling killed in front of them [MASK] how they 're doing okay right now <unk> [MASK] she got into women for women international 's program she got a support network she learned about her rights we taught her vocational and business skills we helped her get a job she was earning four hundred and fifty dollars she was doing okay she was sending them to school have a new home[MASK] she said but what i worry about the most is not any of that i worry that my children have hate in their hearts <unk> [MASK] and when they want to grow up they want to fight again[MASK] the killers of their father and their brother we need to invest in women because that 's our only chance[MASK] to ensure that there is no more[MASK] <unk> war in the future that mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do [MASK] are there good news of course there are good news there are lots of good news to start with <unk> [MASK] these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day <unk> and if they can who are we not to dance [MASK] that girl that i told you about[MASK] <unk> ended up starting women for women international group that impacted one million people sent eighty million dollars and i started this from zero nothing nada [ unclear ] [MASK] they are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances not because of it <unk> [MASK] think of how the world can be a much better place[MASK] if for a change <unk> we have a better equality <unk> we have equality <unk> [MASK] we have a representation and we understand war <unk> both from the[MASK] <unk> you there [MASK] when the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about <unk> [MASK] ideas language even the
