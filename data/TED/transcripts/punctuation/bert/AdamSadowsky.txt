 <unk> hi there i 'm going to be talking a little bit about[MASK] music <unk> machines and life [MASK] or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video [MASK] some of you may recognize this image this is the opening[MASK] <unk> frame of the video that we created we 'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about[MASK] what it is that they wanted <unk> now when we first started talking to ok go[MASK] the name of the song is this too shall pass [MASK] we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with <unk> and we were very excited about this because [MASK] of course they have a history of[MASK] <unk> dancing with machines [MASK] they 're responsible for this video here it goes again[MASK] <unk> 50 million plus views on youtube <unk> four guys dancing on treadmills[MASK] <unk> no cuts just a static camera a fantastically viral and wonderful video so we were really excited about working with them and[MASK] we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you[MASK] <unk> who don 't know a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption an incredibly[MASK] piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task <unk> so we were excited by this idea <unk> and we started talking about exactly what it would look like <unk> and we came up with some parameters <unk> because you know[MASK] <unk> but it also is pretty wide open <unk> and we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video <unk> so[MASK] we came up with a list of requirements the ten commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty <unk> the first is no magic everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a[MASK] <unk> rule of thumb was that if my mother couldn 't understand it then we couldn 't use it in the video <unk> [MASK] they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members <unk> specifically not the other way around [MASK] they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander[MASK] in its process they wanted us to make use of the space <unk> so we have this[MASK] <unk> warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige [MASK] the machine itself would start the music <unk> so the machine would get started it would travel some distance <unk> reacting along the way <unk> hit play on an ipod or a <unk>[MASK] <unk> tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout[MASK] and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way <unk> [MASK] okay [MASK] they wanted it to end precisely on time okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect <unk> and they wanted the music to drop out at a[MASK] certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song [MASK] and as if that wasn 't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right <unk> they wanted it in one shot <unk>[MASK] just some statistics[MASK] <unk> get it on film to our satisfaction of those eighty five takes <unk> only three actually successfully completed their run [MASK] we destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process <unk> we went to home[MASK] <unk> shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it 's actually in the machine [MASK] so what did we learn from all of this well[MASK] <unk> having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things <unk> and we learned that small stuff stinks [MASK] little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust <unk> and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to[MASK] to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn 't matter what temperature it is doesn 't matter what 's in its way[MASK] will pretty much get where it needs to go <unk> but as much as the small stuff stinks <unk> we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go <unk> and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it small stuff stinks <unk> but of course it 's essential <unk> right <unk> [MASK] what else planning is incredibly important you[MASK] we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it 's been said[MASK] <unk> no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and[MASK] she 's a cruel mistress <unk> [MASK] often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever <unk> and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine [MASK] so also put reliable stuff last[MASK] <unk> stuff that 's going to run every time again small to large[MASK] is relevant here the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big <unk> real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there 's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and[MASK] that 's a problem but you don 't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn 't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you know you don 't have to reset the whole thing[MASK] can be messy <unk> [MASK] there were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing <unk> months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we that we had when we finally completed it so it 's important to remember that whether it 's good or it 's bad [MASK] this too shall[MASK] <unk> and now to introduce their music video <unk> we have ok go[MASK] <unk> we can still do one better i think[MASK] <unk> oh[MASK] <unk> okay[MASK]
