 <unk> start with a question that has just been[MASK] consuming me since i first became familiar with your work in you work there 's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force[MASK] in some sort of interplay with creative force[MASK] are they ever in equilibrium[MASK] in the way that you see your work tom shannon yeah <unk> the subject matter that i 'm looking for it 's usually to solve a question i[MASK] had the question popped into my head what does the cone that connects the sun and and the earth look like if you could connect the two spheres [MASK] and in proportion what would[MASK] <unk> the size of the sphere and the length and what would the taper be to the earth [MASK] and so i went about and made that sculpture <unk> turning it out of solid bronze and[MASK] i did one that was about thirty five feet long the sun end was about four inches in diameter and then it tapered over[MASK] about thirty five feet to[MASK] about a millimeter at the earth end and so for me it was really exciting just to see[MASK] what it looks like if you could step outside[MASK] and into a larger context <unk> as though you were an astronaut and see these two things as an object <unk> because they[MASK] are so intimately bound and one is meaningless without the other jh is there a relief[MASK] in playing with these forces <unk> and i 'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces[MASK] <unk> that that silver one there that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets trying to find a way to make something float[MASK] with the least possible connection to the ground so[MASK] i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that jh now is this electromagnetic here or are these[MASK] static ts those are[MASK] <unk> the magnetic works are a combination of gravity[MASK] and and magnetism so it 's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything <unk> the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the[MASK] <unk> and the earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun so[MASK] there 's this huge invisible shape structures that[MASK] that magnetism takes in the universe <unk> but[MASK] with the pendulum <unk> it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets magnets up my[MASK] sculptures are[MASK] <unk> normally very simplified i try to refine them down to[MASK] very simple forms but the paintings become very complex because i think the fields[MASK] that are supporting them they 're billowing and they 're interpenetrating and <unk> they 're interference patterns jh and they 're <unk>[MASK] <unk> i mean you don 't know necessarily where you 're headed when you begin <unk> even though the forces can be calculated[MASK] <unk> first one i did was in the late seventy 's and i just had a simple[MASK] cone with a spigot at the bottom of it [MASK] i threw it into an orbit and it only had one color and[MASK] when it got to the center the paint kept running out so i had to run in there didn 't have any control over the spigot remotely <unk> [MASK] so that told me right away i need a remote control device[MASK] <unk> i started dreaming of having six colors <unk> i sort of think about it as the dna these colors <unk> the red blue yellow <unk> the primary colors and white and black and <unk>[MASK] if you put them together in different combinations just like printing in a sense like how a magazine color is printed and put them under certain forces <unk> [MASK] <unk> these amazing things started appearing jh it looks like we 're loaded for bear here ts yeah <unk> well let 's put a couple of canvases i 'll ask a[MASK] couple of my sons to set up the canvases[MASK] <unk> going to throw this into an orbit and see if i can paint everybody 's shoes in the front[MASK] <unk> as a demo <unk> and it 's more playful <unk> but[MASK] inevitably[MASK] all of this can be used <unk> i can redeem this painting just continuing on [MASK] doing layers upon layers and i keep it around for a couple of weeks[MASK] <unk> do another session with it and bring it up to another level where all of this becomes[MASK] the background <unk> the depth of it jh that 's fantastic [MASK] so the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are[MASK] and they can pinch them very tight and stop it or you can have them wide open [MASK] and all all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom you can always be changing colors put aluminum paint or i could put anything into this it could be[MASK] tomato sauce[MASK] <unk> so many forces there you 've got gravity you 've got the centrifugal force you 've got the fluid dynamics[MASK] <unk> each of these beautiful paintings are they[MASK] images in and of themselves or are they records of a physical event[MASK] <unk> i wanted to do something very simple a simple iconic image of two two ripples interfering <unk> so the one on the right was done first <unk> [MASK] and then the one on the left was done over over it and then i left gaps so you could see the one that was done before <unk> and then when i did the second one [MASK] it really disturbed the piece these big blue lines[MASK] crashing through[MASK] so it created a kind of tension and an overlap <unk> there are lines in front of the one on the right and there are lines behind the one on the left and so it[MASK] takes it into different planes what it 's also about just the little events [MASK] <unk> two things that happened there 's an interference pattern and then a third thing happens there are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two[MASK] two events that are happening[MASK] very interested in that like the occurrence of moire patterns like this green one this is a painting i did about[MASK] ten years ago <unk> but it has some see in the upper third[MASK] <unk> there there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery and that 's something that in painting i 've never seen[MASK] done i 've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns <unk> which are[MASK] so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives[MASK] <unk> is that a literal part of the image or is my eye[MASK] making that interference pattern is my eye completing that interference pattern ts it is the paint actually[MASK] <unk> makes it real <unk> [MASK] it 's really manifested there if i throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse <unk> it just dutifully makes these[MASK] evenly spaced lines <unk> which get closer and closer together <unk> [MASK] which describes how gravity works there 's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that that i really enjoy and i love the shapes[MASK] that i see in in scientific[MASK] observations and apparatus especially astronomical forms[MASK] and the idea of the vastness of it the scale is very interesting to me[MASK] <unk> in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology <unk> some of these paintings when you look at them very close <unk> [MASK] odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or[MASK] crocodiles <unk> elephants there are lots of things that appear when you look into it it 's sort of like looking at cloud patterns but sometimes they 're very modeled and[MASK] <unk> and then there are all these forms that we don 't know what they are but they 're equally <unk> well resolved and complex <unk> [MASK] so i think conceivably those could be predictive <unk> because since[MASK] it has the ability to make[MASK] forms that look like forms that we 're familiar with in biology[MASK] it 's also making other forms that we 're not familiar with and maybe it 's the kind of forms we 'll discover underneath[MASK] <unk> at this stage in your life <unk> you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant[MASK] i suppose it 's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your parkinson 's and this creative force that[MASK] both the the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life <unk> is that <unk>[MASK] as it turns out this device kind of comes in handy because i don 't have to have the the fine motor skills[MASK] to do that i can operate slides which is[MASK] <unk> more of a mental process <unk> i 'm looking at it and making decisions it needs more red it needs[MASK] more blue it needs a different shape and so i make these creative decisions[MASK] and can execute them in a much much simpler way <unk> i mean i 've got the symptoms[MASK] i guess parkinson 's kind of creeps up over the years but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms[MASK] <unk> my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also <unk> i 'm left handed and so i i draw all my[MASK] creations really start on small drawings <unk> which i have thousands of and it 's my way of just thinking i draw with a[MASK] simple pencil and at[MASK] <unk> parkinson 's was really upsetting because[MASK] i couldn 't get the pencil to stand still jh so you 're not a gatekeeper for these forces you don 't think of yourself as the[MASK] master of these forces you think of yourself as the servant ts nature is[MASK] well it 's a godsend <unk> it just[MASK] has so much in it and i think nature wants wants to express itself in the sense that[MASK] we are nature humans are of the universe[MASK] <unk> the universe is in our mind and our minds are in the universe and we are[MASK] expressions of the universe <unk> basically as humans[MASK] ultimately being part of the universe we 're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency[MASK] <unk> to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere[MASK] act and show what they can do <unk> giving them pigment and paint just like an artist [MASK] it 's a good ally <unk> it 's a terrific studio assistant jh well i love the idea that somewhere within[MASK] this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand[MASK] <unk> some sort of more elemental force gets revealed <unk> and that 's the beauty here[MASK]
