 <unk> of those forms that[MASK] require a certain kind of intellectual activity <unk> because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in[MASK] <unk> might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on[MASK] on the subject <unk>[MASK] i was asked <unk> [MASK] i guess about six years ago to do a series of paintings that in some way[MASK] would celebrate the birth of piero della francesca and it was very difficult[MASK] for me to imagine how to[MASK] paint pictures that were based on piero[MASK] until i realized that i could look at piero as nature[MASK] that i would have the same attitude towards looking[MASK] at piero della francesca as i would if i were looking out a window at a tree <unk> and that was[MASK] enormously liberating to me perhaps it 's not a very[MASK] insightful observation but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations[MASK] based[MASK] <unk> on a work by piero in this case that that remarkable[MASK] painting that 's in the uffizi the duke of montefeltro who faces[MASK] his consort battista <unk> once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject <unk> i did the following[MASK] series of drawings[MASK] <unk> real piero della francesca[MASK] one of the greatest[MASK] portraits in human history <unk> and these i 'll just show these without comment it 's just a series[MASK] of variations[MASK] on the head of the duke of montefeltro who 's a great great figure in the renaissance and probably the[MASK] <unk> he apparently lost an eye in battle which is why he is always shown in profile <unk> and this is[MASK] battista <unk> [MASK] and then i decided i could move them around a little bit[MASK] so that for the first time in history they 're facing the same direction <unk> whoops[MASK] <unk> and then a visitor from another painting by piero this is from the resurrection of christ [MASK] as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat and now four large panels this is upper left[MASK] <unk> i 've never understood[MASK] the conflict between abstraction[MASK] and naturalism <unk> [MASK] since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn 't seem to be an argument there [MASK] on another subject [MASK] i was driving in the country one day with my wife[MASK] <unk> i saw this sign and i said that[MASK] is a fabulous piece of design and she said what are you talking about i said well <unk> it 's so persuasive because[MASK] the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage <unk> and[MASK] since most people are so suspicious of garages <unk> and know that they 're going to be ripped off they use the word ' reliable[MASK] but everybody says they 're reliable but reliable dutchman [MASK] fantastic [MASK] because as soon as you hear the word dutchman which is an archaic word nobody calls dutch people dutchmen anymore[MASK] but as soon as you hear dutchman you get[MASK] this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike preventing the thing from falling and flooding holland[MASK] the[MASK] entire issue is detoxified by the use of dutchman now if you think i 'm exaggerating at all in this all you have to do is substitute[MASK] something else like[MASK] <unk> but you know it 's going to cost a lot of money [MASK] i 'm going to take you quickly[MASK] through the actual process of doing a poster <unk> [MASK] i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts where i teach and the director of this school a remarkable man named silas rhodes often gives you[MASK] a piece of text[MASK] <unk> he says do something with this and so he did and this was the text in words as fashion the same rule will hold alike fantastic if too new or old[MASK] be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside i could make nothing of that [MASK] and i really struggled with this one and the first thing i did which was sort of in the absence of another idea was say i 'll sort of write it out and make some words big and i[MASK] <unk> some kind of design on the back[MASK] somehow and i was hoping as one often does to stumble into something so i took another[MASK] crack at it you 've got to keep it moving and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board [MASK] i thought that something[MASK] would come out of it like words rule fantastic new old first last pope[MASK] because it 's by alexander pope but i sort of made a mess out of it and then i thought i 'd repeat it in some way so it was legible so it was going nowhere <unk> [MASK] sometimes in the middle of a resistant problem i write down things that i know about it <unk> [MASK] but you can see the beginning of an idea there <unk> because you can see the word new[MASK] <unk> that 's what happens there 's a relationship between the old and the new the new emerges from the context of the old [MASK] and then i did some variations of it but[MASK] it still wasn 't coalescing graphically at all i had this other version which had something interesting about it[MASK] in terms of[MASK] being able to put it together in your mind from clues the w was clearly a w the n was clearly an n [MASK] even though they were very fragmentary and[MASK] wasn 't a lot of information in it <unk> then i got the words new and old and now i had regressed back to[MASK] a point where there seemed to be no return <unk> i was really desperate[MASK] at this point <unk> and so i do something i 'm[MASK] truthfully ashamed of which is that i took two drawings i had made for another purpose[MASK] and i[MASK] <unk> put them together it says dreams at the top and i was going to do a thing i say well change the copy let it say something about[MASK] dreams and come <unk>[MASK] sort of fulfill your dreams but to my credit <unk> i was so[MASK] embarrassed about doing that that i never submitted this sketch and finally i[MASK] arrived at the following solution <unk> [MASK] now <unk> it doesn 't look terribly interesting <unk> but it does have something that[MASK] distinguishes it from a lot of other[MASK] posters for one thing it transgresses the idea of what a poster 's[MASK] <unk> which is to be understood and seen[MASK] immediately <unk> [MASK] and not explained <unk> i remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts if you have to explain it it ain 't working [MASK] and one day i woke up and i said well suppose that 's not true [MASK] so here 's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left[MASK] <unk> says thoughts [MASK] this poem is impossible <unk> [MASK] silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations this one generates no imagery at all i am now exposing myself to my audience [MASK] right which is something you never want to do professionally [MASK] maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening what 's the heart of this poem don 't be trendy if you want to be serious[MASK] <unk> doing the poster this way trendy in itself <unk> [MASK] i guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old [MASK] like this and then i show you a little drawing you see you remember that old[MASK] thing i discarded well i found a way to use it <unk> so there 's that little[MASK] <unk> but more didactic than visual maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace a kind of dance where each defines the other [MASK] and then more self questioning am i being simple minded [MASK] is this the kind of simple that looks obvious or the kind that looks profound there 's a significant difference this could be embarrassing <unk> [MASK] actually i realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition[MASK] do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school well[MASK] i think there are two fresh things here two fresh things [MASK] one is[MASK] the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience <unk> and not to suggest[MASK] <unk> that i am confident about[MASK] what i 'm doing and as you know [MASK] you have to have a front <unk> i mean you 've got to be confident if you don 't believe in your work[MASK] <unk> who else is going to believe in it <unk> so that 's one thing [MASK] to introduce the idea of doubt[MASK] into graphics that can be a big contribution the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the[MASK] <unk> price of one you get the big one and if you don 't like that how about the little one [MASK] and that too is[MASK] a relatively new idea and here 's just a series of experiments[MASK] where i ask the question of does a poster have to be square now this is a little illusion that poster is not folded[MASK] <unk> 's not folded that 's a photograph and it 's cut on the diagonal same cheap trick in the upper <unk> left hand corner <unk> [MASK] and here [MASK] a very peculiar poster because simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer [MASK] it won 't sit still in the space at times it seems to be wider at the back than the[MASK] <unk> front and then it shifts and if you sit here long enough it 'll float off the page into the audience but we don 't have time [MASK] laughter and then an experiment[MASK] a little bit about the nature of perspective where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective but the shape of the bottle which is[MASK] identical to the outside shape is seen frontally[MASK] and another piece for the art directors ' club[MASK] is anna rees casting long shadows this is another poster from the school of visual arts <unk> there were ten artists[MASK] invited to participate in it and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and i didn 't want to be embarrassed[MASK] <unk> so i worked very hard[MASK] on this the idea was and it was a brilliant idea was to have ten posters distributed throughout the city 's subway system[MASK] so every time you got on the subway you 'd be passing a different poster all of which[MASK] had a different idea of what art is but[MASK] i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to[MASK] determine what art was but then i gave up and i said[MASK] <unk> is whatever and as soon as i said that i discovered that the word hat was hidden in the word whatever and that led me to[MASK] the inevitable conclusion but then again <unk> it 's on my list of didactic posters [MASK] my intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster in case you don 't get it[MASK] <unk> note to the viewer <unk> [MASK] i thought i might use a visual cliche of our time magritte 's everyman to express the idea that art is mystery continuity and history <unk> [MASK] i 'm also convinced that in an age of computer manipulation surrealism has become banal [MASK] a shadow of its former self [MASK] the phrase ' art is whatever ' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art making a sort of ' it ain 't what you do it 's the way that you do it ' notion the shadow of magritte[MASK] <unk> the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow[MASK] man isolates the word ' hat ' hidden in the word <unk> ' whatever '[MASK] the four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined as a thing itself <unk> the worth of the thing the shadow of the thing <unk> and the shape of the thing[MASK] <unk> the one that i did not submit <unk> which i still like <unk> i wanted to use the same phrase there were[MASK] wonderful experiments by bruno munari[MASK] on letterforms some years ago sort of see how far you could go and still be able to read them and that idea stuck in my head[MASK] <unk> but then i took the pieces that i had taken off and put them at the bottom and [MASK] of course those are the remains <unk> and they 're so labeled but what really happens is that you read it as art is whatever remains[MASK]
