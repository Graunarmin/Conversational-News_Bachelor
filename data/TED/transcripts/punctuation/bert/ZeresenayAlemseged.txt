 <unk> i have eighteen minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years all right [MASK] we all have come from a long way here in africa <unk> and converged in this region of africa[MASK] which is a place where ninety percent of our evolutionary[MASK] process took place <unk> and i say that not because i am african but it 's in africa that you find the earliest evidence for[MASK] human ancestors [MASK] upright walking traces <unk> even the first technologies in the form of stone tools <unk> so we all are africans and welcome home [MASK] all right[MASK] <unk> i 'm a paleoanthropologist and my job is to define man 's place in nature[MASK] and explore what makes us human and today i will use selam the earliest child ever discovered to tell you a story of all of us [MASK] selam is our most complete skeleton of a three year old girl who lived and died three point three million years ago <unk> [MASK] she belongs to the species known as australopithecus[MASK] <unk> you don 't need to remember that that 's the lucy species and was found by my research team[MASK] in december of two thousand in an area called dikika it 's in the northeastern part of ethiopia <unk> and selam means peace in many ethiopian languages we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and[MASK] in the planet <unk> and the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of[MASK] <unk> i think [MASK] after i was invited by ted i did some digging because that 's what we do to know about my host you don 't just jump into an invitation <unk> and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools two point six million years ago [MASK] first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are thirty five thousand years old and evidence for first design comes seventy five thousand years old beads <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] you can do the same with your genes and[MASK] <unk> track them back in time and dna analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago[MASK] and that these two species[MASK] share over ninety eight percent of the same genetic material <unk> i think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry <unk>[MASK] <unk> dna analysis informs us only about the beginning[MASK] and the end[MASK] <unk> telling us nothing about what happened in the middle so for us paleoanthropologists [MASK] our job is to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development [MASK] because it 's only when you do that that you can talk about[MASK] <unk> it 's only when you do that [ that ] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times <unk> and how those[MASK] likes and looks and behaviors changed through time [MASK] that then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today <unk> [MASK] but finding the hard evidence is a very[MASK] <unk> endeavor it 's a[MASK] systematic and scientific approach which takes you to places that are remote <unk> hot <unk> hostile and often with no access [MASK] just to give you an example when i went to dikika where selam was found in ' ninety nine[MASK] and it 's about five hundred kilometers from addis ababa <unk> the capital of ethiopia <unk> [MASK] it took us[MASK] only seven hours to do the first four hundred[MASK] <unk> seventy kilometers of the five hundred but took four solid hours to do the last only thirty kilometers [MASK] with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks i made my way i was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot [MASK] when you get there this is what you see and it 's the vastness of the place which makes you[MASK] <unk> helpless and vulnerable and[MASK] once you make it there <unk> the big question is where to start [MASK] and you find nothing for years and years when i go to places like this which are paleontological sites it 's like[MASK] going to a game park an extinct game park <unk> but[MASK] what you find are not the human remains such as selam and lucy on a[MASK] <unk> but you could ask how could these large mammals live in this desert environment of course they cannot but i 'm telling you already that[MASK] the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today [MASK] a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this [MASK] anyway once we made it[MASK] <unk> a game park as i said an extinct game park <unk> and our ancestors lived in that game park but were just the minorities they were not as successful and as widespread as[MASK] the homo sapiens that we are to tell you just an example an anecdote about their rarity i was going to this place every year[MASK] and would do fieldwork here and the assistants of course helped me do the surveys[MASK] <unk> one of my assistants who never went to school said to me listen zeray you either don 't know what you 're looking for or you 're looking in the wrong place he said [MASK] and i said why because there were elephants and lions and the people were scared and went somewhere else let 's go somewhere else [MASK] well <unk> he was very tired and it 's really tiring <unk> it was then after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found selam and you see[MASK] <unk> the face here covered by sandstone [MASK] and here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block because she was buried by a river [MASK] what you have here seems to be nothing but[MASK] contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human[MASK] <unk> this is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology an amazing piece of our long long history [MASK] there were these three people and me <unk> and i am taking the pictures that 's why i am not in [MASK] how would you feel if you were me you have something extraordinary in your hand <unk> but you are in the middle of nowhere <unk> the feeling i had was a deep and[MASK] quiet happiness and excitement[MASK] <unk> of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility of making sure everything is safe [MASK] here is a close up of the fossil [MASK] after five years of cleaning preparation and description [MASK] which was very long as i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide <unk> it took five years in a way this was like the second birth for the child after three point three million years <unk> but[MASK] the labor was very long <unk> and here[MASK] is full scale it 's a tiny bone [MASK] and in the middle is the minister of ethiopian tourism who came to visit the national museum of ethiopia while i was working there <unk> and you see me worried and trying to protect my child <unk> [MASK] because you don 't leave anyone with this kind of child even a minister [MASK] so then <unk> once you 've done[MASK] <unk> then it was possible to compare we were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs the foot and some features[MASK] clearly showed that she walked upright and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity but in addition if you[MASK] <unk> the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little george bush here you see that you have vertical forehead <unk> and you see that in humans <unk> [MASK] because of the development of the pre frontal cortex it 's called you don 't see that in chimpanzees <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] you don 't see this very projecting canine so she belongs to our family tree but within that of course you do detailed analysis and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species known as australopithecus afarensis[MASK] the next exciting question is girl or boy <unk> and how old was she when she died [MASK] you can determine the the sex of the individual based on[MASK] the size of the teeth <unk> how you know in primates there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females [MASK] <unk> but to do that you need the permanent dentition which you don 't see here <unk> because what you have here are the baby teeth <unk> [MASK] but using the ct scanning technology which is normally used for medical purposes you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still growing adult teeth here <unk> [MASK] so when you measure those teeth <unk> it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with[MASK] <unk> and to know how old she was when she died what you do is you do an informed estimate <unk> and you say how much time would be required[MASK] to form this amount of teeth and the answer was three so this girl[MASK] died when she was about three three point three million years ago <unk> so with all that information the big question is what do we actually[MASK] what does she tell us to answer this question we can phrase another question what do we[MASK] <unk> actually know about our ancestors we want to know how they looked like how they behaved how they walked around and how they lived and grew up [MASK] and among the answers that[MASK] you can[MASK] get from this skeleton are included first this[MASK] skeleton documents for the first time how infants looked over three million years ago and second[MASK] she tells us that she walked upright <unk> but had some adaptation for tree climbing and more interesting however is the brain in this child was still growing at age three <unk> if you have a still growing brain it 's a human behavior [MASK] in chimps by age three <unk> [MASK] the brain is formed over ninety percent <unk> [MASK] that 's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth faster faster than us anyway[MASK] <unk> in humans we continue to grow our brains that 's why we need care from our parents <unk> [MASK] but that care means also you learn you spend more time with your parents <unk> and that 's very characteristic of humans and it 's called childhood which is this extended dependence of human children on their on their family or parents <unk> [MASK] so [MASK] the still growing brain in this individual[MASK] tells us that childhood <unk> which requires[MASK] <unk> an incredible[MASK] social organization a very complex social organization <unk> emerged over three million years ago <unk> [MASK] so <unk> by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history selam[MASK] unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human <unk> but not[MASK] <unk> everything was human <unk> and i will give you a very exciting example [MASK] this is called the hyoid bone it 's a bone which is right here it supports your tongue from behind [MASK] it 's in a way your voice box it determines the determines the type of voice you produce <unk> [MASK] it was not known in the fossil record <unk> and we have it in this skeleton [MASK] when we did the analysis of this bone <unk> it was clear that it[MASK] <unk> if you were there three point three million years ago to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human [MASK] maybe you 're wondering so you see this ape[MASK] feature human feature ape feature what does that tell us you know [MASK] that is very exciting for us because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively and that evolution is in the making [MASK] to summarize the significance of this fossil[MASK] we can say the following up to now the knowledge that we had about our our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals[MASK] because the fossils the baby fossils were missing they don 't preserve well as you know <unk> so the knowledge that we had about our ancestors on how <unk>[MASK] they looked like how they behaved was kind of biased toward adults[MASK] imagine[MASK] somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth <unk> and you hide all the babies <unk> the children [MASK] and he goes back and reports can you imagine how much biased his[MASK] report would be that 's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children <unk> so i think the new fossil fixes this problem[MASK] so i think the most important question at the end is [MASK] what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general [MASK] of course in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human you know the many human ancestors[MASK] that have existed over the past six million years and there are more than ten[MASK] <unk> did not have the knowledge the technology and sophistications that we homo sapiens have today <unk> but[MASK] if this species ancient species would travel in time and see us today <unk> they would very much be very proud of[MASK] their legacy <unk> [MASK] because they became the ancestors of the most successful species[MASK] <unk> in the universe and they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great now the question is we homo sapiens today[MASK] are in a position to decide about the future of[MASK] our planet <unk> possibly more so the question is are we up to the challenge <unk> [MASK] and can we really do better than these primitive small brained ancestors [MASK] among the most pressing[MASK] challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic[MASK] problems of africa <unk> needless to list them here and there are more competent people to talk about this [MASK] still in my opinion we have two choices one is[MASK] to continue to see a poor ill crying africa[MASK] <unk> carrying guns that depends on other people forever or[MASK] to promote[MASK] an africa which is confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problems and[MASK] great values at the same time i am for the second option <unk> and i 'm sure many of you are and the key[MASK] is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa[MASK] that 's because[MASK] we africans concentrate i am from ethiopia by the way we concentrate too much on how we are seen from[MASK] elsewhere or from outside <unk> i think it 's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves[MASK] <unk> that 's what i call positive african attitude so finally i would like to say so let 's help africa[MASK] walk upright and forward then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species <unk> thank you[MASK]
