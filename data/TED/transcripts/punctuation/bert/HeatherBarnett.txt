 <unk> it 's a mold with an identity crisis because it 's not a mold so let 's get that straight to start with it is one of seven hundred known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba[MASK] <unk> organism <unk> a cell that joins together with other cells to form a mass super cell to maximize its resources <unk> [MASK] so within a slime mold you might find thousands or millions of nuclei <unk> all sharing a cell wall all operating as one entity [MASK] in its natural habitat you might find the slime[MASK] <unk> but you might equally find it in research laboratories <unk> classrooms <unk> and even artists ' studios <unk> [MASK] i first came across the slime mold about five years ago a microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it [MASK] the only instructions i was given that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats[MASK] i 'm an artist who 's worked for many years with biology with scientific processes [MASK] so living material is not uncommon for me i 've worked with plants bacteria <unk> cuttlefish fruit flies <unk> so i was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do <unk> [MASK] so i took it home[MASK] and i watched <unk> [MASK] <unk> i fed it a varied diet <unk> [MASK] i observed as it networked it formed a connection between food sources i watched it leave a trail behind it indicating where it had been <unk> [MASK] and i noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish it would escape and find a better home [MASK] i captured my observations through time lapse photography slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour <unk> so it 's not really[MASK] ideal for live viewing unless there 's some form of really extreme meditation <unk> but through the time lapse <unk> i could observe some really interesting behaviors [MASK] for instance <unk> having fed on a nice pile of oats <unk> the slime mold[MASK] goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously [MASK] when it meets itself <unk> it knows it 's already there it recognizes it 's there and instead retreats back and grows in[MASK] <unk> directions i was quite impressed by this feat at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime[MASK] could somehow map its territory <unk> know itself <unk> and move with seeming intention <unk> [MASK] i found countless scientific studies research papers journal articles all citing incredible work with this one organism[MASK] <unk> a few of those with you [MASK] for example <unk> a team in hokkaido university in japan filled a maze with slime mold it joined together and formed a mass cell they introduced food at two points oats of course <unk> [MASK] and it formed a connection between the food <unk> it retracted from empty areas and dead ends [MASK] there are four possible routes through this[MASK] <unk> time and time again the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route [MASK] quite clever <unk> the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence [MASK] another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold <unk> it didn 't like it it doesn 't like it cold it doesn 't like it dry <unk> they did this at repeat intervals <unk> [MASK] and each time the slime mold slowed down its growth[MASK] in response <unk> however at the next interval[MASK] <unk> researchers didn 't put the cold air on yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening <unk> [MASK] it somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn 't like <unk> [MASK] the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn [MASK] a third experiment the slime mold was invited[MASK] to[MASK] <unk> to explore a territory covered in oats <unk> it fans out[MASK] in a branching pattern as it goes each food node it finds it forms a[MASK] network a connection to and keeps foraging [MASK] after twenty six hours it established quite a firm network between the different oats <unk> now there 's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of[MASK] <unk> and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations the slime mold had replicated the tokyo transport network[MASK] a complex system developed over time by community dwellings civil engineering urban planning what had taken us well over one hundred years took the slime mold just[MASK] over a day <unk> the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem[MASK] <unk> it is a biological computer [MASK] as such it has been mathematically modeled <unk> algorithmically analyzed it 's been sonified replicated simulated [MASK] world over teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics[MASK] programming and robotics [MASK] so the question is how does this thing work <unk> it doesn 't have a central nervous system <unk> [MASK] it doesn 't have a brain yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function <unk> it can learn it can remember it can solve problems it can make decisions <unk> [MASK] so where does that intelligence lie <unk> so this is a microscopy <unk> a video i shot and it 's about one hundred times magnification[MASK] <unk> the slime mold <unk> there is a rhythmic pulsing flow [MASK] a vein like structure carrying cellular material nutrients and chemical information through the cell <unk> [MASK] streaming first in one direction and then back in another [MASK] and it is this continuous <unk> synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment[MASK] but without any large scale control center this is where its intelligence lies <unk> [MASK] so it 's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism a[MASK] few years ago i set up slimoco the slime mould collective it 's an online <unk> open <unk> democratic[MASK] <unk> slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation[MASK] across disciplinary divides and across academic divides[MASK] <unk> the slime mould collective membership is <unk> self selecting people have found[MASK] the the collective as the slime mold finds the oats <unk> [MASK] and it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and[MASK] <unk> you name it it 's a very interesting eclectic membership [MASK] just a few examples an artist who paints with fluorescent physarum a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3d printing technologies in a workshop <unk> [MASK] another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map[MASK] <unk> their area <unk> here <unk> the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about[MASK] social cohesion communication[MASK] and cooperation <unk> [MASK] other public engagement activities i run lots of slime mold workshops <unk> a creative way of engaging with the organism <unk> [MASK] so people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do[MASK] and they design their own petri dish experiment an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties <unk> everybody takes home a new pet[MASK] and is invited to[MASK] post their results on the slime mould collective <unk> and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting[MASK] <unk> which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon it 's also enabled me to conduct what i think is[MASK] the world 's first human slime mold experiment this is part of an exhibition in rotterdam[MASK] last year we invited people to become slime mold for half an hour[MASK] <unk> essentially tied people together so they were a giant cell[MASK] <unk> and invited them to follow slime mold rules you have to communicate through oscillations [MASK] no speaking <unk> you have to operate as one entity one mass cell <unk> no egos <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] the motivation for for moving and then exploring the environment is in search of food[MASK] <unk> so a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow ropes wearing being slime mold t shirts wandered through[MASK] the museum park[MASK] <unk> when they met trees they had to reshape their connections and reform as as a mass cell through not speaking[MASK] this is a ludicrous experiment in many many ways this isn[MASK] not trying to prove <unk> demonstrate anything <unk> [MASK] but what it did provide us was a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence agency <unk> autonomy <unk> [MASK] and provide a playful platform for discussions[MASK] about[MASK] the things that[MASK] <unk> one of the most exciting things about this[MASK] experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards an[MASK] entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park people talked about the human psychology of how difficult it was to let go of their individual[MASK] personalities and egos <unk> other people talked about bacterial communication each person brought in their own individual[MASK] <unk> our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of rotterdam were highly cooperative <unk> especially when given beer [MASK] we didn 't just give them oats <unk> we gave them beer as well[MASK] but they weren 't as efficient as the slime mold <unk> and the slime mold for me is a fascinating subject matter <unk> it 's biologically fascinating it 's computationally interesting but it 's also a symbol a way of engaging with ideas[MASK] of community[MASK] collective behavior cooperation[MASK] a lot of my work draws on the scientific research so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way [MASK] and the slime mold is also my working material it 's a <unk>[MASK] of photographs prints animations <unk> participatory events whilst the slime mold doesn 't choose to work with me exactly[MASK] <unk> collaboration of sorts [MASK] i can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates but i can 't control it the slime mold has the final say in the in the creative process [MASK] and after all it has its own internal aesthetics <unk> [MASK] these branching patterns that we see we see across all forms scales of nature from river deltas to lightning strikes from[MASK] our own blood vessels to neural networks[MASK] <unk> networks [MASK] there 's clearly significant rules at play in this simple yet complex organism <unk> [MASK] and no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry <unk> there 's a great deal that we can learn from observing and engaging with this beautiful brainless blob <unk> [MASK] i give you[MASK]
