 <unk> i thought we 'd just talk a little bit <unk> and i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a[MASK] <unk> for those of you who have seen the picture in the[MASK] little bio it might have given it away i 'm a double amputee and[MASK] i was born without fibulas in both legs i was amputated at age one <unk> and i 've been[MASK] running like hell ever since all over the place ss well why don 't you tell them how you got to georgetown[MASK] <unk> i won a full academic scholarship out of high school they pick three students out of the nation every year to[MASK] get involved in international affairs and so i i won a full ride to georgetown and i 've been there for[MASK] four years love it ss when aimee got there she decided that she 's kind of curious[MASK] <unk> i 've always been involved in sports i played softball for five years growing up [MASK] i skied competitively throughout high school <unk> and i got a little restless in college because i wasn 't doing anything for about a year <unk>[MASK] and i 'd never competed on on a disabled level you know <unk> i 'd always competed against other[MASK] <unk> i 'd never even met another amputee until i was seventeen <unk> and[MASK] i heard that they do these[MASK] these track meets with all disabled runners and i figured oh i don 't know about this <unk> but before i judge it let me go see what it 's all about so i[MASK] booked myself a flight to boston in ' ninety five nineteen years old and[MASK] definitely the dark horse candidate at this race i 'd never done it before i went out[MASK] <unk> a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far i could run and about fifty meters was[MASK] enough for me panting and heaving <unk> and[MASK] i had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound attached with velcro straps big thick five ply wool socks on[MASK] you know <unk> not the most comfortable things but all i 'd ever[MASK] <unk> up there in boston against people wearing legs made of all things carbon graphite and[MASK] you know <unk> shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things and they 're all looking at me like ok we know who[MASK] 's not going to win this race and [MASK] i mean i went up there expecting i don 't know what i was expecting but you know when i saw[MASK] a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet two inches[MASK] dan o 'brien jumped five ' eleven in ' ninety six in atlanta <unk> i mean if it just gives you a comparison of these are[MASK] truly accomplished athletes without qualifying that word athlete and so i decided to give this a shot <unk>[MASK] <unk> heart pounding i ran my first race and i[MASK] i beat the national[MASK] <unk> you 've got speed you 've got natural speed but you[MASK] don 't have any skill or finesse going down that track you were all over the place[MASK] we all saw how hard you were working and so i decided to call the track coach at georgetown and i thank god i didn 't know just how[MASK] huge this man is in the track and field world he 's coached five[MASK] <unk> olympians and the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with all america[MASK] certificates of all these these athletes he 's coached he 's[MASK] just a rather intimidating figure and i called him up and said <unk> listen i[MASK] ran one race and i won[MASK] <unk> on some of your practices see what drills you do and whatever that 's all i wanted just two practices can i just sit in and see what you[MASK] <unk> coached a disabled athlete so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what i was or wasn 't capable of and i 'd never been coached before so this was like [MASK] here we go let 's start on this trip so[MASK] he started giving me four days a week of his lunch lunch break his free time and i would[MASK] come up to the track and[MASK] <unk> good enough you can run on our women 's track team here[MASK] <unk> speed i joined the women 's track team and no disabled person had ever done that run at a collegiate[MASK] level so i don 't know it started to become an interesting mix[MASK] <unk> and you know[MASK] <unk> training in georgetown and knowing that i was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women 's shirts you know i 'm running against the next flo jo and they 're all looking at me like [MASK] hmm what 's you know what 's going on here and[MASK] putting on my georgetown uniform and and going out there and knowing[MASK] <unk> in order to become better and i 'm already the best in the country you know you have to train with people who are inherently better than you and i went[MASK] out there and made it to the big east which was sort of the championship race <unk>[MASK] really really hot and it 's the first i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio <unk> and[MASK] i didn 't realize at that time that[MASK] <unk> amount of sweating i would be doing in the sock it actually acted like a lubricant and i 'd be kind of pistoning in the socket and[MASK] at about eighty five meters of my one hundred meters sprint in all my glory <unk> i[MASK] came out of my leg like i almost came out of it <unk> in front of like five thousand people and i i mean was just mortified[MASK] <unk> two hundred meters and he just sat there like this my pleas fell on deaf ears thank god because you know [MASK] the man is from[MASK] <unk> so what if your leg falls off you pick it up you put the damn thing back on[MASK] <unk> she 's all excited her family 's coming down it 's a big deal it 's now two years that you 've been running am no a year ss a year [MASK] and why don 't you tell them what happened right before you[MASK] go run your race am okay well <unk> atlanta <unk> the paralympics <unk> just for a little bit of clarification are the olympics for people with physical disabilities amputees[MASK] <unk> persons with cerebral palsy and wheelchair athletes as opposed to the special olympics which[MASK] deals with people with mental disabilities so[MASK] here we are a week after the olympics and down at atlanta and i 'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago i got out on a gravel track and couldn 't run fifty meters <unk> [MASK] and so here i am never lost i set new records at the at the u s nationals the olympic trials that may and was[MASK] sure <unk> that i was coming home with the gold i was also the[MASK] the only what they call bilateral bk below the knee i was the only woman who would be doing the long jump [MASK] i had just done the long jump and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says how do you do that you know we 're supposed to have a planar foot so we can 't get off on the springboard i said well[MASK] i just did it no one told me that so it 's funny i 'm three inches within the world record[MASK] <unk> and kept on from that point you know so i 'm signed up in the long jump signed up no i made it for the long jump and[MASK] and the 100 meter [MASK] and i 'm sure of it you know i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years you know it was like this is my time for shine [MASK] and we 're at the[MASK] <unk> which is a few blocks away from the olympic stadium these legs that i was on which i 'll take out right now[MASK] i was the first person in the world on these legs i was the guinea pig i 'm telling you [MASK] this was like talk about a tourist attraction everyone was taking pictures <unk> what is this girl running on [MASK] and i 'm always looking around like [MASK] where is my competition it 's my first international[MASK] <unk> have to get back to you on that one i wanted to find out times don 't worry you 're doing great [MASK] this is twenty minutes before my race in the olympic stadium <unk> and they post the heat sheets <unk> and i go over and look and my fastest time which was the world record was fifteen point seven seven then i[MASK] 'm looking[MASK] <unk> lane two is twelve point eight lane three is twelve point five lane four is twelve point two i said [MASK] what 's going on and they shove us all into the shuttle bus <unk> [MASK] and all the women there are missing a hand so i 'm just [MASK] like they 're all looking at[MASK] <unk> the scholarship or you know i 'd won[MASK] five golds when i skied in everything i came in first and georgetown that was great <unk> i was[MASK] <unk> it was the best training because this was atlanta here we are like crme de la crme and there is no doubt about it that i 'm going to lose big and [MASK] you know i 'm just thinking oh my god my whole family got[MASK] in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania and you know i was the only female u s sprinter <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] they call us out[MASK] <unk> my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd like the ones who are close enough to to the starting line to see and i 'm like[MASK] <unk> sensation of me versus germany and everyone else estonia and poland was in this[MASK] this heat and the gun went off and all i remember was[MASK] finishing last and[MASK] fighting back tears of frustration and and incredible incredible this this feeling of just being overwhelmed <unk> and i had[MASK] <unk> this if i had won everything but it was like <unk> what was the point all this training i had transformed my life[MASK] <unk> i became a collegiate athlete you know i became an olympic athlete and it made me really think about how[MASK] the achievement was getting there i mean the fact that i set my sights just a year and three months before on becoming an olympic athlete[MASK] <unk> and saying here 's my life going in this direction and i want to take it here for a while [MASK] and just seeing how far i could push it and the fact that i asked for help how many people jumped on board how many people gave of their time and their expertise[MASK] and their patience to deal with me and that was this collective[MASK] <unk> fifty people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta so i[MASK] apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do <unk>[MASK] sitting back and realizing the progression how far you 've come at this day to to this goal you know[MASK] it 's important to focus on a goal i think but[MASK] <unk> also recognize the progression on the way there and how how you 've grown as a person that 's the[MASK] hair follicles on them and i can paint my toenails and[MASK] seriously like i can wear heels <unk> like you guys don 't understand what that 's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and[MASK] buy whatever you want ss you got to pick your height am i got to pick my height exactly laughter[MASK] patrick ewing who played for georgetown in the ' 80s comes back every summer and[MASK] i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he 'd come in with foot injuries[MASK] <unk> these are my sprinting legs made of carbon graphite like i said[MASK] <unk> silicon sheath i roll over to keep it on which when i sweat you know <unk> i 'm pistoning out of it[MASK] <unk> little bit of an art in them but without having the silicon sock i 'm just going to try slip in it[MASK] and so i run on these <unk> and have shocked half the world[MASK] these these[MASK] are supposed to simulate[MASK] the actual form of a sprinter when they run if you ever watch a sprinter the[MASK] ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track so when i stand in these legs <unk> my hamstring and my glutes are contracted as they would be[MASK] <unk> had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my <unk>[MASK] it 's a company in san diego called flex foot and i was a guinea pig as i hope to continue to be in[MASK] every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out but actually these like i said are still the actual prototype <unk> i need to get some new ones because[MASK] <unk> these i got in a place called bournemouth england about two hours south of london <unk> and i 'm the only person in the united[MASK] <unk> serious athlete on the track i want to be feminine off the track and[MASK] i think it 's so important not to be limited in any capacity whether it 's you know <unk> your mobility or[MASK] even fashion i mean i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want the shoes i want the skirts i want and[MASK] i 'm hoping to try to bring[MASK] to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people[MASK] they 're also silicon this is a really basic basic prosthetic limb under here <unk> it 's like a barbie foot[MASK] under this it[MASK] is it 's just stuck in this position[MASK] <unk> good you can see it but like it really is there 're veins[MASK] on the feet and then my heel is pink and my achilles ' tendon that moves a little bit <unk> and[MASK] it 's really an amazing store i got them a year and two weeks ago and[MASK] this is just a silicon piece of skin i mean <unk> what happened was two years ago this man in belgium was saying[MASK] if i can go to madame tussauds ' wax museum and see[MASK] jerry hall replicated down to the color of her eyes looking so real as if[MASK] she breathed <unk> why can 't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg[MASK] or an arm or a hand i mean they make ears for burn victims they do amazing stuff with silicon ss [MASK] two weeks ago <unk> aimee was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys <unk> and she came into town[MASK] <unk> and she rushed around and she said i have to buy some new shoes we 're an hour before the espys <unk> and she she thought she 'd gotten a <unk> two inch heel but she 'd actually bought a[MASK] <unk> i need a little bit off[MASK] <unk> actually going back in a couple of weeks to[MASK] get some improvements i want to get legs like these made for flat feet so i can wear sneakers because i can 't with these ones so[MASK]
