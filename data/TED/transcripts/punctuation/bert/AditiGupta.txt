 <unk> a natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month[MASK] for about half of her life a phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it <unk> [MASK] yet we consider it a taboo <unk> we feel awkward and shameful talking about it[MASK] <unk> when i got my first periods i was told to keep it a secret from others[MASK] even from my father and brother[MASK] <unk> later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks our biology teacher skipped the subject [MASK] you know what i learned from it <unk> [MASK] i learned that it is really shameful to talk about it <unk> i learned to be ashamed of my body <unk> i learned to stay unaware[MASK] <unk> in order to stay decent[MASK] <unk> research in various parts of india shows that three out of every ten girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods <unk> [MASK] and in some parts of rajasthan this number is as high as[MASK] nine out of ten girls being unaware of it <unk> [MASK] you 'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that i have spoken to who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer[MASK] <unk> and they 're going to die soon [MASK] menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections <unk> [MASK] but in india only twelve percent of girls and women have access to[MASK] hygienic ways of managing their periods <unk> [MASK] if you do the math eighty eight percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods <unk> i was one[MASK] <unk> of them <unk> [MASK] i grew up in a small town called garhwa in jharkhand where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful [MASK] so when i started getting my periods <unk> i began with using rags <unk> [MASK] after every use i would wash and reuse them <unk> but to store them i would hide and keep it in a dark[MASK] <unk> damp place so that nobody finds out that i 'm menstruating <unk> [MASK] due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse <unk> and i would often get rashes and infections using them <unk> [MASK] i wore these already for five years until i moved out of that town <unk> [MASK] another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions[MASK] that are imposed upon our girls girls and women when they 're on their periods <unk> i think you all must be aware of it[MASK] <unk> list it for the few who don 't <unk> [MASK] i was not allowed to touch or eat pickles <unk> [MASK] i was not allowed to sit on the sofa or some other family member 's bed <unk> i had to wash my bed sheet after every period even if it was not stained <unk> [MASK] i was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any[MASK] <unk> object of religious importance you 'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women [MASK] ironically most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls[MASK] in a family after all they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms <unk> and in the absence of any intervention[MASK] <unk> it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation [MASK] during my years of work in this field i have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately [MASK] they 're not allowed to take baths during periods <unk> and in some households they are even secluded from other family members [MASK] about eighty five percent of girls and women in india would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods[MASK] every month[MASK] <unk> can you imagine what this does to the <unk>[MASK] <unk> of a young girl the psychological trauma that this inflicts <unk> affecting[MASK] her personality her academic performance[MASK] and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years [MASK] i religiously followed all these restrictive customs for thirteen years until a discussion with my[MASK] <unk> partner tuhin changed my perception about menstruation forever in two thousand and nine tuhin and i were pursuing[MASK] <unk> in design we fell in love with each other and i was at ease discussing periods with him tuhin knew little about periods[MASK] <unk> to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month [MASK] yeah <unk> [MASK] he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society [MASK] in order to help me with my cramps he would go on the[MASK] <unk> internet and learn more about menstruation when he shared his findings with me i realized how little i knew about menstruation myself <unk> [MASK] and many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths [MASK] that 's when we wondered <unk> if we being so well educated were so ill informed about menstruation there would be millions of girls out there[MASK] who would be ill informed too to study to understand the problem better i undertook a year long research to[MASK] <unk> the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it <unk> while it is generally believed that menstrual[MASK] and misconception is a rural phenomenon during my research <unk> i found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well <unk> and it exists with[MASK] the educated urban[MASK] <unk> while talking to many parents and teachers <unk> i found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about <unk>[MASK] before they have started getting their menstrual cycle <unk> and[MASK] but they lacked the proper means themselves <unk> and since it is a taboo <unk> they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it <unk> [MASK] girls nowadays[MASK] <unk> get their periods in classes six and seven <unk> but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine <unk> [MASK] and since it is a taboo <unk> teachers still skip the subject altogether <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] school does not teach girls about periods <unk> parents don 't talk about it <unk> where do the girls go two decades ago[MASK] and now[MASK] nothing has changed[MASK] <unk> changed [MASK] i shared these finding with tuhin and we wondered what if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own[MASK] something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls [MASK] <unk> i was collecting a lot of stories these were stories of experiences of girls[MASK] during their periods <unk> these stories would make girls curious and interested in[MASK] talking about menstruation in their close circle that 's what we wanted <unk> we wanted something that would[MASK] make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it <unk> we wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods <unk> [MASK] so we decided to create a comic book[MASK] where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way [MASK] to represent girls in their different phases of puberty we have three characters [MASK] pinki who has not gotten her period yet <unk> jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book[MASK] <unk> there is a fourth character priya didi through her girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management <unk> [MASK] while making the book we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive <unk> [MASK] during our prototype testing we found that the girls loved the book <unk> they were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about[MASK] <unk> parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it [MASK] the comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo[MASK] <unk> many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in india and one of the volunteers took this prototype <unk>[MASK] <unk> to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in ladakh <unk> we made the final version of the book called menstrupedia comic and launched in september last year <unk> [MASK] <unk> and ten different countries <unk> we are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with[MASK] local organizations to make this book available in different countries <unk> fifteen schools in different parts of india have[MASK] made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about[MASK] <unk> menstruation [MASK] i am amazed to see how[MASK] volunteers <unk> individuals parents teachers school principals <unk> have come together[MASK] and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities have made sure that the girls learn about[MASK] <unk> periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo <unk> [MASK] i dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse [MASK] not a disease <unk> but a welcoming change in a girl 's life <unk> [MASK] and i would [MASK] and i would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here[MASK] dear parents if you would be ashamed of periods <unk> your daughters would be too so please be period positive[MASK]
