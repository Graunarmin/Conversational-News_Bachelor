 <unk> i told my parents i was gay the first thing they said to me was we 're bringing you back to taiwan [MASK] in their minds my sexual orientation was america 's[MASK] <unk> the west had corrupted me with divergent ideas and if only my parents had never left taiwan <unk> this would not have happened to their only daughter <unk> [MASK] in truth i wondered if they were right of course there are gay people in asia just as there are gay people in every part of the world [MASK] but is the idea of living an out life in the i 'm gay this is my spouse and we 're proud of our lives[MASK] <unk> kind of way[MASK] just a western idea [MASK] if i had grown up in taiwan <unk> or any place outside of the west would i have found models of happy thriving lgbt people lisa dazols [MASK] i had similar notions as an hiv social worker in san francisco i had met many gay immigrants they told me their stories of persecution in their home countries just for being gay [MASK] and the reasons[MASK] why they escaped to the us i saw how this had beaten them down [MASK] after ten years of doing this kind of work i needed better stories for myself <unk> [MASK] i knew the world was far from perfect <unk> but surely not every gay story was tragic jc [MASK] so as a couple we both had a need to find stories of hope [MASK] so we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the[MASK] <unk> lgbt individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world they would be courageous <unk> resilient <unk> and most of all proud of who they were [MASK] they would be the kind of person that i aspire to be [MASK] our plan was to share their stories to the world through film ld there[MASK] was just one problem <unk> we had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience we didn 't even know where to find the[MASK] supergays so we just had to trust that we 'd figure it all out along the way <unk> [MASK] so we picked fifteen countries in asia africa and south america countries outside the west that varied in terms of lgbt rights <unk> we bought a camcorder <unk> ordered a book on how to make a documentary [MASK] you can learn a lot these days[MASK] and set off on[MASK] <unk> one of the first countries that we traveled to was nepal [MASK] despite widespread poverty a decade long civil war <unk> and now recently a devastating earthquake [MASK] nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality <unk> [MASK] one of the key figures in the movement is bhumika shrestha [MASK] a beautiful vibrant transgendered woman bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school[MASK] and getting incarcerated[MASK] <unk> because of her gender presentation <unk> [MASK] but in two thousand and seven bhumika and nepal 's lgbt rights organization successfully petitioned the nepali supreme court to protect against lgbt discrimination <unk> here 's[MASK] <unk> the decision for the nepal government[MASK] to give[MASK] transgender identity cards and <unk> same sex marriage ld [MASK] i can appreciate bhumika 's confidence on a daily basis something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don 't fit in[MASK] to people 's strict gender expectations <unk> traveling throughout[MASK] <unk> i tended to freak out women in public restrooms they weren 't used to seeing someone like me <unk> i had to come up with a strategy so that i could just pee in peace [MASK] so anytime i would enter a restroom i would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts [MASK] and try to be as non threatening as possible <unk> putting out my my hands and saying hello just so that people could hear my feminine voice [MASK] this all gets pretty exhausting but it 's just who i am <unk> i can 't be anything else[MASK] <unk> traveled to india [MASK] on one hand <unk> india is a hindu society <unk> without a tradition of homophobia <unk> [MASK] on the other hand it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system which rejects anything that threatens the <unk> male female order <unk> [MASK] when we spoke to activists they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality where the women 's status is established[MASK] <unk> in society <unk> and in that way the status of lgbt people can be affirmed as well ld there we met prince <unk>[MASK] <unk> the world 's first openly gay prince <unk> [MASK] prince <unk> manvendra came out on the oprah winfrey show very internationally his parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal[MASK] <unk> we sat down with prince <unk> manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly here he <unk>[MASK] there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society and that[MASK] instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself <unk> whether we are gay we are lesbian <unk> we are transgender bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from[MASK] <unk> cannot be won in the court rooms <unk> but in the hearts and the minds of the people jc [MASK] while getting my hair cut the woman cutting my hair asked me do you have a husband [MASK] now this was a dreaded question that i got asked a lot by locals while traveling [MASK] when i explained to her that i was with a woman instead of a man she was incredulous and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents[MASK] <unk> reactions[MASK] and whether i was sad that i 'd never be able to have children [MASK] i told her that there are no limitations to my life and that lisa and i do plan to have a family some day <unk> [MASK] now this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy westerner she couldn 't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her[MASK] <unk> i showed her the photos of the supergays that we interviewed in india <unk> [MASK] she recognized prince <unk> manvendra from television and soon i had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me [MASK] and in that ordinary afternoon <unk> [MASK] i had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country ld [MASK] from india[MASK] we traveled to east africa a region known for intolerance towards lgbt people [MASK] in kenya <unk> eighty nine percent of people who come out to their families are disowned homosexual acts are a crime and can

senate [MASK] he became kenya 's first openly gay political candidate[MASK] <unk> david wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was but we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats[MASK] <unk> of who he was even in the face of threats <unk> he stayed authentic ld [MASK] at the opposite end of the spectrum is argentina [MASK] argentina 's a country where ninety two percent of the population identifies as catholic yet argentina has lgbt laws that are even more progressive than here in the us <unk> [MASK] in two thousand and ten argentina became the first country in latin america and the[MASK] <unk> world to adopt marriage equality[MASK] <unk> when we made the visit to my ancestral lands <unk> i wish i could have shown my parents what we found there[MASK] <unk> a whole community of young <unk> beautiful chinese lgbt people sure they had their struggles <unk> but they were fighting it out <unk> [MASK] in shanghai <unk> i had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group[MASK] and tell them our story in my broken mandarin chinese[MASK] in taipei each time we got onto the metro <unk> we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands and we learned that asia 's largest lgbt pride event[MASK] happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live if only my parents knew ld by the time we finished our[MASK] <unk> we had traveled fifty thousand miles and logged one hundred and twenty hours of video footage <unk> we traveled to fifteen countries and interviewed fifty supergays [MASK] turns out it wasn 't hard to find them at all jc [MASK] yes there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality and[MASK] let 's not forget that seventy five countries still criminalize homosexuality today <unk> [MASK] but there are also stories of hope[MASK] and courage in every corner of the[MASK] <unk> world <unk> what we ultimately took away from our journey is equality[MASK] is not a western invention ld one[MASK] of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum [MASK] momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world [MASK] and momentum as more and more countries find models of[MASK] <unk> equality in one another [MASK] when nepal protected against lgbt discrimination india pushed harder <unk> when argentina embraced marriage equality[MASK] uruguay and brazil followed <unk> when ireland said yes to equality [MASK] world stopped to notice <unk> when the us supreme court makes a statement to the

is one filled with more freedom adventure and love[MASK] <unk> i could have ever possibly imagined [MASK] one year after returning home from our trip <unk> marriage equality came to california and in the end we believe love will win out[MASK]
