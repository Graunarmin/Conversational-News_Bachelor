 <unk> so we all have our own biases for example <unk> some of us tend to think that it 's very difficult to transform failing government systems <unk> [MASK] when we think of government systems we tend to think that they 're[MASK] <unk> set in their ways and perhaps the leadership is just too bureaucratic to be able to change things <unk> [MASK] well today <unk> i want to challenge that theory <unk> i want to tell you a story of a very large government system[MASK] that has not only put itself on the path of reform but has also shown fairly spectacular results in less than three years [MASK] this is what a classroom in a public school in india looks like <unk> there are one million such schools in[MASK] <unk> india <unk> and even for me who 's lived in india all her life <unk> walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking <unk> [MASK] by the time kids are eleven fifty percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover[MASK] 11 year olds cannot do simple addition they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence these are things that you and i would expect[MASK] an 8 year old to be able to do by the time kids are thirteen or fourteen they tend to drop out of schools [MASK] in india public schools not only offer free education they offer free textbooks free workbooks <unk> free meals <unk> sometimes even cash scholarships <unk> [MASK] and yet forty percent of the parents today are choosing to pull their children out of public schools and pay out of their[MASK] <unk> pockets to put them in private schools <unk> [MASK] as a comparison in a far richer country the us that number is only ten percent that 's a huge statement on how broken the indian public education system is [MASK] so it was with that background that i got a call in the summer of two thousand and thirteen from an absolutely[MASK] <unk> the head of the department of school education in a state called haryana in india <unk> so she said to us look i 've been heading this department for the last two years i 've tried <unk>[MASK] a number of things and nothing seems to work can you possibly help [MASK] <unk> two million plus children in those public schools <unk> [MASK] so basically with that phone call i promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of peru or canada transform itself [MASK] as i started this project i was very painfully aware of two things one that i had never done anything like this before[MASK] <unk> many others had perhaps without too much success [MASK] as my colleagues and i looked across the country and across the world we couldn 't find another example that we could just pick up and replicate in haryana <unk> [MASK] we knew that we had to craft our own journey <unk> [MASK] but anyway we jumped right in and as we jumped in all sorts of ideas started flying at us people said let 's change the way we recruit teachers let 's[MASK] hire new principals and train them and send them on[MASK] <unk> international learning tours let 's put technology inside classrooms [MASK] by the end of week one we had fifty ideas on the table all amazing all sounded right <unk> there was no way we were going to be able to implement fifty things <unk> [MASK] so i said hang on stop [MASK] let 's first at least decide what is it we 're trying to achieve so with a lot of push and pull and debate haryana set itself a goal which said by two[MASK] <unk> twenty we want eighty percent of our children to be at grade level knowledge [MASK] now the specifics of the goal don 't matter here <unk> but what matters is how specific the goal is [MASK] because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to implement does this idea support[MASK] <unk> 's put it aside as simple as it sounds having a very specific goal right up front has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused in our transformation journey <unk>[MASK] <unk> and looking back over the last two and a half years that has been a huge positive for us <unk> [MASK] <unk> before we went into schools a lot of people told us that education quality is poor because either the teachers are lazy they don 't come into schools <unk> or they 're incapable they actually don 't know how to teach <unk> [MASK] well when we went inside schools <unk> we found something completely different [MASK] on most days most teachers were actually inside schools [MASK] and when you spoke with them you realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes <unk> [MASK] but they were not[MASK] teaching <unk> i went to a school where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom and a toilet[MASK] supervised <unk> i went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids ' accounts [MASK] at lunchtime most teachers were spending all of their time getting the midday meal cooking supervised and served to the students[MASK] so we asked the teachers what 's going on why are you not teaching and they said this is what 's expected of us <unk> [MASK] when a supervisor comes to visit us these are exactly the things that he checks has the toilet been made has the meal been served when my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters these are exactly the[MASK] <unk> things which are discussed [MASK] you see what had happened was over the last two decades india had been fighting the challenge of access having enough schools [MASK] and enrollment <unk> bringing children into the schools <unk> so the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges [MASK] and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs not explicitly but implicitly[MASK] <unk> what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attendance but to tell them that what is most important is for them to go back inside classrooms and teach they needed to be monitored[MASK] and measured and awarded on the quality of teaching and not on all sorts of other things [MASK] so as we went through the education system as we delved into it deeper <unk> we found a few such[MASK] core root causes[MASK] <unk> causes[MASK] which were determining which were shaping how people behaved in the system <unk> and we realized that unless we change those specific things we could do a number of other things we could <unk>[MASK] <unk> train we could put technology into schools <unk> but the system wouldn 't change and addressing these non obvious core issues became a key part of the program[MASK] <unk> we had the goal and we had the issues <unk> and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were [MASK] we obviously did not want to recreate the wheel so we said let 's look around and see what we can find and we found these beautiful small[MASK] pilot experiments all over the country and all over the world <unk> small things being done by ngos being done by foundations <unk> [MASK] but what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled all of them were limited to fifty one hundred or five hundred schools and here we were looking for a solution for fifteen thousand schools <unk> [MASK] so we looked into why <unk> if these things actually work why don 't they actually scale <unk> [MASK] what happens is that when a typical ngo comes in they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources so they might bring in money they might bring in people they might bring in technology [MASK] <unk> fifty or one hundred schools that they actually operate in those additional resources actually create a difference <unk> [MASK] but now imagine that the head of this ngo goes to the head of the school education department and says hey now let 's do this for fifteen thousand schools [MASK] where is that guy or girl going to find the money to actually scale this up to fifteen thousand schools <unk> he doesn 't have the additional money he doesn 't have the resources[MASK] <unk> and hence <unk> innovations don 't scale <unk> [MASK] so right at the beginning of the project what we said was whatever we have to do has to be scalable it has to work in all fifteen thousand schools and <unk>[MASK] <unk> hence it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has[MASK] <unk> i think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me <unk> we spent a lot of long hours[MASK] in office <unk> in cafs sometimes even in bars scratching out heads and saying where are the solutions how are we going to solve this problem in the end i think we did find solutions to many of the issues i[MASK] 'll give you an example [MASK] in the context of effective learning one of the things people talk about is[MASK] children shouldn 't memorize things from books they should do activities and that 's a more effective way to learn [MASK] which basically means giving students things like beads learning rods abacuses but we did not have the budgets to give that to fifteen thousand schools two million children [MASK] we needed another solution we couldn[MASK] 't think of[MASK] <unk> one day one of our team members went to a school[MASK] and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students [MASK] that was a huge eureka moment for us <unk> [MASK] so what happens now in the textbooks in haryana is that after every concept we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say to teach this concept <unk> here 's an activity that you can do and by the way in[MASK] <unk> order to actually do this activity here are things that you can use from your immediate environment whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside which can be used as learning aids for kids [MASK] and we see teachers all over haryana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students <unk> [MASK] so in this way <unk>[MASK] <unk> we were actually able to implement it across all fifteen thousand schools from day one [MASK] now this brings me to my last point how do you implement something across fifteen thousand schools and one hundred thousand teachers [MASK] the department used to have a process which is very interesting i like to call it the chain of hope [MASK] they would write a letter from the headquarters[MASK] <unk> and send it to the next level which was the district offices <unk> they would hope that in each of these district offices an officer[MASK] would get the letter would open it read it[MASK] and then forward it to the next level which was the block offices <unk> [MASK] and then you would hope that at the block office somebody else got the letter <unk> opened it read it and forwarded it eventually to the fifteen thousand principals [MASK] and then one would hope that the principals got the letter received it understood it and[MASK] <unk> started implementing it it was a little bit ridiculous <unk> [MASK] now we knew technology was the answer <unk> but we also knew that most of these schools don 't have a computer or email [MASK] however what the teachers do have are smartphones <unk> they 're constantly on sms on facebook and on[MASK] <unk> so what now happens in haryana is all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of whatsapp groups and anytime something needs to be communicated it 's just posted across all whatsapp groups [MASK] it spreads like wildfire you can immediately check who has received it who has read it teachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously <unk>[MASK] and what 's interesting is it 's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions another teacher from a[MASK] <unk> different part of the state will[MASK] stand up and answer the question everybody 's acting as everybody 's peer group and things are getting implemented [MASK] so today when you go to a school in haryana things look different [MASK] the teachers are back inside classrooms they 're teaching <unk> [MASK] often with innovative techniques <unk> when a supervisor comes to visit the classroom he or she not only checks the[MASK] <unk> construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teaching <unk> [MASK] once a quarter all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded and schools which are not doing <unk>[MASK] <unk> so well find themselves having difficult conversations of course they also get additional support to be able to do better in the future [MASK] <unk> education it 's very difficult to see results quickly <unk> [MASK] when people talk about systemic large scale change they talk about periods of seven years and ten years <unk> but not in haryana [MASK] in the last one year <unk> there have been three independent studies all measuring student learning outcomes which indicate that something[MASK] <unk> something unique is happening in haryana [MASK] learning levels of children have stopped declining <unk> and they have started going up haryana is one of the few states in the country which is showing an improvement and certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement <unk> [MASK] these are still early signs there 's a long way to go but this gives us a lot of hope for the future <unk> [MASK] <unk> recently went to a school and as i was leaving i ran into a lady her name was parvati she was the mother of a child <unk> and she was smiling [MASK] and i said why are you smiling what 's going on [MASK] and she said i don 't know what 's going on <unk> but what i do know is that my children are learning they 're having fun [MASK] and for the time being i 'll stop my search for a private school to send them to [MASK] so i go back to where i started can government systems transform i certainly believe[MASK] <unk> so i think if you give them the right levers <unk> they can move mountains <unk> thank you[MASK]
