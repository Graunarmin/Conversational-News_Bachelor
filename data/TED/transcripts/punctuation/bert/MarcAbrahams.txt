<unk> you may decide that you see one or two points where the design is not[MASK] <unk> doctor ivan schwab in california is one of the people one of the main people who helped answer the question why don 't[MASK] woodpeckers get headaches [MASK] and it turns out the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains we being human[MASK] <unk> have our brains packaged [MASK] they the woodpeckers <unk> typically will peck they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands of times every day [MASK] every day <unk> [MASK] and as far as anyone knows that doesn 't bother them in the slightest how does this happen [MASK] their brain does not slosh around like ours does their brain is packed in very[MASK] <unk> at least for blows coming right from the front [MASK] not too many people paid attention to this research until the last few years when [MASK] in this country especially people are becoming curious about what happens to the brains of football players who bang their heads repeatedly and[MASK] the woodpecker[MASK] maybe relates to that [MASK] there was a paper published in the medical journal the lancet in england a few years ago called a man who pricked his finger[MASK] and smelled putrid for five years dr caroline mills and her team received this patient[MASK] and didn 't really know what to do about

people who were on their way to work in the morning to stop and try something out [MASK] try one of two conditions[MASK] <unk> the tradition is that[MASK] in the winter in that city <unk> you wear your socks on the outside of your boots and what they discovered by[MASK] experiment and it was quite graphic when they saw it was that it 's true that if you wear your socks on the outside rather than the inside you 're much more likely[MASK] to survive and not slip and fall <unk> now i hope you will agree with me that[MASK] these things i 've just described[MASK] <unk> to you each of them deserves some kind of prize [MASK] and that 's what they got each of them got an ig nobel prize in <unk>[MASK] i together with bunch of other people started the ig nobel prize ceremony <unk> every year we give[MASK] <unk> it 's that you 've done something that makes people laugh and then think what you 've done makes people laugh[MASK] and then think <unk> whatever it is there 's something about it that when[MASK] people encounter it at first their only possible reaction is to laugh and then a week later it 's still rattling around[MASK] <unk> in their heads and all they want to do is tell their friends about it that 's the quality we look for every year we get[MASK] in the neighborhood of nine thousand new nominations for the ig nobel prize of those <unk> consistently between ten

very difficult numerically <unk> [MASK] you should know that when we choose somebody to win an ig nobel prize we get in touch with that person <unk> very quietly <unk> [MASK] we offer them the chance to[MASK] <unk> if they want to[MASK] happily for us <unk> almost everyone who 's offered a prize decides[MASK] to accept [MASK] what do you get if you win an ig nobel prize <unk> well <unk> you get several things you get an ig nobel prize[MASK] <unk> the design is different every year [MASK] these are always handmade[MASK] from extremely[MASK] <unk> you 're looking at a picture of the prize we gave last year <unk> two thousand and thirteen[MASK] <unk> most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash some money[MASK] we don 't have any money so we can 't give them in fact the winners have to[MASK] pay their own way to come to the ig nobel ceremony <unk> [MASK] which most of them do last year though we did manage to scrape up some money <unk> last year <unk> each[MASK] of the ten ig nobel[MASK] <unk> prize winners received from us[MASK] ten trillion dollars a $ ten trillion <unk> bill from zimbabwe [MASK] you may remember that zimbabwe had a little adventure for a few years there of inflation [MASK] they ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as one hundred trillion dollars <unk> the man responsible who runs the[MASK] <unk> national bank there by the way won an ig nobel prize in mathematics the[MASK] other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony which happens at harvard university [MASK] and when you get there <unk> you come

hundred and thirty prizes there are lots of these people who walk among you maybe you have one a[MASK] paper was published about thirty years ago called injuries due to falling coconuts[MASK] <unk> by dr peter barss who is canadian <unk>[MASK] dr barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor he wanted to see the world so he went to papua new guinea [MASK] when he got there he went to work in a hospital and he was curious what[MASK] kinds of things happen to people that that bring them to the hospital he looked through the records[MASK] <unk> and he discovered that[MASK] a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts [MASK] one typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands where there are not many coconut trees down to visit their relatives on the coast where there are lots and they 'll think that <unk>[MASK] <unk> a coconut tree is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down a coconut tree that is ninety feet tall and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time[MASK] <unk> team of doctors in europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies <unk> you 're all familiar with colonoscopies one way or another [MASK] or in some cases one way and another <unk> [MASK] they in these papers explained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies[MASK] <unk> how to minimize the chance that when you perform a colonoscopy your patient will explode <unk>[MASK] <unk> one of the authors <unk> flew in from paris to the ceremony <unk> where he explained the history of this <unk>[MASK] <unk> when colonoscopies were becoming a common[MASK] technique for the first time people were figuring out how to do it well <unk> and there were some difficulties at first[MASK] <unk> basic problem i 'm sure you 're familiar with that[MASK] you 're looking inside a long <unk> narrow <unk> dark place and so [MASK] you want to have a larger space you add some gas to inflate it so you have room to look around now that 's added to the gas the methane gas that 's already[MASK] <unk> the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen so they added oxygen to methane gas <unk> and then they wanted to be able to see they needed light so they 'd put in a light source <unk> which in the 1950s was very hot <unk> so you had[MASK] methane gas which is flammable oxygen[MASK] and heat <unk> they stopped using oxygen pretty quickly [MASK] now it 's rare that[MASK] <unk> final thing that i want to tell you about is a prize we gave to <unk> dr elena bodnar [MASK] dr elena bodnar invented a brassiere that in an emergency can be quickly separated into a pair of protective face masks [MASK] one to save your life one to save the life of some lucky bystander[MASK] <unk> why would someone do this you might wonder dr bodnar came to the ceremony and she explained that she grew up in ukraine she was one of the doctors who treated victims of <unk>[MASK] <unk> the chernobyl power plant meltdown <unk> and they later discovered that a lot of the worst medical problems came from the particles people breathed in so she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere[MASK] <unk> when the unexpected happens years later she moved to america she had a baby one day she looked and on the floor her infant son had picked up her bra and had her bra[MASK] on his face and that 's where the idea came from she came to the ig nobel ceremony with the first prototype of the bra and she demonstrated[MASK]
