 <unk> i cut stories <unk> so my process is very straightforward[MASK] <unk> i take a piece of paper <unk> i visualize my story [MASK] sometimes i sketch sometimes i don 't <unk> and as my image is already inside the paper <unk> [MASK] i just have to remove what 's not from that story <unk> [MASK] so i didn 't come to papercutting in a straight line [MASK] in fact <unk> i see it more as a spiral <unk> [MASK] i was not born with a blade[MASK] <unk> in my hand <unk> [MASK] and i don 't remember papercutting as a child [MASK] as a teenager <unk> i was sketching <unk> drawing <unk> and i wanted to be an artist <unk> [MASK] but i was also a rebel <unk> [MASK] and i left everything and went for a long series of[MASK] <unk> i have been a shepherdess a truck driver [MASK] a factory worker a cleaning lady <unk> i worked in tourism for one year in mexico [MASK] one year in egypt <unk> i moved for two years in taiwan <unk> [MASK] and then i settled in new york[MASK] where i became a tour guide <unk> and i still worked as a tour leader[MASK] <unk> leader <unk> traveled back and forth in china tibet and central asia <unk> [MASK] so of course it took time and i was nearly forty <unk> and i decided it 's time to start as an artist[MASK] <unk> and you can use it in a lot of different ways <unk> and i chose the language of silhouette[MASK] because graphically it 's very efficient <unk> and it 's also just getting to the essential of things <unk> [MASK] so the word silhouette comes from a minister of finance etienne de silhouette[MASK] <unk> and he slashed so many budgets[MASK] that people said they couldn 't afford paintings anymore <unk> and they needed to have their portrait[MASK] and people told me like these thirty six views of the empire state building they told me you 're making artist books [MASK] so artist books have a lot of definitions they come in a lot of different shapes <unk> [MASK] but to me they are fascinating objects to[MASK] <unk> they can be with words or without words <unk> [MASK] and i have a passion for images and for words <unk> [MASK] i love pun and the relation to the unconscious <unk> [MASK] i love oddities of languages <unk> and everywhere i lived i learned the languages but never mastered them <unk> [MASK] so i 'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in[MASK] <unk> different languages <unk> so as you can guess my mother tongue is french [MASK] and my daily language is english <unk> [MASK] so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english <unk> [MASK] so one of these works is the spelling spider [MASK] so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee[MASK] <unk> bee but it 's much more connected to the web and[MASK] this spider spins a bilingual alphabet <unk> so you can read[MASK] and substantives <unk> so if you don 't know one of these languages <unk> it 's instant learning <unk> [MASK] and one ancient form of the book is scrolls [MASK] so scrolls are very convenient <unk> because you can create a large image[MASK] <unk> so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image[MASK] so it makes a very freestyle architecture <unk> [MASK] and i 'm making all those kinds of windows <unk> [MASK] so it 's to look beyond the surface it 's to have a look at different worlds and very often i 've been an outsider so[MASK] <unk> i want to see how things work and what 's happening <unk> so each window[MASK] is an image and is a world[MASK] that i often revisit <unk> and i revisit this world thinking about the image[MASK] about what we want to do and what are the[MASK] <unk> that we have with the expressions <unk> it 's all if <unk> so what if[MASK] we were living in balloon houses <unk> [MASK] it would make a very uplifting world <unk> [MASK] and we would leave a very low footprint on the planet it would be so light <unk> [MASK] so sometimes i view[MASK] from the inside like[MASK] <unk> egocentricity[MASK] and the inner circles [MASK] sometimes it 's a global view to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams <unk> [MASK] and we can use them also as a safety net <unk> and my[MASK] <unk> 'm influenced by everything i read <unk> everything i see i have some stories that are humorous[MASK] <unk> of sugar[MASK] with some sweet moments in between <unk> [MASK] and sometimes i have an emotional response to news such as the two thousand and ten haitian earthquake [MASK] other times it 's not even my stories[MASK] <unk> they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities <unk> i call them freudian cities <unk> [MASK] i cannot speak for all my images so[MASK] <unk> just go through a few of my worlds just with the title[MASK] <unk> and at one point i had to do the whole nine yards[MASK] so it 's actually a papercut that 's nine yards long [MASK] so in life and in papercutting <unk> everything is connected one story leads to another [MASK] i was also interested in the physicality of this format because you have to walk to see it [MASK] and parallel to my cutting is my running <unk> i started with small[MASK] images i started with a few miles larger images i started to run marathons <unk> then i went to[MASK] <unk> papercutting marathon at the museum of arts and design in new york city [MASK] the result is hells and heavens it 's two panels thirteen ft high <unk> they were installed in the museum on two floors[MASK] <unk> but in fact it 's a continuous image and i call it hells and heavens because it 's daily hells and daily heavens <unk> there is no border in between some people are born in hells [MASK] and against all odds they make it to heavens <unk> other people make the opposite trip [MASK] that 's the border you have sweatshops in hells you have people renting their wings in the heavens <unk> [MASK] and then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we[MASK] <unk> even have the same action and the result puts you in hells or in heavens <unk> [MASK] so the whole hells and heavens is about free will[MASK] and determinism <unk> and in papercutting you have the drawing as the structure itself[MASK] <unk> so you can take it off the wall <unk> [MASK] here it 's an artist book installation called identity project [MASK] it 's not autobiographical identities <unk> [MASK] they are more our social identities <unk> [MASK] and then you can just walk behind them and try them on <unk> so it 's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity[MASK] that 's another artist book project in fact in the picture you have two of them [MASK] it 's one i 'm wearing and one that 's on exhibition at the center for books arts in new york city <unk> [MASK] why do i call it a book it 's called fashion statement and there are quotes about fashion so you can[MASK] <unk> definition of artist book is very generous <unk> [MASK] so artist books you take them off the wall you take them for a walk you can also install them as public art <unk> [MASK] here it 's in scottsdale <unk> arizona and it 's called floating memories so it 's regional memories <unk> [MASK] and they are just randomly moved by the wind[MASK] <unk> i love public art <unk> and i entered[MASK] competitions for a long time [MASK] after eight years of rejection <unk> i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city <unk> [MASK] it was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen [MASK] i made an artist book[MASK] that 's in stainless steel instead of paper <unk> i called it working in the same direction [MASK] but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions [MASK] with public art <unk> i could also make cut glass here it 's faceted glass in the bronx [MASK] and each time i make public art i want something that[MASK] <unk> 's really relevant to the place it 's installed so for the subway in new york i saw[MASK] a correspondence between riding the subway and reading <unk> [MASK] it is travel in time travel on time [MASK] and bronx literature it 's all about bronx writers and their stories[MASK] <unk> another glass project is in a public library in san jose <unk> california <unk> [MASK] so i made a vegetable point of view of the growth of san jose <unk> so i started in the center with the acorn[MASK] for the ohlone indian civilization then i have the fruit from europe for the ranchers <unk> and then the fruit of the world[MASK] for silicon valley today <unk> and it 's still growing <unk> [MASK] so the technique it 's cut sandblasted <unk> etched and printed glass into architectural glass [MASK] and outside the library i wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind <unk> i took[MASK] <unk> in their title[MASK] and i used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge <unk> [MASK] i also planted the bibliotree <unk> [MASK] so it 's a tree <unk> and in its trunk you have the roots of languages <unk> [MASK] and it 's all about international writing systems <unk> and on the branches you have library material[MASK] <unk> you can also have function and form with public art <unk> so in aurora colorado it 's a bench <unk> but you have a bonus with this bench <unk> [MASK] because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts you will walk away with[MASK] temporary branding of the story element on your thighs [MASK] another functional work it 's in the south[MASK] <unk> side of chicago for a subway station <unk> and it 's called seeds of the future are planted today [MASK] it 's a story about transformation and connections <unk> [MASK] so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter <unk> and not to have objects falling on the rails [MASK] to be able to change fences and window guards[MASK] into flowers it 's fantastic <unk> [MASK] and here i 've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low income buildings and affordable housing <unk> [MASK] so each building has its own personality <unk> and sometimes it 's about a legacy[MASK] of the neighborhood like in morrisania about the jazz[MASK] <unk> history <unk> and for other projects like in paris it 's about the name of the street it 's called rue des prairies[MASK] prairie street <unk> so i brought back the rabbit the dragonfly [MASK] to stay in that street <unk> and in two thousand and nine <unk> i was asked[MASK] to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in new york city for a year[MASK] <unk> so that was a very captive audience <unk> and i wanted to give them an escape <unk> [MASK] i created all around town [MASK] it is a papercutting <unk> and then after i added color on the computer <unk> so i can call it[MASK] <unk> kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques <unk> [MASK] but the result is always to have stories <unk> so the stories they have a lot of possibilities <unk> they have a lot of scenarios [MASK] i don 't know the stories <unk> i take images from our global imagination from clich from things we are thinking about from history <unk> [MASK] <unk> and everybody 's a narrator because everybody has a story to tell but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world [MASK] and in all these universes it 's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with <unk> but the destination is our minds[MASK] and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic <unk> and it 's what story cutting is all about[MASK]
