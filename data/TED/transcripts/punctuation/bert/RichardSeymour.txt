 <unk> my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker and what this guy had done he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches and[MASK] <unk> of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he 'd bought and the guy took it apart <unk> and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels <unk> [MASK] and as he did so his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving [MASK] were words [MASK] and he said to the guy why have you put[MASK] stuff on the back that no one will ever see and the watchmaker turned around[MASK] <unk> god can see it [MASK] now i 'm not in the least bit religious neither was my father but at that point i noticed something happening here <unk> [MASK] i felt something in this plexus of[MASK] blood vessels and nerves and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere i guess but[MASK] i felt something and it was a physiological response <unk> and from that point on from my[MASK] <unk> i began to think of things in a different way and as i took on my career as a designer <unk> i began to ask myself the simple question do we actually think beauty [MASK] or do we feel it <unk> now you probably know the answer to this already you probably think well i don 't know which one you think it is <unk> but i think it 's about feeling beauty <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] so i then moved on into my design career and[MASK] <unk> to find some exciting things one of the most[MASK] early work was done in automotive design some very exciting work was done there [MASK] and during a lot of this work we found something or i found something that really fascinated me [MASK] and maybe you can remember it do you remember when lights used to just go on and off click click when you closed the door in a car and then somebody i think it was bmw introduced a light that went out[MASK] slowly [MASK] <unk> i remember it clearly do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that [MASK] i remember sitting there thinking <unk> this is fantastic in fact i 've never found anybody that doesn 't like the light that goes out slowly <unk> [MASK] i thought well what the hell 's that about so i started to ask myself questions about it <unk> and the first was i 'd ask other people do you like it[MASK] of how this actually works <unk> and so i did some experiments <unk> and i suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that[MASK] light to dark in six seconds[MASK] exactly that do you know what it is anyone [MASK] you see using this bit the thinky bit <unk> the slow bit of the brain using that and this isn 't a think it 's a feel and would you do me a favor for the next fourteen minutes or whatever it is[MASK] <unk> you feel stuff i don 't need you to think so much as i want you to feel it i felt[MASK] a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation <unk> and that thing that i found[MASK] was the cinema or the theater it 's actually just happened here light to dark[MASK] <unk> that 's fantastic i 'm looking forward to it i get a sense of anticipation [MASK] now i 'm not a neuroscientist i don 't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex <unk> but it might be because the people i speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this and some of the people i speak to that have never seen a movie or been to[MASK] <unk> don 't get it in the same way <unk> everybody likes it <unk> but some like it more than others <unk> [MASK] so this leads me to think of this in a different way we 're not feeling it we 're thinking beauty is in the limbic system if that 's not an outmoded idea [MASK] these are the bits the pleasure centers <unk> and maybe what i 'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking <unk> the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those[MASK] bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit the cortex they arrive first [MASK] so how do we make that actually work and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know or what we 're going to learn about something [MASK] this is one of the most beautiful things i know [MASK] it 's a plastic bag and when i looked at it first i thought <unk> no there 's no beauty in that then i found out [MASK] post exposure <unk> that this plastic bag if i put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with[MASK] <unk> coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff [MASK] that that filthy water will migrate through the <unk> wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure <unk> potable[MASK] drinking water and all of a sudden this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me <unk> [MASK] now i 'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit would you mind taking the brain out and i just want you to feel something[MASK] <unk> look at that <unk> what are you feeling about it [MASK] is it beautiful is it exciting i 'm watching your faces very carefully there[MASK] 's some rather bored looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged looking ladies[MASK] who are picking up something off that maybe there 's an innocence to it now i 'm going to tell you what it is are you ready <unk> this is the last act on this earth[MASK] of a little girl called heidi[MASK] <unk> five years old [MASK] before she died of cancer to the spine <unk> it 's the last thing she did the last physical act look at that picture <unk> [MASK] look at the innocence look at the beauty in it is it beautiful now stop <unk> stop how do you feel where are you feeling this i 'm feeling it[MASK] <unk> i feel it here <unk> and i 'm watching your faces because your faces are telling me something the lady over there is actually crying by the way <unk> but[MASK] what are you doing <unk> [MASK] i watch what people do <unk> i watch faces i watch reactions <unk> [MASK] because i have to know how people react to things <unk> and one of the most common faces on something[MASK] faced with beauty something stupefyingly delicious is what i call the omg and by the way[MASK] 's no pleasure in that face it 's not a this is wonderful the eyebrows are doing this the eyes are defocused and the mouth[MASK] is hanging open that 's not the expression of joy there[MASK] 's something else in that there 's something weird happening so pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in poignancy is a word i love as a designer <unk> it means something triggering a big emotional[MASK] <unk> response <unk> often quite a sad emotional response but it 's part[MASK] of what we do it isn 't just about nice <unk> and this is the dilemma <unk> this is the paradox of beauty sensorily we 're taking in all sorts of things mixtures of things that are good bad exciting frightening[MASK] to come up with that sensorial[MASK] exposure that sensation of what 's going on pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl 's drawing[MASK] and also triumph <unk> this sense of transcendence this [MASK] i never knew that ah this is something new and that 's packed in there as well <unk> and as we assemble these tools <unk> from a design point of view i get terribly excited about it [MASK] because these are things as we 've already said they 're arriving at the brain it would seem before cognition before we can manipulate them[MASK] electrochemical party tricks now[MASK] what i 'm also interested in is is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty by that i mean[MASK] intrinsically beautiful things just something that 's exquisitely beautiful that 's universally beautiful [MASK] very hard to find maybe you 've got some examples of it <unk> very hard to find something that to everybody is a very beautiful thing without a certain amount of information packed in there before [MASK] so a lot of it tends to be extrinsic[MASK] <unk> it 's mediated by information before the comprehension or the information 's added on at the back like that little girl 's drawing that i showed you [MASK] now when talking about beauty[MASK] you can 't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you and one of the most tedious[MASK] saying that beauty was about symmetry well it obviously isn 't this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people and then to add them into a list of most beautiful <unk>[MASK] <unk> to least beautiful and then exposing a full face <unk> and they found that it was almost exact[MASK] <unk> pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this <unk> and tried to understand what the individual elements were but feeling it as i go now i can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye i[MASK] 'm not getting it off the eyebrow <unk> and the earhole isn 't doing it to me at all so i don[MASK] 't know how much this is helping me <unk> but it 's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off[MASK] <unk> how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements [MASK] anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are but as we are [MASK] so i 'm going to shamelessly expose something to you which is beautiful to me[MASK] <unk> i can 't express to you how exquisite this object is but i also know why it 's exquisite to me <unk> [MASK] because it 's a palimpsest of things it[MASK] 's masses and masses of layers this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension it 's something much bigger layer after layer of[MASK] <unk> if i just go through some of them now i know about laminar flow when it comes to air piercing objects and that does it consummately well you can see it can so that 's getting me excited <unk> and i feel that here[MASK] this bit <unk> the big secret of automotive design reflection management it 's not about the shapes it 's how the shapes reflect light [MASK] now that thing light flickers across it as you move <unk> so it becomes a kinetic object even though it 's standing still[MASK] <unk> managed by how brilliantly that 's done on the reflection <unk> [MASK] this little relief on the footplate by the way to a rider means there 's something going on underneath it in this case a drive chain running at three hundred miles and hour probably taking the power from the engine i 'm getting <unk>[MASK] <unk> terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things <unk> titanium lacquer[MASK] <unk> can 't tell you how wonderful this is [MASK] that 's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel i 'm really getting into this now and of course a racing bike doesn 't have a prop stand but this one <unk> because it 's a road bike it all goes away and it folds into this little gap <unk> [MASK] so it disappears <unk> and then i can 't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator which is curved why would you do that <unk> because i know we need to bring the wheel[MASK] <unk> the aerodynamics so it 's more expensive but it 's wonderful <unk> and to cap it all brand royalty[MASK] agusta count agusta <unk> from the great histories of this stuff <unk> the bit that you can 't see is the genius that created this <unk> massimo tamburini [MASK] they call him the plumber in italy <unk>[MASK] as well as maestro because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time there 's so little compromise on this you can 't see it[MASK] <unk> likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty[MASK] we have to deal with it so i have to work with a supply chain and i 've got to work with the technologies and i 've got to work with everything else all the time and so compromises start to fit into it <unk> and so look at her i 've had[MASK] to make a bit of a compromise there i 've had to move that part across but only a millimeter <unk> no one 's noticed have they yet did you see what i did[MASK] <unk> i moved three things by a millimeter <unk> pretty <unk> yes beautiful maybe lesser <unk> but then <unk>[MASK] <unk> the consumer says that doesn 't really matter <unk> so that 's okay isn 't it <unk> another millimeter <unk> [MASK] no one 's going to notice those split lines and changes <unk> it 's that easy to lose beauty because beauty 's incredibly difficult[MASK] to do and only a few people can do it and a focus group[MASK] cannot do it <unk> [MASK] and a team rarely can do it <unk> it takes a central cortex if you like to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time <unk> [MASK] this is a beautiful water bottle some of you know of it done by ross lovegrove the designer <unk> [MASK] this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty this one as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this it 's lovely because it is an embodiment of[MASK] <unk> something refreshing and delicious <unk> i might like it more than you like it <unk> because i know how bloody hard it is to do it <unk> it 's stupefyingly difficult[MASK] to make something that refracts light like that [MASK] that comes out of the tool correctly that goes down the line without falling over underneath this like the story of the swan is a million things very difficult[MASK] <unk> to do so all hail to that <unk> it 's a fantastic[MASK] example a simple object <unk> and the one i showed you before was of course a massively complex one <unk> and they 're working[MASK] in beauty in slightly different ways because of it <unk> [MASK] you all i guess like me enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance and part of the joy of it is you know the difficulty you also may be taking into account the fact that it 's incredibly painful anybody seen a ballet dancer 's toes when they come out of the points <unk> [MASK] while she 's doing these graceful arabesques[MASK] plies and what have you something horrible 's going on down here <unk> [MASK] the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what 's actually going on [MASK] now i 'm using microseconds wrongly here so please ignore me <unk> [MASK] but what i have to do now feeling again what i 've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes of these triggers into something early on in the process that you pick it up not through your thinking[MASK] <unk> but through your feeling so we 're going to have a little experiment right are you ready i 'm going to show you something for a very very brief moment are you ready [MASK] okay did you think that was a bicycle when i showed it to you at the first flash <unk> it 's not tell[MASK] me something did you think it was quick when you first saw it yes you did did you think it was modern yes you did that[MASK] <unk> shot into you before that and because your brain starter motor began there now it 's got to deal with it <unk> [MASK] and the great thing is this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it 's green technology and it 's good for you and it 's light and it 's all part of the future [MASK] so is that wrong <unk> well in this case it isn 't because it 's a very very[MASK] <unk> of technology but you 're a slave of that first flash we are slaves to the first few fractions[MASK] <unk> of a second and that 's where much of my work has to win or lose on a shelf[MASK] in a shop [MASK] it wins or loses at that point you may see fifty one hundred two hundred things on a shelf as you walk down it <unk> [MASK] but i have to work within that domain to ensure that it gets you there[MASK] first and finally the layer that i love of knowledge some of you i 'm sure will be familiar with this <unk> what 's[MASK] <unk> about this and the way i love to come back to it is this is taking something that you hate[MASK] or bores you folding clothes and if you can actually do this who can actually do this anybody try to do this yeah it[MASK] 's fantastic isn 't it <unk> look at that do you want to see it again no time it says i have two minutes left so we can 't do this [MASK] <unk> that 's how underpaid younger aged people have to fold your t shirt you didn 't maybe know it but how do you feel about it <unk> [MASK] it feels fantastic when you do it you look forward to doing it and when you tell somebody else about it like you probably have[MASK] you look really smart the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside [MASK] the stuff that costs nothing because that knowledge is free[MASK] bundle that together and where do we come out <unk> form follows function <unk> only sometimes[MASK] <unk> only sometimes <unk> [MASK] form is function [MASK] form is function it informs it tells us it supplies us answers before we 've even thought about it and so i 've stopped using words like form and[MASK] i 've stopped using words like function as a designer what i try to pursue now[MASK] is the emotional functionality of things because if i can get that[MASK] <unk> i can make them wonderful and i can make them repeatedly wonderful and you know what those products and services are because you own some of them they[MASK] 're the things that you 'd snatch if the house was on fire <unk> forming the emotional bond[MASK] between this thing and you[MASK] is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it thank you[MASK]
