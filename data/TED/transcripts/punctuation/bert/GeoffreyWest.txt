 <unk> cities are the crucible of civilization [MASK] they have been expanding <unk> urbanization has been expanding at an exponential rate in the last two hundred years so that by the second part of this century the planet will be completely dominated by cities[MASK] <unk> cities are the origins of global warming <unk> impact on the environment <unk> health pollution disease <unk> [MASK] finance economies [MASK] energy they 're all problems that are confronted by having cities <unk> that 's where all these problems come from and the tsunami of problems that we feel we 're facing in terms of sustainability questions[MASK] <unk> are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet [MASK] here 's some numbers [MASK] two hundred years ago the united states was less than a few percent urbanized <unk> it 's now more than eighty two percent [MASK] the planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago <unk> china 's building three hundred new cities in the next twenty years now listen to this <unk> every week for the[MASK] <unk> foreseeable future until two thousand and fifty <unk> every week more than a million people[MASK] are being added to our cities <unk> [MASK] this is going to affect everything everybody in this room if you stay alive is going to be affected by what 's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon <unk> [MASK] however cities <unk> [MASK] <unk> negative aspect to them [MASK] are also the solution because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people creating ideas innovation wealth and so on [MASK] so we have this kind of dual nature <unk> and so there 's an urgent need for[MASK] a scientific theory of cities now these[MASK] <unk> my comrades in arms [MASK] this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people <unk> and they 've done all the work <unk> and i 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together [MASK] so here 's the problem <unk> this is what we all want the ten billion people on the planet in two thousand and fifty want to live in places like this <unk> [MASK] having things like this <unk> doing things like this <unk> with economies that are growing like[MASK] <unk> not realizing that entropy produces things like this this <unk> this[MASK] and this and the question is [MASK] is that what edinburgh and london and new york are going to look like in two thousand and fifty or is it going to be this <unk> that 's the question [MASK] i must say many of the indicators look like this is what it 's going to look like <unk> but let 's talk about[MASK] <unk> my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities and scientific theory means quantifiable relying on underlying generic <unk>[MASK] <unk> principles that can be made into a predictive framework <unk> that 's the quest is that conceivable [MASK] <unk> cities part of biology is london a great big whale <unk> is edinburgh a horse <unk> [MASK] is microsoft a great big anthill what do we learn from that we use them metaphorically the dna of a company the[MASK] metabolism of a city and so on is that just bullshit <unk> metaphorical bullshit or is there serious substance to it and if that is the case [MASK] how come that it 's very hard to kill a city you[MASK] <unk> drop an atom bomb on a city <unk> and thirty years later it 's surviving very few cities[MASK] fail all companies die all companies and if you have a serious theory you should be able to predict when google is going to go bust <unk> <unk> [MASK] so is that just another version of this <unk> [MASK] well we understand this very well that is you ask any generic question about this how many trees of a given size[MASK] <unk> size how many branches of a given size does a tree have how many leaves what is the energy flowing through each branch <unk> what is the size of the canopy what is its growth what is its mortality <unk>[MASK] we have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions and the idea is can we do the same for[MASK] <unk> so the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life is that it is scalable it works over an extraordinary range this is just a tiny range actually it 's us mammals we 're one of these [MASK] the same principles the same dynamics the same organization is at work in all of these including us <unk> and it can scale over a range of one hundred million in size and that is[MASK] one of the main reasons life is[MASK] <unk> resilient and robust[MASK] scalability <unk> we 're going to discuss that in a moment more but you know at a local level <unk> you scale everybody in this room is scaled that 's called growth[MASK] here 's how you grew [MASK] rat <unk> that 's a rat could have been you we 're all pretty much the same <unk> [MASK] and you see you 're very familiar with this you grow very quickly and then you stop and that line there[MASK] is a prediction from the same theory based on the same principles that describes that forest <unk> [MASK] and here it is for the growth of a rat and those points on there are data points <unk> this is just the weight versus the age <unk> [MASK] and you see it stops growing very very good for biology also one of the reasons for its great resilience [MASK] very very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm [MASK] <unk> is what we believe <unk> this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us [MASK] particularly illustrated in that left hand corner <unk> hockey sticks this is a bunch of software companies[MASK] and what it is is their revenue versus their age all zooming away and everybody making millions and billions of dollars <unk> okay <unk> so[MASK] how do we understand this so let 's first talk about biology this is[MASK] <unk> explicitly showing you how things scale and this is a truly remarkable graph what is plotted here is metabolic rate[MASK] how much energy you need per day to stay alive versus[MASK] your weight your mass for all of us bunch of organisms [MASK] and it 's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of ten otherwise you couldn 't get everything on the graph <unk> and what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way[MASK] <unk> way is that everybody lies on the same line <unk> despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe [MASK] there 's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this it 's particularly[MASK] astonishing because each one of these organisms each subsystem each cell type each[MASK] <unk> has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history <unk> [MASK] and yet despite all of that darwinian evolution and natural selection <unk> they 've been constrained to lie on a line <unk> something else is going on [MASK] before i talk about that i 've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve this straight line it 's three quarters roughly <unk> [MASK] which is less than one and we call that sublinear and here 's the point of that it says that[MASK] <unk> that if it were linear the[MASK] steepest slope then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy <unk> [MASK] but it 's sublinear <unk> and what that translates into is that if you double the size of the organism <unk> you actually only need seventy five percent more energy so a wonderful thing about all of biology <unk>[MASK] is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale the bigger you are systematically according to very[MASK] <unk> rules less energy per capita now[MASK] any physiological variable you can think of any life history event you can think of if you plot it this way <unk> looks like this <unk> [MASK] there is an extraordinary regularity so you tell me the size of a mammal i can tell you at the ninety percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology[MASK] <unk> and the reason for this is because of networks all of life[MASK] is controlled by networks from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level <unk> and you 're very familiar with these networks <unk> [MASK] that 's a little thing that lives inside an elephant <unk> and here 's the summary of what i 'm saying [MASK] if you take those networks <unk> this idea of networks and you apply universal principles[MASK] <unk> principles all of these scalings and all of these constraints[MASK] follow <unk> including the description of the forest the description of your circulatory system [MASK] the description within cells one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that <unk> systematically the pace of life decreases as you get bigger <unk> [MASK] heart rates are slower <unk> you live longer <unk> diffusion of oxygen and resources across[MASK] <unk> membranes is slower etc the question is is any of this true for cities and companies <unk> [MASK] so is london a scaled up birmingham which is a scaled up brighton <unk> etc etc [MASK] is new york a scaled up san francisco which is a scaled up santa fe <unk> don 't know we will discuss that <unk> but they are networks [MASK] and the most important network of cities is you[MASK] <unk> cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions our interactions and the clustering and grouping of individuals [MASK] here 's just a symbolic picture of that <unk> [MASK] and here 's scaling of cities <unk> [MASK] this shows that in this very simple example which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size plotted in the same way as the biology you see exactly the[MASK] <unk> same kind of thing there is a scaling that is that the[MASK] number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size [MASK] the slope of that is less than linear <unk> there is an economy of scale less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are not surprising <unk> but here 's what 's[MASK] <unk> it scales in the same way everywhere <unk> this is just european countries <unk> but you do it in japan or china or colombia <unk> [MASK] always the same with the same kind of[MASK] economy of scale to the same degree and[MASK] any infrastructure you look at whether it 's the length of roads length of electrical lines anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way <unk> it 's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on[MASK] but even more surprising[MASK] is if you look at socio economic quantities quantities that have no analog in biology that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to ten thousand years ago <unk> [MASK] the top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way and the bottom one is you lot[MASK] plotted in the same way <unk> and what you see is a scaling phenomenon[MASK] <unk> but most important in this [MASK] the exponent the analog to that three quarters for the metabolic rate is bigger than one it 's about one point one five to one point two [MASK] here it is <unk> which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita <unk> unlike biology higher wages more super creative people per capita as you get bigger[MASK] <unk> more patents per capita more crime per capita and we 've looked at everything more aids cases flu <unk> etc <unk> [MASK] and here they 're all plotted together just to show you what we plotted here is[MASK] income gdp gdp of the city[MASK] crime and patents all on one graph and you can see they all follow the same line <unk> and here 's the statement if you double the size of a city from one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand from a million to two million ten to twenty million[MASK] <unk> then systematically you get a fifteen percent increase in wages <unk> wealth number of aids cases number of police <unk> [MASK] anything you can think of [MASK] it goes up by fifteen percent <unk> and you have a fifteen percent savings[MASK] on[MASK] the infrastructure this <unk> no doubt is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities because they think[MASK] they think that all those wonderful things like creative people <unk> wealth income is what attracts them forgetting about the ugly and the bad [MASK] what is the reason for this <unk> well i don 't have time to tell you about all the mathematics but underlying this[MASK] is the social networks because this is a universal phenomenon <unk> this fifteen percent rule[MASK] is true no matter where you[MASK] <unk> on the planet japan [MASK] chile <unk> portugal [MASK] scotland <unk> doesn 't matter <unk> always all the data shows it 's the same despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently <unk> something universal is going on <unk>[MASK] the universality to repeat <unk> is us that we are the city <unk> and it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions so there it is[MASK] <unk> it is those networks and their mathematical structure unlike biology which had sublinear scaling economies of scale <unk> [MASK] you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger <unk> if it 's social networks with super linear scaling more per capita[MASK] then the theory says that you increase the pace of life the bigger you[MASK] <unk> life gets faster on the left is the heart rate showing biology on the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of european cities <unk> showing that increase[MASK] <unk> lastly i want to talk about growth <unk> [MASK] this is what we had in biology just to repeat <unk> economies of scale[MASK] gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior <unk> you grow fast and then stop part of our[MASK] <unk> that would be bad for economies and cities and indeed one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation then <unk>[MASK] <unk> indeed you get from the same theory a beautiful rising exponential curve lovely and in fact if you compare it to data it fits very well with the development of cities and economies <unk> but it has a terrible catch <unk> and the catch is that[MASK] <unk> destined to collapse for many reasons kind of malthusian reasons that you run out of resources and how do you avoid that <unk> well we 've done it before what we do is [MASK] as we grow and we approach the collapse a major innovation takes place[MASK] and we start over again <unk> and we start over again as we approach the next one and so on so there 's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain[MASK] <unk> growth and avoid collapse [MASK] the catch <unk> however to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster <unk> [MASK] so the image is that we 're not only on a treadmill that 's going faster <unk> but we have to change the treadmill[MASK] faster and faster we have to accelerate on a continuous basis[MASK] <unk> avoid a heart attack <unk> [MASK] so lastly i 'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies[MASK] see companies <unk> they scale <unk> the top one in fact is walmart on the right it 's the same plot <unk> this happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees we could use sales <unk> [MASK] anything you like there it is after some little fluctuations at the beginning [MASK] when companies are innovating[MASK] <unk> scale beautifully <unk> and we 've looked at twenty three thousand companies in the united states <unk> may i say <unk> and i 'm only showing you a little bit of this <unk> [MASK] what is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology <unk> indicating that they 're dominated not by[MASK] economies of scale in that interpretation by bureaucracy and administration <unk> and they do it beautifully may i say <unk> so if you tell me the size of some company some small company <unk> i could have predicted the size of walmart [MASK] if it has this sublinear scaling the theory says we should have[MASK] sigmoidal growth there 's walmart <unk> doesn 't look very sigmoidal that 's what we like hockey sticks <unk> [MASK] but you notice i 've cheated because i 've only gone up to ' ninety four let 's go up to two thousand and eight that red line is from the theory <unk> so if i 'd have done this in <unk>[MASK] i could have predicted what walmart would be now and then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies there they[MASK] <unk> they all start looking like hockey sticks they all bend over and they all die like you and me thank you[MASK]
