 <unk> he 's our son he was born two and a half years ago and i had a pretty tough pregnancy[MASK] <unk> had to stay still in a bed for like eight months[MASK] but in the end everything seemed to be under control so he got the right weight at birth he got the right apgar index so we were pretty reassured by[MASK] this but[MASK] at the end ten days later after he was born we discovered that he had a stroke[MASK] <unk> as you might know a stroke is a brain injury[MASK] a perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth[MASK] and in his case as you can see the right[MASK] part of his brain has gone[MASK] so the effect that this stroke could have on mario 's body could be the fact that he couldn 't be able to control the left[MASK] <unk> side of his body[MASK] just imagine if you have a computer and a printer and[MASK] you want to transmit to input to print out a document but the printer doesn 't have the right drives so[MASK] the same is for mario it 's just like he would like to move his left side of his body but he 's not able to transmit the right input to move his[MASK] <unk> arm and left leg so life had to change we needed to change our schedule we needed to change[MASK] the impact that[MASK] this birth had on our life roberto d 'angelo as you may imagine unfortunately we were not ready[MASK] nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities and as many[MASK] <unk> questions as possible started to come to our minds[MASK] and that has been really a tough time questions some basics like you know why did this happen to us and what went wrong[MASK] some more[MASK] tough like really what will be the impact on mario 's life i mean at the end will he be able to work will he be able to be normal and you know as a parent especially for the first time[MASK] why is he not going[MASK] <unk> to be better than us[MASK] and this indeed really is tough to say but a few months later we realized that[MASK] we were really feeling like a failure i mean the the only real product of our life[MASK] at the end was a failure and you know it was not a failure for ourselves[MASK] <unk> was a failure that will impact his full life[MASK] honestly we went down i mean we went really down but at the end[MASK] we started to look at him and we said we have to react[MASK] so immediately as francesca said we changed our life we started physiotherapy we started the rehabilitation[MASK] and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot basically we spent months[MASK] doing this with mario you have an object[MASK] and we showed him how to grab the object[MASK] now the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains exactly now as you watch me doing this[MASK] you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do[MASK] the actions[MASK] it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation but one day[MASK] <unk> we found that mario was not looking at our hand[MASK] he was looking at us[MASK] we were his mirror[MASK] and the problem as you might feel is that we were down we were depressed we we were looking at him as a problem[MASK] not as a son not from a positive perspective and that day really changed our perspective[MASK] <unk> we realized that we[MASK] had to become a better mirror for mario we restarted from our strengths and at the same time we restarted from his strengths we stopped <unk>[MASK] looking at him as a problem and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve[MASK] <unk> our strengths that we really can bring to mario and we started from our passions i mean at the end my wife and myself are quite different but we have many things in common[MASK] we love to travel we love music we love to be in places like this and we started to bring mario with us[MASK] just to show to him the best things that we can show to him[MASK] this short video is from last week[MASK] <unk> i am not saying applause[MASK] i am not saying it 's a miracle that 's not the message because we are just at the beginning of the path but we want to share what was the key learning[MASK] the key learning that mario drove to us and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not[MASK] only what[MASK] <unk> and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity and this is the message that we want to share with you this is why we are here[MASK] mario and this is why applause and this[MASK] is why we[MASK] decided to share the best mirror in the world[MASK] with him and we thank you so much all of you applause ff thank you[MASK]
