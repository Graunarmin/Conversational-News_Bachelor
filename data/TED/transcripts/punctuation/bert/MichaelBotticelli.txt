 <unk> i was a broken man <unk> and you probably wouldn 't be able to tell that if you met me i had a good job[MASK] at a well respected academic institution <unk> i dressed well of course <unk> but my insides were rotting away[MASK] you see i grew up in a family riddled with addiction <unk> [MASK] and as a kid i also struggled with coming to terms with my own sexuality <unk> and even though i couldn 't name it then growing up as a gay kid[MASK] just compounded my issues of isolation and insecurities <unk> but drinking took all of that away[MASK] <unk> like many i drank at an early age <unk> i continued to drink my way through college <unk> [MASK] and when i finally did come out in the early 1980s about the only places to meet other gay people to socialize [MASK] to be yourself were gay bars [MASK] and what do you do in gay bars <unk> you drink <unk> and i did[MASK] a lot my story is not unique[MASK] <unk> like millions of americans my disease progressed undiagnosed it took me to people and places and things that i never would have chosen[MASK] it wasn 't until an intersection with the law gave me an opportunity to get care [MASK] that i began my journey of recovery[MASK] my journey of recovery has been filled with love and with joy <unk> but it hasn 't been without[MASK] <unk> pain like many of you i 've lost too many friends and family to this disease <unk> i 've heard too many heartbreaking stories of people who 've lost loved ones to addiction <unk> [MASK] and i 've also lost countless friends[MASK] to hiv and aids our current opioid epidemic and the aids epidemic tragically have much in common [MASK] right now we are in the midst of one of the greatest health crises of our time[MASK] during two thousand and fourteen alone twenty eight thousand people died of drug overdoses associated with prescription drugs[MASK] and heroin [MASK] during the 1980s scores of people were dying from hiv and aids [MASK] public officials ignored it <unk> [MASK] some wouldn 't even utter the words [MASK] they didn 't want[MASK] <unk> treatment <unk> and tragically there are many parallels with our current epidemic <unk> [MASK] some called it the gay plague <unk> they called for quarantines [MASK] they wanted to separate the innocent victims from the rest of us [MASK] i was afraid we were losing this battle because people were blaming us for being sick public policy was being[MASK] <unk> held hostage by stigma and fear <unk> and also held hostage were compassion care <unk> research recovery[MASK] and treatment <unk> but we changed all that [MASK] because out of the pain of those deaths we saw a social and political movement aids galvanized us[MASK] into action[MASK] <unk> to stand up to speak up[MASK] and to act out and it also galvanized the lgbt movement [MASK] we knew we were in a battle for our lives because silence equaled death <unk> [MASK] but we changed <unk> and we made things happen and right now <unk> we have the potential to see the end of hiv aids in our lifetime[MASK] <unk> these changes came in no small part by the courageous <unk> yet simple decision for people to come out[MASK] to their neighbors to their friends to their families[MASK] and to their coworkers [MASK] years ago i was a volunteer for the names project this was an effort started by cleve jones in san francisco[MASK] to show that people who died of aids had names[MASK] and faces and families and people who loved them <unk> [MASK] i still recall unfolding the aids memorial quilt on the national mall[MASK] <unk> so fast forward to two thousand and fifteen [MASK] the supreme court 's decision to strike down the ban on same sex marriage [MASK] my husband dave and i walk over to the steps of the supreme court to celebrate that decision with so many other people and i couldn 't help but think[MASK] how far we came around lgbt rights and yet how far[MASK] we needed to go around issues of addiction <unk> [MASK] when i was nominated by president obama to be his director of drug policy <unk> i was very open about my recovery and about the fact that i was a gay man [MASK] and at no point during my confirmation process at least that i know of[MASK] did the fact that i was a gay man[MASK] come to bear on my candidacy or my fitness to do this job but[MASK] <unk> addiction did [MASK] at one point a congressional staffer said that there was no way that i was going to be confirmed by the united states senate because of my past [MASK] despite the fact that i had been in recovery for over twenty years [MASK] and despite the fact that this job takes a little bit of knowledge around addiction [MASK] <unk> you know this is the stigma that people with substance use disorders face every single day <unk> [MASK] and you know i have to tell you it 's still why i 'm more comfortable coming out as a gay man than i am as a person with a history of addiction <unk> [MASK] nearly every family in america is affected by addiction <unk> [MASK] yet unfortunately too often it 's not talked about openly and honestly [MASK] it 's whispered about[MASK] <unk> met with derision and scorn <unk> [MASK] we hear these stories time and time again on tv <unk> online <unk> [MASK] we hear it from public officials and we hear it from family and friends[MASK] and those of us with an addiction we hear those voices <unk> and somehow we believe that we are less deserving[MASK] <unk> of care and treatment <unk> today in the united states only one in nine people[MASK] get care and treatment for their disorder one in nine think about that [MASK] generally people with other diseases get care and treatment if you have cancer you get treatment if you[MASK] have diabetes you get treatment if you have a heart attack you get emergency services and you get referred to care <unk> [MASK] but somehow people with addiction have to wait for treatment or often can 't get when[MASK] <unk> they need it [MASK] and left untreated addiction has significant dire consequences <unk> and for many people that means death or incarceration <unk> [MASK] we 've been down that road before for too long our country felt like we could arrest our way out of this problem <unk> [MASK] but we know that we can 't [MASK] decades of scientific research has shown that this is a medical issue[MASK] <unk> that this is a chronic medical condition[MASK] that people inherit[MASK] and that people develop <unk> [MASK] so the obama administration has taken a different tack on drug policy <unk> [MASK] we 've developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to expand prevention services treatment services early intervention and recovery[MASK] <unk> we 've pushed criminal justice reform <unk> [MASK] we 've knocked down barriers to give people second chances <unk> we see public health and public safety officials working hand in hand at the community level <unk> [MASK] we see police chiefs across the country guiding people to treatment instead of jail and incarceration <unk> [MASK] we see law enforcement and other first responders reversing overdoses with naloxone to give people a second chance for care [MASK] the affordable care act[MASK] is the biggest expansion of substance use disorder treatment in a generation <unk> [MASK] and it also calls for the integration of treatment services within primary care <unk> [MASK] but fundamentally <unk> [MASK] all of this work is not enough <unk> unless we change the way that we view people with addiction[MASK] <unk> years ago when i finally understood that i had a problem[MASK] and i knew that i needed help <unk> i was too afraid to ask for it [MASK] i felt that people would think i was stupid that i was weak willed [MASK] that i was morally flawed <unk> [MASK] but i talk about my recovery because i want to make change [MASK] i want us to see that we need to be open and candid about who[MASK] <unk> we are and what we can do i am public about my own recovery not to be <unk>[MASK] i am open about my own recovery to change public opinion to change public policy[MASK] and to change the course of this epidemic and empower the millions of americans who struggle with this journey to be open and candid about who they are[MASK] <unk> than their disease <unk> and all of us have the opportunity to change public opinion[MASK] and to change public policy [MASK] all of us know someone who has an addiction <unk> [MASK] and all of us can do our part to change how we view people with addiction in the united states <unk> so when you see someone with an addiction[MASK] <unk> think of a drunk or a junkie or an addict or an abuser[MASK] see a person [MASK] offer them help <unk> give them kindness and compassion <unk> [MASK] and together we can be part of a growing movement in the united states to change how we view people with addiction <unk> [MASK] together we can change public policy <unk> we can ensure that people get care when they need it just like any other disease[MASK] we can be part of a growing unstoppable movement[MASK] to have millions of americans enter recovery and put an end to this epidemic thank you very much[MASK]
