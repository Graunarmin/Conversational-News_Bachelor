 <unk> i was trying to think about my career since i left the white house and the best[MASK] example i have is a cartoon in the new yorker a couple of years ago this little boy is looking up at his father and he says daddy when i grow up i want to be a former president[MASK] <unk> i have had a great blessing as a former president because i have had an access[MASK] that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around[MASK] this whole universe not only am i familiar with the fifty states in the united states but also my wife and i have visited more than one hundred and forty five countries[MASK] in the world and the carter center has had <unk> full time programs in eighty nations on earth[MASK] <unk> lot of times when we go into a country we not only the meet the king or the president but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas[MASK] of africa <unk> so our overall commitment at the carter center is to promote human rights <unk> [MASK] and knowing the world as i do i can tell you without any equivocation[MASK] that the number one abuse of human rights on earth[MASK] <unk> addressed quite often is the abuse of women and girls [MASK] there are a couple of reasons for this that i 'll mention to begin with <unk> [MASK] first of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures holy scriptures [MASK] in the bible <unk> old testament new testament <unk> quran and so forth and these have been misinterpreted by men[MASK] who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques <unk> [MASK] and they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position[MASK] compared to men in the eyes of god [MASK] this is a very serious problem it 's ordinarily not addressed a number of years ago in the year two thousand i had been a baptist[MASK] <unk> southern baptist for seventy years i tell you i still teach sunday school every sunday i 'll be teaching this sunday as well but[MASK] the southern baptist convention in the year two thousand decided that women should play a secondary position a subservient position to men [MASK] so they issued an edict in effect <unk> that prevents women from[MASK] <unk> deacons in the church or chaplains in the military and if a woman teaches a classroom[MASK] in a southern baptist seminary <unk> they cannot teach if a boy is in the room[MASK] because you can find verses in the bible there 's over thirty thousand verses in the bible that say that a woman shouldn 't teach a man and so forth <unk> [MASK] but the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position that is[MASK] <unk> problem <unk> because men can[MASK] exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer for instance <unk> wants to cheat women they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of god <unk> why should i treat them[MASK] as equals myself why should i pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work <unk> the other very serious blight that causes[MASK] <unk> this problem is the excessive resort to violence and that is increasing tremendously around the world[MASK] <unk> in the united states of america for instance we have had an enormous increase in[MASK] abuse of poor people mostly black people and and minorities by putting them in prison <unk>[MASK] <unk> when i was in office as governor of georgia <unk> one out of every one thousand americans were in prison <unk> nowadays seven point three[MASK] people per one thousand are in prison that 's a sevenfold increase [MASK] and since i left the white house there 's been an eight hundred percent increase in the number of women[MASK] who are black who are in prison <unk> we also have [ one of the only countries ] on earth that still has the death[MASK] <unk> that is a developed country and we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights[MASK] in encouraging the death penalty <unk> we 're in california now and i figured out the other day that[MASK] california has spent four billion dollars in convicting thirteen people for the <unk>[MASK] if you add that up that 's three hundred and seven million dollars it costs california to send a person to be executed nebraska this week just passed a law[MASK] abolishing the death penalty <unk> because it costs so much [MASK] so the resort to to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause[MASK] of the increase in abuse of women <unk> let me just go down a very few abuses of women that that concern me most[MASK] <unk> and i 'll be fairly brief because i have a limited amount of time as you know one is genital mutilation [MASK] genital mutilation is horrible and not known by american women <unk> but[MASK] in some countries many countries <unk> when a child is born that 's a girl very soon in her life her genitals are completely[MASK] cut away by[MASK] <unk> remove the exterior parts of a woman 's genitalia [MASK] and sometimes <unk> in more extreme cases but not very rare cases <unk> they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate and then later when she gets married the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex [MASK] this is not a rare thing although it 's against the law in most countries in egypt for instance[MASK] ninety one percent of all the females that live in egypt today[MASK] have been sexually mutilated in that way in some countries it 's more than ninety eight percent of the women[MASK] are cut that way before they reach maturity this is a horrible affliction[MASK] on all women that live in those countries[MASK] <unk> another very serious thing is honor killings <unk> where a family with misinterpretation again of a holy scripture there 's nothing in the quran that mandates this[MASK] will execute a girl in their family if she is raped[MASK] or if she marries a man that her[MASK] father does not approve or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing <unk> [MASK] and this is done by members of her own family so the family becomes murderers[MASK] when the girl[MASK] brings so called disgrace to the family an analysis was done in egypt not so long ago by the united nations and it showed that seventy five percent of these murders of a girl[MASK] are perpetrated by the father the uncle or the <unk>[MASK] <unk> brother but twenty five percent of the murders are conducted by women another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery <unk> [MASK] or human trafficking it[MASK] <unk> called nowadays <unk> there were about twelve point five million people sold from africa into slavery in the new world[MASK] back in the 19th century and the 18th century there are thirty million people now living in slavery the united states[MASK] department of state now has a mandate from congress to to[MASK] <unk> a report every year and the state department reports that eight hundred thousand people are sold across international borders every year[MASK] into slavery and that eighty percent of those sold[MASK] are women into sexual slavery [MASK] in the united states right this moment sixty thousand people are living in human bondage or slavery <unk> [MASK] atlanta georgia where the carter center is located and where i teach at emory university[MASK] they have between two hundred and three hundred women people[MASK] <unk> sold into slavery every month [MASK] it 's the number one place in the nation because of that atlanta has the busiest airport in the world and they also have a lot of passengers that come from[MASK] from the southern hemisphere if a brothel owner[MASK] wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin they can do it for[MASK] <unk> girl brings several times more than that and the average brothel owner in atlanta and in the united states now can earn about $ thirty five thousand[MASK] per slave the sex trade in atlanta georgia exceeds the total drug trade[MASK] in atlanta georgia so this is another very serious problem <unk> and the basic problem is prostitution because[MASK] <unk> there 's not a whorehouse in america that 's not known by the local officials the local policemen or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth [MASK] and this leads to one of the worst problems and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery[MASK] in all countries in the world sweden has got a good approach to it about fifteen to twenty years ago sweden decided to change the law and women are[MASK] <unk> no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery <unk> but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers[MASK] are prosecuted and prostitution has gone down [MASK] in the united states we take just the opposite position for every male arrested for illegal[MASK] sex trade twenty five women are arrested in the united states of america[MASK] <unk> ireland i 've already said sweden france <unk> and other countries are moving now towards this so called swedish model that 's another thing that can be done [MASK] we have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire our military[MASK] and our great university system in the military <unk> they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults[MASK] <unk> much more than one percent are actually prosecuted <unk> and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization[MASK] a ship like my submarine or a battalion in the army or a company in the marines[MASK] <unk> has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not [MASK] and of course the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command sexual assaults are taking place so they do not do it that law needs to be changed [MASK] about one out of four girls who enter american universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates <unk> [MASK] and this is now getting a lot of publicity partially because of my book but other things and so[MASK] eighty nine universities in america are now condemned[MASK] by the department of education under title ix because[MASK] the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault the department of justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists[MASK] <unk> but when they get on a university campus <unk> they can rape with impunity <unk> they 're not prosecuted <unk> [MASK] those are the kinds of things that go on in our in our society another thing that 's very serious about[MASK] about the abuse of of women[MASK] and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal[MASK] <unk> a woman in the united states now gets twenty three percent less than a man when i became president <unk> the difference was thirty nine percent so we 've made some progress <unk> [MASK] partially because i was president and so forth [MASK] but in the last fifteen years there 's been no progress made so it 's been just about[MASK] twenty three or twenty four percent difference for the last fifteen years these are the kind of things that go on if you take the fortune five hundred companies[MASK] twenty three of them have women ceos <unk> [MASK] out of five hundred and those ceos i need not tell you make less on an average[MASK] than the other[MASK] <unk> that 's what goes on in our country another problem with the united states is we are the most warlike nation on earth <unk> [MASK] we have been to war with about twenty five different countries[MASK] since the second world war [MASK] sometimes we 've had soldiers on the ground fighting the other times we 've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people other times of course now[MASK] <unk> since the second world war there was four years i won 't say which ones where we didn 't we didn[MASK] 't drop a bomb we didn 't launch a missile we didn 't fire a bullet [MASK] but anyway <unk> those kinds of things <unk> the[MASK] resort to violence and the[MASK] misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes are the basic causes[MASK] <unk> abuse of women and girls <unk> there 's one more basic cause[MASK] that i need not mention and that is that in general men don 't give a damn that 's[MASK] true the average man that might say <unk> i 'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts[MASK] <unk> the privileged position that we occupy <unk> and this is very similar to what i knew when i was a child <unk> when separate but equal[MASK] had existed racial discrimination legally had existed for[MASK] one hundred years from <unk>[MASK] <unk> end of the war between the states the civil war all the way up to <unk>[MASK] <unk> when lyndon johnson got the bills passed for equal rights <unk> but during that time <unk> there were many white people that didn 't think that racial discrimination[MASK] <unk> was okay <unk> but they stayed quiet <unk> because they enjoyed the privileges of[MASK] better jobs[MASK] <unk> unique access to jury duty <unk> better schools <unk> and everything else <unk> and that 's the same thing that exists today because the average man[MASK] really doesn 't care even though they say i 'm against[MASK] discrimination against girls and[MASK] <unk> women they enjoy a privileged position and it 's very difficult to get the[MASK] majority of men who control the university system <unk> [MASK] the majority of men that control the military system <unk> the majority of men that control the governments of the world <unk> [MASK] and the majority of men that control[MASK] the great religions[MASK] <unk> so what is the basic thing that we need to do today <unk> i would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations[MASK] like this one and where you come from [MASK] europe and so forth who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act need to take the[MASK] responsibility on yourselves[MASK] to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and[MASK] and women all over the world <unk> the average woman in egypt doesn 't have much to say about her daughters getting[MASK] genitally mutilated[MASK] and so forth i didn 't even go down to detail about that but i hope that out of this conference <unk> that every woman here will get your husbands to[MASK]
