 <unk> i 've been a critical care emt for the past seven years in suffolk county new york <unk> i 've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to hurricane sandy [MASK] if you are like most people death might be one of your greatest fears <unk> some of us will see it coming <unk> some of us won[MASK] <unk> medical term called impending doom it[MASK] 's almost a symptom [MASK] as a medical provider i 'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says i 'm going to die today [MASK] we are trained to reevaluate the patient 's condition <unk> [MASK] throughout my career <unk> i have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes[MASK] <unk> left to live[MASK] and there was nothing i could do for them with this i was faced with a dilemma do i tell the dying[MASK] that they are about to face death or do i lie to them to comfort them [MASK] early in my career <unk> i faced this dilemma by simply lying <unk> i was afraid <unk> [MASK] i was afraid if i told them the truth <unk> that they would die in terror in fear <unk> just grasping for those last moments of life [MASK] that all changed with one incident[MASK] five years ago i responded to a motorcycle accident the rider had suffered critical critical injuries <unk> [MASK] as i assessed him <unk> i realized that there was nothing that could be done for him [MASK] and like so many other cases <unk> he looked me in the eye and asked that question am i going to die [MASK] in that moment <unk> i decided to do something different <unk> i decided to tell him the truth[MASK] <unk> i decided to tell him that he was going to die[MASK] and that there was nothing i could do for him [MASK] his reaction shocked me to this day <unk> [MASK] he simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face he was not met with that terror or fear that i thought he would be [MASK] he simply laid there and as i looked into his eyes i saw inner peace and acceptance[MASK] <unk> from that moment forward i decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies [MASK] having responded to many cases since then where patients were[MASK] in their last moments and there was nothing i could do for them in almost every case they have all had the same reaction to the truth of inner peace and acceptance[MASK] <unk> in fact there are three patterns i have observed in all these cases the first pattern[MASK] always kind of shocked me <unk> regardless of religious belief[MASK] or cultural background there 's a need for forgiveness <unk> whether they call it sin[MASK] or they simply say they have a regret their guilt is universal <unk> [MASK] i had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack as i prepared myself and[MASK] <unk> my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest <unk> [MASK] i began to tell the patient of his imminent demise <unk> [MASK] he already knew by my tone of voice and body language <unk> [MASK] as i placed the defibrillator pads on his chest <unk> prepping for what was going to happen [MASK] he looked me in the eye and said i wish i had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time [MASK] faced with imminent death[MASK] <unk> death all he wanted was forgiveness <unk> [MASK] the second pattern i observe is the need for remembrance <unk> [MASK] whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones ' they needed to feel that they would be[MASK] living on there 's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones myself my crew or anyone around <unk> [MASK] countless times <unk> i have had a patient look me[MASK] <unk> eyes and say will you remember me the final pattern i observe[MASK] always touched me the deepest to the soul the dying need to know that their life had meaning [MASK] they need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks [MASK] this came to me[MASK] <unk> early in my career <unk> [MASK] i had responded to a call there was a female in her late <unk> 50s severely pinned within a vehicle <unk> [MASK] she had been <unk> t boned at a high rate of speed <unk> [MASK] critical critical condition <unk> as the fire department worked to remove her from the car i climbed in to begin to render care [MASK] as we talked she had said to me there was so much more i wanted to do with my life she had felt she had not left her mark on this earth[MASK] <unk> as we talked further it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school because of her two children[MASK] had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors <unk> [MASK] it would end up taking forty five minutes to free her from the[MASK] <unk> she perished prior to freeing her <unk> [MASK] i believed what you saw in the movies when you 're in those last moments that it 's strictly terror fear <unk> [MASK] i have come to realize <unk> regardless of the circumstance it 's generally met with peace and acceptance [MASK] that it 's the littlest things the littlest moments the littlest[MASK] things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments[MASK]
