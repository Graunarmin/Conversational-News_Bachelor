 <unk> i 'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust <unk> i think these are so commonplace they 've become clichs of our society <unk> [MASK] <unk> i think there are three one 's a claim <unk> there has been a great decline in trust <unk> very widely believed <unk> the second is[MASK] an aim <unk> we should have more trust <unk> and the third is[MASK] a task <unk> we should rebuild trust <unk> [MASK] i think that the claim <unk> the aim and the task are all misconceived [MASK] so what i 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story[MASK] about a claim[MASK] an aim and a task which i think give one[MASK] quite a lot better purchase on the matter first the claim <unk> why do people think trust has declined <unk> [MASK] and if i really think about it on the basis of my own evidence <unk> i don 't know the answer <unk> i 'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown[MASK] <unk> in others <unk> i don 't have an overview [MASK] but of course <unk> i can look at the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined [MASK] when you actually look at opinion polls across time there[MASK] 's not much evidence for that that 's to say the people who were mistrusted twenty years ago principally journalists and[MASK] <unk> politicians are still mistrusted [MASK] and the people who were highly trusted twenty years ago are still rather highly trusted judges nurses <unk> the rest of us are in between[MASK] and by the way <unk> the average person in the street is almost exactly midway <unk> but is that good evidence what opinion polls[MASK] <unk> what else can they record so they 're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions <unk> do you trust politicians do you trust teachers <unk> [MASK] now if somebody said to you do you trust greengrocers do you trust fishmongers do you trust elementary school teachers you would probably begin[MASK] <unk> and that would be a perfectly sensible response and[MASK] you might say <unk> when you understood[MASK] the answer to that well [MASK] i trust some of them but not others that 's a perfectly rational thing [MASK] in short in our real lives we seek to place trust in a differentiated way <unk> we don 't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type[MASK] <unk> of official or office holder or[MASK] type of person is going to be uniform <unk> [MASK] i might for example say that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know to teach the reception class to read [MASK] but in no way to drive the school minibus[MASK] <unk> i might after all know that she[MASK] <unk> keep a conversation going but not but perhaps not to keep a secret simple so if we 've got those[MASK] evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated <unk> why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust[MASK] <unk> more abstractly <unk> [MASK] i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust <unk> [MASK] secondly <unk> what about the aim <unk> the aim is to have more trust <unk> well frankly i think that 's a stupid aim it[MASK] 's not what i would aim at i would aim[MASK] <unk> aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy in fact i aim positively[MASK] to try not to trust the untrustworthy[MASK] <unk> and i think of those people who for example <unk> placed their savings with the very aptly named[MASK] <unk> who then made off with them <unk> [MASK] and i think of them and i think well <unk> yes too much trust more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life <unk> [MASK] intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim <unk> [MASK] well once one says that one says yeah <unk> okay that means that what matters in the first place is[MASK] <unk> judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things are they competent [MASK] are they honest are they reliable [MASK] and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters and reliable and honest we 'll have a pretty good reason to trust them because they 'll be trustworthy [MASK] but if on the other hand they 're unreliable we might not[MASK] <unk> i have friends who are competent and honest but i would not trust them to post a letter because they 're forgetful[MASK] <unk> i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things[MASK] <unk> but i realize that they overestimate their own competence and i 'm very glad to say i don 't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest[MASK] but that 's what we 're looking for trustworthiness before trust trust is the response trustworthiness is what we have to judge and of course it 's difficult [MASK] across the last few decades we 've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on[MASK] that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness[MASK] <unk> a lot of these systems have the converse effect they don 't work as they 're supposed to i remember i was[MASK] talking with a midwife who said well you see the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby [MASK] and all over our public life our institutional life we find that[MASK] <unk> that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and[MASK] and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite it is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks <unk> like midwives [MASK] from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes as we say you can all give your own examples there[MASK] so so much for the aim <unk> [MASK] <unk> i think is more trustworthiness and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people [MASK] and if we are trying to judge whether other people or <unk>[MASK] <unk> office holders or politicians are trustworthy it 's not easy <unk> it is judgment and simple reaction attitudes don 't do[MASK] rebuilding trust <unk> i think also gets things backwards it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust <unk> [MASK] well <unk> we can do that for ourselves we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness we can do it two people together trying to improve trust [MASK] but trust in the end [MASK] is distinctive because it 's given by other people you can 't rebuild what[MASK] other people give you you have to give them the basis for giving[MASK] you their trust <unk> [MASK] so you have to i think be trustworthy and that of course is because you can 't fool all of the people all of the time <unk> [MASK] usually <unk> [MASK] but you also have to provide[MASK] usable evidence that you are trustworthy how to do it well every[MASK] <unk> day all over the place it 's being done by ordinary people by officials by institutions quite effectively <unk> [MASK] let me give you a simple commercial example <unk> [MASK] the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back [MASK] and they don 't ask any questions they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color i wanted that 's super <unk> i trust them because they have made[MASK] <unk> vulnerable to me [MASK] i think there 's a big lesson in that if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party <unk> [MASK] then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying <unk> [MASK] so in the end i think what we are aiming for is not[MASK] very difficult to discern <unk> it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge[MASK] when and how the other person is trustworthy <unk> so[MASK] the moral of all this is we need to think much less about trust <unk> let alone about[MASK] attitudes of trust detected or mis detected by opinion polls much more about being trustworthy and how you give people adequate <unk> useful[MASK] and simple evidence that[MASK]
