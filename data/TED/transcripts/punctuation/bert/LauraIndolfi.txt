 <unk> by raising your hand how many of you know at least one person on the screen wow[MASK] it 's almost a full house it 's true <unk> they are very famous in their fields and[MASK] do you know what all of them have in common [MASK] they all died of pancreatic cancer <unk> [MASK] however although it 's very very sad this news it 's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be[MASK] it 's become the third cause of cancer deaths and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years <unk> [MASK] that 's a very tiny number <unk> especially if you compare it with breast cancer[MASK] <unk> rate is almost ninety percent <unk> [MASK] so it doesn 't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence [MASK] what 's shocking though is that in the last forty years <unk> this number hasn 't changed a bit while much more progress has been made with other types[MASK] <unk> so how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective [MASK] as a biomedical entrepreneur i like to work on problems that seem impossible <unk> understanding their limitations and trying to find new innovative solutions that can change their outcome [MASK] the first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly <unk> literally it 's depicted in orange on the screen <unk> [MASK] but you can barely see it until i remove all[MASK] the other organs in front [MASK] it 's also surrounded by many other vital organs like the liver the stomach the bile duct [MASK] and the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs is the reason why pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types [MASK] the hard to reach location also prevents the[MASK] <unk> this brings us to the second piece of bad news [MASK] pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels[MASK] why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor <unk> [MASK] let 's think for a second how chemotherapy works the drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the[MASK] until it reaches the tumor site it 's like driving on a highway <unk> trying to reach a destination <unk> [MASK] but what if your destination doesn 't have an exit on the highway you will never get there [MASK] and that 's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer <unk> [MASK] the drugs navigate throughout[MASK] <unk> all of your body <unk> they will reach[MASK] healthy organs resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall <unk> but very little will go to the tumor <unk> [MASK] therefore <unk> the efficacy is very limited [MASK] to me it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole body treatment to target a specific organ <unk> [MASK] however in the last forty years a lot of money <unk> research and effort have gone towards finding new powerful drugs to[MASK] <unk> pancreatic cancer <unk> but nothing has been done in changing the way we deliver them to the patient <unk> [MASK] so after two pieces of bad news <unk> i 'm going to give you good news <unk> hopefully [MASK] with a collaborator at mit and the massachusetts general hospital in boston <unk> we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer by making localized drug delivery a reality <unk> [MASK] we are basically[MASK] parachuting you on top of your destination <unk> avoiding your having to drive all around the highway <unk> [MASK] we have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one [MASK] they are flexible enough that they can be[MASK] folded to fit into the catheter <unk> so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery[MASK] <unk> they are solid enough that once they are positioned on top of the tumor they will act as a cage <unk> they will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs controlling the the metastasis the[MASK] devices are also biodegradable that means that once in the body <unk> they start[MASK] <unk> delivering the drug only locally slowly[MASK] and more effectively than what is done with the current whole body treatment [MASK] in pre clinical study we have demonstrated that this localized approach is able to improve by twelve times the response to treatment <unk> [MASK] so we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it 's needed the most we allow a response that is twelve times more powerful[MASK] <unk> reducing the systemic toxic effect <unk> [MASK] we are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level <unk> we are finalizing the pre clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the fda for approval for clinical trials <unk> [MASK] currently the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer <unk> we are hoping that one day[MASK] <unk> we can reduce their pain extend their life and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease [MASK] by rethinking the way we deliver the drug we don 't only make it more powerful and less toxic <unk> we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions[MASK] for almost all other impossible problems in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
