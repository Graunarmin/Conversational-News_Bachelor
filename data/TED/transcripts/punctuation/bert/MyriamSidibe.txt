 <unk> imagine that a plane is about to crash with two hundred and fifty children and babies and if you knew how to stop that would you [MASK] now imagine[MASK] that sixty planes full of babies under five[MASK] <unk> crash every single day <unk> [MASK] that 's the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday <unk> [MASK] six point six million children never make it to their fifth birthday <unk> [MASK] most of these deaths are preventable <unk> and that doesn 't just make me sad it makes me angry[MASK] <unk> makes me determined <unk> diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers[MASK] of children under five [MASK] and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn 't some smart new technological innovations it[MASK] 's one of the world 's oldest inventions a[MASK] bar of soap <unk> [MASK] washing hands[MASK] <unk> a habit we all take for granted can reduce diarrhea by half can reduce respiratory infections by one third [MASK] handwashing with soap[MASK] can have an impact on reducing flu [MASK] trachoma <unk> [MASK] sars <unk> and most recently in the case of cholera and ebola outbreak one of the key interventions[MASK] is handwashing with soap <unk> handwashing with soap keeps kids in school[MASK] it stops babies from dying handwashing with soap is one of the most <unk>[MASK] ways of saving children 's lives it can save over six hundred thousand children every year that 's the equivalent[MASK] of stopping ten jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day <unk> i think you 'll agree with me[MASK] <unk> that 's a pretty useful public health intervention <unk> [MASK] so now just take a minute <unk> i think you need to get to know the person next to you why don 't you just shake their hands <unk> [MASK] please shake their hands all[MASK] right get to know each other they look really pretty all right <unk> [MASK] so what if i told you[MASK] <unk> that the person whose hands you just shook[MASK] actually didn 't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet [MASK] they don 't look so pretty anymore right <unk> pretty yucky you would agree with me <unk> [MASK] well <unk> statistics are actually showing that four people out of five[MASK] don 't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet globally <unk> [MASK] and the same way we don 't do it when we 've got fancy toilets <unk> running water <unk> and soap available it 's the[MASK] <unk> same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high [MASK] what is it is there no soap <unk> [MASK] actually soap is available [MASK] in ninety percent of households in india ninety four percent of households in kenya you will find soap <unk> [MASK] even in countries where soap[MASK] <unk> we are at fifty percent [MASK] so why is it why aren 't people washing their hands [MASK] why is it that mayank [MASK] this young boy that i met in india <unk> isn 't washing his hands <unk> well [MASK] in mayank 's family <unk> soap is used for bathing soap is used for laundry soap is used for washing dishes [MASK] his parents think sometimes it 's a precious commodity so they 'll keep it in a cupboard[MASK] they 'll keep it away from him so he doesn 't waste it <unk> on average in mayank 's family <unk> they will use soap for washing hands once a day[MASK] at the very best and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap <unk> what 's the result of that children pick up disease[MASK] in the place that 's supposed to love them and protect them the most in their homes[MASK] <unk> think about where you learned to wash your hands <unk> did you learn to wash your hands at home <unk> did you learn to wash your hands in school <unk> [MASK] i think behavioral scientists will tell you that it 's very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life <unk> [MASK] however we all[MASK] <unk> and local cultural norms are something that[MASK] shape how we change our behavior <unk> and this is where the private sector comes in every second[MASK] in asia and africa[MASK] one hundred and eleven mothers will buy this bar to protect their family <unk> many women in india will tell you they learned all about hygiene [MASK] <unk> from this bar of soap from lifebuoy brand iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good[MASK] in the places where they sell their products it 's that belief <unk> plus the scale of unilever that allows us to keep[MASK] talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers [MASK] big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn [MASK] think about it[MASK] marketeers[MASK] spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other <unk> [MASK] and actually they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages just for a minute imagine[MASK] when they put all their forces behind a message as[MASK] <unk> handwashing with soap[MASK] the profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world <unk> but it 's been happening for centuries the <unk> lifebuoy brand was launched in <unk>[MASK] in victorian england[MASK] to actually combat cholera last week <unk> i was in ghana[MASK] with the minister of health <unk> because if you don 't know there 's a cholera outbreak in ghana at the moment a hundred and eighteen years[MASK] <unk> the solution is exactly the same it 's about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap [MASK] and that they 're using it because that 's the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading <unk> [MASK] i think[MASK] this drive for profit is extremely powerful sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity[MASK] or government government is doing what they can [MASK] <unk> such as cholera or ebola at the moment <unk> but with competing priorities the budget is not always there [MASK] and when you think about this [MASK] you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit it requires sustained funding[MASK] to refine this behavior [MASK] <unk> in short those[MASK] that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap <unk> we have friends[MASK] like usaid [MASK] the global public private partnership for handwashing with soap <unk> london school of hygiene and tropical medicine <unk> plan wateraid that all believe[MASK] for a <unk>[MASK] partnership <unk> win for the public sector because we help them reach their[MASK] <unk> targets <unk> win[MASK] for the private sector because we build new generations of future handwashers and most importantly <unk> win for the most vulnerable [MASK] on october fifteen we will celebrate global handwashing day schools communities our friends in the public sector[MASK] and our friends in the private sector yes on that day even our competitors we all join hands[MASK] <unk> hands to celebrate the world 's most important public health intervention [MASK] what 's required and again where the private sector can make a huge difference is coming up with this big creative thinking[MASK] that drives advocacy if you take our help a child reach five campaign <unk> we 've created great[MASK] <unk> great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person[MASK] in a way that can relate to them [MASK] we 've had over thirty million views most of these discussions are still happening online i urge you to take five minutes and look at those films [MASK] i come from mali one of the world 's poorest countries <unk> i grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice[MASK] <unk> i trained in europe 's premier school of public health <unk> i think i 'm probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health <unk> [MASK] and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap [MASK] nine years ago <unk> i decided[MASK] <unk> successful public health career in the making [MASK] that i could make the biggest impact coming [MASK] selling and promoting the world 's best invention in public health soap <unk> we run today the world 's largest handwashing program[MASK] by any public health standards <unk> we 've reached over one hundred and eighty three million people[MASK] in sixteen countries my team and i have the ambition to reach one billion by[MASK] over the last four years business[MASK] has grown double digits <unk> whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased <unk> [MASK] it may be uncomfortable for some to hear business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence[MASK] but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more without it[MASK] <unk> and without talking about it we cannot achieve the change that we need [MASK] last week my team and i spent time[MASK] visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing [MASK] the death of a newborn <unk> i 'm a mom i can 't imagine anything more powerful[MASK] and more painful [MASK] this one is from myanmar[MASK] <unk> had the most beautiful smile the smile i think that life gives you when you 've had[MASK] a second chance her son myo is her second one she had[MASK] a daughter who passed away at three weeks <unk> [MASK] and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life <unk> [MASK] and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant[MASK] <unk> and that if soap is used before touching the babies we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers <unk> [MASK] and that 's what inspires me inspires me to continue in this mission to know that i can equip her[MASK] with what 's needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world nurturing her newborn <unk> [MASK] <unk> and next time you think of a gift[MASK] for a new mom and her family don 't look far buy her soap it 's the most beautiful invention in public health <unk> [MASK] i hope you will join us[MASK] and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like myo reach their fifth birthday <unk> thank you[MASK]
