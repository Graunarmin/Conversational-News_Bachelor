 <unk> probably don 't know me but i am one of those 01 percenters that you hear about and read about and i am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat[MASK] <unk> and tonight what i would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats to my people because it feels like it 's time for us all[MASK] to have a chat [MASK] like most plutocrats <unk> i too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist i have founded cofounded or funded[MASK] over thirty companies across a range of industries <unk> i was the first non family investor in amazon com [MASK] i cofounded a company called aquantive[MASK] that we sold to microsoft[MASK] <unk> for six point four billion dollars my friends and i we own a bank <unk> i tell you this [MASK] unbelievable right <unk> i tell you this[MASK] to show[MASK] that my life is like most plutocrats <unk> i have a broad[MASK] perspective on capitalism and business <unk> and i have been rewarded obscenely[MASK] for that[MASK] with a life that[MASK] <unk> most of you all can 't even imagine multiple homes a yacht my own plane <unk> etc etc etc [MASK] but let 's be honest i am not the smartest person you 've ever met i am certainly not the hardest working <unk> [MASK] i was a mediocre student i 'm not technical at all i can 't write a word[MASK] <unk> my success is the consequence of spectacular luck of birth of circumstance[MASK] and of timing[MASK] <unk> but i am actually pretty good at a couple of things one <unk> i have an unusually high tolerance for risk [MASK] and the other is i have a good sense a good intuition about what will happen in the future and i think that that intuition about the future[MASK] essence[MASK] of good entrepreneurship so what do i see in our future today you ask <unk> i see pitchforks as in[MASK] angry mobs with pitchforks <unk> because while people like us plutocrats[MASK] <unk> fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind in one thousand nine hundred and eighty <unk> the top one percent of americans shared about eight percent of national [ income ] [MASK] while the bottom fifty percent of americans shared eighteen percent [MASK] thirty years later today the top one percent shares over twenty percent of national[MASK] <unk> the bottom fifty percent of americans share twelve or thirteen [MASK] if the trend continues <unk> [MASK] the top one percent will share over thirty percent of national [ income ] in another thirty years <unk> [MASK] while the bottom fifty percent of americans will share just six [MASK] you see the problem isn 't that we have some inequality [MASK] some inequality is necessary[MASK] for a[MASK] <unk> is at historic highs today[MASK] and it 's getting worse every day <unk> and if wealth power <unk> and income continue to concentrate[MASK] at the very tippy top our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a[MASK] before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks <unk> so i have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires[MASK] and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world <unk> wake up <unk> wake up <unk> it cannot last [MASK] because if we do not do something to fix the glaring[MASK] economic inequities in our society the pitchforks will come[MASK] <unk> for us [MASK] for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality <unk> it has never happened <unk> there are no examples [MASK] you show me a highly unequal society and i will show you a police state or an uprising <unk> [MASK] the pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this[MASK] <unk> it 's not a matter of if it 's when and it will be terrible when they come[MASK] for everyone but particularly[MASK] for people like us plutocrats <unk> i know i must sound like some liberal do gooder i[MASK] 'm not i 'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong[MASK] what i am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately[MASK] rising inequality doesn 't just increase our risks from pitchforks <unk> but it 's also terrible[MASK] for business too [MASK] so the model for us rich guys should be henry ford when ford famously introduced the $ five day <unk> which was twice the prevailing wage at the time <unk> [MASK] he didn 't just increase the productivity of his factories[MASK] he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor[MASK] into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made ford intuited[MASK] what we now know is true <unk> that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem[MASK] and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem a feedback[MASK] <unk> loop between customers and businesses raising wages[MASK] increases demand which increases hiring <unk> which in turn increases wages[MASK] and demand and profits <unk> and that virtuous cycle of increasing[MASK] prosperity is precisely what is missing from today 's[MASK] economic recovery[MASK] <unk> this is why we need to put behind us the <unk> trickle down policies that so dominate both political parties[MASK] and embrace something i call middle out economics[MASK] middle out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient[MASK] <unk> that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality that they 're not efficient at all but are effective[MASK] if well managed this <unk>[MASK] <unk> allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work[MASK] by [ efficiently ] allocating existing resources it works[MASK] creating new solutions to human problems the genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary[MASK] <unk> system <unk> it rewards people for solving other people 's problems[MASK] <unk> the difference between a poor society[MASK] and a rich society obviously is[MASK] the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens the sum of the solutions[MASK] that we have in our society really is our prosperity and this explains why companies like google and amazon and microsoft and apple and the entrepreneurs[MASK] <unk> who created those companies have contributed so much[MASK] to our nation 's prosperity [MASK] this <unk> 21st century[MASK] perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems <unk>[MASK] <unk> how many problem solvers diverse able problem solvers we have and thus how many of our fellow citizens[MASK] actively participate <unk> both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions and as customers who consume them <unk> [MASK] but this maximizing participation thing[MASK] doesn 't happen by accident it doesn 't happen by itself it[MASK] <unk> requires effort and investment which is why[MASK] all highly prosperous capitalist democracies[MASK] are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure[MASK] that they depend on <unk> we plutocrats[MASK] need to get this[MASK] <unk> economics thing behind us this idea that the better we do the better everyone else will do it 's not true [MASK] how could it be [MASK] i earn one thousand times the median wage <unk> but i do not buy one thousand times as much stuff do i i[MASK] actually bought two pairs of these pants <unk> what my partner mike calls my manager pants[MASK] <unk> i could have bought two thousand pairs but what would i do with them [MASK] laughter how many haircuts can i get how often can i go out to dinner [MASK] no matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get we can never drive[MASK] a great national economy only a thriving middle class can do that [MASK] there 's nothing to be done my plutocrat friends[MASK] might say [MASK] henry ford was in a different time <unk> maybe we can 't do some things <unk> maybe we can do some things <unk> [MASK] june nineteen <unk> two thousand and thirteen <unk> bloomberg published[MASK] an article i wrote called the capitalists case for a[MASK] <unk> the good people at forbes magazine <unk> among my biggest admirers called it nick hanauer 's <unk>[MASK] and yet just three hundred and fifty days after that article was published seattle 's mayor ed murray[MASK] signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in seattle to fifteen dollars an hour more than double what the prevailing federal[MASK] <unk> seven point two five rate is [MASK] how did this happen reasonable people might ask <unk> it happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source[MASK] of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies <unk> we reminded them that when workers have more money <unk> businesses have more[MASK] <unk> and need more employees <unk> [MASK] we reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage [MASK] taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need <unk> [MASK] we reminded them that low wage workers[MASK] make terrible taxpayers and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses all businesses benefit[MASK] <unk> yet all can compete [MASK] now the orthodox reaction of course is raising the minimum wage costs jobs right <unk> [MASK] your politician 's always echoing that trickle down idea by saying things like well[MASK] if you raise the price of employment guess what happens you get less of it [MASK] are you sure[MASK] <unk> because there 's some contravening evidence since one thousand nine hundred and eighty the[MASK] wages of ceos in our country have gone from about thirty times the median wage to five hundred times [MASK] that 's raising the price of employment [MASK] and yet to my knowledge <unk> [MASK] i have never seen a company outsource its ceo 's job automate[MASK] <unk> export the job to china [MASK] in fact we appear to be employing more ceos and senior managers than ever before so too for technology workers[MASK] and financial services workers who earn multiples of the of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them so clearly[MASK] you can raise the price of employment[MASK] and get more of it i know that most people think that[MASK] <unk> minimum wage is this insane <unk> risky economic experiment <unk> we disagree <unk> we believe that the $ fifteen minimum wage in seattle[MASK] is actually the continuation of a logical economic policy it is allowing our city to kick your city 's ass <unk> [MASK] <unk> washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation <unk> we pay all workers $ nine <unk>[MASK] <unk> which is almost thirty percent more than the federal minimum of seven point two five [MASK] but crucially four hundred and twenty seven percent more than the federal tipped minimum of two point one[MASK] three if trickle down thinkers were right <unk> then washington state should have massive unemployment seattle should be sliding into the ocean <unk> and yet[MASK] seattle is the fastest growing big city in the country <unk> washington state[MASK] is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation [MASK] the restaurant business in seattle booming [MASK] why <unk> because the fundamental law of capitalism is when workers have more money businesses have more customers[MASK] and need more workers [MASK] when restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants [MASK] that 's not bad for the restaurant business <unk> that 's good for it despite what some restaurateurs[MASK] may tell you is it more complicated than i 'm making[MASK] <unk> a lot of dynamics at play <unk> but can we please stop insisting[MASK] that if low wage workers earn a little bit more unemployment will skyrocket and the economy will collapse <unk> there is no evidence for it [MASK] the most insidious thing about trickle down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer everyone is better off [MASK] it is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer <unk> that will be bad for the economy this[MASK] <unk> nonsense so can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me[MASK] and my plutocrat friends[MASK] made our country <unk> we plutocrats know even if we don 't like to admit it in public that if we had been born somewhere else not[MASK] <unk> here in the united states we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit it[MASK] 's not that they don 't have good entrepreneurs in other places <unk> even very very poor places it 's just that that 's all that those entrepreneurs ' customers can afford [MASK] so here 's an idea for a new kind[MASK] of economics a new kind of politics[MASK] <unk> new capitalism let 's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives <unk> but also[MASK] that the more people we include both as entrepreneurs and as customers the better it works [MASK] let 's by all means shrink the size of government [MASK] but not by slashing the poverty programs <unk> but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually don 't need those programs <unk> [MASK] let 's invest enough in the middle[MASK] <unk> class[MASK] to make our economy fairer[MASK] and more inclusive and by fairer more truly competitive <unk> and by more truly competitive more able to generate the solutions[MASK] to human problems that are the true drivers of growth[MASK] and prosperity capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for[MASK] prosperity in human societies if it is well managed <unk> [MASK] but capitalism because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems <unk> tends towards inexorably inequality <unk> concentration and collapse <unk> [MASK] the work of democracies[MASK] <unk> is to maximize[MASK] the inclusion of the many[MASK] in order to create prosperity not to enable the few to accumulate money <unk> government[MASK] does create prosperity and growth by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive <unk> [MASK] balancing the power of capitalists like me[MASK] and workers[MASK] isn 't bad for capitalism it[MASK] <unk> essential to it programs like a reasonable minimum wage [MASK] affordable healthcare paid sick leave and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure[MASK] necessary for the middle class like education r and d <unk> these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace[MASK] to drive growth <unk> because no one benefits from[MASK] <unk> it like us [MASK] many economists would have you believe that their field is an objective science <unk> i disagree <unk> [MASK] and i think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status[MASK] and power[MASK] <unk> which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories[MASK] to tell everyone else about why our relative[MASK] relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone [MASK] like we are indispensable the job creators <unk> and you are not like[MASK] <unk> tax cuts for us create growth <unk> but investments in you[MASK] will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country that we matter that you don 't [MASK] for thousands of years these stories were called divine right <unk> today we have[MASK] <unk> the united states of america made us not the other way around [MASK] that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies not a consequence of it[MASK] <unk> and we should never forget[MASK] that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit [MASK] fellow plutocrats[MASK] i think it may be time for us to recommit to our country [MASK] to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective <unk> a capitalism that will ensure[MASK] that america 's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world [MASK] let 's secure the future for ourselves our children and their children [MASK] or alternatively[MASK] <unk> we could do nothing hide in our gated communities and[MASK] private schools <unk> enjoy our planes and yachts and wait for the pitchforks[MASK]
