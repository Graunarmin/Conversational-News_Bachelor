much in common [MASK] for nothing in my life 's path[MASK] would have predicted that i 'd be standing here as the first[MASK] <unk> first lady of the united states of america there is nothing in my story that would land me here[MASK] <unk> wasn 't raised with wealth or resources[MASK] or any social standing to speak of [MASK] i was raised on the south side of chicago that 's the real part of chicago <unk> [MASK] and i was the product of a working class community my father was a city worker[MASK] <unk> all of his life and my mother was a stay at home mom <unk> and she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother[MASK] <unk> neither of them attended university [MASK] my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life <unk> but even as it got harder for him to walk[MASK] and get dressed in the morning i saw him struggle more and more[MASK] my father never complained about his struggle he was grateful for what he had he just woke[MASK] <unk> up a little earlier[MASK] and worked a little harder [MASK] and my brother and i were raised with all that you really need [MASK] love strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work [MASK] that there was nothing that we could not do [MASK] i am an example of what 's possible[MASK] when girls from the[MASK] <unk> of their lives are loved and nurtured[MASK] by the people around them[MASK] <unk> i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life[MASK] <unk> grandmothers <unk> teachers aunts cousins <unk> neighbors who taught me about[MASK] quiet strength and dignity <unk> and my[MASK] <unk> the most important role model in my life who lives with us at the white house[MASK] and helps to care for our two little daughters <unk> malia and sasha[MASK] <unk> she 's an active presence in their lives as well as mine and is instilling in them[MASK] the same values that she taught me and my brother <unk> [MASK] things like compassion and integrity <unk> and confidence <unk> and perseverance[MASK] all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love[MASK] <unk> that only a grandmother can give <unk> i was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged[MASK] by some strong male role models as well <unk> [MASK] including my father my brother <unk> uncles and grandfathers <unk> the men in my life life taught me some important things as well <unk> [MASK] they taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between[MASK] men and women they taught me about what a strong marriage feels like <unk> that it 's built on faith and commitment[MASK] and an admiration for each other 's unique gifts <unk> they taught me about[MASK] what it means to[MASK] be a father and to raise a family and not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help[MASK] raise[MASK] <unk> kids in the broader community and these were the same qualities that i looked for[MASK] in my own husband <unk> barack obama <unk> [MASK] and when we first met <unk> one of the things that i remember is that he took me out on a date[MASK] and his date was to[MASK] go with him to a community[MASK] <unk> but when we met barack was a community organizer he worked <unk> helping people to find jobs and[MASK] to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods [MASK] as he talked to the residents in that community center he talked about two concepts he talked about the world as it is and[MASK] <unk> the world as it should be [MASK] and i talked about this throughout the entire campaign what he said that all too often is that we accept[MASK] the distance between those two ideas <unk> [MASK] and sometimes we settle for the world as it is even when it doesn 't reflect our values and aspirations <unk> [MASK] but barack reminded us on that day all of us in that room that we all know[MASK] what our world should look like[MASK] <unk> we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like <unk> we all know [MASK] and he urged the people in that meeting in that community to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas [MASK] to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should[MASK] <unk> one and the same <unk> and i think about that today because i am[MASK] reminded and convinced that all of you in this school[MASK] are very important parts of closing that gap you are the women who will build the world as it should be [MASK] you 're going to write the next chapter in history not just for yourselves <unk> but for your generation[MASK] and generations to come <unk> and that 's why[MASK] <unk> why getting a good education is so important that 's why all of this that you 're going through[MASK] the ups and the downs <unk> the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don 't[MASK] why it 's so important because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong[MASK] as the health of their women[MASK] and that 's important to keep in mind[MASK] of that health includes an outstanding education <unk> the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one[MASK] is often the presence of an empowered woman[MASK] or women at the center of that family <unk> the difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often[MASK] <unk> the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society <unk> [MASK] the difference between a languishing nation[MASK] and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls
