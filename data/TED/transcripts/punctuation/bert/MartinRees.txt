 <unk> have something in common their interests in business lie on or near the earth 's surface <unk> the odd one out is an[MASK] <unk> my talk will be in two parts i 'll talk first as an astronomer <unk> and then as a worried member of the human race <unk> [MASK] but let 's start off[MASK] by remembering that darwin showed how we 're the outcome of four billion years of evolution <unk> [MASK] and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin 's simple beginning to set our earth in a cosmic context[MASK] <unk> and let me just run through a few slides [MASK] this was the impact that happened last week on a comet[MASK] <unk> if they 'd sent a nuke <unk> it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday so that 's another project for nasa that 's[MASK] mars from the european mars express[MASK] <unk> this artist 's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan <unk> saturn 's giant moon [MASK] it landed on the surface <unk> this is pictures taken on the way down that looks like a coastline it is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus one hundred and seventy degrees centigrade [MASK] if we go beyond our solar system[MASK] <unk> twinkly points of light each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it [MASK] and we can see places where stars are forming like the eagle nebula <unk> [MASK] we see stars dying in six billion years the sun will look like that [MASK] and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that [MASK] on a still bigger[MASK] <unk> we see entire galaxies of stars we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled [MASK] and to the cosmologist these galaxies are just the atoms as it were of the large scale universe [MASK] this picture shows a patch of sky[MASK] so small that it would take about one hundred patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky <unk> through a small telescope this would look quite blank[MASK] <unk> but you see here hundreds of of little faint smudges <unk> [MASK] each is a galaxy fully like ours or andromeda [MASK] which looks so small and faint because its light has taken ten billion light years to get to us [MASK] the stars in those galaxies probably don 't have[MASK] planets around them there 's scant chance of life there that 's because there 's been no time for the[MASK] nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and[MASK] <unk> of life we believe that all of this emerged from a big bang[MASK] a hot dense state [MASK] so how did that amorphous big bang turn into our complex cosmos i 'm going to show you a movie simulation[MASK] sixteen powers of ten faster than real time which shows a patch[MASK] <unk> of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out <unk> but you see [MASK] as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small <unk> dense irregularities and structures develop and we 'll end up after thirteen billion years with something looking rather like our[MASK] own universe <unk> [MASK] and we compare simulated universes like that i 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk with what we[MASK] <unk> actually see in the sky <unk> well <unk> we can trace things back[MASK] to the[MASK] earlier stages of the big bang but we still don 't know what banged and why it banged that 's a challenge for 21st century science [MASK] if my research group had a logo it would be this picture here[MASK] <unk> an ouroboros where you see the micro world on the left[MASK] the world of the quantum[MASK] and on the right the large scale universe of[MASK] planets stars and galaxies [MASK] we know our universes are united though links between left and right the everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules stars[MASK] are fueled by how the[MASK] <unk> nuclei in those atoms react together and as we 've learned in the last few years galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter <unk> [MASK] particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei <unk> but[MASK] we 'd like to know[MASK] the synthesis symbolized at the very top the micro world of the quantum is understood [MASK] on the right hand side gravity holds sway einstein explained that <unk> but the unfinished business for[MASK] <unk> science is to link together[MASK] cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were gastronomically at the top of that picture [MASK] and until we have that synthesis we won 't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom [MASK] quantum effects could shake everything [MASK] and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small which we don 't[MASK] <unk> yet have [MASK] one idea incidentally and i had this hazard sign to say i 'm going to speculate from now on[MASK] is that our big bang was not the only one one idea is that[MASK] our three dimensional universe may be embedded in a high dimensional space just as you can imagine[MASK] on these sheets of[MASK] <unk> you can imagine ants on one of them thinking it 's a two dimensional universe not being aware of another population of ants on the other [MASK] so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours <unk> [MASK] but we 're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension <unk> and we 're imprisoned in our three <unk> [MASK] and so[MASK] we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we 've normally called our universe the aftermath of our big bang <unk> and here 's another picture bottom right depicts our universe[MASK] <unk> is not beyond that but even that is just one bubble as it were in some vaster reality [MASK] many people suspect that just as we 've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems one galaxy to many galaxies we have to go to[MASK] many big bangs from one big bang perhaps these many big bangs displaying an immense variety of properties <unk> well <unk> let 's go back to this picture[MASK] <unk> one challenge symbolized at the top <unk> but there 's another challenge to science[MASK] symbolized at the bottom you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small <unk> but we want to understand the very complex and the most complex things are ourselves [MASK] midway between atoms and stars we depend on stars to make the atoms we 're made of we depend on[MASK] chemistry[MASK] to determine our complex structure[MASK] <unk> clearly have to be large compared to atoms [MASK] to have layer upon layer of complex structure <unk> we clearly have to be small <unk> compared to stars and planets otherwise we 'd be crushed by gravity and in fact we are midway <unk> [MASK] it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is fifty kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here[MASK] the science[MASK] of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right <unk> [MASK] and it 's this science which is not only[MASK] enlightening our understanding of the biological world but also transforming our world faster than ever <unk> [MASK] <unk> more than that it 's engendering new kinds of change and i now move on to the second part of my talk and[MASK] the book our final century was mentioned <unk> if i was not[MASK] a <unk> self effacing brit i would mention the book myself <unk> and i would add that it 's available in paperback [MASK] and in america it was called our[MASK] <unk> in this century <unk> not only has science changed the world faster than ever <unk> but in new and different ways <unk> [MASK] targeted drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence [MASK] perhaps even implants into our brains may change human beings themselves and human beings their physique and character has not changed for thousands of years it may change this century <unk> [MASK] it 's new in our history[MASK] and the human impact on the global environment greenhouse warming mass extinctions and so forth is unprecedented too and so this makes[MASK] this coming century a challenge [MASK] bio and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects while nonetheless reducing pressure on energy and resources <unk> [MASK] but they will have a dark side[MASK] <unk> in our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic [MASK] or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind on disaster [MASK] indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure[MASK] error rather than terror and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be[MASK] <unk> of global consequence in fact some years ago <unk> bill joy wrote an article[MASK] expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over etc i don 't go along with all that but it 's interesting that he had a simple solution it was what he called <unk>[MASK] <unk> he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits now that 's absurdly naive for two reasons first[MASK] <unk> any scientific discovery[MASK] has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones <unk> [MASK] and also when a scientist makes a discovery he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be [MASK] and so what this means is that[MASK] we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of[MASK] <unk> we have to accept that there will be hazards <unk> and i think we have to[MASK] go back to what happened in the[MASK] post war era post world war ii when the nuclear scientists who 'd been involved in making the atomic bomb in many cases were concerned[MASK] that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers and they were inspired not by the young einstein [MASK] <unk> who did the great[MASK] work in relativity but by the old einstein the icon[MASK] of poster and t shirt who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws he was premature but he was a moral compass an inspiration to scientists who were[MASK] concerned with arms control and perhaps the greatest living person is someone i 'm privileged to know joe rothblatt <unk> equally untidy office there as you can see[MASK] and he founded the pugwash movement he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell <unk> and he[MASK] sets an example of the concerned scientist <unk> and i think[MASK] to harness science optimally to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed <unk> we need <unk> latter day counterparts of people like joseph rothblatt <unk> [MASK] we need not not just campaigning[MASK] <unk> physicists but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well <unk> [MASK] and i think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service or company employees subject to commercial pressure [MASK] i wrote my book our final century as a scientist [MASK] just a general scientist but there 's one respect i think in which being a cosmologist offered a[MASK] <unk> special perspective <unk> and that 's that it offers an awareness of the immense future <unk> [MASK] the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture[MASK] outside the american bible belt anyway <unk> but most people even those who are familiar with evolution [MASK] <unk> mindful that even more time lies ahead the sun has been shining for four and a half billion years <unk> but it 'll be another six billion years[MASK] before its fuel runs out on that schematic picture a sort of time lapse picture we 're halfway <unk> and[MASK] it 'll be another six billion before that happens and any remaining life on earth is[MASK] <unk> an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there experiencing the sun 's demise <unk> but any life and intelligence that exists then[MASK] will be as different from us as we are from bacteria <unk> the unfolding of intelligence and complexity[MASK] still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity[MASK] <unk> if you represent the earth 's lifetime by a single year <unk> [MASK] say from january when it was made to december the 21st century would be a quarter of a second[MASK] in june[MASK] a tiny fraction of the year <unk> but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective our century is very very[MASK] <unk> the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet [MASK] as i should have shown this earlier <unk> [MASK] it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria <unk> [MASK] when einstein died <unk>[MASK] one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by herblock in the washington post[MASK] <unk> albert einstein lived here [MASK] and i 'd like to end with a vignette as it were inspired by this image <unk> we 've been familiar for forty years[MASK] with this image the fragile beauty of[MASK] land ocean and clouds <unk> contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints <unk> [MASK] but let 's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos[MASK] from afar not[MASK] <unk> just for forty years <unk> but for the entire four point five billion year history of our earth [MASK] what would they have seen <unk> over nearly all that immense time earth 's appearance would have changed very gradually [MASK] the only abrupt worldwide change would have been[MASK] major asteroid impacts or volcanic[MASK] <unk> apart from those brief traumas nothing happens suddenly <unk> [MASK] the continental landmasses drifted around ice cover waxed and waned successions of new species emerged evolved and became extinct <unk> [MASK] but in just a tiny sliver of the earth 's history [MASK] the last one millionth part a few thousand years <unk> the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before [MASK] this signaled the start of agriculture change has accelerated as human[MASK] <unk> populations rose [MASK] then other things happened even more abruptly <unk> within just fifty years that 's one hundredth of one millionth of the earth 's age[MASK] the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere[MASK] started to rise and ominously fast <unk> the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves the total output from all tv[MASK] and cell phones and radar transmissions <unk> and something else happened[MASK] metallic objects albeit very small ones a few tons at most[MASK] escaped into orbit around the earth some journeyed to the moons and planets a race of advanced extraterrestrials[MASK] watching our solar system from afar[MASK] could confidently predict earth 's final doom in another six billion years <unk> but could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than[MASK] <unk> halfway through the earth 's life [MASK] these human induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed [MASK] if they continued their vigil [MASK] what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years [MASK] will some spasm foreclose[MASK] <unk> or will the biosphere stabilize [MASK] or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases oases a post human life elsewhere <unk> [MASK] the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization but for civilization to survive we 'll need the wisdom of the old einstein[MASK] humane global and farseeing and whatever happens[MASK] in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into[MASK] <unk> remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth far beyond the earth as depicted here <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
