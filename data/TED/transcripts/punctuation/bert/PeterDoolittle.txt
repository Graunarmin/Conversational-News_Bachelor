 <unk> so yesterday i was out in the street in front of this building <unk> and[MASK] i was walking down the sidewalk <unk> [MASK] and i had company several of us and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks <unk> we 're not talking each other <unk> we 're facing forward <unk> we 're moving[MASK] <unk> when the person in front of me[MASK] slows down and[MASK] so i 'm watching him and he slows down and finally he stops <unk> well that wasn 't fast enough for me [MASK] so i put on my turn signal <unk> and i walked around him <unk> and as i walked i looked to see what he was doing <unk> and he was doing this [MASK] he was texting <unk> and he couldn 't text and walk at the same time <unk> now we could approach this from a working memory[MASK] <unk> perspective or from a multitasking perspective we 're going to do working memory today <unk> now working memory[MASK] is that part of our consciousness that we are[MASK] aware of at any given time of day you 're going it right now it 's not something we can turn off <unk> if you turn it off that 's called a coma [MASK] okay so right now you 're doing just fine <unk> [MASK] now working memory has four basic components[MASK] it allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge it allows us to reach back into our long term memory and pull some of that in as we need it <unk> [MASK] mixes it <unk> processes it[MASK] in light of whatever our current goal is <unk> now the current goal isn 't something like i want to be president or the best surfer in the world it 's more mundane i 'd like that cookie[MASK] <unk> i need to figure out how to get into my hotel room <unk> now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that our ability to take[MASK] what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy[MASK] our current goal[MASK] <unk> now working memory capacity has a fairly long history <unk> and it 's associated with a lot of positive effects people with high working memory capacity[MASK] tend to be good storytellers <unk> they tend to solve and do well[MASK] standardized tests[MASK] however important that is they 're able to have high levels of writing ability <unk> they 're also able to reason at high levels so what we 're[MASK] going to do here is play a little bit with some of that so i 'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks and we 're going to take your working memory out for a ride you up for[MASK] <unk> going to give you five words <unk> [MASK] and i just want you to hang on to them don 't write them down just hang on to them five words <unk> while you 're hanging on to them i 'm going to ask you to answer three questions <unk> [MASK] i want to see what happens with those words so here 's the words[MASK] <unk> so good okay what i want you to do is i want you to tell me what the answer is to twenty three times eight just shout it out[MASK] <unk> it 's a neurological test just in case you were wondering [MASK] all right now what i want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the english alphabet backwards[MASK] <unk> you should have started with z [MASK] all right <unk> how many people here are still pretty sure you 've got all five words[MASK] <unk> up with about less than half right which is normal there will be a range some people can hang on to five some people can hang on to ten some will be down to two or three [MASK] what we know is this is really important to the way we function right [MASK] and it 's going to be really important here at ted because you 're going to be exposed to so many different ideas <unk> now[MASK] the problem that we have is that life comes at us and it comes at us very quickly and what we need to do is to take[MASK] <unk> that amorphous[MASK] flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that 's about the size of a pea <unk> [MASK] now don 't get me wrong working memory is awesome [MASK] working memory allows us to[MASK] investigate our current experience as we move forward <unk> it allows us to make sense of the world around us[MASK] <unk> but it does have certain limits <unk> now[MASK] working memory is great for allowing us to communicate we can have a conversation <unk> [MASK] and i can build a narrative around that so i know where we 've been and where we 're going and how to contribute to this conversation it[MASK] allows us to problem solve critical think [MASK] we can be in the middle of a meeting <unk> listen to somebody 's presentation evaluate it <unk> decide whether or not we like it ask follow up questions all of that occurs[MASK] <unk> it also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese[MASK] when what we 're really looking for is red bull and bacon [MASK] gotta make sure we 're getting what we 're looking for now [MASK] a central issue with working memory is that it 's limited it 's limited in capacity limited in duration limited in focus <unk> we tend to remember about[MASK] <unk> it used to be seven <unk> but with functional mris apparently it 's four and we were overachieving <unk> [MASK] now we can remember those four things for about ten to twenty seconds unless we do something with it <unk> [MASK] unless we process it <unk> unless we apply it to something unless we talk to somebody about it <unk> [MASK] when we think about working memory <unk> [MASK] we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us have you ever walked from one room[MASK] to another and then forgotten why you 're there [MASK] you do know the solution to that right <unk> you go back to that original room [MASK] have you ever forgotten your keys you ever forgotten your car you ever forgotten your kids have you[MASK] ever been involved in a conversation <unk> and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting[MASK] so you 're nodding and you 're smiling but you 're really paying attention to this one over here <unk> until you hear that last word go up and you realize [MASK] you 've been asked a question [MASK] and you 're really hoping the answer is no because that 's what you 're about to say <unk> [MASK] all of that talks about working memory what we can do and what we can 't do we need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity and that working[MASK] <unk> memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that we negotiate that through strategies [MASK] so what i want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here and these will be really important because you are now in an information target rich environment for the next several days[MASK] <unk> now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence our life[MASK] <unk> immediately and repeatedly [MASK] we need to process what 's going on the moment it happens not ten minutes later not a week later[MASK] at the moment <unk> so we need to think about well do i agree with him[MASK] <unk> what 's missing what would i like to know [MASK] do i agree with the assumptions <unk> [MASK] how can i apply this in my life [MASK] it 's a way of processing what 's going on so that we can use it later <unk> now we also need to repeat it we need to practice <unk> so we need to think about it here [MASK] in between[MASK] <unk> we want to talk to people about it we 're going to write it down and when you get home <unk> pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time [MASK] practice for some reason became a very negative thing it 's[MASK] very positive [MASK] the next thing is we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively [MASK] oftentimes we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge what we want to do is spin that around we want to take all of our[MASK] <unk> existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful [MASK] we also want to use imagery <unk> we are built for images <unk> we need to take advantage of that [MASK] think about things in images write things down that way [MASK] if you read a book <unk> pull things up i just got through reading the great gatsby and i have a perfect idea of what he looks like[MASK] in my head so my own version the last one[MASK] <unk> is organization and support we are meaning making machines it 's what we do we try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us <unk> [MASK] organization helps <unk> so we need to structure what we 're doing in ways that make sense if we are providing[MASK] knowledge and experience we need to structure that and the last one is support [MASK] we all started as novices everything we do is an approximation of sophistication we should expect it to change over time we have to support[MASK] <unk> that the support may come in asking people questions giving them a sheet of paper that has[MASK] an organizational chart on it or has some[MASK] guiding images <unk> but we need to support it <unk> now the final piece of this the take home message[MASK] from a working memory capacity standpoint is this what we process we learn <unk> if we 're not processing life[MASK]
