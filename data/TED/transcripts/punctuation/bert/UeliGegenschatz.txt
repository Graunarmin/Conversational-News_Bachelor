 <unk> i started[MASK] with paragliding paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider with the possibility to fly cross country distance just with the use of thermals[MASK] to soar also different aerobatic maneuvers are[MASK] <unk> possible with a paraglider <unk> [MASK] from there i started with skydiving in this picture you can see there is a four way skydive <unk> four people flying together and on the left hand side[MASK] it 's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump for the film itself and also for[MASK] the judging from regular relative skydiving[MASK] <unk> skydiving i went on to freeflying freeflying is more the <unk>[MASK] skydiving you can see the skydiver with the red suit <unk> he 's in a <unk> stand up position [MASK] the one with the yellow green suit he 's flying head down and that 's me in the background <unk> carving around the whole formation[MASK] freefall also with the helmet cam to film this jump [MASK] from freeflying i went on to skysurfing skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet you can imagine with this big <unk>[MASK] a skysurfing board there is a lot of force a lot of power of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning we call it[MASK] <unk> from there i went on to wingsuit flying wingsuit flying is a suit <unk> [MASK] that i can make fly <unk> just only with my body if i put some tension on my body <unk> tension on my suit <unk> [MASK] i can make it fly and as you see[MASK] the fall rate is[MASK] much much slower because of the bigger surface with a proper body position i 'm able to really move forward to[MASK] <unk> quite some distance this is a jump i did[MASK] in rio de janeiro you can see the[MASK] copacabana on the left hand side[MASK] from there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving i went on to base jumping base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects[MASK] <unk> earth meaning mountains cliffs it 's for sure for me it 's the ultimate feeling of[MASK] being in free fall with all the visual references <unk> so my goal soon was to[MASK] discover new places that nobody had jumped before <unk> so in summer two thousand i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland[MASK] <unk> two years after this i was the first to base jump from matterhorn a very famous mountain that probably[MASK] everybody knows in here [MASK] two thousand and five i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk and from the jungfrau <unk> three very famous mountains in switzerland the special thing on these[MASK] <unk> i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day[MASK] in two thousand and eight i jumped the eiffel tower in paris [MASK] so with all this[MASK] this knowledge i also[MASK] wanted to to get into stunts <unk> [MASK] so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider[MASK] or here everybody[MASK] everybody was freezing pretty much except me because it was very cold in austria where we did this filming everybody sitting in a basket <unk> [MASK] and i was on top of the balloon <unk> ready to slide down with my[MASK] with my skysurf board <unk> [MASK] or this jump from a moving truck on the[MASK] <unk> highway [MASK] extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step if you really work hard on your skills[MASK] and on your knowledge <unk> of course you need to[MASK] <unk> so i 'm training a lot you need to have the the best possible equipment <unk> and[MASK] probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills mental preparation and all this[MASK] to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly <unk> [MASK] so for two thousand and nine i 'm training hard for my two new projects[MASK] the first one i want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit and i want to set a new record with the longest distance ever flown[MASK] for my second project <unk> i have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before <unk> [MASK] so now [MASK] on the[MASK] <unk> following movie you will see that i 'm much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in english <unk> enjoy <unk> and thank you very much[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> i think we all might have some questions [MASK] question one <unk> so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does because it it looks like it might ueli gegenschatz pretty much i believe this is probably the closest[MASK] the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly[MASK] <unk> this but how do you land ue parachute we have to open a parachute just seconds before <unk> i would say impact it 's[MASK] not possible to land a wingsuit yet jc yet <unk> but people are trying are you among those you 're not going to commit are you among those trying to do it ue it 's a dream it 's a dream yeah [MASK] we 're still working on it and we 're developing the wingsuits to[MASK] <unk> get better performance to get more knowledge <unk> and[MASK] i believe soon jc all right well we will watch this space but i have two more questions <unk> what is the there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing[MASK] <unk> see the the way where i was flying <unk> that 's reason number one and reason number two it 's much easier for the camera guy to film[MASK] if i 'm[MASK] using smoke jc ah i see so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked one more question what do you do to to cover your face because i just keep keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards are you in a helmet[MASK] <unk> feeling would be with only goggles jc and is that how you usually fly ue usually i 'm wearing a helmet in the mountains i 'm always wearing a helmet because of landings[MASK] usually it 's difficult it 's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings[MASK] so you have to be prepared jc right now is there anything you don 't do do people come to you with projects and say[MASK]
