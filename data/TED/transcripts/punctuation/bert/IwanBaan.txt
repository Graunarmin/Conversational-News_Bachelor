 <unk> fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects documenting their work[MASK] and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they[MASK] <unk> i think of new cities like dubai or ancient cities like rome[MASK] with zaha hadid 's incredible maxxi museum [MASK] or like right here in new york with the high line [MASK] a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this [MASK] but what i find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people <unk> [MASK] <unk> like here in chandigarh <unk> india the city which has been completely designed by the architect le corbusier [MASK] now sixty years later the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for <unk> [MASK] like here where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall [MASK] but over the course of several years <unk> i 've been documenting rem koolhaas 's cctv building in beijing[MASK] and the olympic stadium in the same city by the[MASK] <unk> architects herzog and de meuron at these large scale construction sites in china you see a sort of makeshift camp[MASK] where workers live during the entire building process [MASK] as the length of the construction takes years <unk> workers end up forming a rather rough and ready informal city <unk> making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they 're building [MASK] over the past[MASK] <unk> seven years i 've been following my fascination with the built environment and for those of you who know me you[MASK] would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase three hundred and sixty five days a year <unk> [MASK] being constantly on the move[MASK] means that sometimes i am able to catch life 's most unpredictable moments <unk> like here in new york the day after the sandy storm hit the city[MASK] <unk> just over three years ago <unk> i was for the first time in caracas venezuela <unk> and while flying over the city i was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city [MASK] a place where nearly seventy percent of the population lives in slums <unk> draped literally all over the mountains <unk>[MASK] <unk> office building which sits right in the center of caracas <unk> the building was under construction until the collapse of the venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early ' 90s [MASK] about eight years ago people started moving into the abandoned tower[MASK] and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower <unk> there 's only one little entrance[MASK] <unk> to the entire building and the three thousand residents come in and out through that single door <unk> [MASK] together the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower [MASK] in the lobby they painted the walls and planted trees[MASK] <unk> they also made a basketball[MASK] <unk> but when you look up closely you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through within the tower people have come up with all sorts of[MASK] solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower with no elevators the tower is like[MASK] <unk> walkup designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven 't had any education in architecture or[MASK] <unk> inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by this tower becomes like a living city a place which is alive with <unk>[MASK] and small businesses <unk> the inventive inhabitants for instance find opportunities in the most unexpected cases like the adjacent parking garage which has been reclaimed <unk>[MASK] <unk> as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to[MASK] <unk> the apartments [MASK] a walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create[MASK] walls how to make an air flow how to create transparency <unk> circulation throughout the tower <unk> [MASK] essentially creating a home that 's completely adapted to the conditions of[MASK] <unk> when a new inhabitant moves into the tower they already have a roof over their head so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets <unk> [MASK] slowly from found materials <unk> walls rise <unk> and people create a space out of any found objects or materials <unk> [MASK] it 's remarkable to see the design decisions that they 're making like when everything is made out of[MASK] <unk> some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish[MASK] the inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower <unk> [MASK] they typically make the best out of their conditions and try to make their spaces look nice and homey or at least up until as far as they can reach[MASK] <unk> reach [MASK] throughout the tower you come[MASK] across all kinds of services like the barber [MASK] small factories and every floor has a little grocery store or shop and[MASK] you even find a church <unk> [MASK] and on the 30th floor there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed[MASK] <unk> from the outside behind this always changing facade you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic intuitive way that responds directly to their needs <unk> [MASK] let 's go now to africa to nigeria to a community called makoko [MASK] a slum where one hundred and fifty thousand people live just meters above the lagos lagoon [MASK] while it may appear to[MASK] <unk> be a completely chaotic place [MASK] when you see it from above there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home [MASK] from the main dock people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area <unk> [MASK] when out on the water it 's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific[MASK] <unk> way of living even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits <unk> [MASK] behind every window and door frame <unk> you 'll see a small child peering back at you <unk> [MASK] and while makoko seems to be packed with people what 's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building [MASK] the population growth in[MASK] <unk> nigeria and especially in these areas like makoko are painful reminders of how out of control things really are [MASK] in makoko very few systems and infrastructures exist electricity is rigged[MASK] and freshest water comes from self built wells throughout the area this[MASK] <unk> meet a specific way of living on the water <unk> so fishing and boat making are common professions [MASK] you 'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area <unk> like barbershops <unk> [MASK] cd and dvd stores <unk> movie theaters <unk> tailors <unk> everything is there <unk> [MASK] there is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or[MASK] <unk> to be associated with a faraway place <unk> like that hotel in sweden [MASK] on this particular evening <unk> i came across this live band dressed to the t in their coordinating outfits [MASK] they were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted out generator for all of the community to enjoy [MASK] by nightfall the area becomes almost pitch black[MASK] <unk> save for a small lightbulb or[MASK] a fire <unk> [MASK] what originally brought me to makoko was this project from a friend of mine kunl adeyemi [MASK] who recently finished building this three story floating school for the kids in makoko [MASK] with this entire village existing on the water[MASK] <unk> public space is[MASK] <unk> so now that the school is finished the ground floor[MASK] is a playground for the kids <unk> but when classes are out the platform is just like a town square where the fishermen mend their nets[MASK] and floating shopkeepers dock their boats <unk> [MASK] another place i 'd like to share with you is the zabbaleen in cairo they 're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper egypt[MASK] <unk> and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes[MASK] from all over cairo [MASK] for years <unk> the zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities <unk> [MASK] but in the early <unk> 1980s they settled on the <unk> mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city <unk> [MASK] today they live in this area <unk> approximately fifty thousand to seventy thousand people who live in this community of[MASK] <unk> houses[MASK] where up to three generations live in one[MASK] structure [MASK] while these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid [MASK] each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for[MASK] <unk> and the upper floor is dedicated to living space [MASK] i find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there like this very distinguished man[MASK] <unk> who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him [MASK] <unk> while to most of us living amongst these piles and piles of garbage[MASK] may seem totally uninhabitable to those in the zabbaleen this is just a different type of normal [MASK] in all these places i 've talked about today <unk> what i do find fascinating is that there 's really no such thing as normal <unk> and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation [MASK] throughout the day it 's quite common to come across a small party taking place[MASK] in the streets just like this engagement[MASK] <unk> party in this tradition the bride to be displays all of their belongings which they soon bring to their new husband a[MASK] gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed[MASK] and all the garbage is used as[MASK] as props to display all their new home accessories [MASK] like makoko and the torre david[MASK] throughout the zabbaleen you 'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood <unk> [MASK] there are the retail shops the cafes and the restaurants and the community is this community of coptic christians <unk> [MASK] so you 'll also find a church <unk> along with the scores of religious <unk>[MASK] throughout the area <unk> and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops the[MASK] <unk> barbers <unk> everything [MASK] visiting the homes of the zabbaleen is also full of surprises while from the outside <unk> these homes look like any other informal structure in the city <unk> [MASK] when you step inside you are met with all manner of design decisions[MASK] and interior decoration <unk> despite[MASK] <unk> having limited access to space and money the homes in the area are designed with care and detail [MASK] every apartment is unique <unk> and this individuality tells a story about each family 's circumstances and values many of these people take their homes[MASK] and interior spaces very[MASK] seriously putting a lot of work and care into the details <unk> the shared spaces are also treated in the same manner [MASK] where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns[MASK] <unk> despite this elaborate decor <unk> sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways like this home which caught my attention while all the[MASK] the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door <unk> [MASK] when i was let in it appeared that this fifth floor apartment was being transformed into a complete[MASK] <unk> animal farm where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room [MASK] but then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the[MASK] nicest apartments in the area[MASK] <unk> the attention to this detail astonished me and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment [MASK] from floor to ceiling every part was decorated <unk> [MASK] but if it weren 't for the strangely familiar[MASK] stomach churning odor that constantly passes through the <unk>[MASK] it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill[MASK] <unk> what moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions i was welcomed with open arms[MASK] into a home that was made with love care and unreserved passion <unk> let 's move[MASK] across the map to china to an area called[MASK] <unk> henan and gansu [MASK] in a region famous for the soft <unk> porous loess plateau soil there lived until recently an estimated forty million people in these houses underground [MASK] these dwellings are called the yaodongs through this architecture by subtraction[MASK] built literally inside of the soil [MASK] in these villages you see an entirely altered landscape <unk> and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square rectangular houses which sit[MASK] <unk> seven meters below the ground <unk> [MASK] when i asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground <unk> they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn 't have the money to buy materials <unk>[MASK] <unk> and this digging out was their most logical form of living [MASK] from makoko to zabbaleen[MASK] <unk> communities have approached the tasks of planning design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances <unk> [MASK] created by these very people who live work and play in these particular spaces these neighborhoods are intuitively designed[MASK] to make the most of their circumstances in most of these places the government is completely absent <unk> leaving inhabitants with no choice but to[MASK] reappropriate found materials <unk> [MASK] and while these communities are highly disadvantaged <unk> they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity <unk> and prove that indeed we have the ability to[MASK] adapt to all manner of circumstances <unk> what makes places like the torre david particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into[MASK] <unk> now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves and how highly particular their solutions would be if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into <unk> [MASK] today you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people [MASK] from china to brazil these projects attempt to provide as many houses[MASK] <unk> as possible but they 're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to <unk> the individual needs of the people [MASK] i would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration <unk> zita cobb <unk> [MASK] the founder of the wonderful shorefast foundation based out of fogo island newfoundland [MASK] she says that there 's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy and i couldn 't agree with her more[MASK]
