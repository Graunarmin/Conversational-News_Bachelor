 <unk> what 's happening in genomics and how this revolution[MASK] is about to change everything we know about the world life ourselves <unk> and how we how we think[MASK] <unk> if you saw two thousand and one a space odyssey and you heard the boom boom boom boom <unk> and you saw the monolith you know that was arthur c clarke 's[MASK] representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species in this case it was[MASK] picking up bones and creating a tool using it as a tool which meant that apes just sort of running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things[MASK] if they[MASK] <unk> used a tool <unk> and that moved us to the next level and you know we in the last[MASK] thirty years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools and we 've seen many seminal moments we 've seen the creation of small computers[MASK] <unk> and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably twenty in your home and in not just your p c but in every device in your washing machine [MASK] your cell phone you 're walking around [MASK] your car has twelve microprocessors then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flatten the world we 've seen so much change and we 've given ourselves these tools now[MASK] <unk> these high powered tools that are are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us <unk> and that is a genome [MASK] how 's your genome today have you thought about it lately heard about it at least you[MASK] probably hear about genomes these days <unk> i thought i 'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is[MASK] <unk> like if you ask people well what is a megabyte or megabit and what is broadband people never want to say <unk> i really don 't understand so i will tell you right off of the bat you 've heard of dna you probably studied a little bit in[MASK] biology a[MASK] genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism and one thing[MASK] that is common to all of life is dna[MASK] doesn 't matter whether you 're a yeast it doesn 't matter whether you 're a mouse doesn 't matter whether you 're a fly[MASK] <unk> we all have dna the dna is organized in words <unk> call them [MASK] genes and chromosomes <unk> and when watson and crick in the ' 50s first decoded this[MASK] <unk> double helix that we know as[MASK] the[MASK] dna molecule very long complicated molecule[MASK] we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that dna is a language that determines the characteristics our traits what we inherit what diseases we may get [MASK] we 've also along the way[MASK] discovered that[MASK] this is a very old molecule that all of the dna in your body has been around[MASK] forever <unk> since the beginning of us of us as creatures there is a historical archive [MASK] living in your genome is the history of our species [MASK] and you as an individual human being where you 're from [MASK] going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years and that 's now starting to be understood[MASK] <unk> but also the genome is really the instruction manual <unk> it is the program <unk> [MASK] it is the code of life <unk> it is what makes you function it is what makes[MASK] every organism function [MASK] dna is a very elegant molecule <unk> it 's long and it 's complicated really all you have to know about it is that there 's four letters a t[MASK] c g they represent the name of a chemical and with these four letters <unk> you can create a language a language that can describe anything <unk> and very complicated things [MASK] you know they are generally put together in pairs[MASK] <unk> creating a word or what we call base pairs <unk> and you[MASK] <unk> when you think about it four letters <unk> or the representation of four things makes us work <unk> [MASK] and that may not sound very intuitive but let me flip over to something else you know about and that 's computers look at this screen here[MASK] and you know you see pictures and you see words but really all there are are ones and zeros[MASK] <unk> the language of technology is binary you 've probably heard that at some point in time <unk> everything that[MASK] <unk> happens in digital is converted or a representation of a one and a zero so when you 're listening to[MASK] itunes and your favorite music that 's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly when you 're seeing these pictures <unk> it 's all ones and zeros and when you 're talking on your telephone <unk>[MASK] your cell phone and it 's going over the network your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and[MASK] <unk> magically whizzed around and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we 've been able to create with just a one and a zero well now you ramp that up to four and you have a lot of complexity[MASK] a lot of ways to describe[MASK] mechanisms <unk> so let 's talk about what that means so if you look at a human[MASK] <unk> they consist of three point two billion of these base pairs [MASK] that 's a lot and they mix up in all different fashions and that makes you a human being[MASK] <unk> if you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of sizing we 're actually smaller than the program microsoft office[MASK] <unk> it 's not really all that much data <unk> i will also tell you we 're at least as buggy[MASK] <unk> this here is a bug in my genome[MASK] that i have struggled with for a long long time <unk> when you get sick <unk> it is[MASK] a bug in your genome <unk> in fact many many diseases we have struggled with for for a long[MASK] <unk> we haven 't been able to cure because we just don 't understand how it works at the genomic level <unk> we are starting to understand that so up to this point we tried to fix it by using what i call shit against the wall pharmacology <unk> which means[MASK] well let 's just throw chemicals at it and maybe it 's going to make it work [MASK] but if you really understand why does a cell go from normal[MASK] cell to cancer <unk> what is the code what are the exact[MASK] <unk> instructions that are making it do that then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out [MASK] so for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine here 's a few factoids for you we actually have about twenty four thousand genes that do things we have about a hundred one hundred and twenty thousand others[MASK] that don 't appear to function every day but represent this archival[MASK] <unk> history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years <unk> you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount <unk>[MASK] <unk> of genes they recently sequenced pinot noir and it also has about thirty thousand genes[MASK] now look around [MASK] just look next to your neighbor look forward look backward we all look pretty different a lot of very handsome and pretty people here skinny chubby different races cultures <unk>[MASK] <unk> we are all ninety nine point nine % genetically equal <unk> [MASK] that 's a tiny amount of material but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species <unk> so <unk> [MASK] we are now able to read genomes the first human genome took[MASK] ten years three billion dollars it was done by[MASK] <unk> craig venter and then james watson 's one of the[MASK] <unk> of dna[MASK] genome was done for two million dollars and in just two months and if you think about the computer industry and how we 've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster[MASK] all the time the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about five thousand dollars in about an hour or[MASK] <unk> see that happen in the next five years <unk> and what that means is you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card [MASK] it will be here [MASK] and when you buy medicine <unk> you won 't be buying a drug that 's used for everybody you will give your genome to the pharmacist and your drug will be made for you <unk>[MASK] <unk> and it will work much better than the ones that were you won 't have side effects all those side effects you know[MASK] <unk> oily residue and you know <unk> whatever they say in those commercials <unk> forget about that they 're going to make all that stuff go away[MASK] <unk> what does a genome look like [MASK] well there it is it is a long long series of these base pairs <unk> if you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this but what scientists are doing now is they 're understanding[MASK] <unk> these do and what they mean <unk> because what nature is doing is double clicking all the time <unk> [MASK] in other words <unk> the first couple of sentences here <unk> assuming this is a[MASK] grape plant make a root [MASK] make a branch create a blossom in a human being down in here it could be make blood cells [MASK] start cancer[MASK] for me it may be [MASK] every calorie you consume you conserve because i come from a very cold climate for my wife eat three times as much and you never put on any <unk>[MASK] <unk> weight <unk> it 's all hidden in this code and it 's starting to be understood at breakneck pace [MASK] what can we do with genomes now that we can read them now that we 're starting to have the book of life well there 's many things some are exciting some people will find very <unk>[MASK] <unk> scary i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me but that 's okay [MASK] <unk> functionality this is really important we can understand for example why we create plaque in our arteries[MASK] <unk> what creates the starchiness inside of a grain <unk> why does yeast[MASK] metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide we can also look at at a grander scale what creates problems what creates disease [MASK] and how we may be able[MASK] <unk> to fix them <unk> because we can understand this we can fix them make better organisms most importantly what we 're learning is that nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox [MASK] the toolbox exists [MASK] an architect far better better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox and we now[MASK] <unk> now have the ability to use it [MASK] we are now not just reading genomes <unk> we are writing them this company synthetic genomics i 'm involved with created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug a very primitive creature called mycoplasma genitalium if[MASK] you have a uti you 've probably or ever had a uti you[MASK] you 've come in contact with this little bug very simple only has about two hundred[MASK] <unk> we were able to[MASK] completely synthesize that genome [MASK] now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if i plug this synthetic genome if i pull the old one out and plug it in[MASK] does it just boot up and live well guess what it does [MASK] not only does it do that if you took the genome[MASK] that synthetic genome and you plugged it into a different critter[MASK] like yeast you now turn that yeast into mycoplasma it 's sort of like booting up a pc with[MASK] a mac o s software well actually you could do it the other way so you know[MASK] by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism <unk> the software if you will changes the hardware <unk> [MASK] and this is extremely[MASK] profound <unk> so <unk> [MASK] last year the french and italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced pinot noir the genomic sequence now exists for the entire pinot noir organism and[MASK] they identified once again about twenty nine thousand genes <unk> they have discovered pathways that[MASK] create flavors [MASK] although it 's very important to understand that those compounds that it 's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome in our tongue for us to understand and interpret those flavors <unk> they 've also discovered that there 's a heck of a lot of[MASK] activity going on producing aroma as well <unk> [MASK] they 've identified areas of vulnerability to disease they now are understanding and the work is going on [MASK] exactly how this plant works and we have the capability to know to read[MASK] <unk> that entire code and understand how it ticks so then what do you do [MASK] knowing that we can read it knowing that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch [MASK] so what do you do <unk> well <unk> one thing you could do is what some people might call franken noir [MASK] we can build a better vine by the way just so you know you[MASK] <unk> get stressed out about genetically modified organisms there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified they 're not grown from seeds they 're grafted into root stock <unk>[MASK] they would not exist in nature on their own <unk> so <unk> don 't worry about don 't stress about that stuff we 've been doing this forever so we could you know <unk> focus on disease[MASK] <unk> we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it or costs <unk> we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make pinot noir grow[MASK] maybe in long island god forbid [MASK] we could produce better flavors flavors and aromas you want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here or there [MASK] all of these things could conceivably be done and i will tell you i 'd pretty much bet[MASK] <unk> that it will be done <unk> but there 's an ecosystem here <unk> in other words <unk> we 're not sort of unique little organisms running around <unk> we are part of a big ecosystem <unk> in fact[MASK] i 'm sorry to inform you that inside of your digestive tract is about ten pounds of microbes which you 're circulating through your body quite a bit [MASK] our ocean 's teaming with microbes in fact[MASK] when craig venter[MASK] <unk> venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet[MASK] by discovering all new microbes in the first twenty feet of water we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co2 and oxygen than plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere [MASK] we find microbial life in every part of the planet in ice[MASK] <unk> coal in rocks in[MASK] volcanic vents it 's an amazing thing [MASK] but we 've also discovered when it comes to plants in plants as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes <unk> it is the ecosystem <unk>[MASK] <unk> around them it is the microbes that live in their root systems that have just as much impact on the character of[MASK] <unk> those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves <unk> if you take a closer look at a root system you will find there are many many many <unk>[MASK] <unk> diverse microbial colonies this is not big news to viticulturists they have been you know [MASK] <unk> you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in [MASK] you don 't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and and what characteristics [MASK] we can start to figure that out we all talk about terroir we worship terroir we say <unk> wow is[MASK] <unk> my terroir great it 's so special i 've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn 't believe well you know we really [MASK] we argue and debate about it we say it 's climate it 's soil it 's this well guess what we can figure out what the heck terroir is it 's in there waiting to be sequenced there <unk>[MASK] <unk> are thousands of microbes there <unk> they 're easy to sequence unlike a human they you know have a thousand two thousand genes[MASK] <unk> we can figure out what they are all we have to do is go around and sample[MASK] dig into the ground find those bugs <unk> sequence them <unk> correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don 't like that 's just a big database and then fertilize [MASK] and then we understand what is terroir [MASK] so some people will say oh my god are we playing god are we now if we engineer[MASK] <unk> you know people would always ask james watson he 's not always the most politically correct guy [MASK] and they would say [MASK] are you know are you playing god and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question [MASK] well somebody has to [MASK] i consider myself a very spiritual[MASK] <unk> the organized religion part and i will tell you i don 't believe there 's anything unnatural[MASK] <unk> i don 't believe that chemicals are unnatural <unk> i told you i 'm going to make some of you puke[MASK] it 's very simple we don 't invent molecules compounds <unk> they 're here <unk> they 're in the universe we reorganize things we change them around <unk> [MASK] but we don 't make anything unnatural[MASK] <unk> we can create bad impacts we can poison ourselves we can poison the earth[MASK] but that 's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made[MASK] <unk> so <unk> what 's happening today is nature is presenting us with a toolbox <unk> and we find that this toolbox is very extensive there are microbes out there that actually <unk>[MASK] <unk> make gasoline believe it or not there are microbes you know go back to yeast these are chemical factories the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by nature and[MASK] <unk> we now can use those [MASK] there also is a set of rules nature will not allow you to we could engineer a grape plant but guess what we can 't make the grape plant produce babies [MASK] nature has put a set of rules out there[MASK] <unk> we can work within the rules we can 't break the rules we 're just learning what the rules are i just ask the[MASK] <unk> if you could cure all disease if you could make disease go away <unk> because we understand how it actually works <unk> [MASK] if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious healthy plants that grow in in very hard to grow environments[MASK] <unk> if we could create clean and plentiful energy we right in the labs at synthetic genomics have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide[MASK] and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline[MASK] <unk> carbon dioxide the stuff we want to get rid of not sugar not anything carbon dioxide a little bit of sunlight <unk> you end up with a[MASK] lipid that[MASK] is highly refined we could solve our energy problems <unk> we can reduce co2 we could clean up our oceans we could make better wine <unk> if we[MASK] <unk> you know i think the answer is very simple working with nature <unk> working with this tool set that we now understand [MASK] is the next step in humankind 's evolution and all i can tell you is stay healthy for twenty years <unk> if you can stay healthy for twenty years you 'll see one hundred and fifty maybe three hundred[MASK]
