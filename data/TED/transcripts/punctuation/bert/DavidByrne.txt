 <unk> this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that i wrote was first performed [MASK] it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven[MASK] <unk> the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent[MASK] and there wasn 't a lot of reverberation in the room so the[MASK] rhythms could be pretty intact too pretty concise [MASK] other places around the country had similar rooms <unk> this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville the music was in some ways different but in[MASK] structure and form very much the[MASK] <unk> the clientele behavior was very much the same too <unk> and[MASK] so the bands at tootsie 's or at cbgb 's[MASK] had to play loud enough[MASK] the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing <unk> [MASK] since then i 've played other places that are much nicer <unk> i 've played[MASK] the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that[MASK] <unk> exciting but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i[MASK] had written or was writing at the time <unk> didn 't sound all that great in some of those halls we managed but[MASK] sometimes those halls didn 't seem exactly suited[MASK] to the music i was making or had made so i asked myself <unk> do i write stuff for specific rooms[MASK] <unk> do i have a place a venue in mind when i write is that a kind of model for creativity do we all make things with a venue a context [MASK] <unk> part of its roots in west africa <unk> [MASK] and the music there <unk> i would say the instruments the intricate rhythms <unk> the way it 's played the setting the context <unk> [MASK] it 's all perfect <unk> it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting <unk> there 's no[MASK] big room to[MASK] create reverberation and confuse the rhythms <unk> the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification[MASK] <unk> etc it 's no accident <unk> it 's perfect for that particular context <unk> and it would be a mess[MASK] in a context like this this is a gothic cathedral[MASK] <unk> no rhythm whatsoever <unk> and[MASK] the room flatters the music <unk> it actually improves it this is the room that bach[MASK] wrote some of his music for this is the organ <unk> [MASK] it 's not as big as a gothic cathedral so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively[MASK] <unk> this is a little bit later <unk> this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in i think we 're in like one thousand seven hundred and seventy somewhere around there <unk>[MASK] they 're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really frilly music[MASK] <unk> the audience in these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out[MASK] to one another <unk> they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that if they liked an aria[MASK] <unk> they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and[MASK] well <unk> that was an opera[MASK] experience this is the opera house that wagner built for himself <unk> and the size of the room is not that big <unk> it 's smaller than this but[MASK] <unk> wagner made an innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bombast so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more[MASK] <unk> obviously this kind of thing became popular the halls got bigger carnegie hall 's fair sized it 's larger than some of the other symphony halls and[MASK] they 're a lot more reverberant than[MASK] la scala around the same according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker <unk> this kind of rule came into effect that[MASK] <unk> audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or[MASK] gossiping with one another during the show <unk> they had to be very quiet <unk> so those two things combined meant that[MASK] a different kind of music[MASK] worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren 't in[MASK] some of these other kinds of music <unk> quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting <unk> but because of the[MASK] <unk> reverberation in those rooms like carnegie hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural[MASK] <unk> coming along at the same time this is a jazz band <unk> according to scott joplin [MASK] the bands were playing on riverboats and and clubs again it 's noisy they 're playing for dancers there 's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections <unk> that the dancers really liked and they 'd say play that part again [MASK] well <unk> there 's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers <unk> so the bands started to improvise[MASK] <unk> new melodies <unk> and a new form of music was born these are[MASK] played mainly in small rooms [MASK] people are dancing <unk> shouting and drinking so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for[MASK] that 's the beginning of the century for the[MASK] whole of 20th century popular music whether it 's rock or latin music or whatever [ live music ] doesn 't really change that much <unk> [MASK] it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became[MASK] one of the primary venues for music <unk> and this was[MASK] one way that the music got there <unk> microphones enabled singers in particular[MASK] <unk> and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music but[MASK] singers like frank sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone [MASK] other singers[MASK] <unk> this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone it would have been impossible without recorded music as well <unk> and[MASK] he 's singing right into your ear he 's whispering into your ears the effect is just electric it 's like the guy is[MASK] sitting next to you whispering[MASK] who knows what into your ear[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] at this point music diverged there 's live music <unk> and there 's recorded music <unk> [MASK] and they no longer have to be exactly the same [MASK] now there 's venues like this a discotheque <unk> and there 's jukeboxes in bars where you don 't even need to have a band[MASK] there doesn 't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever[MASK] <unk> systems are good people began to make music specifically[MASK] for discos and for those sound systems [MASK] and as with jazz [MASK] the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others <unk> so the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections[MASK] <unk> mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies and another new form of music was born [MASK] live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably <unk> acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet <unk> [MASK] <unk> basketball arenas and hockey arenas musicians who ended up there did the best they could they wrote what is now called arena rock which is[MASK] <unk> situation and in some ways the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly so[MASK] there 's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile i grew up with a radio in a car but now that 's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue[MASK] <unk> i would say is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it [MASK] it might not be what you want to listen to at home <unk> but it works great in the car[MASK] has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice[MASK] kind of stuck in the middle automobile music you can share with your friends <unk> there 's one other kind of new venue[MASK] <unk> the private mp3 player <unk> presumably this is just for christian music laughter[MASK] in some ways it 's like carnegie hall or when the audience had to hush up because[MASK] you can now hear every single detail in other ways it 's more like the west african music because[MASK] if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet[MASK] <unk> turn it up and the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage <unk> so that doesn 't really work <unk> i think[MASK] pop music mainly it 's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail <unk> [MASK] but the dynamic doesn 't change that much <unk> [MASK] so i asked myself[MASK] <unk> a model for creation <unk> this adaptation that we do and[MASK] does it happen anywhere else well <unk> according to david attenborough and some other people birds do it too[MASK] that the birds in the canopy where the foliage is dense <unk> their calls tend to be high pitched[MASK] <unk> and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls <unk> so that they don 't get distorted when they bounce off the[MASK] forest floor and birds like[MASK] this savannah sparrow <unk> they tend to have a buzzing sound clip savannah[MASK] sparrow song type call <unk> and it turns out that a[MASK] sound like this is the most energy efficient[MASK] and practical way[MASK] <unk> to transmit[MASK] their call across the fields and[MASK] savannahs <unk> [MASK] other birds like this tanager [MASK] have adapted within the same species <unk> the tananger on the east coast of the united states where the forests are a little denser has one kind of call <unk> and the tananger[MASK] <unk> this is a model for creation if we make music <unk> primarily the form at least to fit[MASK] <unk> and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems[MASK] is that how it works[MASK] <unk> yeah i think it 's evolutionary <unk> it 's adaptive <unk> but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there[MASK] <unk> this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion[MASK] <unk> and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something and i 'm saying well[MASK] <unk> the passion 's still there but the vessel[MASK] that it 's going to be injected into and poured into [MASK] that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going[MASK] <unk> conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer <unk> thomas frank says that[MASK] this might be a kind of explanation why some[MASK] voters vote against their best interests [MASK] that voters like a lot of us [MASK] assume that if they hear something that sounds like it 's sincere that it 's coming from the gut that it 's passionate that it 's more authentic[MASK] and they 'll vote for that <unk> so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance[MASK] of[MASK] being selected in that way <unk> which seems a little dangerous <unk> i 'm saying the two <unk> the passion the joy are[MASK] <unk> mutually exclusive maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that[MASK] we are like the birds we adapt [MASK] we sing <unk> and like the birds <unk> [MASK] the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much[MASK]
