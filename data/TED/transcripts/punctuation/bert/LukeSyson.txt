 <unk> two years ago <unk> i have to say there was no problem two years ago i knew exactly what an icon looked like <unk> it looks like this [MASK] everybody 's icon but also the default position of a curator of italian renaissance paintings which i was then and in a way <unk> this is[MASK] <unk> also another default selection leonardo da vinci 's exquisitely soulful[MASK] image of the lady with an ermine and i use that word soulful deliberately [MASK] or then there 's this or rather these the two versions of leonardo 's virgin of the rocks that were about to come together in london for the very first time [MASK] in the exhibition that i was then in the absolute throes of organizing i was literally[MASK] up to my eyes in leonardo and i had been for three years [MASK] so he was occupying every part of my my brain leonardo had taught me <unk> during that three years about what a picture can do about taking you <unk>[MASK] <unk> from your own material world into a spiritual world he said actually that he believed the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible and invisible[MASK] in the universe that 's a huge a huge task[MASK] <unk> and yet somehow he achieves it he shows us i think the human soul he shows us the capacity of of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm[MASK] <unk> to see[MASK] a vision of the universe that 's more perfect than our own to see god 's own plan in some sense <unk> so this in a sense[MASK] <unk> was really what i believed an icon was at[MASK] about that time <unk> i started talking to tom campbell <unk> director here of the metropolitan museum about what my next move might be [MASK] the move in fact back to[MASK] an earlier life one i 'd begun at the british museum back to the world of three dimensions of sculpture and of decorative arts to take over the department of european sculpture and decorative arts[MASK] here at the met <unk> but it was an incredibly busy time all the conversations were done at very peculiar times of the day[MASK] over the phone[MASK] in the end i accepted the job without actually having been here again i 'd been there a couple of years before but on that particular visit <unk> [MASK] so it was just before the time that the leonardo show was due to open when i finally made it back[MASK] to the met[MASK] <unk> to new york to see my new domain [MASK] to see what european sculpture and decorative arts looked like beyond those renaissance collections with which i was so already familiar <unk> and i thought on that very first day <unk> i better <unk>[MASK] <unk> tour the galleries <unk> fifty seven of these galleries like fifty seven varieties of baked beans i believe[MASK] <unk> the italian renaissance <unk> and then i moved gradually around feeling a little lost sometimes[MASK] <unk> my head also still full of the leonardo exhibition that was about to open and i came across[MASK] this <unk> and i thought to myself what the hell have i done [MASK] there was absolutely no connection in my mind[MASK] <unk> all and in fact if there was any emotion going on it was a kind of of repulsion this object felt utterly and completely alien silly at a level that i hadn 't yet understood silliness to be[MASK] <unk> and then it was made worse[MASK] there were two of them [MASK] <unk> i started thinking about why it was in fact that i[MASK] disliked this object so much what was the anatomy of my of my distaste <unk> well so much gold <unk> so vulgar you[MASK] know so nouveau riche frankly <unk>[MASK] <unk> leonardo himself had preached against the use of gold so it was absolutely anathema at that moment <unk> and then there 's little pretty sprigs of flowers everywhere[MASK] <unk> finally <unk> that pink <unk> that damned pink <unk> it 's[MASK] such an extraordinarily artificial color i mean it 's a color that i can 't think of anything that you actually see in nature that looks that that shade [MASK] the object even has its own tutu [MASK] this little flouncy spangly bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the[MASK] <unk> reminded me in an odd kind of way of my niece 's fifth birthday party[MASK] <unk> where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy there was one who would come as a fairy princess you should have seen the looks [MASK] and i realize that this object was in my mind born from the same mind from the same womb practically as barbie ballerina [MASK] and then there 's the elephants[MASK] <unk> those extraordinary elephants with[MASK] their little sort of strange sinister expressions and greta garbo eyelashes [MASK] with these golden tusks and so on i realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic march across the serengeti [MASK] it was a a dumbo nightmare[MASK] <unk> but something more profound was happening as well [MASK] these objects it seemed to me were quintessentially the kind that i and my liberal left friends in london had always seen as summing up something deplorable about the french aristocracy in the in the <unk> 18th century [MASK] the label had told me that these pieces were made by[MASK] <unk> actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as i later learned <unk> but for me they summed up a kind of [MASK] that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy in the in the <unk> 18th century <unk> i and my colleagues had always[MASK] <unk> that these objects in way summed up the the idea of you know no wonder there was a revolution <unk> or indeed <unk> thank god there was a revolution <unk>[MASK] there was a sort of idea really that if you owned a vase like this then there was really only one fate possible [MASK] so there i was in[MASK] <unk> i took the job and i went on looking at these vases i sort of had to because they 're on a through route[MASK] in the met so almost anywhere i went there they were <unk> they had this kind of[MASK] odd sort of fascination <unk> like a car accident <unk> where i couldn 't stop looking [MASK] and as i did so <unk> i started thinking well what are we[MASK] <unk> what i started with was was understanding this as really[MASK] a supreme piece of of design it took me a little time but that tutu for example actually this is a piece that does dance in its own way <unk> it has an extraordinary lightness and yet it is also amazing balanced <unk> [MASK] it has these kinds of sculptural ingredients[MASK] <unk> <unk> and then the play between actually really quite carefully disposed color and gilding and the sculptural surface is really[MASK] <unk> really rather remarkable <unk> [MASK] and then i realized that this piece went into the kiln four times at least four times in order to arrive at this how many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece and then remember <unk> not just one but two so <unk>[MASK] <unk> he 's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this[MASK] <unk> and then this question of uselessness well actually the end of the trunks were originally candle holders so what you would have had were candles[MASK] on either side imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface on the slightly uneven pink <unk> on the beautiful gold <unk> it would have glittered in an interior a little like a little firework[MASK] and at that point actually a firework went off in my brain <unk> somebody reminded me that that word ' fancy ' which in[MASK] <unk> sense for me <unk> encapsulated this object actually comes from the same root as the word <unk> ' fantasy '[MASK] and that what this object was just as much in a way <unk> in its own way as a leonardo da vinci painting is a portal to somewhere else this is[MASK] <unk> if you think about divans and perhaps even <unk> opium induced visions of pink elephants then at that point this object starts to make[MASK] sense this is an object which is all about escapism it 's about an escapism that that happens[MASK] that the aristocracy in france sought very deliberately[MASK] <unk> to distinguish themselves from ordinary people[MASK] <unk> of the imagination[MASK]
