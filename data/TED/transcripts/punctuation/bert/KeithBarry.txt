 <unk> brain magic what 's brain magic all about brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind reading effects so unlike traditional magic it uses the power of words <unk>[MASK] linguistic deception non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense[MASK] <unk> 'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how <unk> i want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody i want everybody to put out your hands like this for me first of all [MASK] ok clap them together once [MASK] ok <unk> reverse your hands now follow my actions exactly now about half the audience has their left hand up <unk> why is that ok swap[MASK] <unk> them around put your right hand up[MASK] cross your hands over so your right hand goes over interlace your fingers like this then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb that 's very important yours is the other way around so swap it around <unk> [MASK] excellent <unk> ok <unk> extend your fingers like this for me [MASK] all right tap them together once ok now <unk> if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this[MASK] <unk> now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how [MASK] now i remember when i was about fifteen [MASK] i read a copy of life magazine <unk> which detailed a story about a <unk> 75 year old blind russian woman[MASK] who could sense printed letters there 's[MASK] <unk> and even sense colors just by touch and she was completely blind she could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed face down on a hard surface [MASK] now i was fascinated <unk> but at the same time skeptical how could somebody read using their fingertips[MASK] <unk> you know if you actually think about it <unk> if somebody is totally blind[MASK] a guy yesterday did a demonstration[MASK] <unk> where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things[MASK] <unk> and it 's just a really weird thing to try and figure out how could somebody read using their fingertips now earlier on as part of a tv show that i have coming up on mtv i attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight <unk> [MASK] so <unk> let 's take[MASK] <unk> expert can see through somebody else 's eyes[MASK] <unk> i 'm trying to see through your eyes[MASK] <unk> the way two days ago <unk> we were going to film this down there at the race[MASK] <unk> we got a guy into a car and we got a camera man in the back <unk> but halfway through the drive he told me he had i think it was a nine millimeter stuck to his leg so i stopped pretty quick and that was it[MASK] so do you believe it 's possible to see through somebody else 's eyes that 's the question now most people here would automatically say no <unk> ok[MASK] <unk> want you to just think about it for a moment a lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened all right but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception [MASK] the solutions you come up with will ninety nine percent of the time be way off the mark [MASK] this is because magic is all about directing attention if for instance i didn 't want you to look at my right hand then i don 't look at it <unk> but if i wanted you to look at my right hand <unk> then i look at it[MASK] <unk> you know how but very complicated in other ways i 'm going to give you some demonstrations right now i need two people to help me out real quick can you come up <unk> [MASK] and let 's see [MASK] down at the end here can you also come up real quick do you mind <unk> yes at the end <unk> ok give them a round of applause as they come up you might want to use the stairs there it[MASK] <unk> 's very important for everybody here to realize i haven 't set anything up with you you don 't know what <unk>[MASK] would you mind just standing over here for a

synchronicity so our minds are along the same lines [MASK] and as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to take your left hand <unk> and just place it up here i want you to hold it there just for a moment <unk> and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go[MASK] <unk> i want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop ok[MASK] now allow it to stay there [MASK] ok now in a moment <unk> you 'll feel a certain pressure <unk> ok <unk> and i want you to be aware of the pressure just[MASK] be aware of the[MASK] <unk> only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release but only when you feel the pressure release do you understand [MASK] just answer yes or no man yes kb [MASK] hold it right there and only when you feel the pressure go back allow your hand to drift back to the[MASK] <unk> that was wonderfully done <unk> let 's try it again <unk> [MASK] excellent <unk> now that you 've got the idea let 's try something even more interesting allow[MASK] <unk> to stick firmly to the tabletop keep your eyes closed can you stand up[MASK] just stand stage forward i want you to point directly at his forehead <unk> [MASK] ok <unk> imagine a connection between you and him [MASK] only when you want the pressure to be released <unk> make an upward gesture like this but only when you want it to be released you can wait as long as you want <unk> but only when you want the pressure[MASK] <unk> only when you want the pressure to go back make a downward gesture you can wait as long as you want[MASK] <unk> want you to be aware that in a moment <unk> when i snap my fingers your eyes will open again [MASK] it 's ok to remember to forget or forget to remember what happened <unk> most people ask you what the hell just happened up

are crazy has anybody here seen that film <unk> yeah remember when they threw the coke out of the airplane and it landed on the ground <unk> and it didn 't break now [MASK] see that 's because coke bottles are solid <unk> [MASK] it 's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle[MASK] <unk> you see psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes [MASK] for some magicians or mentalists <unk> sometimes the spoon will bend or melt <unk> sometimes it will not <unk> sometimes the object will slide across the table sometimes it will not it depends on how much
