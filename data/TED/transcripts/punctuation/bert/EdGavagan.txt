again and that anticipation that rhythm <unk> helps give us a structure[MASK] to how we organize ourselves and our lives and gives it a[MASK] measure of predictability living in new york city as i do [MASK] it 's almost as if with so many people doing so many things[MASK] at the same time[MASK] <unk> time in such close quarters it 's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck you[MASK] 're never there 's just juxtapositions are are possible that just aren 't you don 't think they 're going to happen [MASK] and you never think you 're going to be the guy who 's walking down the[MASK] <unk> because you choose to go down one side or the other the rest of your life is changed forever[MASK] <unk> and one one night i 'm riding the uptown local train i get on i tend to be[MASK] a little bit vigilant when i get on[MASK] the subway i 'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book <unk> and i get on the car and i look and[MASK] <unk> guy and a girl and they 're sitting next to each other and she 's got her[MASK] leg draped over his knee and they 're[MASK] doing they[MASK] have this little contraption and they 're tying these knots <unk> and they 're doing it with one hand they 're doing it[MASK] left handed and right handed very quickly and then she 'll hand the thing to him and he 'll do[MASK] <unk> never seen anything like this it 's almost like they 're practicing magic tricks [MASK] and at the next stop a guy gets on the car and he has this[MASK] sort of visiting professor look to him he 's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the[MASK] rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches and [MASK] he looks at them <unk> and then in a blink of an eye he kneels down in front of them <unk> and he starts to[MASK] listen here 's how you can do it look if you do this and he takes the laces out of their hand and instantly he starts tying these knots <unk> and[MASK] even better than they were doing it remarkably <unk> [MASK] and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques <unk> and he 's the guy giving the lecture[MASK] <unk> tell them and he 's like no this is very important here you know <unk> when you 're needing these knots <unk> it 's going to be you know everything 's going to be happening at the same time[MASK] <unk> it 's going to be[MASK] you 're going to have all this information coming at you there 's going to be organs getting in the way it 's going to be slippery <unk> and[MASK] it 's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature each hand left[MASK] <unk> right hand you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers and at that moment when i heard that i just got catapulted out of the subway car[MASK] into[MASK] a night when i had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where i had been stabbed[MASK] to the trauma room of st vincent 's hospital in manhattan[MASK] <unk> and what had happened was[MASK] a[MASK] gang had come in from brooklyn as part of an initiation for three of their members they had to kill somebody <unk> and i happened[MASK] to be the guy walking down bleecker street that night <unk> and they jumped on me without a word one of the very lucky[MASK] <unk> when i was at notre dame i was on the boxing team so i put my hands up right away <unk> instinctively [MASK] the guy on the right had a knife with a 10 inch blade <unk> and he went in[MASK] under my elbow <unk> and it went up and[MASK] cut my inferior vena cava [MASK] if you know anything about anatomy that 's not a good thing to get cut and everything of course on the way up and then i still had my hands up[MASK] he pulled it out and went for my neck[MASK] <unk> and sunk it in up to the hilt[MASK] in my neck[MASK] <unk> and i got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out the other guy was still working on me <unk> collapsing my other lung <unk> [MASK] and i managed[MASK] to by hitting that guy to get a minute i ran down the street and collapsed and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and[MASK] <unk> let the trauma room know they had an incoming <unk> and one of the[MASK] side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision <unk> so i remember being on the stretcher and having a little <unk>[MASK] cone of vision and i was moving my head around and we got to st vincent 's and we 're racing down this hallway and i see the lights going[MASK] <unk> and it 's a peculiar[MASK] effect of of memories like that they don 't really go to the usual place that memories go they kind of have this[MASK] vault where they 're stored in high def and george lucas did all the sound effects[MASK] <unk> it 's not like[MASK] any other kind of memories <unk> and i get into the the trauma room and they 're waiting for me and the lights are there <unk> and[MASK] i[MASK] 'd been able to breathe a little more now because the the blood has left had been filling up my lungs and i was having a very hard time breathing but[MASK] now it 's kind of gone into the stretcher and i said[MASK] <unk> anything i can do to help and [MASK] laughter the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh <unk> and i 'm turning my head trying to see everybody <unk> and[MASK] i had this weird memory of being in college and raising[MASK] raising money for the flood victims of bangladesh <unk> and then i look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me and i think he looks bangladeshi[MASK] and i just have those two facts and i just think this could work somehow and then i go i go out and[MASK] they work on me for the rest of the night <unk> and[MASK] i needed about[MASK] forty units of blood to keep me there while they[MASK] did their work and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines my[MASK] cecum organs i didn 't know that i had and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me <unk> which[MASK] i thought was great you know just a little tidy thing there at the end and[MASK] i came to in the morning <unk> out of anesthetic he had let them know that he wanted to be there <unk> and[MASK] he had given me about a two percent chance of[MASK] <unk> living <unk> so he was there when i when i woke up and it was waking up was like breaking through the ice into[MASK] a frozen lake of pain it was that[MASK] enveloping <unk> and there was only one spot[MASK] that didn 't hurt worse than anything i 'd ever felt and it was my instep <unk> and he was holding[MASK] the arch of my foot and[MASK] and rubbing the instep with his thumb <unk> and i looked up and he 's like good to see you and[MASK] i[MASK] was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything and the pain was just overwhelming <unk> and he said you know we didn 't cut your hair[MASK] <unk> you might have gotten strength from your hair like samson and you 're going to need all the strength you can get and in those days my hair was down to my waist[MASK] <unk> i drove a motorcycle i was unmarried i owned a bar <unk> so those were different times [MASK] but i had three days of life support[MASK] <unk> the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn 't going to make it so it was three days of[MASK] everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop <unk> and when i finally[MASK] pooped then that somehow surgically speaking that 's like you crossed some good line and um on that[MASK] <unk> came in and[MASK] whipped the sheet off of me he had three or four friends with him [MASK] and he does that and they all look and there was no infection and they bend over me and they 're poking and prodding and they 're like there 's no hematomas blah blah [MASK] look at the color and they 're talking amongst themselves and i 'm like this restored automobile that he 's just going yeah i did that[MASK] <unk> these guys are high fiving him over[MASK] how good i turned out you know and it 's my zipper <unk> and i 've still got the staples in and everything <unk> and[MASK] later on when i got out and the the flashbacks and the[MASK] nightmares were giving me a hard time i went back to him[MASK] and <unk>[MASK] and i was sort of asking him <unk> you know <unk> what am i gonna do[MASK] <unk> and i think kind of as a surgeon he basically said [MASK] kid i saved your life like now you can do whatever you want like <unk> <unk> you gotta get on with that it 's like[MASK] i gave you a new car and you 're complaining about[MASK] <unk> and the subway doors are closing and[MASK] my stop is next <unk> and i look at these kids <unk> and i go i think to myself i 'm going to lift my shirt up[MASK] <unk> this is the new york city subway that 's going to lead to[MASK] other things [MASK] and so i just think they got their lecture to go to i step off i 'm standing on the platform <unk> and[MASK] i feel my index finger in[MASK] in the first scar that i ever got from my umbilical[MASK] <unk> and then around that is traced the last scar that i got from my surgeon <unk> [MASK] and i[MASK] think that that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives[MASK] led me[MASK] to my surgical team and their training[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> skill and always a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos[MASK]
