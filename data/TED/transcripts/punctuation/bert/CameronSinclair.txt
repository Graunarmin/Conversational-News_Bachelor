 <unk> take you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish <unk> i 'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven 't been and that 's around the world <unk> [MASK] when i was about twenty four years old[MASK] <unk> kate stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work not only about responding to natural disasters[MASK] but involved in systemic issues <unk> [MASK] we believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design design can really make a difference in people 's lives <unk> [MASK] so i started my life as an architect or training as an architect <unk> and i was always interested[MASK] <unk> in socially responsible design and how you can really make an impact <unk> but when i went to architecture school <unk> it seemed that i was a black sheep in the family[MASK] <unk> many architects seemed to think that when you design you design a jewel and it 's a jewel that you try and crave for whereas i felt that when you design you either improve <unk>[MASK] or you create a detriment to the community in which you 're designing so you 're not just doing a building for the residents or or for the people who are going to use it <unk> but for the community as a whole [MASK] we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo <unk> [MASK] and i didn 't know what i was doing like i said[MASK] mid 20s and i 'm <unk> the internet generation so we started a website <unk> we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world[MASK] <unk> that led to a number of prototypes being built and really[MASK] <unk> experimenting with some ideas[MASK] <unk> two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub saharan africa responding to the hiv aids pandemic[MASK] that led to[MASK] five hundred and fifty entries from fifty three countries <unk> we also[MASK] have designers from around the world that participate <unk> and we had an exhibit[MASK] <unk> of work that that followed that two thousand and four was the tipping point for us [MASK] we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in iran in bam also following up on our work in africa <unk> [MASK] working within the united states most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but i live in bozeman montana go up to the north plains on the reservations or go down to alabama or mississippi[MASK] <unk> and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that i 've been to so we got involved in[MASK] in inner cities and elsewhere and also[MASK] <unk> i will go into some more projects two thousand and five mother nature kicked our ass i think we can pretty much assume that two thousand and five was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters [MASK] and because of the internet and because of[MASK] <unk> connections to blogs and so forth within[MASK] literally hours of the tsunami we were already raising funds getting involved working with with people on the ground[MASK] <unk> we run from a couple of laptops and in the first couple of days <unk> i had four thousand emails from people needing help <unk> so[MASK] we began to get involved in projects there and i 'll talk about some others[MASK] <unk> and then of course this year we 've been responding to katrina as well as following up on our reconstruction work so this is a brief overview [MASK] in two thousand and four i really couldn 't manage the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests that i was getting it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone <unk> [MASK] so we decided to embrace <unk>[MASK] <unk> an open source model of business so that anyone anywhere in the world could start a local chapter and they can get involved in local problems because i believe there is no such thing as[MASK] <unk> utopia all problems are local all solutions are local so that means you[MASK] know somebody who 's based in in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do so what happened is we used meetup and and all these other[MASK] internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects in one hundred and four countries[MASK] <unk> so the bullet point sorry i never do a suit so i knew that i was going to take this off <unk> ok <unk> because i 'm going to do it very quick[MASK] this isn 't just about nonprofit what it showed me is that there 's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity[MASK] not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved[MASK] <unk> in making change <unk>[MASK] i 'm adding that to my time <unk>[MASK] so what you don 't know is we 've[MASK] <unk> these thousands of designers working around the world connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three[MASK] the fact that nobody told us we couldn 't do it <unk> we did it and so there 's something to be said about navet so seven years later we 've developed so that we 've got advocacy <unk>[MASK] <unk> instigation and implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums op eds we have a book on humanitarian work <unk> but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy[MASK] we can talk about fema but that 's another talk <unk> [MASK] instigation developing ideas with communities and and ngos doing open source design competitions[MASK] <unk> referring matchmaking with communities and then implementing actually going out there and doing the work because[MASK] when you invent <unk> it 's never a reality until it 's built <unk> so it 's really important that if we 're designing and[MASK] trying to create change we build that change <unk> so here 's a select number of projects [MASK] kosovo <unk> [MASK] this is kosovo in ' ninety nine [MASK] we did an open design competition like i said <unk> it led to a whole variety of of ideas and this wasn 't about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the the land the resident lived in[MASK] and that they would rebuild their own home <unk> [MASK] this wasn 't imposing an architecture on a community <unk> this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow[MASK] the way they want to we had from the sublime to the ridiculous but they worked this is an inflatable hemp house <unk> it was built it[MASK] <unk> this is a shipping container built and works and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural[MASK] building <unk> but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks <unk> so we 've engaged not just designers but also[MASK] a whole variety of[MASK] professionals using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes[MASK] <unk> straw bale construction creating heat walls <unk> and then something remarkable happened in ' ninety nine we went to africa[MASK] originally to look at the housing issue within three days we realized the problem was not housing <unk> it was the the growing pandemic of hiv aids <unk> [MASK] and it wasn 't doctors telling us this it was actual villagers that we were staying[MASK] <unk> and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk ten fifteen kilometers to see doctors <unk> you get the doctors to the people <unk> [MASK] and we started engaging the the medical community [MASK] and you know we thought we were real bright[MASK] sparks we 've come up with this great idea mobile health clinics <unk> widely distributed throughout sub saharan africa [MASK] and the medical community there said we[MASK] said this for the last decade we know this we just don 't know how to show this so in a way we <unk>[MASK] <unk> needs and shown[MASK] solutions <unk> and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in [MASK] this one i personally love because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness <unk> [MASK] this is a kenaf clinic <unk> you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and[MASK] and it grows fourteen feet in a month and on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top <unk> and[MASK] when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers <unk> you cut down the clinic and you eat it[MASK] so it 's dealing with the fact that if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea[MASK] <unk> as important as getting antiretrovirals out there so you know this is a serious serious solution [MASK] this one i love the idea is it 's not just a clinic it 's a community center this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining project [MASK] every one of these projects is sustainable [MASK] that 's not because i 'm a tree hugging green person <unk> it 's because when you live on four dollars a day[MASK] <unk> living on survival and you have to be sustainable you have to know where your energy is coming from you have to know where your resource is coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down <unk> [MASK] so this is this is about getting an economic engine <unk> and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it 's not an aids clinic <unk> [MASK] it 's a community center <unk> so you[MASK] <unk> and these ideas developed into prototypes and they were eventually built and currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out in nigeria and[MASK] kenya [MASK] from that we also developed siyathemba <unk> the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don 't have education [MASK] and we 're working in an area where young women between the ages[MASK] <unk> have a fifty percent hiv aids rate <unk> [MASK] and that 's not because they 're promiscuous <unk> it 's because there 's no knowledge <unk> and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that <unk>[MASK] <unk> doubled as an hiv aids outreach center <unk> and the coaches of the girls ' team were also trained doctors <unk> so that there would be a very slow way of developing[MASK] <unk> and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region and then the community picked their design they said this is our design because it 's not only about engaging a community <unk>[MASK] it 's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process [MASK] <unk> out there working with the first ever women 's soccer team in[MASK] <unk> which has now changed to siyathemba[MASK] this is our home ground cameron sinclair i 'm going to show that later because i 'm running out of time <unk> i can see chris looking at me[MASK] slyly <unk> this was a connection just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop[MASK] africa 's first telemedicine center in tanzania <unk> and we met literally a couple of months ago we 've already developed a design the team is over there working in partnership this was a matchmaking thanks to[MASK] <unk> to a couple of tedsters sun [ microsystems ] cheryl heller[MASK] and[MASK] andrew zolli who connected me with this amazing african woman <unk> and we start construction in june and it will be opened by tedglobal so when you come to tedglobal you can check it out [MASK] but what we 're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development <unk> and we 've been involved in a lot of[MASK] <unk> such as[MASK] the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina <unk> this is a[MASK] <unk> shelter that can be easily assembled <unk> [MASK] this is a <unk>[MASK] community center <unk> and what that means is we actually live and work with the community and they 're part of the design[MASK] <unk> the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be <unk> and then eventually the community <unk>[MASK] <unk> through skills training end up building the building with us <unk> here is another school[MASK] this is what the un un gave these guys for six months twelve plastic tarps[MASK] this was in august <unk> this was the replacement that 's supposed to last for two years when the rain comes down you can 't hear a thing and in the summer it 's about one hundred and forty degrees[MASK] <unk> inside <unk> so we said if the rain 's coming down <unk> let 's get fresh water so every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system <unk> very low cost[MASK] <unk> three classrooms and rainwater collection is five thousand dollars <unk> this was raised by hot chocolate sales[MASK] in atlanta <unk> [MASK] it 's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a[MASK] <unk> couple of weeks ago and there 's six hundred kids that are now using the schools [MASK] so disaster hits home[MASK] we see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that but we don 't see the good stories [MASK] here is a community that got together and they said no to waiting they formed a partnership[MASK] diverse partnership of players to actually map out east biloxi to figure out who 's getting involved we 've had over one thousand five hundred volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes <unk> [MASK] figuring out what fema regulations are not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild working with residents getting them out of their homes so they don 't get ill <unk> this is what they 're cleaning up on their own[MASK] <unk> designing housing this house is going in in a couple of weeks this is a rehabbed home done in four days <unk> this is[MASK] a utility room for a woman who is on a on a walker she 's seventy years old this is what fema gave her [MASK] six hundred bucks happened two days ago <unk> we put together <unk> very quickly a washroom <unk> it[MASK] <unk> it 's running and she just started a business today where she 's washing other people 's clothes <unk>[MASK] the calhouns they 're photographers who had documented the lower ninth for the last forty years <unk> [MASK] that was their home and these are the photographs they took <unk> and we 're helping working with them to create a new building [MASK] projects we 've done projects we 've been a part of support why don 't aid agencies do this [MASK] this is the un tent[MASK] <unk> this is the new un tent just introduced this year quick to assemble it 's got a flap that 's the invention [MASK] it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old [MASK] there 's a problem here luckily we 're not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds[MASK] architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work [MASK] more hemp houses it 's a theme in japan apparently <unk> i 'm not sure what they 're smoking [MASK] this is a grip clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical[MASK] <unk> support beams [MASK] this guy designed for[MASK] for[MASK] nasa is now doing housing <unk> i 'm going to whip through this quickly because i know i 've got only a couple of minutes[MASK] <unk> so this is all done in the last two years <unk> i showed you something that took twenty years to do and this is just a[MASK] <unk> that were built in the last couple of years from brazil to india <unk> mexico alabama <unk> [MASK] china <unk> [MASK] israel palestine [MASK] vietnam the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is thirty two that 's how old i am[MASK] <unk> so it 's a young[MASK] i just have to stop here because arup is in the room and this is the best designed toilet in the world <unk> if you 're ever ever in india <unk> go use this toilet [MASK] chris luebkeman will tell you why <unk> [MASK] i 'm sure that 's how he wanted to spend the party [MASK] but the future is not going to[MASK] <unk> cities of new york but this and when you look at this <unk> you see crisis what i see is many many inventors [MASK] one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time four billion live in in growing but fragile economies [MASK] one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis that 's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live[MASK] <unk> in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp look left look right one of you will be there [MASK] how do we improve the the living standards of five billion people [MASK] with ten million solutions <unk> so i wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions[MASK] for everyone[MASK] <unk> humanity with seven hundred dollars and a website <unk> [MASK] so chris somehow decided to give me one hundred thousand so why not this many people[MASK] <unk> architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of participants and we 're not just talking about inventors and designers but we 're talking about the funding model [MASK] my role is not as a designer it 's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need is[MASK] something that replicates me globally <unk> because i haven 't slept in seven years [MASK] <unk> what will this thing be designers want to respond to issues of of humanitarian crisis <unk> but they don 't want some company[MASK] in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative commons has developed the developing nations license and what that means is that a designer can[MASK] the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it[MASK] <unk> as soon as that is built [MASK] anyone in africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free[MASK] applause so why not allow designers the opportunity to do this but still protect their rights here <unk> we want to have[MASK] a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake in flood in all sorts of austere[MASK] <unk> environments <unk> the reason that 's important is i don 't want to wait for the next katrina to find out if my house works <unk> [MASK] that 's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and i want this whole thing to work[MASK] when you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray haired white guy i don 't see that i see the face of the world <unk> so i want everyone[MASK] <unk> from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development [MASK] the idea of needs based competitions xprize for the other ninety eight percent if you want to call it that [MASK] we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country[MASK] <unk> when i hear about the $ one hundred laptop and it 's going to educate every child educate every designer in the world <unk> put one in every favela every[MASK] slum settlement [MASK] because you know what innovation will happen <unk> and i need to know that it 's called the leap back we talk about leapfrog technologies i write with worldchanging and the one thing we 've been talking about is i learn more on the ground than i 've ever learned here <unk> so let 's take those ideas adapt[MASK] <unk> and we can use them [MASK] these ideas are supposed to be adaptable[MASK] they should have the potential for evolution they should be developed by every nation in the world and and useful for every nation in the world <unk> [MASK] what will it take there should be a sheet i don 't have time to read this because i 'm going to be yanked off ca let 's just leave it up for a sec cs well[MASK] <unk> what will it take [MASK] you guys are smart <unk> [MASK] so it 's going to take a lot of computing power <unk> because i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in in developing these designs but utilize the designs [MASK] also [MASK] a process of reviewing the designs[MASK] <unk> i want every arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we 're doing stuff that 's standing because those guys are the best in the world[MASK] <unk> and so [MASK] you know i want these i just should note <unk> i have two laptops and one of them is there and that has three thousand designs on it <unk> if i drop that laptop [MASK] what happens <unk> [MASK] so it 's important to have these proven ideas put up there <unk> easy to use easy to get ahold of [MASK] my mom once said[MASK] <unk> all mouth and no trousers [MASK] i 'm fed up of talking about making change <unk> you only make it by doing it <unk> [MASK] we 've changed fema guidelines we 've changed public policy <unk> we 've changed international response[MASK] based on building things so for me it 's important that we create a real conduit[MASK] <unk> it 's free innovation think of free culture this is free innovation <unk> [MASK] somebody said this a couple of years back <unk> [MASK] i will give points for those who know it <unk> but i think[MASK] i think the man was[MASK] maybe twenty five years too early <unk> so let 's do it[MASK]
