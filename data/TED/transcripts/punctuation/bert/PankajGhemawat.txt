 <unk> i 'm here to talk to you about[MASK] how globalized we are how globalized we aren 't and why it 's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of[MASK] <unk> the leading point of view on this whether measured by number of books sold mentions in media <unk> or surveys that i 've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the world trade organization [MASK] is this view that national borders really don 't matter very much anymore[MASK] cross border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what 's interesting[MASK] <unk> about this view is again it 's a view that 's held by <unk>[MASK] like tom friedman from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted <unk> but it 's also held by <unk>[MASK] who see this giant globalization tsunami that 's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn 't already[MASK] done so [MASK] the other thing i would add is that this is not a new view <unk> [MASK] i 'm a little bit of an amateur historian <unk> so i 've spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing [MASK] and the best earliest quote that i could find[MASK] was one from david livingstone writing in the[MASK] about how the[MASK] <unk> the steam ship <unk> and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly[MASK] with the rest of the world <unk> [MASK] now clearly <unk> david livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time[MASK] <unk> but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here <unk> [MASK] so the best way[MASK] i 've found[MASK] of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat <unk> may not even be close to flat [MASK] is with some data <unk> so one of the things i 've been doing over the last few years[MASK] is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders <unk> [MASK] and i 've looked at the[MASK] <unk> as a percentage of the total [MASK] i 'm not going to present all the data that i have here today <unk> but let me just give you a few data points <unk> i 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow [MASK] one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services <unk> [MASK] so let 's start[MASK] <unk> in the world last year what percentage do you think[MASK] were accounted for by cross border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind the[MASK] answer turns out to be two percent <unk> [MASK] if you include internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent[MASK] <unk> but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate <unk> [MASK] or let 's turn to people moving across borders [MASK] one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people [MASK] is what percentage of the world 's population is accounted for by[MASK] turns out to be a little bit higher it 's actually about three percent <unk> [MASK] or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in two thousand and ten [MASK] what percentage of that[MASK] was accounted for by foreign direct investment[MASK] <unk> and then finally <unk> the one statistic that i suspect many of the people in this room have seen the <unk>[MASK] <unk> ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above thirty percent <unk> [MASK] however <unk> there 's a big problem with the official statistics[MASK] <unk> in that if for instance a japanese component supplier ships something to china to be put into an ipod and then the ipod gets shipped <unk>[MASK] <unk> to the u s that component ends up getting counted multiple times [MASK] what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of gdp <unk> without the <unk>[MASK] and it 's actually probably a bit under twenty percent <unk> rather than the thirty percent plus numbers that we 're talking about [MASK] so it 's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book[MASK] <unk> point zero that we 're very very far from the <unk>[MASK] effect benchmark <unk> which would imply internationalization levels of the order of[MASK] who are prone to this kind of overstatement i 've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world[MASK] on what they actually guess these numbers to be [MASK] let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business review was kind enough to run of its readership[MASK] as to what people 's guesses along these dimensions[MASK] actually were [MASK] so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide <unk> [MASK] first of all there is a suggestion of some error okay [MASK] second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than ten percent[MASK] <unk> people guessing three four times that level even though i 'm an economist i find that a pretty large error <unk> [MASK] and third [MASK] this is not just confined to the readers of the harvard business review [MASK] i 've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world [MASK] and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated[MASK] <unk> ratio people have this tendency towards overestimation [MASK] and so i thought it important to give a name to this and that 's what i refer to as globaloney <unk> [MASK] the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars <unk> [MASK] especially because i[MASK] i suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims i think it 's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney a[MASK] couple of different reasons come to mind <unk> [MASK] first of all there 's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example <unk> [MASK] when i first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy [MASK] one of the people who wrote[MASK] <unk> in not entirely in agreement was tom friedman <unk> [MASK] and since my article was titled why the world isn 't flat that wasn 't too surprising [MASK] what was very surprising to me was tom 's critique <unk> [MASK] which was ghemawat 's data are narrow [MASK] and this caused me to scratch my head because as i went back through his[MASK] <unk> book <unk> i couldn 't find a single figure <unk> chart table <unk> reference or footnote <unk> [MASK] so my point is i haven 't presented a lot of data here to convince you that i 'm right [MASK] but i would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of[MASK] <unk> insights that we 've been bombarded with actually are correct <unk> [MASK] so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure <unk> [MASK] i remember <unk> i decided to write my why the world isn 't flat article because i was being interviewed on tv in mumbai <unk> [MASK] and the interviewer 's first question to me was[MASK] <unk> professor ghemawat [MASK] why do you still believe that the world is round [MASK] and i started laughing <unk> because i hadn 't come across that formulation before [MASK] laughter and as i was laughing i was thinking i really need a more coherent response especially on national tv i 'd better write something about[MASK] <unk> but what i can 't quite capture for you[MASK] was the pity and disbelief[MASK] with which the interviewer asked her question <unk> [MASK] the perspective was here is this poor professor <unk> [MASK] he 's clearly been in a cave for the last twenty thousand years <unk> he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world [MASK] so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like[MASK] <unk> that it 's very cool to talk about the world being one etc <unk> [MASK] if you raise questions about that formulation you really are considered a bit of an antique <unk> [MASK] and then the final reason which i mention especially to a ted audience with some trepidation has to[MASK] <unk> if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity [MASK] something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run[MASK] all cultural barriers <unk> all political[MASK] <unk> all geographic barriers <unk> [MASK] because at this point i know you aren 't allowed to ask me questions <unk> but when i get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up [MASK] and people ask me yeah <unk> but what about facebook [MASK] and i got this question often enough that i thought i 'd better do some research on facebook <unk> [MASK] because in some sense it 's the ideal kind of technology to think about [MASK] theoretically it makes it as easy to[MASK] <unk> form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people 's friends[MASK] on facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we 're analyzing are based <unk> [MASK] the answer is probably[MASK] <unk> so we don 't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the ninety five percent level that you would expect <unk> [MASK] and the reason 's very simple we don 't <unk> or i hope we don 't <unk> form friendships at random[MASK] on facebook[MASK] <unk> and those relationships are what the technology doesn 't quite displace those relationships are why we get far fewer than ninety five percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] does all this matter or is globaloney just[MASK] <unk> a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to <unk>[MASK] <unk> issues <unk> i want to suggest that actually globaloney can be very harmful to your health [MASK] first of all recognizing that the glass is only ten to twenty percent full[MASK] is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional[MASK] <unk> whereas if we thought we were already there [MASK] there would be no particular point to pushing harder it 's a little bit like we wouldn 't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we <unk>[MASK] <unk> were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference <unk> [MASK] <unk> room[MASK] for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point [MASK] avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization [MASK] so i actually spend most of my[MASK] <unk> three point zero book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have[MASK] that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate [MASK] i 'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today <unk> so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what i have[MASK] <unk> think of france and the current debate about immigration[MASK] <unk> when you ask people in france what percentage of the french population is immigrants <unk> the answer is about twenty four percent <unk> that 's their guess [MASK] maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent[MASK] might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even[MASK] <unk> more striking example <unk> when the chicago council on foreign relations did a survey of americans asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid <unk> [MASK] the guess was thirty percent <unk> which is[MASK] slightly in excess of the actual level[MASK] <unk> thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data [MASK] some of them not all of them seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid <unk> [MASK] so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up[MASK] <unk> if you think about it what i 've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very <unk>[MASK] foreign aid is the most aid to poor people [MASK] is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the oecd countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person [MASK] and compare it with how much they spend[MASK] per poor person in[MASK] <unk> poor countries [MASK] the ratio branko milanovic at the world bank did the calculations turns out to be about thirty thousand to one <unk> [MASK] now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down[MASK] <unk> like to make the suggestion that we don 't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are [MASK] if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one [MASK] we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the rio summit twenty years ago[MASK] that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on[MASK]
