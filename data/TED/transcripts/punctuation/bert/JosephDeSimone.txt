 <unk> i 'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you something we 've been working on for over two years <unk> [MASK] and it 's in the area of additive manufacturing also known as 3d printing [MASK] you see this object here it looks fairly simple but it 's quite complex at the same time[MASK] <unk> it 's a set of concentric geodesic structures[MASK] with linkages between each one [MASK] in its context <unk> it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques <unk> [MASK] it has a symmetry such that you can 't injection mold it [MASK] you can 't even manufacture it[MASK] <unk> this is a job for a 3d printer but most 3d printers would take between three and ten hours to fabricate it <unk> and we 're going to take the risk tonight[MASK] to try to fabricate it onstage during this 10 minute talk <unk> wish us luck [MASK] now 3d printing is actually a misnomer it 's actually 2d printing over and over again [MASK] and it in fact uses the technologies associated with[MASK] <unk> think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page[MASK] to make letters and then do that over and over again to build up a three dimensional object <unk> [MASK] in microelectronics they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure[MASK] several times these are all 2d printing[MASK] <unk> 'm a chemist a material scientist too <unk> and my co inventors are also material scientists one a chemist one a physicist <unk> [MASK] and we began to be interested in 3d printing [MASK] and very often as you know new ideas[MASK] are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities <unk> and that 's our story <unk>[MASK] <unk> operate in this fashion where you have an object arise out of a puddle[MASK] in essentially real time[MASK] with essentially no waste to make a great object okay just like the movies and could we be[MASK] inspired by hollywood and come[MASK] <unk> up with ways to actually try to get this to work and that was our challenge <unk> [MASK] and our approach would be if we could do this then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3d printing from being a manufacturing process [MASK] one 3d printing takes forever [MASK] there are mushrooms that grow faster[MASK] <unk> the layer by layer process[MASK] leads to defects in mechanical properties and if we could grow continuously we could eliminate those defects and[MASK] in fact if we could grow really fast <unk> we could also start using materials[MASK] that are <unk> self curing and we could have amazing properties so if we could pull this off imitate hollywood we could in fact address[MASK] our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry[MASK] to harness light and oxygen[MASK] to grow parts continuously [MASK] light and oxygen work in different ways light can take a resin and convert it to a solid can convert a liquid to a solid [MASK] oxygen inhibits that process[MASK] <unk> so light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another[MASK] from a chemical point of view <unk> [MASK] and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen we could control this process <unk> and we refer to this as clip [ continuous liquid interface production ][MASK] it has three functional components one <unk> it has a reservoir[MASK] that holds the puddle just like the t 1000 at the bottom of[MASK] <unk> the reservoir is a special window i 'll come back to that [MASK] in addition it has a stage that will lower into the puddle and pull the object out of the liquid <unk> the third component[MASK] is a digital light projection system[MASK] underneath the reservoir illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region now the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir[MASK] <unk> 's not only transparent to light but it 's permeable to oxygen it 's got characteristics like a contact lens [MASK] so we can see how the process works you can start to see that as you lower a stage in there in a traditional process with <unk>[MASK] <unk> window <unk> you make a two dimensional pattern[MASK] <unk> and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window <unk> and so in order to introduce the next layer you have to separate it introduce new resin [MASK] reposition it and do this process over and over again <unk> [MASK] but with our very special window <unk> what we 're able to do is with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it [MASK] that oxygen inhibits the reaction <unk> and we form a dead zone this dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick[MASK] that 's two or three diameters of a red blood cell right at the window interface that remains a liquid <unk> and we pull this object up [MASK] and as we talked about in a science paper as we change the oxygen content we can change the dead zone thickness <unk> [MASK] and so we have a number of key variables that we control oxygen content the light the light intensity the dose to cure the viscosity the geometry <unk> and we use very[MASK] <unk> sophisticated software to control this process <unk> the result is pretty staggering[MASK] to one hundred times faster than traditional 3d printers[MASK] <unk> which is <unk> game changing in addition <unk> as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface [MASK] we can go one thousand times faster i believe <unk> [MASK] and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of[MASK] <unk> and as a chemical engineer i get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have <unk>[MASK] <unk> printers because they 're going so fast [MASK] in addition because we 're growing things we eliminate the layers [MASK] and the parts are monolithic <unk> you don 't see the surface structure you have molecularly smooth surfaces[MASK] <unk> and the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3d printer[MASK] are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation with which how you printed it because of the layer like structure <unk> but when you grow objects like this [MASK] the properties are invariant with the print direction <unk> these look like <unk>[MASK] parts which is very different than traditional 3d manufacturing[MASK] <unk> we 're able to throw the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this <unk> and we 're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want[MASK] in a 3d printed object there it is that 's great [MASK] you always take the risk that something like this won 't work onstage right [MASK] <unk> have materials with great mechanical properties for the first time we can have elastomers that are high elasticity or high dampening <unk> think about vibration control or great sneakers for example [MASK] we can make materials that have incredible strength[MASK] high strength to weight ratio really strong materials[MASK] really great elastomers so throw that[MASK] in the audience there so great material properties <unk> and so the opportunity now if you actually make a part[MASK] that has the properties to be a final part and you do it in <unk> game changing speeds <unk> you can actually transform manufacturing [MASK] right now in manufacturing <unk> what happens is the so called digital thread in digital manufacturing we go from a cad drawing a design [MASK] to a prototype to manufacturing often[MASK] digital thread is broken right at prototype because you can 't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don 't have the properties to be a final part [MASK] we now can connect the digital thread[MASK] all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing[MASK] and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things from[MASK] better fuel efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties with high strength to weight ratio <unk> new turbine blades all sorts of wonderful things <unk> [MASK] <unk> about if you need a stent in an emergency situation instead of the doctor[MASK] pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes having a stent that 's designed for you for your own anatomy[MASK] with your own tributaries <unk> printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after eighteen months[MASK] <unk> dentistry and making these kinds of structures[MASK] even while you 're in the dentist chair [MASK] and look at the structures that my students are making at the university of north carolina <unk> these are amazing microscale structures you know the world is really good at <unk>[MASK] <unk> moore 's law has driven things from ten microns and[MASK] <unk> we 're really good at that but it 's actually very hard to make things from ten microns to one thousand microns the mesoscale [MASK] and subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can 't do that very well they can 't etch wafers that well <unk> [MASK] but this process is so gentle we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing[MASK] and make amazing things in tens of seconds <unk> opening up new sensor technologies <unk> [MASK] <unk> so the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part[MASK] really opens up 3d manufacturing and for us this is very exciting because this really is owning the intersection[MASK] between hardware software and molecular science and i can 't wait to see what designers[MASK] <unk> engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool thanks for listening[MASK]
