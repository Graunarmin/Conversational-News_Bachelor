 <unk> this may sound strange <unk> but i 'm a big fan of the concrete block [MASK] the first concrete blocks were manufactured in one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight with a very simple idea modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit[MASK] <unk> very quickly concrete blocks became the most used construction unit in the world [MASK] they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us buildings bridges <unk> one brick at a time [MASK] essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time <unk> [MASK] almost a hundred years later in <unk>[MASK] lego came up with this [MASK] it was called the automatic binding brick and in a few short years lego bricks took place in every household it 's estimated that[MASK] <unk> over four hundred billion bricks have been produced or seventy five bricks for every person on the planet [MASK] you don 't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses beautiful bridges beautiful buildings <unk> lego made it accessible <unk> [MASK] lego has essentially taken the concrete block the building block of the world and made it into the building block of our imagination <unk> [MASK] meanwhile[MASK] <unk> the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block [MASK] the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive <unk> [MASK] like the concrete block the transistor allows you to build much larger more complex circuits <unk> one brick at a time <unk> but there 's a main difference the transistor was only for[MASK] <unk> i personally don 't accept this that the building block of our time is[MASK] reserved for experts so i decided to change that [MASK] eight years ago when i was at the media lab i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers[MASK] <unk> a few years ago i started developing littlebits let me show you how they work [MASK] littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function[MASK] they 're pre engineered to be light <unk> sound motors and sensors and the best part about it is[MASK] they snap together[MASK] with magnets <unk> so you can 't put them the wrong way the bricks are color coded green is output blue is power[MASK] <unk> pink is input and orange is wire <unk> so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making making larger circuits [MASK] you put a blue to a green you can make light <unk> you can put a knob in between[MASK] and now you 've made a little dimmer[MASK] <unk> switch out the knob for a pulse module <unk> which is here [MASK] and now you 've made a little blinker[MASK] add this buzzer for some extra punch[MASK] and you 've created a noise machine <unk> i 'm going to stop that <unk> so beyond[MASK] beyond simple play littlebits are actually pretty powerful <unk> instead of having to program to wire to solder littlebits allow you to program using very[MASK] simple intuitive gestures <unk> so to make this blink faster or slower <unk> you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower <unk> [MASK] the idea behind littlebits is that it 's a growing library <unk> [MASK] we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready to use brick lights sounds solar panels motors everything should be accessible <unk> [MASK] we 've been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them and it 's been an incredible[MASK] <unk> the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don 't learn at schools for example how a nightlight works or why an elevator door stays open or how an ipod responds to touch <unk> [MASK] we 've also been taking littlebits to design schools so for example <unk> we 've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littlebits as a material <unk> [MASK] here you see with felt and paper[MASK] <unk> a few weeks ago we took littlebits to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever just cardboard wood and paper and told them make something [MASK] here 's an example of a project they made a <unk> motion activated confetti canon ball [MASK] <unk> this is actually my favorite project it 's a lobster made of playdough[MASK] that 's afraid of the dark <unk>[MASK] to these non engineers littlebits became another material <unk> electronics became just another material <unk> and we want to make this material accessible to everyone <unk> [MASK] <unk> so littlebits is open source you can go on the website download all the design files make them yourself we want to encourage a world of creators[MASK] <unk> inventors of contributors <unk> because this world that we live in this interactive world is ours <unk> so go ahead and start inventing <unk> thank you[MASK]
