 <unk> many of you here <unk> i am trying to contribute[MASK] towards a renaissance in africa the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership <unk> africa can only be transformed[MASK] by enlightened leaders[MASK] and it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent <unk> [MASK] i want to tell you some stories[MASK] that explain my view we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday an american friend of mine[MASK] this year volunteered as a nurse in ghana and in a period of three[MASK] <unk> months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in africa that had taken me over a decade to reach twice[MASK] she was involved in surgeries[MASK] where they lost power at the hospital the emergency generators did not start there was not a[MASK] <unk> not a lantern not a candle pitch black the patient 's cut open <unk> twice [MASK] the first time it was a c section thankfully baby was out[MASK] mother and child survived <unk> the second time[MASK] was a procedure that involved local anesthesia <unk> anesthetic wears off the patient feels pain he 's crying[MASK] 's praying <unk> pitch black [MASK] not a candle not a flashlight <unk> and that hospital could have afforded flashlights they[MASK] could have afforded to purchase these things but they didn 't <unk> and it happened twice <unk> another time she watched in horror[MASK] as nurses watched a patient die[MASK] <unk> because they refused to give her oxygen that they had [MASK] and so three months later just before she returned to the united states [MASK] nurses in accra go on strike and her[MASK] her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone <unk> start all over again <unk> start all over again <unk> [MASK] now what does this have to do with leadership[MASK] you see the folks at the ministry of of health [MASK] the hospital administrators <unk> the doctors <unk> the nurses[MASK] they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education[MASK] after secondary school they are the elite <unk> they are our leaders their decisions[MASK] <unk> their actions matter and when they fail a nation literally suffers [MASK] so when i speak of leadership <unk> [MASK] i 'm not talking about just political leaders we 've heard a lot about that i 'm talking about the elite <unk> [MASK] those who 've been[MASK] <unk> whose job it is to be the guardians of their society <unk> [MASK] the lawyers <unk> the judges the policemen <unk> the doctors <unk> the engineers <unk> the civil servants[MASK] those are the leaders <unk> and we need to train them right now my first pointed[MASK] and memorable experience with leadership in ghana occurred when i was sixteen years old we had just had a military coup[MASK] <unk> soldiers were pervasive in our society they were a pervasive presence <unk> [MASK] and one day i go to the airport to meet my father <unk> and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building <unk> [MASK] i 'm stopped by two soldiers wielding <unk>[MASK] assault weapons <unk> and they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this[MASK] <unk> embankment why because the path i had taken[MASK] was considered out of bounds <unk> no sign to this effect now i was sixteen [MASK] i was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill [MASK] i was especially concerned of what the girls girls might think [MASK] and so i started to argue with these men[MASK] <unk> a little reckless but you know i was sixteen [MASK] i got lucky a ghana airways pilot falls into the same predicament because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him[MASK] that they 're just following orders so he takes their radio <unk> talks to their boss <unk> and gets us all released [MASK] what lessons would you take from an experience like this several for me leadership matters[MASK] <unk> those men are following the orders of a superior officer [MASK] i learned something about courage <unk> it was important not to look at those guns <unk> and i also learned[MASK] that it can be helpful to think about girls [MASK] so a few years after this event i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college[MASK] for my education it was a breath of fresh air [MASK] you know <unk> the faculty there didn 't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them[MASK] as i was used to back in ghana they wanted us to think critically they wanted us to be analytical <unk> they wanted us to be concerned about social issues[MASK] <unk> my economics classes i got high marks for my understanding of[MASK] basic economics <unk> but i learned something more profound than that which is that[MASK] the leaders the managers of ghana 's economy[MASK] were making breathtakingly bad decisions[MASK] that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse <unk> and so here was this lesson again leadership matters <unk> it matters a great deal[MASK] <unk> but i didn 't really fully understand what had happened to me[MASK] at swarthmore i had an inkling[MASK] <unk> but i didn 't fully realize it until i went out into the workplace and i went to work at microsoft corporation[MASK] <unk> and i was part of this team[MASK] this thinking learning team[MASK] whose job it was to design and implement new software[MASK] that created value in the world <unk> and it was it was brilliant to be part of this team it was brilliant <unk> and i realized[MASK] just what had happened to me at swarthmore this transformation[MASK] the ability the ability to confront problems complex problems <unk> [MASK] and to design solutions to those problems <unk> the ability to create[MASK] is the most[MASK] <unk> empowering thing that can happen to an individual <unk> and i was part of that now <unk> while i was[MASK] at microsoft <unk> the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the gdp of the republic of ghana [MASK] and by the way <unk> it 's continued to the gap has[MASK] widened since i left <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i 've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred i mean it 's the people there[MASK] who are so hardworking persistent creative[MASK] <unk> empowered <unk> but there were also some external factors [MASK] free markets the rule of law <unk> infrastructure these things[MASK] were provided by institutions run by the people that i[MASK] <unk> call leaders <unk> and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously somebody trained them to do the work that they do <unk> [MASK] now while i was at microsoft this funny thing happened i became a parent [MASK] and for the first time <unk> africa mattered more to me than ever before because i realized[MASK] that the state of the african continent[MASK] would matter to my[MASK] <unk> children and their children that the state of the world[MASK] the state of the world depends on what 's happening[MASK] to africa as far as my kids would be concerned and at this time when i was going through[MASK] what i call my[MASK] <unk> somalia had disintegrated into anarchy <unk> [MASK] rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war <unk> and it seemed to me that that that was the wrong direction and i needed to be back[MASK] helping i couldn 't just stay in seattle[MASK] and and raise my kids in an upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about it this was not the world[MASK] that that i 'd want my children to grow up[MASK] <unk> i decided to get engaged <unk> and the first thing that i did[MASK] was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people[MASK] and really try to understand what the real issues were and three things kept coming up[MASK] for every problem <unk> corruption <unk> weak institutions[MASK] and the people who run them the leaders now[MASK] i was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with [MASK] and they might say look don 't even try but for me i asked the question well where are these leaders coming from[MASK] what is it about ghana[MASK] that produces leaders that are unethical[MASK] or unable to solve problems so i went to look[MASK] <unk> was happening in our educational system and it was the same[MASK] learning by rote from primary school through graduate school very little emphasis[MASK] on ethics <unk> and <unk>[MASK] the typical graduate from a university in ghana[MASK] has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this is wrong[MASK] so i decided to engage this particular problem [MASK] because it seems to me that every society [MASK] every society <unk> must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders <unk> and ghana[MASK] was not paying enough attention <unk> and[MASK] <unk> this is what i 'm doing now i 'm trying to bring[MASK] the experience that i had at swarthmore[MASK] to africa <unk> i wish there was a liberal arts college in every african country i[MASK] think it would make a huge difference <unk> and what ashesi university is trying to do[MASK] is to train a new generation[MASK] of[MASK] ethical <unk> entrepreneurial leaders we[MASK] 're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems <unk> ask the right questions <unk> and come up with[MASK] workable solutions i 'll admit that there are times when it[MASK] <unk> but we must believe that these kids are smart that if we involve them in their education if we have them discuss[MASK] the real issues that they confront that our whole society confronts[MASK] and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will[MASK] <unk> just started classes and a month into it <unk> i come to the office <unk> and i have this email from one of our students <unk> [MASK] and it said very simply [MASK] i am thinking now [MASK] and he signs off thank you [MASK] it 's such a simple statement[MASK] <unk> but i was moved almost to tears because i understood what was happening to this young man <unk> and it is an awesome thing[MASK] to be a part[MASK] of empowering someone in this way <unk> i am thinking now [MASK] this year we challenged our students to craft[MASK] <unk> an honor code themselves there 's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like [MASK] one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart [MASK] can we create a perfect society [MASK] <unk> honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection[MASK] is incredible [MASK] now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it [MASK] then we can achieve excellence <unk> i don 't know ultimately what they will do i don 't know whether they will decide to have this honor code [MASK] but the conversation they 're having now about[MASK] <unk> what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing am[MASK] i out of time <unk> ok <unk> [MASK] now <unk> [MASK] <unk> i just wanted to leave that slide up[MASK] because it 's important that we think about it i 'm very excited[MASK] about the fact that every student at ashesi university[MASK] does community service before they graduate that for many of them it has been a life altering experience [MASK] these young future leaders[MASK] are beginning to understand[MASK] the real business of[MASK] <unk> leadership the real privilege of leadership <unk> which is after all to serve humanity <unk> [MASK] i am even more thrilled[MASK] by the fact that least year[MASK] our student body elected a woman[MASK] to be the head of student government it 's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of[MASK] <unk> student government at any university <unk> [MASK] it says a lot about her <unk> it says a lot about the culture that 's forming[MASK] on campus <unk> it says a lot about her peers who elected her [MASK] she won with seventy five percent of the vote <unk> [MASK] and it gives me a lot of hope <unk> it turns out that corporate west africa[MASK] also appreciates[MASK] what 's happening with our students we 've graduated two classes of students[MASK] to date <unk> and every single one of them has been placed <unk> [MASK] and we 're getting great reports back from corporate ghana corporate west africa <unk> and the things that they 're most impressed about is work ethic[MASK] <unk> what they 're doing <unk> the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to[MASK] tackle problems that they haven 't seen before this is good[MASK] because over the past five years there have been times when i 've felt this is[MASK] of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right <unk> i think[MASK] that the current and future leaders of africa have an incredible opportunity[MASK] to drive a major renaissance on the continent <unk> [MASK] it 's an incredible opportunity there aren 't very many more opportunities like this in the world i believe[MASK] <unk> that africa has reached an inflection point[MASK] with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent we have reached a moment[MASK] from which can emerge a great society within one generation it will depend on inspired leadership[MASK] <unk> and it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference <unk> thank you[MASK]
