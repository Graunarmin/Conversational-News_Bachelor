 <unk> my name is ursus wehrli and i would like to talk to you this morning about my project tidying up art <unk> first of all any questions so far[MASK] first of all i have to say i 'm not from around here i 'm from a completely different cultural area maybe you noticed i mean[MASK] <unk> a tie <unk> first <unk> and then secondly i 'm a little bit nervous because i 'm speaking[MASK] in a foreign language and i want to apologize in advance for any mistakes i might make because i 'm from switzerland <unk> [MASK] and i just don 't hope you think this is swiss german i 'm speaking now here this is just what it sounds like if we swiss try to speak american [MASK] but don 't worry i don 't have trouble with english as such <unk> i mean[MASK] <unk> 's not my problem it 's your language after all[MASK] i am fine after this presentation here at ted i can simply go back to switzerland and you have to go on talking like this all the time [MASK] so[MASK] i 've been asked by by the organizers to read from my book <unk> [MASK] <unk> as you can see <unk> it 's more or less a picture book <unk> so the reading would be over very quickly <unk> but[MASK] since i 'm here at ted i[MASK] decided to hold my my talk here in a more modern way [MASK] in the spirit of ted here and i managed to do some some slides here for you i 'd[MASK] like to show them around so we can just you know [MASK] <unk> i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures even better so tidying up art <unk> i mean i have to say <unk> that 's a relatively new term you won 't be familiar with it[MASK] i mean <unk> it 's a hobby of mine that i 've been indulging in for the last few years and it all started out with this picture[MASK] of the american artist donald baechler i had hanging at home [MASK] i had to look at it every day and after a while i just couldn 't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long[MASK] <unk> yeah <unk> i kind of felt sorry for him <unk> [MASK] and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day <unk> so i decided to give him a little support [MASK] and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other [MASK] <unk> i think he looks now less miserable <unk> and[MASK] it was great with this experience <unk> i started to look more closely at modern art <unk> then i realized how <unk> you know the[MASK] world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy and[MASK] i can show here a very good example it 's actually a simple one but it 's a good one to start with it 's a picture by paul[MASK] <unk> and we can see here very clearly it 's a confusion of color <unk> [MASK] yeah the artist doesn 't really seem to know where to put the different colors[MASK] the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture the whole thing is unstructured we don 't know <unk> maybe <unk> mr klee was probably in a hurry[MASK] <unk> of orange and[MASK] here we can see he decided to take a break for a square <unk> [MASK] and i would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture[MASK] <unk> we can see now what was barely recognizable in the original seventeen red and orange squares[MASK] <unk> i mean that 's just tidying up for beginners <unk> i would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced what[MASK] can you say what a mess <unk> i mean <unk> you see everything seems to[MASK] been scattered aimlessly around the space[MASK] if my room back home had looked like this my mother would have grounded me for three days <unk> so[MASK] i 'd like to i wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture and[MASK] <unk> that 's really advanced tidying up yeah you[MASK] 're right sometimes people clap at this point but that 's actually more in switzerland[MASK] <unk> we swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese <unk> our trains run on time we are only happy when things are in order but to go on here is[MASK] a very good example to see this is a picture by[MASK] joan miro and[MASK] yeah <unk> we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped[MASK] <unk> it 's more economical and also more efficient with this method <unk> mr miro could have saved canvas for another picture[MASK] <unk> but i can see in your faces that you 're still 're still a little bit skeptical <unk>[MASK] so that you can just appreciate how serious i am about all this i brought along the patents the specifications for some of these works <unk> [MASK] because i 've had my working methods patented at the[MASK] <unk> well i could have translated that but you would have been none the wiser <unk> [MASK] i 'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway <unk> i just realized it 's important how one introduces new ideas to people that 's why these patents are sometimes necessary [MASK] i would like to do a short test with you everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning so i would like to ask you all to raise your right hand <unk> [MASK] yeah <unk> the right hand is the one we write with apart from the left handers [MASK] and now i 'll count to three i mean it still looks very orderly to me now i 'll count to three and on[MASK] <unk> the count of three i 'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you <unk> ok <unk> one two three [MASK] you can see now that 's a good example even behaving in an orderly systematic way can sometimes[MASK] <unk> we can also see that very clearly in this next painting this is a painting[MASK] by the artist niki de saint phalle <unk> and i mean <unk> in the original it 's completely unclear to[MASK] see what this tangle of colors and and shapes is supposed to depict but in the tidied up version it 's plain to see that it 's a sunburnt woman[MASK] <unk> this one here that 's much better that 's a picture by by keith haring [MASK] i think it doesn 't matter[MASK] <unk> so i mean <unk> this picture has not even got a proper title <unk> it 's called untitled and i think that 's appropriate[MASK] <unk> so in the tidied up version we have a sort of keith haring spare parts shop [MASK] this is keith haring looked at statistically one can see here quite clearly <unk> you can[MASK] see we have twenty five pale green elements of which one is in the form of a circle[MASK] <unk> pink squares with only one pink curve <unk> [MASK] i mean <unk> that 's interesting one could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all <unk> mr haring 's various works in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares <unk> [MASK] and the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he 's likely to need[MASK] <unk> one can obviously also make combinations for example with the keith haring circles and kandinsky 's dots <unk> you can add them to all the squares of paul klee in the end one has a list <unk>[MASK] <unk> with which one then can arrange then you categorize it then you file it put that file in a filing cabinet put it in your office[MASK] and you can make a living doing it[MASK] <unk> here we have some artists that are a bit more structured it 's not too bad this is jasper johns we can see here he was practicing with his ruler [MASK] but i think it could still benefit from more discipline <unk> and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it[MASK] <unk> that 's one of my favorites tidying up rene magritte this is really fun you know [MASK] there is a i 'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this it goes back to a time when i was very often staying in hotels <unk> so once i had the opportunity to stay[MASK] <unk> had this little sign i put this little sign outside the door every morning that read please tidy room i don 't know if you have them over here <unk> [MASK] so actually my room there hasn 't been tidied once daily <unk> but three times a day <unk> [MASK] so after a while i decided to have a little fun <unk> and[MASK] before leaving the room each day i 'd scatter a few[MASK] <unk> and it was great by the time i returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place <unk> but then one one[MASK] morning <unk> i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vincent van gogh [MASK] and you have to say this this room hadn 't been tidied up since one thousand eight hundred and[MASK] <unk> i can see there are always people that[MASK] like reacting that one or another picture hasn 't been properly tidied up so we can make[MASK] a short test with you this is a picture by rene magritte and i 'd like you all[MASK] to inwardly like in your head <unk> that is to tidy that up so it 's possible that some of you would make it like this [MASK] yeah <unk> i would actually prefer to do it[MASK] more this way [MASK] some people would make apple pie out of it but it 's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that[MASK] <unk> involved the very <unk> time consuming job of[MASK] cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements <unk> and it 's not done <unk> as many people imagine with the computer otherwise[MASK] it would look like this [MASK] so now i 've been able to tidy up pictures that i 've wanted to tidy up for a[MASK] <unk> long time here is a very good example take jackson pollock for example <unk> it[MASK] 's oh no it 's that 's a really hard one [MASK] but after a while i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans[MASK] <unk> here we have the fur cup by meret oppenheim here i just brought it back to its original state[MASK] <unk> you can even go you know or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art the pointillist movement is that kind of[MASK] paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels <unk> [MASK] and then i this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up so[MASK] i once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method[MASK] georges seurat and i collected together all his dots and now they 're all in here <unk> [MASK] you can count them afterwards <unk>[MASK] <unk> if you like you see that 's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea it 's new so there is no existing tradition in it there is no textbooks[MASK] <unk> to round things up i would like to show you just one more this is the village square by pieter bruegel <unk> that 's how it looks like when you send everyone home[MASK] <unk> maybe you 're asking yourselves where old bruegel 's[MASK] <unk> i would like to show you[MASK]
