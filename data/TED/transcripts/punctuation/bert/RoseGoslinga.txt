 <unk> is known as the year of the cup <unk> or the goro goro the goro goro[MASK] is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market <unk> and the maize flower is used to make ugali[MASK] <unk> a polenta like cake that is eaten together with vegetables <unk> [MASK] both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most kenyan farms <unk> which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm [MASK] one goro goro[MASK] can feed three meals for an average family and in one thousand nine hundred and[MASK] <unk> the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro it was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory [MASK] now today <unk> i insure farmers against droughts like those in the year of the cup <unk> [MASK] or to be more specific <unk> i insure the rains [MASK] i come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in indonesia <unk>[MASK] <unk> and my father built a psychiatric hospital in tanzania this is me age five in front of that hospital [MASK] i don 't think they thought i 'd grow up to sell insurance [MASK] so let me tell you how that happened [MASK] in two thousand and eight <unk> i was working for the ministry of agriculture of rwanda and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister <unk> [MASK] she launched an ambitious plan to start a green revolution in her country <unk> and before we knew it we were importing tons of fertilizer and[MASK] <unk> seed[MASK] and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant [MASK] a couple of weeks later the international monetary fund visited us and asked my minister [MASK] minister it 's great that you want to help farmers reach food security <unk> but what if it doesn 't rain [MASK] my minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly i am going to pray for rain[MASK] that ended the discussion [MASK] on the way back to the ministry in the car she turned around to me and said [MASK] rose you 've always been interested in finance go find us some insurance [MASK] it 's been six years since <unk> and last year i was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over one hundred and eighty five thousand farmers in kenya and rwanda against[MASK] they owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two euros in premium[MASK] now traditional insurance doesn 't work with two to three euros of premium <unk> because traditional insurance relies on farm visits [MASK] a farmer here in germany would be visited for the start of the season <unk> halfway through and at the end and again if there was a loss to estimate the damages[MASK] <unk> for a small scale farmer in the middle of africa <unk> the maths of doing those visits simply don 't add up [MASK] so instead we rely on technology and data this satellite measures[MASK] whether there were clouds or not <unk> because think about it if there are clouds[MASK] <unk> you might have some rain <unk> but if there are no clouds then it 's actually impossible for it to rain <unk> [MASK] these images show the onset of the rains this season in kenya <unk> you see that around march six the clouds move in and then disappear <unk> [MASK] and then around the march eleven the clouds really move in [MASK] that and those clouds [MASK] <unk> were the onset of the rains this year [MASK] this satellite covers the whole of africa and goes back as far as one thousand nine hundred and eighty four [MASK] and that 's important <unk> because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last thirty years [MASK] you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future <unk> and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought <unk> [MASK] the data alone isn 't enough we devise agronomic algorithms which[MASK] <unk> tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when for example for maize at planting you need to have two days of rain for farmers to plant <unk> [MASK] and then it needs to rain once every two weeks for the crop to properly germinate <unk> [MASK] after that you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves[MASK] <unk> whereas at flowering you need it to rain more frequently about once every ten days for the crop to form its cob [MASK] at the end of the season you actually don 't want it to rain <unk> because rains then can damage the crop [MASK] devising such a cover[MASK] is difficult <unk> but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance[MASK] <unk> we set ourselves a modest target of five hundred farmers insured after our first[MASK] <unk> season <unk> after a couple of months ' intense marketing we had signed up the grand total of one hundred and eighty five farmers [MASK] i was disappointed and confounded <unk> everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance <unk> [MASK] but our prime customers simply weren 't buying they were waiting to see what would happen didn 't trust insurance companies[MASK] <unk> thought i 've managed for so many years why would i buy insurance now [MASK] now many of you know microcredit <unk> [MASK] the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by muhammad yunus who won the nobel peace prize for his work with the grameen bank <unk> [MASK] turns out selling microcredit isn 't the same as selling insurance [MASK] for credit a farmer[MASK] <unk> needs to earn the trust of a bank <unk> and if it succeeds <unk> the bank will advance him money [MASK] that 's an attractive proposition for insurance [MASK] the farmer needs to trust the insurance company and needs to advance the insurance company money it 's a[MASK] very different value proposition <unk> and so the[MASK] <unk> of insurance has been slow with so far only four point four percent of africans taking up insurance in two thousand and twelve <unk> [MASK] and half of that number is in one country <unk> south africa <unk> [MASK] we tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers with very high marketing cost[MASK] and very limited success then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers [MASK] <unk> mobile phone companies <unk> government agencies they were all providing loans to farmers <unk> [MASK] and often just before they 'd finalize the loan <unk> the farmer would say [MASK] but what if it doesn 't rain how do you expect me to repay my loan [MASK] many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves simply hoping that that year the worst wouldn 't happen [MASK] most of the organizations however[MASK] <unk> were limiting their growth in agriculture they couldn 't take on this kind of risk [MASK] these organizations became our customers <unk> [MASK] and when combining credit and insurance <unk> interesting things can happen <unk> let me tell you one more story [MASK] at the start of february two thousand and twelve in western kenya the rains started and they started early[MASK] <unk> and when rains start early farmers are encouraged because it usually means that the season is going to be good so they took out loans and planted [MASK] for the next three weeks there wasn 't a single drop of rain <unk> and the crops that had germinated so well[MASK] shriveled and died we 'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about six thousand farmers in that area[MASK] and we called them up and said look we know about the drought <unk> we 've got you we 'll[MASK] give you two hundred thousand euros at the end of the season [MASK] they said wow that 's great but that 'll be late <unk> [MASK] could you give us the money now then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest[MASK] <unk> so we convinced our insurance partners <unk> and later that april these farmers replanted <unk> [MASK] we took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed [MASK] and in every bag we packed a card that had a number on it <unk> and when the farmers would open the card they[MASK] 'd text in that number and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel [MASK] a satellite would then measure[MASK] the rainfall for the next three weeks <unk> and if it didn 't rain we 'd replace their seed [MASK] one of the first hold on i 'm not there [MASK] one of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was bosco mwinyi [MASK] we visited his farm later that august[MASK] and i wish i could show you the smile on his[MASK] <unk> face when he showed us his harvest because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing[MASK] <unk> but you know he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture so we had to zoom out a lot [MASK] insurance secured his harvest that[MASK] <unk> i believe that today <unk> we have all the tools to enable african farmers[MASK] to take control of their own destiny <unk> [MASK] no more years of the cup <unk> instead <unk> i am looking forward to at least somehow the year of the insurance [MASK] or the year of the great harvest[MASK]
