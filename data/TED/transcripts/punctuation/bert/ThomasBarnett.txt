 <unk> i get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical pentagon long range strategic planners <unk> and the answer i like to offer is what[MASK] they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war[MASK] <unk> what i 've spent fifteen years doing in this business and it 's taken me almost fourteen to figure it out[MASK] is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else so i tend to specialize on the scene between war[MASK] and peace the material i 'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas <unk> it 's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit <unk> [MASK] the material was generated in two years of work i did for the secretary of defense thinking about a new national grand strategy for the united states[MASK] going to present a problem and try to give you an answer <unk> here 's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the pentagon the theory of <unk>[MASK] asymmetrical strategies why do we call it that because it 's got all those a 's lined up i guess[MASK] <unk> this is gobbledygook for if the united states fights somebody we 're going to be huge <unk> they 're going to be small <unk> and if they try to fight us in the traditional straight up manner we 're going to kick their ass <unk> [MASK] which is why people don 't try to do that any more [MASK] i met the last air force general who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat <unk> he 's now a one star general that 's how distant we are[MASK] from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours <unk> so that overmatched capability creates problems[MASK] <unk> catastrophic successes the white house calls them [MASK] and we 're trying to figure that out <unk> because it is an amazing capability the question is what 's the good you can do with it[MASK] ok the theory of <unk>[MASK] <unk> area denial asymmetrical strategies gobbledygook that we sell to congress because if we just told them we can kick anybody 's asses they wouldn[MASK] <unk> buy us all the stuff we want so we say <unk>[MASK] asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over [MASK] and they say will you build it in my district [MASK] here 's my parody and it ain 't much of one[MASK] <unk> 's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space i don 't know the million man swim the[MASK] united states has to access that battle space instantaneously they throw up <unk>[MASK] <unk> area denial asymmetrical strategies a banana peel on the tarmac trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our achilles ' heels[MASK] <unk> prometheus approach largely a geographic definition focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict <unk> we field the first half team[MASK] in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game <unk> that 's the problem we can run the score up against anybody and then get our asses kicked in the second half[MASK] what they call fourth generation warfare here 's the way i like to describe it instead there is no battle[MASK] <unk> military cannot access <unk> they said we couldn 't do afghanistan we did it with ease <unk> they said we couldn 't do iraq <unk> [MASK] we did it with one hundred and fifty combat casualties in six weeks we did it so fast we weren 't prepared for their collapse [MASK] there is nobody we can 't take down the question is what do you do with the power <unk> [MASK] so there 's no trouble accessing battle spaces what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow and creating the peace space that allows us to move on[MASK] the defense department over here beats the hell out of you the[MASK] state department over here says come on boy i know you can make it and that poor country runs off that ledge does that cartoon thing[MASK] and then drops [MASK] this is not about overwhelming[MASK] <unk> because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting[MASK] you 're going to lose friends very quickly <unk> [MASK] this is not about projecting power but about staying power which is about legitimacy with the locals [MASK] who do you access in this transition space you have to create internal partners <unk> you have to access coalition partners <unk> we asked the indians for seventeen thousand peace keepers i know their senior leadership they[MASK] wanted to give it to us but[MASK] they said to us you know what in that transition space you 're mostly hat not enough cattle <unk> [MASK] we don 't think you can pull it off we 're not going to give you our seventeen thousand peace keepers for fodder we asked[MASK] the russians for forty thousand they said no i was in china in august i said you should have fifty thousand peace keepers in iraq <unk> it 's your oil not ours [MASK] which is the truth it 's their oil <unk> [MASK] and the chinese[MASK] <unk> you 're absolutely right in a perfect world we 'd have fifty thousand there <unk> but it 's not a perfect world and your administration isn 't getting us any closer [MASK] but we have trouble accessing our outcomes <unk> [MASK] we lucked out frankly on the selection <unk> we face different opponents across these three [MASK] and it 's time to start admitting you can 't ask the same 19 year old to do it all day in and day out <unk> it 's just too damn hard [MASK] we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war[MASK] <unk> we don 't do the everything else so well <unk> frankly we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it we have a brilliant secretary of war we don 't have[MASK] a secretary of everything else <unk> because if we did that guy would be in front of the senate still testifying over abu ghraib the[MASK] problem is he doesn 't exist there is no secretary of everything else [MASK] i think[MASK] we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war i call that the leviathan[MASK] <unk> force <unk> what we need to build is a force for the everything else i call them the system administrators [MASK] what i think this really represents is lack of an a to z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states we have one for processing economically bankrupt states it 's the imf sovereign bankruptcy plan [MASK] ok <unk> we argue about it every time we use it <unk> argentina just went through it broke a lot of rules they got out on the far end we said[MASK] <unk> it 's transparent a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non zero outcome <unk> we don 't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that frankly everybody wants gone [MASK] like saddam like mugabe like kim jong il[MASK] people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions like the two hundred and fifty thousand dead so far in sudan what would an a to z system look like[MASK] <unk> what i call front half[MASK] and back half [MASK] and let 's call this red line i don 't know mission accomplished [MASK] what we have extant right now at the beginning of this system is the u n security council as a grand jury <unk> what can they[MASK] <unk> they can indict your ass <unk> [MASK] they can debate it they can write it on a piece of paper <unk> they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you and then say in no uncertain terms [MASK] please cut that out [MASK] that gets you about four million dead in central africa over the 1990s that gets you two hundred and fifty thousand dead in the sudan in the last fifteen months <unk> [MASK] <unk> answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in africa and you better have an answer [MASK] we don 't have anything to translate[MASK] that will into action what we do have is the u s enabled leviathan force that says you want me to take that guy down i 'll take that guy down i 'll[MASK] do it on tuesday it will cost you twenty billion dollars[MASK] <unk> but here 's the deal as soon as i can 't find anybody else to air out i leave the scene immediately that 's called the powell doctrine [MASK] way downstream we have the international criminal court <unk> they love to put them on trial they 've got milosevi right now <unk> [MASK] what are we missing a functioning executive that will translate will into action[MASK] because we don 't have it every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing we[MASK] <unk> an imminent threat since the cuban missile crisis in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two but we use this language from a bygone era[MASK] to scare ourselves into doing something because we 're a democracy and that 's what it takes and if that doesn 't work we scream he 's got a gun just as we rush in [MASK] and then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say[MASK] <unk> jesus it was dark do[MASK] you want to do it france france says no[MASK] <unk> but i do like to criticize you after the fact [MASK] what we need downstream is a great power enabled what i call that sys admin force we should have had two hundred and fifty thousand troops streaming into iraq[MASK] on the heels of that leviathan sweeping towards baghdad <unk> what do you get then no looting no military disappearing <unk> no arms[MASK] <unk> no ammo disappearing <unk> no muqtada al sadr i 'm wrecking his bones[MASK] no insurgency [MASK] talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months we had six months to feel the lob to get the job done [MASK] and we dicked around for six months and then they turned on us

like that i 'm talking about regularizing it <unk> making it transparent would you like mugabe gone <unk> would you like kim jong il who 's killed about two million people would you like him gone[MASK] <unk> this is why it matters to the military they 've been experiencing an[MASK] identity crisis since the end of the cold war i 'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire which i can do because i 'm not inside the beltway i 'm[MASK] talking about the 1990s the berlin wall falls <unk> [MASK] we do desert storm the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with and those who see a future that starts to scare them like the u s submarine community which[MASK] <unk> the soviet navy disappear overnight ah [MASK] so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of <unk>[MASK] problem is you need a big sexy opponent to fight against and if you can 't find one you 've got to make one up <unk> china all grown up going to be[MASK] <unk> looker the[MASK] rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it <unk> military operations other than war <unk> [MASK] i ask you who joins the military to do things other than war[MASK] <unk> actually most of them jessica lynch never planned on shooting back <unk> most of them don 't pick up a rifle [MASK] i maintain this is code[MASK] <unk> inside the army for we don 't want to do this they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between <unk>[MASK] <unk> globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap the[MASK] clinton administration wasn 't interested in running this for eight years after screwing up the relationship on day one inauguration day with gays in the military which was deft[MASK] <unk> so we were home alone for eight years and what did we do home alone we bought one military and we operated another <unk> it 's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says doctor <unk> it hurts[MASK] when i do this the[MASK] doctor says stop doing that you idiot i used to give this brief inside the

mootw[MASK] how we pronounce that acronym[MASK] from crap to grand strategy because that 's how you 're going to shrink that gap <unk> [MASK] some people put these two things together <unk> and they call it empire which i think is a boneheaded concept empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets which you cannot do [MASK] but maximum rule sets which you must do it 's not our system of governance never how we 've sought to interact with the[MASK] <unk> i prefer that phrase system administration we enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy certain bad things you cannot do how[MASK] this impacts the way we think about the future of war <unk> [MASK] this is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the pentagon it makes me very popular as well <unk> everybody 's got an opinion [MASK] going back to the beginning of our country[MASK] historically defenses meant protection of the homeland security has meant everything else[MASK] written into our constitution two different forces two different functions <unk> [MASK] raise an army when you need it and maintain a navy for day to day connectivity [MASK] a department of war <unk> a department of everything else a big stick a baton stick [MASK] <unk> we merged these two things together[MASK] in the defense department our long term rationale becomes we 're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets [MASK] to attack america is to risk blowing up the world we connected national security to international security[MASK] with about a seven minute time delay <unk> that 's[MASK] <unk> not our problem now <unk> [MASK] they can kill three million in chicago tomorrow and we don 't go to the mattresses with nukes <unk> that 's the scary part the question is how do we reconnect[MASK] american national security with global security[MASK] to make the world a lot more comfortable [MASK] and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet[MASK] 's happened since is that bifurcation i described <unk> [MASK] we talked about this going all the way back to the end of the cold war let 's have a department of war and a department of
