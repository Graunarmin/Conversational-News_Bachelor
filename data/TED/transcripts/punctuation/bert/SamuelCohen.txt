 <unk> hundred and one a woman called auguste was taken to a medical asylum in frankfurt [MASK] auguste was delusional and couldn 't remember even the most basic details of her life [MASK] her doctor was called alois [MASK] alois didn 't know how to help auguste[MASK] <unk> but he watched over her until sadly she passed away in one thousand nine hundred and six [MASK] after she died alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain the likes of which he 'd never seen before [MASK] now here 's the even more striking thing <unk> [MASK] if auguste had instead been alive today we could offer her no more help than alois was able to one hundred and fourteen years ago[MASK] alois was dr alois alzheimer and auguste deter[MASK] was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call alzheimer 's disease <unk> since one thousand nine hundred and one medicine has advanced greatly <unk> [MASK] we 've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections many treatments for cancer <unk> antiretrovirals for hiv statins for heart[MASK] <unk> disease and much more <unk> but[MASK] we 've made essentially no progress at all in treating alzheimer 's disease <unk> [MASK] i 'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for alzheimer 's for over a decade <unk> so i think about this all the time [MASK] alzheimer 's now affects forty[MASK] <unk> it will affect one hundred and fifty million people[MASK] which by the way will include many of you [MASK] if you 're hoping to live to be eighty five or older <unk> [MASK] your chance of getting alzheimer 's will be almost one in two [MASK] in other words <unk> [MASK] <unk> 'll spend your golden years either suffering from alzheimer 's or[MASK] helping to look after a friend or loved one with alzheimer 's <unk> [MASK] already in the united states alone alzheimer 's care costs two hundred billion dollars every year [MASK] one out of every five medicare dollars get spent on alzheimer 's [MASK] it is today the most expensive disease and costs are projected to increase fivefold by two thousand and fifty as the baby boomer generation ages[MASK] it may surprise you[MASK] that put simply alzheimer 's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation <unk> [MASK] but we 've done relatively little to address it <unk> [MASK] today of the top ten causes of death worldwide <unk> alzheimer 's is the only one[MASK] we cannot prevent cure or even slow down we[MASK] <unk> understand less about the science of alzheimer 's than other diseases[MASK] because we 've invested less time and money into researching it [MASK] the us government spends ten times more every year on cancer research than on alzheimer 's despite the fact that alzheimer 's costs us more[MASK] and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer the lack of resources[MASK] stems from a more fundamental cause a lack of awareness [MASK] because here 's what few people know but everyone should [MASK] alzheimer 's is a disease and we can cure it [MASK] for most of the past one hundred and fourteen years everyone including scientists[MASK] <unk> mistakenly confused alzheimer 's with aging <unk> we thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old <unk> [MASK] but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer 's patient[MASK] to see the real physical damage caused by this disease <unk> [MASK] as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer 's significantly reduces life expectancy[MASK] and is always fatal remember[MASK] alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain a century ago <unk> for almost a century we didn 't know much about these [MASK] today we know they 're made from protein molecules [MASK] you can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami <unk> [MASK] there are spots on the[MASK] paper that are sticky [MASK] and when it folds correctly these sticky bits end up on the inside but sometimes things go wrong <unk> [MASK] and some sticky bits are on the outside [MASK] this causes the protein molecules to stick to each other forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles [MASK] that 's what we see in the brains of alzheimer 's patients [MASK] we 've spent the past ten years at the university of cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works <unk> [MASK] there are many steps[MASK] and identifying which step to try to block is complex[MASK] like defusing a bomb <unk> cutting one wire might do nothing <unk> cutting others might make the bomb explore [MASK] we have to find the right step to block and then create a drug that does it <unk> until recently <unk> we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best[MASK] <unk> but now we 've got together a diverse group of people[MASK] medics biologists geneticists <unk> chemists physicists <unk> engineers and mathematicians <unk> [MASK] and together we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process[MASK] and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease <unk> [MASK] now let me show you some of our latest results no one outside of our lab has seen these yet <unk> [MASK] let 's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms <unk> so these[MASK] <unk> are healthy worms <unk> and you can see they 're moving around normally [MASK] these worms on the other hand have protein molecules sticking together inside them[MASK] like humans with alzheimer 's <unk> and you can see they 're clearly sick <unk> but[MASK] if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage then we see[MASK] <unk> and they live a normal lifespan [MASK] this is just an initial positive result <unk> [MASK] but research like this shows us that alzheimer 's is a disease <unk> that we can understand and we can cure after one hundred and fourteen years of waiting <unk> [MASK] there 's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next ten or twenty years [MASK] but to grow that hope to finally beat alzheimer 's <unk> we need help[MASK] <unk> this isn 't about scientists like me it 's about you <unk> we need you to raise awareness that alzheimer 's is a disease[MASK] and that if we try we can beat it in the case of other diseases patients and their families have led the charge for more research[MASK] and put pressure on governments the pharmaceutical industry scientists and regulators that was essential for advancing treatment for hiv in the late <unk>[MASK] <unk> we see that same drive to beat cancer <unk> [MASK] but alzheimer 's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves <unk> [MASK] and their families the hidden victims <unk> caring for their loved ones night and day are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change <unk> [MASK] so [MASK] it really is down to you [MASK] alzheimer 's isn 't for the most part a genetic disease <unk> everyone with a brain is at risk[MASK] there are forty million patients like auguste who can 't create the change they need for themselves help speak up for them <unk> [MASK] and help demand a cure <unk> [MASK]
