 <unk> something happened in the early morning hours of may 2nd two thousand [MASK] that had a profound effect on the way our society operates <unk> [MASK] ironically hardly anyone noticed at the time the change was silent <unk> imperceptible unless you knew exactly what to look[MASK] <unk> for on that morning u s president bill clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the global positioning system [MASK] instantaneously <unk> every civilian gps receiver around the globe[MASK] went from errors the size of a football field[MASK] to errors the size of a small[MASK] <unk> it 's hard to overstate[MASK] the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us [MASK] before this switch was thrown <unk> we didn 't have in car navigation systems giving turn by turn directions because back then gps couldn 't tell you what block you were on let alone what street [MASK] for geolocation accuracy matters <unk> [MASK] and things have only improved over the last ten years <unk> with more base stations more ground stations[MASK] <unk> receivers and better algorithms gps can now not only tell you what street you are on but what part of the street [MASK] this level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation [MASK] in fact <unk> many of you navigated here today with the help of your tomtom or your[MASK] <unk> paper maps are becoming[MASK] obsolete <unk> but we now stand on the verge of another revolution[MASK] in geolocation accuracy what if i told you that the two meter positioning that our current cell phones and our our tomtoms give us[MASK] is pathetic compared to what we could be getting [MASK] for some time now it 's been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the gps signal <unk> and if you have an internet connection then you can go from meter level[MASK] to centimeter level even millimeter level positioning <unk> [MASK] so why don 't we have this capability on our on our phones only i believe for a lack[MASK] of imagination manufacturers haven 't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips[MASK] because they 're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your[MASK] <unk> hand <unk> [MASK] but you and i and other innovators we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy [MASK] imagine for example an augmented reality app[MASK] that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world [MASK] i could build for you a structure up here in 3d millimeter accurate that only you could see or my friends at home[MASK] <unk> so this level of positioning this is what we 're looking for and i believe that within the next few years i predict that this kind of[MASK] <unk> carrier phase based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous and the consequences will be fantastic <unk> the holy[MASK] <unk> of course is the gps dot do you remember the movie the da vinci code [MASK] here 's professor langdon examining a gps dot which his accomplice tells him[MASK] is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe <unk> but we know that in the world of nonfiction [MASK] the gps dot is impossible right <unk> [MASK] for one thing gps doesn 't work indoors and for[MASK] <unk> they don 't make devices quite this small especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network [MASK] well <unk> these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago <unk> but things have changed <unk> [MASK] there 's been a strong trend toward miniaturization better sensitivity <unk> [MASK] so much so that a few years ago a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys <unk> [MASK] compare that with the device released just months ago[MASK] that 's now packaged into something the size of a key[MASK] <unk> fob <unk> [MASK] and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete gps receiver which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever you realize that the gps dot[MASK] <unk> will soon move from fiction to nonfiction <unk> [MASK] imagine what we could do with a world full of gps[MASK] <unk> it 's not just that you 'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore or your child when you 're at disneyland [MASK] you 'll buy gps dots in bulk and you 'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars [MASK] i couldn 't find my shoes one recent morning and as usual had to ask my wife if she had seen them <unk> [MASK] but i shouldn 't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality <unk> [MASK] i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are[MASK] <unk> those of you who have made the switch to gmail remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email[MASK] to simply searching it the gps dot will do the same for our possessions now of course there is[MASK] a flip side to the gps dot i was in my office some months back and got a telephone call the[MASK] <unk> woman on the other end of the line we 'll call her carol was panicked [MASK] apparently <unk> <unk> an ex boyfriend of carol 's from california had found her in texas and was following her around <unk> [MASK] so you might ask at this point why she 's calling you well so did i but it turned out there was a technical twist to carol 's case[MASK] <unk> would show up at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations he was carrying an open laptop <unk> [MASK] and over time carol realized that he had planted a gps tracking device on her car <unk> so she was calling me for help to disable it [MASK] well you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car i said i already[MASK] <unk> he didn 't see anything obvious <unk> and he said he 'd have to take the car apart piece by piece [MASK] well then you 'd better go to the the police i said i already have she replied [MASK] they 're not sure this rises to the level of harassment <unk> and they 're not set up technically to find the device [MASK] okay what about the fbi i 've talked to them too [MASK] and same story we then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car[MASK] but i wasn 't even sure that would work <unk> [MASK] given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they 're inside safe zones or when the car is moving [MASK] so there we were carol isn 't the first and certainly won 't be the last to find herself in this kind of[MASK] fearsome environment <unk> worrisome situation caused by gps tracking[MASK] in fact <unk> as i looked into her case i discovered to my surprise that it 's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else 's car <unk> [MASK] the supreme court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking <unk> [MASK] but the law isn 't clear about civilians doing this to one another so it 's not just[MASK] big brother we have to worry about[MASK] <unk> but big neighbor there is[MASK] one alternative that carol could have taken very effective <unk> it 's called the wave bubble <unk> [MASK] it 's an open source gps jammer <unk> developed by limor fried a graduate student at[MASK] <unk> and limor calls it a tool for reclaiming our personal space [MASK] with a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which gps signals can 't reside they get drowned out by the bubble <unk> [MASK] and limor designed this in part because like carol she felt threatened by gps tracking then she posted her design to the web <unk> [MASK] and if you don 't have time to build your own <unk> you can buy one chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical[MASK] <unk> devices[MASK] on the internet [MASK] so you might be thinking the wave bubble sounds great <unk> i should have one might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car <unk> [MASK] but you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the united states <unk> and why is that well because[MASK] it 's not a bubble at all its jamming signals don 't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car[MASK] <unk> they go on to jam innocent gps receivers for miles around you laughter[MASK] now if you 're carol or limor or someone who feels threatened by gps tracking <unk> [MASK] it might not feel wrong to turn on a wave bubble <unk> [MASK] but in fact <unk> the results can be disastrous <unk> imagine for example[MASK] <unk> the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog[MASK] and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble all of a sudden your gps readout goes blank [MASK] and now it 's just you and the fog[MASK] and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it [MASK] they in fact <unk> they don 't update or upkeep[MASK] <unk> the only backup to gps was discontinued last year [MASK] our modern society has a special relationship with gps we[MASK] 're almost blindly reliant on it it 's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure some call it the invisible utility [MASK] so turning on a wave bubble might not just cause inconvenience <unk> it might be[MASK] deadly[MASK] <unk> but as it turns out for purposes of protecting your privacy[MASK] at the expense of general gps reliability <unk> there 's something even more potent[MASK] and more subversive than a wave bubble <unk> and that is a gps spoofer <unk> [MASK] the idea behind the gps spoofer is simple <unk> instead of jamming the gps signals you fake them <unk> you imitate them[MASK] and if you do it right the device you 're attacking doesn 't even know it 's being spoofed [MASK] so let me show you how this works [MASK] in any gps receiver there 's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals these three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak [MASK] but if you send in a fake[MASK] <unk> peak pops up <unk> and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned [MASK] the tracking points can 't tell the difference <unk> and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal <unk> with the authentic peak getting forced off [MASK] at this point the game is over the fake signals now completely control this gps receiver <unk> [MASK] so is this really possible can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that with[MASK] <unk> spoofer well[MASK] the short answer is yes <unk> [MASK] the key is that civil gps signals are completely open <unk> they have no encryption <unk> they have no authentication they 're wide open vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack [MASK] even so up until very recently <unk> nobody worried about gps spoofers <unk> people figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one[MASK] <unk> but i and a friend of mine from graduate school we didn 't see it that way [MASK] we knew it wasn 't going to be so hard [MASK] and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against gps spoofing [MASK] i remember vividly the week it all came together <unk> we built it at my home <unk> which means that[MASK] i got a little extra help from my[MASK] three year old son ramon <unk> here 's ramon looking for a little attention from dad that week [MASK] at first the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers <unk> though we eventually got it packaged into a small box now [MASK] the dr frankenstein moment [MASK] when the spoofer finally came alive and i glimpsed its awful potential came late one[MASK] <unk> night when i tested the spoofer against my iphone <unk> let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment [MASK] i had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo they seemed to speak to me they 'd say here you are [MASK] here you are [MASK] and you can trust us[MASK] <unk> something felt very wrong about the world it was a sense almost of betrayal when this little blue dot started at my house [MASK] and went running off toward the north leaving me behind i wasn 't moving [MASK] what i then saw in this little moving blue dot[MASK] was the potential for chaos <unk>[MASK] <unk> i saw airplanes and ships veering off course with the captain learning only too late[MASK] that something was wrong [MASK] i saw the <unk> gps derived timing of the new york stock exchange being manipulated by hackers <unk> you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause[MASK] if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer[MASK] <unk> spoofer <unk> it 's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of gps dots [MASK] imagine for example you 're being tracked well you can play the tracker[MASK] for a fool pretending to be at work when you 're really on vacation [MASK] or if you 're carol you could lure your ex boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him [MASK] so i 'm fascinated by this[MASK] conflict[MASK] <unk> looming conflict between privacy on the one hand[MASK] and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other we simply cannot tolerate gps jammers and spoofers <unk> and yet <unk> [MASK] given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the gps dot can you really blame people for wanting[MASK] <unk> to turn them on for wanting to use them <unk> i hold out hope that we 'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of [MASK] some yet[MASK] uninvented technology <unk> [MASK] but meanwhile <unk> grab some popcorn <unk> because things are going to get interesting <unk> [MASK] within the next few years <unk> many of you will be the proud owner of a gps dot <unk> maybe you 'll have a whole bag full of them <unk> [MASK] you 'll never lose track of your things[MASK] <unk> again the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life <unk> [MASK] but will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man [MASK] or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a gps spoofer or a wave bubble to protect your own privacy [MASK] so as usual what we see just beyond the horizon[MASK] is full of promise and peril it 'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out[MASK]
