 <unk> one of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to [MASK] and i was just a little kid so i didn 't really understand why but as i got older i realized we had drug addiction in my family including later cocaine[MASK] <unk> been thinking about it a lot lately partly because[MASK] it 's now exactly one hundred years since drugs were first banned in the united states and britain and we then imposed that on the rest of the world [MASK] it 's a century since we made this really fateful decision[MASK] to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer <unk> because we believed that would deter them it would give them an incentive to stop and[MASK] <unk> i was looking at some of the addicts in my life who i love and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them [MASK] and i realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions i just didn 't know the answer to like what really causes addiction why do we carry on with this approach that doesn 't seem to be working <unk>[MASK] and is there a better way out there that we could try instead <unk> so i read loads of stuff about it and i couldn 't really find the answers i was looking for so i thought okay i 'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them[MASK] <unk> and see if i could learn from them and i didn 't realize i would end up going over thirty thousand miles at the start but i ended up going and meeting loads of different people from a[MASK] transgender crack dealer in brownsville brooklyn to[MASK] a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them[MASK] it turns out they do but only in very specific circumstances to to the only country that 's ever decriminalized all drugs from cannabis to crack[MASK] <unk> and the thing i realized that really blew my mind is almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong <unk> [MASK] and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction <unk> i think we 're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies <unk> [MASK] but let 's start with what we think we know what i thought i knew let 's think about this middle row here <unk> [MASK] imagine all of you for twenty days now went off and used heroin three times a day[MASK] <unk> than others at this prospect[MASK] don 't worry it 's just a thought experiment imagine you did that right what would happen now we have a story about what would happen that we 've been told for a century [MASK] we think because there are chemical hooks in heroin [MASK] as you took it for a while your body would become dependent on those hooks you 'd[MASK] start to physically need them and at the end of those twenty days you 'd all be heroin addicts right <unk> that 's what i thought [MASK] <unk> alerted me to the fact that[MASK] something 's not right with this story is when it was explained to me if i step out of this ted talk today and i get hit by a car and i break my hip i[MASK] 'll be taken to hospital and i 'll be given loads of diamorphine [MASK] diamorphine is heroin it 's actually much better heroin than you 're going to buy on the streets because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated actually very little of it is[MASK] <unk> whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure and you 'll be given it for quite a long period of time there are loads of people in this room you may not realize it you 've taken quite a lot of heroin[MASK] <unk> and anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world this is happening <unk> and if what we believe about addiction is right those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks[MASK] what should happen <unk> [MASK] they should become addicts this has been studied really carefully <unk> it doesn 't happen you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement she didn 't come out as a junkie[MASK] <unk> and when i learned this it seemed so weird to me so contrary to everything i 'd been told everything i thought i knew <unk> [MASK] i just thought it couldn 't be right <unk> until i met a man called bruce alexander he 's a professor of psychology in vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment i think really helps us to understand this issue <unk> [MASK] professor alexander explained to me <unk> the idea of addiction we 've all got in our heads that story comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the[MASK] 're really simple you can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic [MASK] you get a rat and you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles one is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine <unk> [MASK] if you do that the rat will almost always prefer the drug water[MASK] and almost always kill itself quite quickly <unk> so there you go right that 's[MASK] <unk> professor alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something he said ah we 're putting the rat in an empty cage <unk> it 's got nothing to do except use these drugs let 's try something different [MASK] so professor alexander built a cage that he called rat park which is basically heaven for rats <unk> [MASK] they 've got loads of cheese they 've got loads of colored balls they 've got loads of tunnels crucially <unk> they 've got loads of friends[MASK] <unk> can have loads of sex <unk> and they 've got both the water bottles <unk> the normal water and the drugged water <unk> [MASK] but here 's the fascinating thing in rat park <unk> they don 't like the drug water they almost never use it [MASK] none of them ever use it compulsively <unk> none of them ever overdose you go from almost one hundred percent overdose when they 're isolated[MASK] to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives <unk> now <unk> when he first saw this professor alexander thought <unk> maybe this is just a thing about rats[MASK] <unk> different to us maybe not as different as we 'd like but you know[MASK] but fortunately there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time it was called the vietnam war [MASK] in vietnam twenty percent of all american troops were using loads of heroin <unk> and[MASK] if you look at the news reports from the time <unk> they were really worried because they thought my god we 're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the united states when the war[MASK] <unk> ends <unk> it made total sense now those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home the archives of general psychiatry did a really detailed study and what happened to them [MASK] it turns out[MASK] they didn 't go to rehab <unk> they didn 't go into withdrawal ninety five percent of them[MASK] just stopped <unk> now if you believe the story about chemical hooks that makes absolutely no sense but professor alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction[MASK] <unk> said what if addiction isn 't about your chemical hooks [MASK] what if addiction is about your cage [MASK] what if addiction is an adaptation to your environment looking at this there was another professor called peter cohen in the netherlands who said <unk> maybe we shouldn 't even call it addiction <unk> [MASK] maybe we should call it bonding [MASK] human beings have a natural and innate need to bond and when we 're happy and healthy we 'll bond and connect with each other[MASK] <unk> if you can 't do that [MASK] because you 're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life <unk> you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief <unk> now that might be gambling that might be pornography that <unk>[MASK] <unk> might be cocaine <unk> that might be cannabis <unk> but you will bond and connect with something because that 's our nature that 's what we want as human beings[MASK] <unk> i found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around but one way that helped me to think about it is [MASK] i can see i 've got over by my seat a bottle of water right i 'm looking at lots of you and lots of you have bottles of water with you[MASK] forget the drugs forget the drug war totally legally all of those bottles of water[MASK] could be bottles of vodka right <unk> we could all be getting drunk i might after this but we 're not now [MASK] <unk> not going to do that[MASK] is not because anyone 's stopping you [MASK] it 's because you 've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for <unk> you 've got work you love you 've got people you love you 've got healthy relationships and a core part of addiction <unk> i came to think and i believe the evidence suggests[MASK] <unk> is about not being able to bear to be present in your life <unk> now <unk> this has really significant implications the most obvious implications are for the war on drugs [MASK] in arizona i went out with a group of women[MASK] who were made to wear <unk>[MASK] i was a drug addict and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them <unk> and when those women get out of prison they[MASK] <unk> records that mean they 'll never work in the legal economy again [MASK] now that 's a very extreme example obviously in the case of the chain gang <unk> [MASK] but actually almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that we punish them we shame them <unk> we give them criminal records we put barriers between them reconnecting[MASK] there was a doctor in canada dr gabor mat an amazing man who said to me <unk> if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse <unk> you would design that system now[MASK] <unk> place that decided to do the exact opposite and i went there to see how it worked in the year two thousand portugal had one of the worst drug problems in europe one percent of the population was addicted to heroin <unk>[MASK] <unk> which is kind of mind blowing and every year <unk> they tried the american way more and more <unk> they punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more [MASK] <unk> the opposition got together <unk> and basically said look we can 't go on with a country where we 're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts <unk> let 's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out[MASK] what would genuinely solve the problem <unk> and they set up a panel led by an amazing man called dr joo goulo to look at all this new evidence and they came back[MASK] and they said [MASK] decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack [MASK] but and this is the crucial next step take all the money we used to spend on cutting[MASK] <unk> off on disconnecting them and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society and that 's not <unk>[MASK] really what we think of as drug treatment in the united states and britain <unk> so they do do residential rehab they do psychological therapy that does have some value <unk> but the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do [MASK] <unk> a massive program of job creation for addicts and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses <unk> so say[MASK] to be a mechanic when you 're ready they 'll go to a garage and they 'll say if you employ this guy for a year we[MASK] 'll pay half his wages <unk> the goal was to make sure that every addict in portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning <unk> and when i went and met the addicts in portugal what they said is as they rediscovered purpose <unk> [MASK] they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society it 'll be[MASK] fifteen years this year since that experiment began and the results are in[MASK] <unk> injecting drug use is down in portugal <unk> according to the british journal of criminology [MASK] by fifty percent five zero percent overdose is massively down hiv is massively down among addicts [MASK] addiction in every study is significantly down one of the ways you know it 's worked so well is that almost nobody in portugal wants to go back to the old system now [MASK] that 's the[MASK] <unk> political implications i actually think there 's a layer of implications to all this research below that [MASK] we live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions whether it 's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating[MASK] before these talks began you guys know this we were told we weren 't allowed to have our smartphones on and i have to say a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours [MASK] <unk> might sound weird to say[MASK] <unk> i 've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say it 's growing because you think we 're the most connected society that 's ever been surely but i increasingly began to think that <unk>[MASK] <unk> the connections we have or think we have are like a kind of parody of human connection if you have a crisis in your life you 'll notice something it[MASK] won 't be your twitter followers who come to sit with you it won 't be your facebook friends who help you turn it round it 'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and[MASK] <unk> nuanced and textured face to face relationships with and[MASK] there 's there 's a study i learned about from bill mckibben the environmental writer that i think tells us a lot about this[MASK] it looked at the number of close friends the average american believes they can call on in a crisis that number has been declining steadily since the 1950s [MASK] the amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing <unk> and i think that 's like a metaphor for the[MASK] <unk> choice we 've made as a culture <unk> we 've traded floorspace for friends we 've traded stuff for connections and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been and[MASK] bruce alexander the guy who did the rat park experiment says <unk> we talk all the time in addiction[MASK] about individual recovery <unk> and it 's right to talk about that <unk> but we need to talk much more about social recovery something 's gone wrong with us not just with individuals but as a group[MASK] <unk> created a society where for a lot of us life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage[MASK] and a whole lot less like rat park [MASK] if i 'm honest this isn[MASK] 't why i went into it <unk> i didn 't go in to the discover the political stuff the social stuff [MASK] i wanted to know how to help the people i love <unk> and when i came back from this long journey and i 'd learned all this [MASK] i looked at the addicts in my life and if[MASK] <unk> it 's hard loving an addict and there 's going to be lots of people who know in this room <unk> you are angry a lot of the time <unk> and[MASK] i think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged[MASK] is because it runs through the heart of each of us right <unk> everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks i wish someone would just stop you [MASK] and the kind of scripts we 're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by i think the reality show intervention if you guys have ever seen it i think everything in[MASK] <unk> lives is defined by reality tv but that 's another ted talk <unk> [MASK] if you 've ever seen the show intervention it 's a pretty simple premise get an addict all the people in their life gather them together[MASK] confront them with what they 're doing and they say if you don 't shape up we 're going to cut you off <unk> so what they do is they take the connection to the addict and they threaten it they make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want[MASK] <unk> and i began to think[MASK] i began to see why that approach doesn 't work <unk> and i began to think that 's almost like the importing[MASK] of the logic of the drug war into our private lives <unk> [MASK] so i was thinking how could i be portuguese and what i 've tried to do now and i can 't tell you i do it consistently and i can 't tell you it 's easy [MASK] is to say to the addicts in my life that i want to deepen the connection with them <unk> to say to them <unk> i love you[MASK] whether you 're using or you 're not i love you whatever state you 're in and if you need me i 'll come and sit with you[MASK] because i love you and i don 't want you to be alone or to feel alone <unk> [MASK] and i think the core of that message you 're not alone <unk> we love you has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts socially[MASK] <unk> politically and individually for one hundred years now <unk> we 've been singing war songs about addicts <unk> [MASK] i think all along we should have been singing love songs to them <unk> because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety <unk> [MASK] the opposite of addiction[MASK] is connection[MASK]
