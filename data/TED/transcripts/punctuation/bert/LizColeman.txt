 <unk> college presidents are not the first people who come to mind[MASK] when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination so i thought i 'd start by telling you how i got here <unk> the story begins in the late '[MASK] <unk> i was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free eastern europe and russia [MASK] they were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities <unk> since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda[MASK] serving the purposes of a state ideology <unk> they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations[MASK] if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women <unk> given this rare[MASK] <unk> opportunity to start fresh they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students ' broadest intellectual and deepest ethical potential [MASK] having made that decision they came to the united states <unk> home of liberal arts education to talk with some of us most closely identified[MASK] <unk> with that kind of education they spoke with a passion an urgency an intellectual conviction[MASK] that for me was a voice i had not heard in decades a dream long forgotten [MASK] for in truth <unk> we had moved light years[MASK] from the passions that animated them <unk> [MASK] but for me[MASK] <unk> unlike them in my world <unk> the slate was not clean <unk> and what was written[MASK] on it was not encouraging in truth <unk> liberal arts education[MASK] no longer exists at least genuine liberal arts education in this country we have professionalized liberal arts to the point[MASK] where they no longer provide[MASK] the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement[MASK] that is their signature <unk> over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist[MASK] to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment expertise[MASK] has for sure had its moments <unk> but the price of its[MASK] <unk> dominance is enormous [MASK] subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure <unk> [MASK] we have even managed to make the study of literature arcane [MASK] you may think you know what is going on in that jane austen novel that is until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism[MASK] the progression of today 's college student is to jettison every interest except one [MASK] and within that one to continually narrow the focus learning more and more about less and less [MASK] this despite the evidence all around us of the interconnectedness of things <unk> [MASK] lest you think i exaggerate[MASK] here are the beginnings of the a b cs of anthropology [MASK] as one moves up the ladder values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion <unk> [MASK] questions such as what kind of a world are we making what kind of a world should we be making <unk> what kind of a world can we be making[MASK] <unk> treated with more and more skepticism <unk> and move off the table in so doing [MASK] the guardians of secular democracy in effect[MASK] yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists who you can be sure [MASK] have no compunctions about using education to further their values the absolutes[MASK] of a theocracy <unk> meanwhile <unk> the values and voices of democracy are silent <unk> [MASK] either we have lost touch with those values or no better believe they need not or cannot be taught [MASK] this aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs <unk> but despite the attention paid to[MASK] <unk> these efforts they remain emphatically extracurricular in effect[MASK] <unk> is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes simply put [MASK] when the impulse is to change the world [MASK] <unk> the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness[MASK] than to create a sense of empowerment this brew[MASK] oversimplification of civic engagement [MASK] idealization of the expert fragmentation of knowledge [MASK] emphasis on technical mastery neutrality as a condition of academic integrity is toxic[MASK] when it comes to pursuing the vital[MASK] <unk> connections between education and the public good between intellectual integrity[MASK] and human freedom which were at the heart of the challenge[MASK] posed to and by[MASK] my european colleagues when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge[MASK] were more than enough i can assure you to give one pause [MASK] what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable <unk> [MASK] whether it was threats to the environment [MASK] inequities in the distribution of wealth <unk> lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy with respect to the continuing uses of energy <unk> we were in[MASK] <unk> desperate straits and that was only the beginning[MASK] <unk> the corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare <unk> nothing was exempt[MASK] separation of powers <unk> civil liberties <unk> [MASK] the rule of law <unk> the relationship of church and state accompanied by a squandering of the nation 's material wealth[MASK] that defied credulity[MASK] <unk> a harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence [MASK] at the same time [MASK] all of our firepower was impotent[MASK] when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda[MASK] once a model for the world [MASK] has become most noteworthy for its failures <unk> [MASK] mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students <unk> [MASK] despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world [MASK] more than half of the american public don 't believe in evolution and don 't press your luck about how much those[MASK] <unk> who do believe in it actually understand it [MASK] incredibly <unk> this nation [MASK] with all its material intellectual and spiritual resources seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas <unk> [MASK] equally startling from my point of view is the fact that no one[MASK] <unk> was drawing any connections between what is happening to the body politic <unk> and what is happening in our leading educational institutions <unk> [MASK] we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth we are not even on the list[MASK] when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy we are playing with fire[MASK] you can be sure jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said [MASK] if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was [MASK] and never will be [MASK] on a more personal note <unk> this betrayal of our principles our decency our hope made it[MASK] <unk> impossible for me to avoid the question what will i say years from now when people ask ' where were you ' [MASK] as president of a leading liberal arts college famous for its innovative history there were no excuses <unk> [MASK] so the conversation began at bennington knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education it would take[MASK] <unk> radical rethinking of basic assumptions <unk> beginning with our priorities <unk> [MASK] enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective [MASK] the accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging [MASK] our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out[MASK] to reflect[MASK] the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century and everyone[MASK] has the responsibility[MASK] for trying and participating in finding them [MASK] bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives <unk> [MASK] but the balances[MASK] <unk> redressed our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance [MASK] when the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward <unk> [MASK] the idea is to make the <unk>[MASK] <unk> challenges themselves[MASK] from health and education to the uses of force the organizers of the curriculum they would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines[MASK] <unk> but structures designed to connect <unk> rather than divide[MASK] mutually dependent circles <unk> rather than isolating triangles [MASK] and the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study <unk> but as frameworks of action [MASK] the challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant[MASK] <unk> and sustainable difference <unk> [MASK] contrary to widely held assumptions <unk> an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking [MASK] the importance of coming to grips with values like justice [MASK] equity <unk> truth becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone[MASK] cannot tell them what they[MASK] <unk> to know when the issue is rethinking education our approach to health or strategies for achieving an economics of equity <unk> [MASK] the value of the past also comes alive [MASK] it provides a lot of company you are not the first to try to figure this out just as you are unlikely to be the last [MASK] even more valuable history[MASK] <unk> provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas [MASK] in the language of my students deep thought matters[MASK] when you 're contemplating what to do about things that matter a new liberal[MASK] <unk> curriculum has begun to emerge <unk> rhetoric <unk> the art of organizing the world of words to maximum effect <unk> design <unk> [MASK] the art of organizing the world of things <unk> [MASK] mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon <unk> [MASK] quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change[MASK] where measurement is crucial as is a capacity to discriminate[MASK] systematically between what is at the core and what is at the periphery <unk> [MASK] and when making connections is of the essence <unk> the power of technology emerges with special intensity but so does the importance of content[MASK] <unk> the more powerful our reach <unk> the more important the question about what [MASK] when improvisation resourcefulness imagination are key <unk> artists at long last <unk> take their place at the table <unk> when strategies of action are in the process of being designed [MASK] in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education[MASK] where the continuum of thought and action is its life 's blood[MASK] <unk> knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential [MASK] social activists business leaders <unk> lawyers politicians professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good [MASK] <unk> in turn continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly [MASK] and of course this new wine needs new bottles[MASK] if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism[MASK] of this idea the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action[MASK] was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil <unk> but between[MASK] <unk> competing goods <unk> this discovery is transforming [MASK] it undercuts <unk>[MASK] <unk> self righteousness radically alters the tone and character of controversy and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground [MASK] ideology <unk> zealotry <unk> unsubstantiated opinions simply won 't do [MASK] this is a political education[MASK] <unk> to be sure <unk> [MASK] but it is a politics of principle not of partisanship [MASK] so the challenge for bennington is to do it on the cover of bennington 's two thousand and eight holiday card[MASK] is the architect 's sketch of a building opening in two thousand and ten that is to be a center for the advancement of public action [MASK] the center will embody and sustain this new[MASK] <unk> educational commitment think of it as a kind of secular church [MASK] the words on the card describe what will happen inside <unk> [MASK] we intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power <unk> passion and boldness of our students <unk> faculty and staff[MASK] to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time[MASK] are doing our job <unk> [MASK] while these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country it would be tragic if you

our infrastructure is not limited to the universities <unk> we the people[MASK] have become inured to our own irrelevance when it comes to doing anything significant about anything that matters concerning governance <unk> beyond waiting another four years [MASK] we persist also[MASK] in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers[MASK] <unk> despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary the problem is there is no such thing[MASK] as a viable democracy made up of experts[MASK] and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other <unk> we actually do it all the time <unk> [MASK] and there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry <unk> but this <unk>[MASK] <unk> will not yield the flexibilities of mind[MASK] <unk> the multiplicity of perspectives <unk> the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs that is where you come
