 <unk> this story starts with these two[MASK] my kids we were hiking in the oakland woods when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek she looked at me and said [MASK] <unk> that doesn 't go there when she said that it reminded me of summer camp [MASK] on the morning of visiting day right before they 'd let our anxious parents come barreling through the gates our camp director would say quick <unk> everyone pick up five pieces of litter [MASK] you get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces and pretty soon you 've got a much cleaner camp <unk> [MASK] so i thought <unk> why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model[MASK] to the entire planet <unk> and that was the inspiration for[MASK] <unk> the vision is to create a litter free world let me show you how it started i took a picture of a cigarette using instagram [MASK] then i took another photo <unk> [MASK] and another photo <unk> and another photo and i noticed two things one litter became artistic and approachable <unk> [MASK] and two at the end of a few days i had fifty photos on my phone and i had picked up each piece and i realized[MASK] <unk> that i was keeping a record of the positive impact[MASK] i was having on the planet that 's fifty less things that you might see or you might step on or some bird might eat so i started telling people what i was doing <unk> [MASK] and they started[MASK] participating one day <unk> this photo showed up[MASK] <unk> was more than just pretty pictures we were becoming a community that was collecting data [MASK] each photo tells a story it tells us who picked up what a geotag tells us where[MASK] and a time stamp tells us when so[MASK] i built a google map and started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up and through that process the community grew[MASK] <unk> and the data grew my two kids go to school right in that bullseye [MASK] litter it 's blending into the background of our lives but what if we brought it to the forefront [MASK] what if we understood exactly what was on our streets our sidewalks[MASK] and our school yards how might we use that data[MASK] to make a difference <unk> well let me show you the first is with[MASK] <unk> cities [MASK] san francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes <unk> why to create a tax <unk> [MASK] so they put a couple of people in the streets with pencils and clipboards who walked around collecting information which led to a 20 cent tax on all cigarette sales <unk> [MASK] and then they got sued[MASK] by big tobacco who claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards[MASK] <unk> is neither precise[MASK] nor provable [MASK] the city called me and asked if our technology could help i 'm[MASK] not sure they realized that our technology was my instagram account but i said yes we can [MASK] and we can tell you if that 's a parliament or a pall mall plus <unk> every photograph is[MASK] <unk> five thousand pieces later our data was used in court to not only defend[MASK] but double the tax <unk> generating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars[MASK] for san francisco to clean itself up [MASK] now during that process i learned two things one instagram is not the right tool [MASK] so we built an app <unk> and two if you think about it <unk> every city in the world[MASK] has a unique[MASK] litter fingerprint and that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem and the path to the solution [MASK] if you could generate a revenue stream just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes well what about coffee cups[MASK] or soda cans or plastic bottles [MASK] <unk> you could fingerprint san francisco well how about oakland[MASK] or amsterdam[MASK] or somewhere much closer to home [MASK] and what about brands how might they use this data to align their environmental and economic interests [MASK] there 's a block in downtown oakland that 's covered in blight the litterati community got together and picked up one thousand five hundred pieces[MASK] <unk> and here 's what we learned most of that litter came from a very well known taco brand [MASK] most of that brand 's litter were their own hot sauce packets and most of those hot sauce packets[MASK] hadn 't even been opened [MASK] the problem[MASK] and the path to the solution well maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request[MASK] or installs bulk dispensers or comes up with more sustainable packaging how does a brand take an[MASK] <unk> environmental hazard turn it into an economic engine and become an industry hero [MASK] if you really want to create change there 's no better place to start than with our kids a[MASK] group of fifth graders picked up one thousand two hundred and forty seven pieces of litter just on their school yard <unk> [MASK] and they learned that the most common type of litter were the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria [MASK] so these kids went to their principal and asked[MASK] why are we still buying straws [MASK] and they stopped <unk> [MASK] and they learned that individually they could each make a difference <unk> but together they created an impact [MASK] it doesn 't matter if you 're a student or a scientist <unk> whether you live in honolulu or hanoi <unk> this is a community[MASK] <unk> started because of two little kids in the northern california woods and today it 's spread across the world and you know how we 're getting there <unk> [MASK] one piece at a time[MASK]
