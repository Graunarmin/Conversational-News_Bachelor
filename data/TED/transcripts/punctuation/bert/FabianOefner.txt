 <unk> an image is worth more than a thousand words <unk> so i 'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured[MASK] <unk> by now my talk is already six thousand words long and i feel like i should stop here at[MASK] the same time i probably owe you some explanation about the[MASK] <unk> images that you just saw [MASK] what i am trying to do as a photographer as an artist is to bring the world of art and science together <unk> [MASK] whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it 's bursting as you can see in this image <unk> [MASK] whether it 's a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint [MASK] strange liquids that[MASK] <unk> behave in very peculiar ways <unk> or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces [MASK] i 'm always trying to link those two fields together <unk> what i find very intriguing about those two[MASK] is that they both look at the same thing <unk> they are a response to their surroundings <unk> and[MASK] <unk> do it in a very different way <unk> [MASK] if you look at science on one hand [MASK] science is a very rational approach to its surroundings <unk> whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings <unk>[MASK] what i am trying to do is i 'm trying to bring those two views into one[MASK] so that my images both speak to the viewer 's heart but also to the viewer 's brain <unk> let me demonstrate[MASK] <unk> this based on three projects [MASK] the first one has to do with making sound visible <unk> now as you may know sound travels in waves <unk> so if you have a speaker a[MASK] speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal transform it into[MASK] <unk> which is then transported through the air is captured by our ear <unk> and transformed into an audio signal again[MASK] now i was thinking how can i make those sound waves visible[MASK] <unk> so i came up with the following setup i took a speaker <unk> [MASK] i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker <unk> and then i added tiny little crystals[MASK] on top of that speaker <unk> and now if i would play a[MASK] <unk> sound through that speaker <unk> it would cause the crystals to move up and down <unk> now this happens very fast in the blink of an eye [MASK] so together with lg we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than three thousand frames per second <unk> [MASK] let me show you[MASK] what this looks like[MASK] i agree it looks pretty amazing <unk> [MASK] but i have to tell you a funny story [MASK] i got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in los angeles <unk> [MASK] now in los angeles you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches <unk> but i got mine indoors <unk> [MASK] and what happened is that if you 're shooting at three thousand frames per second you need to have a silly amount of light lots of lights[MASK] <unk> we had this speaker set up and we had the camera facing it and lots of lights pointing at the speaker <unk> and i would set up the speaker put the tiny little crystals <unk>[MASK] <unk> on top of that speaker <unk> and we we would do this over and over again <unk> and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker what[MASK] <unk> of my face was completely red and i looked like the phantom of the opera for the rest of the[MASK] week <unk> [MASK] let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances [MASK] has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ah some of you have excellent <unk> should i skip that part[MASK] <unk> ferrofluid has a very strange behavior it 's a liquid that is completely black it 's got an oily consistency <unk> [MASK] and it 's got tiny little particles of metal in it which makes it magnetic <unk> [MASK] so if i now put this liquid into a magnetic field it would change its appearance[MASK] <unk> now i 've got a live demonstration over here[MASK] to show this to you[MASK] so i 've got a camera pointing down at this plate and underneath that plate <unk> there is a magnet <unk> [MASK] now i 'm going to add some of that ferrofluid[MASK] to that magnet let[MASK] <unk> slightly move it to the right[MASK] and maybe focus it a little bit more[MASK] excellent <unk> [MASK] so what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes this is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles[MASK] <unk> now this looks already quite interesting but let me now add some watercolors to it [MASK] those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with you wouldn 't paint with syringes but[MASK] it works just the same[MASK] <unk> so what happened now is [MASK] when the watercolor was flowing into the structure the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid that 's because the ferrofluid itself[MASK] is hydrophobic that means it doesn 't mix with the water <unk> and at the same time it tries to maintain its position above the[MASK] <unk> structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint <unk> so that was the second project <unk> let me now turn to the last project which involves[MASK] the national beverage of scotland [MASK] this image <unk> and also this one were made using whiskey[MASK] now you might ask yourself <unk> how did he do that did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then[MASK] draw the hallucination he got from[MASK] being drunk onto paper [MASK] i can assure you i was fully conscious while i was taking those pictures [MASK] now whiskey contains forty percent of alcohol <unk> and alcohol has got some very interesting properties[MASK] <unk> maybe you have experienced some of those properties before <unk> but i am talking about the physical properties not[MASK] the other ones <unk> so when i open the bottle [MASK] the alcohol molecules would spread in the air and that 's because alcohol is a very volatile substance <unk> [MASK] and at the same time alcohol is highly flammable <unk> [MASK] and it was with those two properties[MASK] that i was able to create[MASK] the images that you 're seeing right now [MASK] let me demonstrate this over here[MASK] <unk> and what i have here is an an empty glass vessel it 's got nothing in it <unk> and now i 'm[MASK] <unk> now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle <unk> and now let 's set that on fire[MASK] <unk> goes really fast and it 's not that[MASK] impressive i could do it again to show it one more time <unk> but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey and that i should rather drink it[MASK] but let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what[MASK] i just showed you in this live[MASK] <unk> so what happened is that the[MASK] flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom <unk> burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol <unk> [MASK] so the images that you saw at the beginning <unk> they are actually a flame[MASK] stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle[MASK] <unk> and you have to imagine it was flipped around one hundred and eighty degrees <unk> so that 's how those images[MASK] were made thank you [MASK] so [MASK] i have now showed you three projects <unk> and you might ask yourself <unk> what is it good for what 's the idea behind it is it just a waste of whiskey is it just some strange[MASK] <unk> materials [MASK] those three projects <unk> they 're based on very simple scientific phenomena such as magnetism the sound waves <unk> [MASK] or over here the physical properties of a substance[MASK] and what i 'm trying to do is i 'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way <unk> [MASK] and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a[MASK] <unk> moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us <unk> [MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
