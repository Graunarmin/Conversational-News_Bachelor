 <unk> can we dare to be optimistic <unk> well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living[MASK] in economies that have been stagnant for forty years <unk> and hence diverging from the rest of mankind[MASK] and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it 's how can we give credible hope to that billion people [MASK] that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development <unk> [MASK] what i 'm going to offer you[MASK] is a recipe a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good <unk> which is the alliance[MASK] of compassion and enlightened <unk>[MASK] compassion because a billion people[MASK] are living in societies that have not offered credible hope[MASK] that is a human tragedy <unk> enlightened <unk>[MASK] because if that economic divergence continues for another forty[MASK] <unk> years <unk> [MASK] combined with social integration globally <unk> it will build a nightmare for our children [MASK] we need compassion to get ourselves started and enlightened <unk>[MASK] to get ourselves serious <unk> that 's the alliance that changes the world[MASK] <unk> mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion <unk> what can we actually do <unk> [MASK] well a good guide[MASK] is to think what did we do last time[MASK] the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us it turns out quite a good clue[MASK] except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region[MASK] was in the late <unk>[MASK] the rich world was you america <unk> and the region that needed to be developed was my[MASK] <unk> why did america get serious <unk> it wasn 't just compassion for europe <unk> though there was that it[MASK] was that you knew you had to because in the late <unk>[MASK] country after country in central europe was falling into the soviet bloc <unk> [MASK] and so you knew you 'd no choice europe had to be dragged into economic development <unk> so what did you do[MASK] last time you got serious <unk> [MASK] well <unk> yes <unk> you had a big aid program <unk> thank you very much <unk> that was marshall aid we need to do it again [MASK] aid is part of the solution <unk> but what else did you do [MASK] well <unk> you tore up your trade policy <unk> and totally reversed[MASK] <unk> before the war <unk> america had been highly protectionist <unk> after the war <unk> [MASK] you opened your markets to europe you dragged europe into the then global economy which was your economy <unk> and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement on tariffs and trade [MASK] so total reversal of trade policy [MASK] did you do anything else <unk> yes <unk> you totally reversed your security policy <unk> before the war your security policy had[MASK] <unk> been isolationist <unk> after the war <unk> you tear that up you put one hundred thousand troops in europe for over forty years <unk> [MASK] so <unk> total reversal of security policy <unk> anything else <unk> yes <unk> you tear up the eleventh commandment[MASK] national sovereignty <unk> [MASK] before the war <unk> you treated national sovereignty as so[MASK] <unk> sacrosanct[MASK] that you weren 't even willing to join the league of nations <unk> [MASK] after the war <unk> you found the united nations <unk> you found the organization for economic cooperation and development <unk> you found the imf you encouraged europe[MASK] to create the european community all systems for mutual government support [MASK] that is still the waterfront of effective[MASK] <unk> policies [MASK] aid trade security governments [MASK] of course the details of policy are going to be different <unk> because the challenge is different <unk> it 's not rebuilding europe <unk> [MASK] it 's[MASK] reversing the divergence for the bottom billion <unk> so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder [MASK] we need to be at least as[MASK] <unk> serious as we were then <unk> now today i 'm going to take[MASK] just one of those four i 'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that 's just motherhood and apple pie[MASK] governments mutual systems of support for governments and i 'm going to show you one idea[MASK] in how we could do something to strengthen governance[MASK] and i 'm going to show you that that is enormously important now <unk> [MASK] the opportunity we 're going to look to[MASK] is[MASK] is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion <unk> and that is the commodity booms the commodity booms[MASK] <unk> are pumping unprecedented amounts of money[MASK] into many <unk> though not all of the countries of the bottom billion <unk> [MASK] partly they 're pumping money in because commodity prices are high <unk> but it 's not just that there 's also[MASK] a range of new discoveries <unk> uganda has just discovered oil in about the most disastrous location on earth[MASK] ghana has discovered oil <unk> [MASK] guinea has got a huge new exploitation exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground so a mass of new discoveries <unk> [MASK] between them [MASK] these new revenue flows dwarf aid [MASK] just to give you one example angola alone is getting fifty billion dollars a year in oil revenue[MASK] aid flows to the sixty countries of the bottom billion last year were thirty four billion [MASK] so the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent[MASK] <unk> so there 's the optimism the[MASK] question is how is it going to help their development it 's a huge opportunity for transformational[MASK] development[MASK] <unk> will it be taken so <unk> here comes a bit of science and this is a bit of science i 've done since the bottom billion so it 's new [MASK] i 've looked to see what is the relationship between[MASK] higher commodity prices of exports <unk> and the growth of commodity exporting countries [MASK] and i 've looked globally <unk> i 've taken all the countries in the world for the last forty years <unk> and looked to see what the relationship[MASK] <unk> is <unk> and the the short run <unk> say the first five to seven years[MASK] is just great in fact it 's hunky dory <unk> everything goes up you[MASK] get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so[MASK] gdp goes up a lot[MASK] fantastic <unk> that 's the short run[MASK] and how about the long run <unk> come back fifteen years later <unk> [MASK] well <unk> the short run <unk> it 's hunky dory <unk> but the long run <unk> it 's humpty dumpty[MASK] you go up in the short run <unk> but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they 'd had no booms at all [MASK] that is not a forecast about how commodity[MASK] <unk> prices go <unk> it 's a forecast of the consequences the long term consequences for growth of an increase in prices [MASK] so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it 's called [MASK] and again i 've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance <unk> the initial level of economic governance[MASK] <unk> resource booms accrue [MASK] in fact if you 've got good enough governance there is no resource boom <unk> you go up in the short term <unk> [MASK] and then you go up even more in the long term <unk> that 's norway the richest country in europe <unk> it 's australia it 's canada [MASK] the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a[MASK] <unk> threshold of governance they still go up in the short run <unk> that 's what we 're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment <unk> the best growth rates they 've had[MASK] ever and the question is whether the short run will persist and[MASK] with bad governance historically over the last forty years it hasn 't it 's countries like nigeria which are worse off than if they 'd never had oil <unk>[MASK] <unk> there 's a threshold level[MASK] above which you go up in the long term and below which you go down [MASK] just to benchmark that threshold it 's about the governance level of portugal in the mid 1980s [MASK] so the question is are the bottom billion above or below that threshold now there 's one big change[MASK] since the commodity booms of[MASK] <unk> is the spread of democracy <unk> [MASK] so i thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy [MASK] so i looked [MASK] democracy does have significant effects[MASK] and unfortunately they 're adverse <unk> democracies make even more[MASK] <unk> two distinct aspects of democracy [MASK] there 's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power <unk> and there are checks and balances which determine how you use power <unk>[MASK] <unk> it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that 's doing the damage with democracy <unk> whereas strong checks and balances[MASK] make resource booms good <unk> and so <unk> what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances <unk> [MASK] they haven 't got them <unk> they got instant democracy in the <unk>[MASK] elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances[MASK] in all the societies of the bottom billion <unk> there are intense struggles to do just that [MASK] the simple proposal is that we should have some international standards <unk> which will be voluntary <unk> but which would spell out the key decision points[MASK] that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues we know these international standards[MASK] <unk> work because we 've already got one it 's called the extractive industries transparency initiative [MASK] that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have [MASK] no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it [MASK] pushed it and published the revenues in the paper <unk> nigerian newspapers circulations spiked people wanted[MASK] <unk> to know[MASK] what their government was getting in terms of revenue <unk> so we know it works what would the content be[MASK] of these international standards i can 't go through all of them <unk> but i 'll give you[MASK] an example <unk> the first is[MASK] how to take the resources out of the ground the economic processes taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top[MASK] <unk> of the ground [MASK] and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction [MASK] you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they 've been sold over the last forty years [MASK] a company flies in does a deal with a minister <unk> and that 's great for the company <unk> and it 's quite often great for the minister[MASK] <unk> technology which can transform that and it 's called verified auctions <unk> [MASK] the[MASK] public agency with the greatest expertise on earth is of course the treasury that is the british treasury <unk> [MASK] and the british treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth[MASK] <unk> they worked out they were worth two billion pounds just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction <unk> it 'll reveal the value [MASK] it went for twenty billion pounds through auction <unk> if the british treasury can be out by a factor of ten [MASK] think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like [MASK] <unk> when i put that to the president of sierra leone the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions <unk> [MASK] there are five such decision points each one needs an international standard <unk> if we could do it [MASK] we would[MASK] change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are[MASK] <unk> for change [MASK] that 's our modest role [MASK] we cannot change these societies <unk> but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing <unk> [MASK] because the odds are so stacked against them <unk> [MASK] and yet we 've not got these rules if you think about it <unk> the cost of promulgating international rules[MASK] <unk> why on earth are they not there [MASK] i realized that the reason they 're not there[MASK] is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians[MASK] will get away with gestures that unless we have an informed society[MASK] <unk> what politicians do especially in relation to africa is gestures <unk> things that look good <unk> but don 't work [MASK] and so i realized[MASK] we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry[MASK]
