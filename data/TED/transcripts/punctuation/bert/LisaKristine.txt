 <unk> i 'm one hundred and fifty feet[MASK] down an illegal mine shaft in ghana[MASK] <unk> the air is thick with heat and dust <unk> and it 's hard to breathe[MASK] <unk> i can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness <unk> but i can 't see much else [MASK] i hear voices talking but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing <unk> [MASK] and stone being broken with primitive tools [MASK] like the others <unk> i wear a flickering cheap flashlight[MASK] tied to my head with this elastic <unk> tattered band[MASK] <unk> i can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three foot square hole[MASK] dropping hundreds of feet into the earth [MASK] when my hand slips i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip[MASK] and fell countless feet[MASK] down that shaft as i stand talking to you today[MASK] these men are still deep in that hole <unk> risking their lives without payment or compensation <unk> and often dying [MASK] i got to climb out of that hole <unk> and i got to go home <unk> [MASK] but they likely never will because they 're trapped[MASK] in slavery[MASK] <unk> for the last twenty eight years i 've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than seventy countries on six continents <unk> and in two thousand and nine i had the great honor[MASK] of being the sole exhibitor at the vancouver peace summit <unk> amongst all the astonishing people i met there <unk> [MASK] i met a supporter of free the slaves an ngo dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery <unk> [MASK] we started talking about slavery and really[MASK] <unk> really i started learning about slavery <unk> for i had certainly known it existed in the world <unk> but not to such a degree <unk> [MASK] after we finished talking i felt so horrible[MASK] and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime <unk> and i[MASK] i thought if i don 't know how many other people don 't know [MASK] it started burning a hole in my stomach so within weeks <unk> [MASK] i flew down to los angeles to meet with the director of free the slaves and offer them my help <unk> [MASK] thus began my journey into modern day slavery <unk> [MASK] oddly i had been to many of these places before some i even considered like my[MASK] <unk> but this time <unk> i would see the skeletons hidden in the closet a conservative estimate tells us there are more than <unk>[MASK] million people enslaved in the world today that 's double the amount of people taken from africa during the entire[MASK] trans atlantic slave trade [MASK] a hundred and fifty years ago an[MASK] <unk> agricultural slave[MASK] cost about three times the annual salary of an american worker [MASK] that equates to about $ fifty thousand in today 's money <unk> [MASK] yet today <unk> entire families can be enslaved for generations[MASK] over a debt as small as $ eighteen <unk> astonishingly slavery generates profits of more than $ thirteen[MASK] <unk> have been tricked by false promises[MASK] of a good education a better job [MASK] only to find that they 're forced to work without pay under the threat of violence <unk> and they cannot walk away [MASK] today 's slavery is about commerce so the goods that enslaved people produce have value <unk> but the people producing them[MASK] are disposable slavery exists[MASK] everywhere nearly in the world <unk> and yet it is illegal[MASK] everywhere in the world [MASK] in india and nepal i was introduced to the brick kilns [MASK] this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient egypt or dante 's inferno[MASK] <unk> inferno <unk> enveloped in temperatures[MASK] of one hundred and thirty degrees men women children [MASK] entire families in fact were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust <unk> [MASK] while mechanically stacking bricks on their head up to eighteen at a time <unk> and carrying them from the scorching kilns[MASK] to trucks hundreds of yards away <unk> deadened by monotony[MASK] <unk> and exhaustion <unk> they work silently <unk> doing this task over and over[MASK] for sixteen or seventeen hours a day [MASK] there were no breaks for food no water breaks <unk> and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential [MASK] pervasive was the heat and the dust[MASK] that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working [MASK] every twenty minutes i 'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it [MASK] and as i sat there i thought my camera is getting far better treatment[MASK] than these people back in the[MASK] <unk> i wanted to cry <unk> [MASK] but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said lisa don 't do that just don 't do that here and he very clearly explained to me[MASK] that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this not just for me <unk> but for them <unk> [MASK] i couldn 't offer them any direct help <unk> i couldn 't give them money <unk> [MASK] <unk> i wasn 't a citizen of that country <unk> i could get them in a worse[MASK] situation than they were already in [MASK] i 'd have to rely on free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation and i trusted[MASK] that they would as for me <unk> i 'd have to wait until i got home to really feel[MASK] my heartbreak in the himalayas i found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain[MASK] <unk> terrain[MASK] to trucks waiting at roads below <unk> [MASK] the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them <unk> and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these[MASK] handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth it 's difficult to witness something so[MASK] <unk> how can we affect something so insidious <unk> yet so pervasive <unk> [MASK] some don 't even know they 're enslaved people working sixteen seventeen hours a day without any pay <unk> [MASK] because this has been the case all their lives <unk> they have nothing[MASK] to compare it to [MASK] when these villagers claimed their freedom <unk> the slaveholders burned down all of their houses[MASK] <unk> i mean these people had nothing <unk> and they were so petrified they wanted to give up <unk> [MASK] but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere <unk> and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own so that now they do the same back breaking work <unk> [MASK] but they do it for themselves <unk> and they get paid for it <unk> and they do it in freedom[MASK] <unk> sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery <unk> and because of this worldwide awareness i was warned that it would be[MASK] difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry [MASK] in kathmandu i was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves <unk> [MASK] they ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this[MASK] dirty <unk> dimly fluorescent lit[MASK] basement [MASK] this wasn 't a brothel per se it was more like a restaurant <unk> cabin restaurants as they 're known in the trade are venues for forced prostitution <unk> [MASK] each has small private rooms where the slaves women <unk> along with young girls and boys some as young as seven years old [MASK] are forced to entertain the clients encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol[MASK] <unk> each cubicle is dark and dingy <unk> [MASK] identified with a painted number on the wall <unk> and partitioned by plywood and a curtain <unk> [MASK] the workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers <unk> [MASK] standing in the near darkness <unk> i remember[MASK] <unk> and in that instant i could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell [MASK] i had only one way out the stairs from where i 'd come in [MASK] there were no back doors <unk> there were no windows large enough to climb through these people[MASK] have no escape at all and as we take in such a difficult[MASK] <unk> it 's important to note[MASK] that slavery including sex trafficking occurs in our own backyard as well <unk> [MASK] tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture in restaurants in domestic servitude <unk> and the list can go on [MASK] recently the new york times reported that between one hundred thousand[MASK] and three hundred thousand american children are sold into sex slavery every year[MASK] it 's all around us we just don 't see it [MASK] the textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor <unk> [MASK] i visited villages in india where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade <unk> [MASK] this is a family portrait <unk> the dyed black hands are the[MASK] <unk> father <unk> while the blue and red hands are his sons <unk> [MASK] they mix dye in these big barrels <unk> and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows <unk> but the dye[MASK] is toxic [MASK] my interpreter told me their stories we have no freedom[MASK] <unk> we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing [MASK] it 's estimated that more than four thousand children[MASK] are enslaved on lake volta <unk> the largest man made lake in the world [MASK] when we first arrived <unk> i went to have a quick look <unk> i saw what seemed to be a[MASK] <unk> family fishing on a boat two older brothers some younger kids <unk> makes sense right <unk> [MASK] wrong they were all enslaved children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished <unk> [MASK] and they 're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake even though they do not know how to swim [MASK] this young child is eight years old[MASK] he was trembling when our boat approached frightened it would run over his tiny canoe <unk> he was petrified he would be knocked in the water [MASK] the skeletal tree limbs submerged in lake volta[MASK] often catch the fishing nets <unk> and weary frightened children are thrown into the water[MASK] to untether the lines many of them drown for[MASK] <unk> as long as he can recall <unk> he 's been forced to work on the lake <unk> [MASK] terrified of his master he will not run away <unk> and since he 's been treated with cruelty all his life <unk> [MASK] he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages <unk> [MASK] i met these boys at five in the morning when they were hauling in the last of their nets <unk> but they had been working since one[MASK] a m in the cold <unk> windy night <unk> [MASK] and it 's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they 're full of fish <unk> [MASK] i want to introduce you to kofi <unk> [MASK] kofi was rescued from a fishing village <unk> i met him at a shelter where free the slaves[MASK] rehabilitates victims of slavery[MASK] here he 's seen taking a bath at the well pouring big buckets of water over his head [MASK] and the wonderful news is as you and i are sitting here talking today <unk> kofi has been reunited with his family [MASK] and what 's even better his family has been given tools to make a living[MASK] and to keep their children[MASK] <unk> kofi is the embodiment[MASK] of possibility who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference[MASK] in his life <unk> [MASK] driving down a road in ghana with partners of free the slaves [MASK] a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window [MASK] he told us to follow him[MASK] down a dirt road into the jungle at the end[MASK] <unk> of the road he urged us out of the car and told the driver to quickly leave <unk> [MASK] then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath and said this is the path this is the path go [MASK] as we started down the path <unk> we pushed aside the vines blocking the way <unk> [MASK] and after about an hour of walking in found that the trail had become flooded[MASK] by recent rains[MASK] <unk> so i hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest <unk> [MASK] after another two hours of hiking <unk> the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing <unk> [MASK] and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field [MASK] and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring[MASK] many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold <unk> wading in water poisoned[MASK] by mercury mercury is used in the extraction process these miners[MASK] are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of ghana[MASK] <unk> when they came out of the shaft they were soaking wet from their own sweat <unk> [MASK] i remember looking into their tired <unk> bloodshot eyes for many of them had been underground for <unk>[MASK] hours [MASK] the shafts are up to three hundred feet deep <unk> [MASK] and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the[MASK] at first glance <unk> the pounding site seems full of powerful men <unk> [MASK] but when we look closer we see some less fortunate[MASK] working on the fringes <unk> and children too all of them are victim to injury <unk> illness[MASK] and violence in fact it 's very likely[MASK] <unk> that this muscular person will end up like this one here racked with tuberculosis[MASK] and mercury poisoning in just a few years [MASK] this is manuru when his father died his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines when his[MASK] <unk> manuru inherited his uncle 's debt which further forced him[MASK] into being enslaved in the mines <unk> when i met him he had been working in the mines for fourteen years <unk> [MASK] and the leg injury that you see here[MASK] is actually from a mining accident one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated on top of that[MASK] <unk> yet he 's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft even still he has a dream[MASK] that he will become free[MASK] and become educated with the help of local activists like free the slaves [MASK] and it 's this sort of determination in the face of unimaginable odds [MASK] that fills me[MASK] with complete awe[MASK] i want to shine a light on slavery <unk> [MASK] when i was working in the field <unk> i brought lots of candles with me [MASK] and with the help of my interpreter <unk> [MASK] i imparted to the people i was photographing that i wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight [MASK] so when it was safe for them and safe for me <unk> i made[MASK] <unk> these images <unk> [MASK] they knew their image would be seen by you out in the world <unk> [MASK] i wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them <unk> [MASK] and that we will do whatever we can[MASK] to help make a difference in their lives <unk> i truly believe <unk> if we can see one another as fellow human beings[MASK] <unk> then it becomes very difficult to tolerate[MASK] atrocities[MASK] like slavery <unk> [MASK] these images are not of issues they are of people real people like you and me all deserving of the same rights <unk> dignity and respect in their lives <unk> [MASK] there is not a day that goes by that i don 't think of these many[MASK] <unk> beautiful <unk> mistreated[MASK] people i 've had the tremendous[MASK] honor of meeting <unk> [MASK] i hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them people like you [MASK] and i hope that force will ignite a fire <unk> and that fire will shine a light on slavery <unk> [MASK] for without that light[MASK] <unk> the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
