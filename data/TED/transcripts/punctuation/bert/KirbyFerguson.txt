 <unk> years old and his career is just reaching its pinnacle he 's been christened the voice of a generation and he 's churning out classic[MASK] classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate [MASK] but there 's a small minority of dissenters <unk> and they claim that bob dylan is stealing other people 's songs [MASK] two thousand and four <unk> brian burton <unk> aka danger mouse <unk> [MASK] takes the beatles ' white album combines it with jay z 's the black album to create the grey album the grey album becomes an immediate sensation online and the beatles ' record company sends out[MASK] <unk> unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property [MASK] now the grey album is a remix it is new media created from old media it was made using these three techniques copy <unk> [MASK] transform and combine it 's how you remix you take existing songs [MASK] you chop them up you transform the pieces you combine them back together again and you 've got a new song but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs <unk> [MASK] but i think these aren 't just the[MASK] <unk> components of remixing [MASK] i think these are the basic elements of all creativity <unk> [MASK] i think everything is a remix <unk> and i think this is a better way to conceive of creativity all right[MASK] let 's head back to one thousand nine hundred and sixty four and let 's hear where some of dylan 's early songs came from we 'll do some side by side comparisons here all right this first song you 're going to[MASK] <unk> 'll hear dylan 's masters of war[MASK] <unk> so that 's the same basic melody and overall structure this next one <unk> is the patriot game by dominic behan alongside that you 're going to hear with god on our side[MASK] <unk> so in this case dylan admits he must have heard the patriot game he forgot about it then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain he just thought it was his song [MASK] last one this is who 's going to buy you ribbons another traditional folk tune <unk> alongside that is don 't think twice it 's all right this one 's more about the lyric[MASK] <unk> there 's a lot of these it 's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed this is pretty typical among folk singers <unk> [MASK] here 's the advice of dylan 's idol woody guthrie the worlds are the important thing don 't worry about tunes take a tune <unk> sing high when they sing low [MASK] sing fast when they sing slow and you 've got a new tune applause[MASK] and that 's that 's what guthrie did right here[MASK] <unk> this case performed by the carter family guthrie adapted it into this land is your land [MASK] so bob dylan like all folk singers <unk> he copied melodies he transformed[MASK] <unk> he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff[MASK] now american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others <unk> instead these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property <unk> [MASK] now <unk> creative works may indeed be kind of like property <unk> but it 's property that we 're all building on and creations can only take root and grow[MASK] once that ground has been prepared[MASK] <unk> ford once said i invented nothing new i simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work [MASK] progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable [MASK] two thousand and seven <unk> [MASK] the iphone makes it debut apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades[MASK] that 's multi touch controlling a device by touching its display [MASK] here is steve jobs introducing multi touch and making a rather foreboding joke steve jobs and we have invented a new technology called <unk>[MASK] you can do multi fingered gestures on it <unk> and boy have we patented it[MASK] <unk> earlier this is jeff han <unk> and i mean that 's multi touch it 's the same animal at least let 's hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology jeff han[MASK] multi touch sensing isn 't anything isn 't completely new i mean people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the ' 80s [MASK] the technology <unk> you know isn 't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility[MASK] <unk> so he 's pretty frank about it not being new <unk> so it 's not multi touch as a whole that 's patented it 's the small parts of it that are and it 's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent [MASK] to promote the progress of useful arts <unk> [MASK] here is the first ever[MASK] that is all there is to it apple has patented this it 's a 28 page software patent but i will summarize what it covers spoiler alert [MASK] unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger[MASK] i 'm only exaggerating a little bit it 's a broad patent now can someone own this idea now[MASK] back in the ' 80s there were no software patents <unk> and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface [MASK] what if they had patented pop up menus <unk> scrollbars the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets[MASK] <unk> would a young and inexperienced apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like xerox now [MASK] this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you 're the one getting remixed [MASK] for example sj i mean picasso had a saying he said good artists copy <unk> great artists steal and[MASK] <unk> two thousand and ten i 'm going to destroy android because it 's a stolen product [MASK] i 'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this okay[MASK] so in other words great artists steal <unk> but not from me [MASK] now behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion we have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours we have no such aversion towards copying what other people[MASK] <unk> have because we do that nonstop [MASK] so here 's the sort of equation we 're looking at [MASK] we 've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property <unk> plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases <unk> plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court <unk> plus cognitive <unk>[MASK] <unk> biases against perceived loss and the sum looks like this [MASK] <unk> is this promoting the progress of useful arts one thousand nine hundred[MASK] bob dylan is forty two years old [MASK] and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past <unk> he records a song called blind willie mctell named after the blues singer and[MASK] the song is a voyage through the past through a much darker time but a simpler one[MASK] <unk> time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did [MASK] i jump ' em from other writers but i arrange ' em my own way [MASK] i think this is mostly what we do our creativity comes from without not from within we are not self made we are dependent on one another [MASK] and admitting this to ourselves isn 't an embrace[MASK] <unk> 's a liberation from our misconceptions <unk> and it 's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin[MASK]
