 <unk> we most certainly do talk to terrorists <unk> no question about it <unk> we are at war[MASK] with a new form of terrorism <unk> it 's sort of the good old traditional form of terrorism <unk> but it 's sort of been packaged for the[MASK] one of the big things about countering terrorism[MASK] is [MASK] how do you perceive it <unk> because perception leads to your response to it [MASK] so if you have a traditional perception of terrorism[MASK] <unk> it would be that it 's one of criminality one of war so[MASK] <unk> you going to respond to it naturally it would follow that you meet kind with kind you fight it[MASK] <unk> if you have a more modernist approach <unk> and your perception of terrorism is almost cause and effect then[MASK] naturally from that the responses that come out of it[MASK] are much more asymmetrical [MASK] we live in a modern global world terrorists have actually adapted to it <unk> it 's something we have to[MASK] too and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses[MASK] have to start in effect putting on their <unk> google tinted glasses or whatever [MASK] for my part what i wanted us to do was just to look at[MASK] terrorism as though it was a global brand say coca cola both are fairly bad for your health[MASK] if you look at[MASK] it as a brand in those ways what you 'll come to realize is <unk> it 's a pretty flawed product as we 've said it 's pretty bad for your health[MASK] <unk> it 's bad for those who it affects and it 's not actually good if you 're a suicide bomber either[MASK] <unk> it doesn 't actually do what it says on the tin[MASK] <unk> you 're not really going to[MASK] <unk> get seventy two virgins in heaven[MASK] it 's not going to happen i don 't think [MASK] and you 're not really going to in the ' 80s end capitalism by supporting one of these groups it 's a load of nonsense but what you realize it 's got an achilles ' heel <unk> [MASK] the brand has an achilles ' heel <unk> [MASK] we 've mentioned the health <unk> but it needs consumers to buy into it [MASK] the consumers it needs[MASK] are the terrorist constituency they 're the people who buy into the brand support them facilitate them [MASK] and they 're the people we 've got to reach out to [MASK] we 've got to attack that brand in front of them <unk> there 's two essential ways of doing that if we carry on this brand theme one is reducing their market <unk>[MASK] <unk> what i mean is it 's their brand[MASK] against our brand[MASK] <unk> we 've got to compete <unk> we 've got to show we 're a better product <unk> if i 'm trying to show we 're a better product [MASK] i probably wouldn 't do things like guantanamo bay <unk> [MASK] we 've talked there about curtailing the underlying need[MASK] for the product itself you could be looking there at poverty injustice[MASK] <unk> all those sorts of things which feed terrorism <unk> the other thing to do is to knock the product <unk> [MASK] attack the brand myth as we 've said you know there 's nothing heroic about killing a young kid <unk> [MASK] perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across[MASK] <unk> we 've got to reveal the dangers in the product our target audience <unk> it 's not just the producers of terrorism as i 've said the[MASK] <unk> it 's not just the marketeers of terrorism which is those who finance those who facilitate it <unk> [MASK] but it 's the consumers of terrorism <unk> we 've got to get in to those homelands that 's where they recruit from that 's where they get their power and strength that 's where their consumers come from <unk> [MASK] and we have to get our messaging in there [MASK] so the essentials are we 've got to have interaction in those areas with the terrorists the facilitators etc[MASK] <unk> 've got to engage <unk> we 've got to educate <unk> and we 've got to have dialogue <unk> now[MASK] <unk> staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds[MASK] think about delivery mechanisms how are we going to do these attacks well <unk> reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society[MASK] <unk> we 've got to show we 're better <unk> we 've got to show our values[MASK] <unk> we 've got to practice what we preach <unk> but when it comes to knocking the brand <unk> if the terrorists are coca cola and we 're pepsi <unk> [MASK] i don 't think being pepsi <unk> anything we say about coca cola anyone 's going to believe us [MASK] so we 've got to find a different mechanism <unk> and one of the best mechanisms i 've ever come across is[MASK] <unk> the victims of terrorism <unk> they are somebody who can actually stand there and say this product 's crap [MASK] i had it and i was sick for days <unk> it burnt my hand whatever you believe them you can see their scars <unk> you trust them[MASK] <unk> but whether it 's victims whether it 's governments <unk> ngos or even the queen yesterday [MASK] <unk> in northern ireland we have to interact and engage with those different[MASK] layers of terrorism and in effect we do have to have a little dance with the devil this[MASK] is my favorite part of my speech i wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point but [MASK] <unk> for health and safety reasons have told me i 've got to do a countdown so[MASK] i feel like a bit of an irish or jewish terrorist sort of a health and safety terrorist and i [MASK] i 've got to count three two one and[MASK] it 's a bit alarming <unk> so thinking of what my motto would be and it would be body parts not heart attacks[MASK] <unk> was a suicide bomber amongst us all we 're all victims of terrorism <unk> there 's six hundred and twenty five of us in this room we 're going to be scarred for life [MASK] there was[MASK] a father and a son who sat in that seat over there the son 's dead the father lives <unk> the father[MASK] will[MASK] probably kick himself for years to come that he didn 't take that seat[MASK] instead of his kid he 's going to take to alcohol and he 's probably going to kill himself in three years that 's the stats there 's a[MASK] very young attractive lady over here <unk> and she has something which i think 's the worst form of psychological physical injury i 've ever seen out of[MASK] <unk> a suicide bombing <unk> it 's human shrapnel <unk> [MASK] what it means is when she sat in a restaurant in years to come ten years to come fifteen years to come or she 's on the beach <unk> every so often she 's going to start rubbing her skin <unk> [MASK] and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel <unk> [MASK] and that is a[MASK] hard thing for[MASK] <unk> 's a lady over there as well who lost her legs in this[MASK] bombing <unk> she 's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our[MASK] government[MASK] for looking after what 's happened to her she had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities she 's going to give up university to[MASK] look after mum we 're all here <unk> and all of those[MASK] <unk> who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event <unk> but all of you here who are victims are going to learn[MASK] some hard truths that is our society <unk> we sympathize <unk> [MASK] but after a while <unk> we start to ignore <unk> we don 't do enough as a society <unk> we do not look after our victims <unk> and we do not enable them[MASK] <unk> and what i 'm going to try and show is that actually victims are the best weapon we have[MASK] against more terrorism <unk> how would the government at the turn of the millennium[MASK] approach today well we all know what they 'd have done then is an invasion[MASK] <unk> if the suicide bomber was from wales good luck to wales i 'd say[MASK] knee jerk legislation[MASK] <unk> emergency provision legislation which hits at the very basis of our society as we all know[MASK] it 's a mistake [MASK] we 're going to drive prejudice throughout edinburgh throughout the u k [MASK] for welsh people [MASK] today 's approach governments have learned from their mistakes <unk> they are looking at what i 've started off on on these more asymmetrical[MASK] approaches to it <unk> more modernist views[MASK] <unk> cause and effect <unk> but mistakes of the past are inevitable it 's human nature <unk> the fear and the pressure to do[MASK] <unk> just to before the bang to this idea of brand and i was talking about coke and pepsi <unk> etc <unk> [MASK] we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war they 'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against[MASK] injustice imperialism <unk> etc <unk> [MASK] we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield[MASK] <unk> 's not just [ our ] flesh and blood they want <unk> they actually want our cultural souls <unk> and that 's why the brand analogy[MASK] is a very interesting way of looking at this <unk> if we look at[MASK] al qaeda <unk> al qaeda was essentially a[MASK] product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of nine eleven launched it <unk> it was its big marketing day[MASK] <unk> and it was packaged for the 21st century they knew what they were doing[MASK] they were effectively [ doing ] something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world where there 's poverty ignorance and injustice[MASK] we as i 've said have got to[MASK] <unk> looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots [MASK] now it 's got a title <unk> everyone 's doing it there 's a bomb people start suing <unk> but one of the first early cases on this was the omagh bombing[MASK] <unk> a civil action was brought from one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight [MASK] in omagh bomb went off real ira middle of a peace process that meant that[MASK] the culprits couldn 't really be prosecuted[MASK] for lots of reasons <unk> mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on the greater good [MASK] it also meant then if you can imagine this that the people who bombed your children[MASK] and your husbands were walking around the supermarket[MASK] that you lived in some of those victims said enough is enough we brought a private action[MASK] <unk> and thank god ten years later we actually won it <unk> there is a slight appeal on at the moment so i have to be a bit careful but i 'm[MASK] fairly confident why was it effective it was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void <unk> [MASK] it was because the real ira and other terrorist groups their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog when we put the victims[MASK] <unk> as the underdog and flipped it [MASK] they didn 't know what to do <unk> [MASK] they were embarrassed their recruitment went down the bombs actually stopped fact because of this action [MASK] we became <unk> or those victims became more importantly a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization <unk> [MASK] there 's other examples we have a case called almog which is to do with[MASK] <unk> bank[MASK] that was allegedly from our point of view <unk> giving rewards to suicide bombers just by[MASK] bringing the very action [MASK] that bank has stopped doing it <unk> [MASK] and indeed the powers that be around the world which for real politic reasons before <unk> couldn 't actually deal with this issue because there was lots of competing interests have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system[MASK] 's another case called the mcdonald case where some victims of semtex of the provisional ira bombings [MASK] which were supplied by gaddafi <unk> [MASK] sued <unk> and that action has led to amazing[MASK] things for new libya libya new libya has been compassionate towards those victims and started taking it so it started a whole new dialogue there[MASK] but the problem is we need more[MASK] and more support for these ideas and cases civil affairs and[MASK] civil society initiatives a good one is in somalia there 's a war on piracy if anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy like a war on terrorism and beat it <unk> you 're wrong [MASK] what we 're trying to do[MASK] <unk> is turn pirates to fisherman they used to be fisherman of course[MASK] <unk> but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste in their water [MASK] so what we 're trying to do is create security and employment by bringing a coastguard along with the fisheries industry <unk> and i can guarantee you as that builds <unk> al shabaab and such likes <unk>[MASK] <unk> will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people [MASK] <unk> importantly <unk> it takes the war to their homelands and not onto our shore <unk> and we 're looking at the causes <unk> the last one i wanted to talk about was dialogue[MASK] <unk> the advantages of dialogue are obvious it self educates both sides[MASK] <unk> enables a better understanding <unk> reveals the strengths and weaknesses <unk> and yes like some of the speakers before <unk> the shared vulnerability does lead to trust[MASK] <unk> and it does then become that process part of normalization <unk> but it 's not an easy road after[MASK] the bomb the victims are not into this there 's practical problems <unk> it 's politically risky for the protagonists[MASK] and for the interlocutors <unk> on one occasion i was doing it every time i did a point that they didn 't like they actually threw stones at me <unk> and when i did a point they liked[MASK] <unk> they starting shooting in the air <unk> equally not great [MASK] laughter whatever the point it gets to the heart of the problem <unk> you 're doing it <unk> you 're talking to them <unk> now i just want to end[MASK] with saying <unk> if we follow reason [MASK] we realize that i think we 'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it[MASK] <unk> we need to foster more modern and asymmetrical responses to it <unk> [MASK] this isn 't about being soft on terrorism <unk> it 's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields <unk> [MASK] we must foster innovation as i 've said <unk> [MASK] governments are receptive <unk> it won 't come from those dusty corridors <unk> the private sector has a role [MASK] the role we could do right now is going away and looking at how[MASK] <unk> we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives <unk> [MASK] if i was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one 's perception to it and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it[MASK] <unk> but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point <unk> [MASK] we have to ask ourselves these questions however unpalatable have we been[MASK] <unk> ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world [MASK] what if actually engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do what if the bombs are just simply wake up calls for us [MASK] what happens[MASK] if that bomb went off because we didn 't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue[MASK] to deal with these things and interaction[MASK] <unk> what is definitely uncontroversial is that as i 've said we 've got to stop being reactive and more proactive <unk> and i just want to leave you[MASK] with one idea which is that it[MASK] 's a provocative question for you to think about and the answer will require sympathy with the devil[MASK] <unk> it 's a question that 's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers <unk> what if society actually needs[MASK] <unk> crisis to change <unk> what if society actually needs terrorism[MASK] to change and adapt for the better it 's those bulgakov themes <unk> it 's that picture of jesus and the devil hand in hand in gethsemane[MASK] walking into the moonlight what it would mean is that humans[MASK] <unk> in order to survive in development <unk> quite darwinian spirit here inherently must dance with the devil[MASK]
