 <unk> so have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a place with no rules that sounds pretty cool [MASK] you wake up one morning however and you discover that the reason there are no rules is because there 's no government and there are no laws in fact[MASK] <unk> fact all social institutions[MASK] have disappeared <unk> [MASK] so there 's no schools there 's no hospitals there 's no police there 's no banks there 's no athletic clubs [MASK] there 's no utilities well[MASK] i know a little bit about what this is like because when i was a medical student in one thousand [MASK] <unk> i worked in a refugee camp in the balkans during the kosovo war when the war was over i got permission unbelievably from my medical school[MASK] to take some time off and follow some of the families that i had befriended[MASK] in the camp back to their village in kosovo and understand how they navigated life in this postwar[MASK] setting <unk>[MASK] <unk> postwar kosovo was a very interesting place because nato troops were there mostly to make sure the war didn 't break out again <unk> [MASK] but other than that it was actually a lawless place and almost every social institution both public and private had been destroyed <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] i can tell you that when you go into one of these situations and settings[MASK] <unk> absolutely thrilling for about thirty minutes <unk> because that 's about how long it takes before you run into a situation[MASK] where[MASK] you realize how incredibly vulnerable you are [MASK] for me that moment came when i had to cross the first checkpoint <unk> and i realized as i drove up that i would be negotiating passage[MASK] through this checkpoint with a[MASK] <unk> armed individual[MASK] who if he decided to shoot me right then and there actually wouldn 't be doing anything illegal <unk> [MASK] but the sense of vulnerability that i had was absolutely nothing[MASK] in comparison to the vulnerability of the families that i got to know over that year you see life[MASK] in a society where there are no social institutions is[MASK] with danger and uncertainty <unk> and simple questions like what are we going to eat tonight [MASK] are very complicated to answer [MASK] questions about security when you don 't have any security systems are terrifying is[MASK] that altercation i had with the neighbor down the block going to turn into a violent episode that will end my life or my family 's life[MASK] <unk> health concerns when there is no health system[MASK] are also terrifying <unk> [MASK] i listened as many families had to sort through questions like my infant has a fever what am i going to do [MASK] my sister who is pregnant is bleeding [MASK] what should i do who should i turn to where are the doctors where are the nurses <unk> if i could find one are they trustworthy [MASK] how will i pay them in what currency will i pay them[MASK] <unk> i need medications where will i find them <unk> if i take those medications are they actually counterfeits and on and on [MASK] so for life in these settings <unk> the dominant theme <unk> the dominant feature of life [MASK] is the incredible vulnerability[MASK] that people have to manage day in and day out because of the lack of social systems[MASK] <unk> and it actually turns out that this feature of life[MASK] is incredibly difficult to explain and be understood by people who are living outside of it i discovered this[MASK] when i left kosovo i came back to boston i became a physician <unk> i became a global public health policy[MASK] <unk> i joined the harvard medical school and brigham and women 's hospital division of global health [MASK] and i as a researcher really wanted to get started on this problem right away i was like how do we reduce the crushing vulnerability of people living in these types of fragile settings [MASK] is there any way we can start to think about how to protect and quickly recover the institutions that are critical to survival like the health system [MASK] and i have to say i had amazing colleagues[MASK] but one interesting thing about it was this was sort of an unusual question for them they were kind of like oh if you work in war doesn 't that mean you[MASK] work on refugee camps and you work on documenting mass atrocities which is by the way very very very important so it took me a while[MASK] to explain why i was so passionate about this issue <unk> until about six years ago that 's when this landmark study[MASK] <unk> at and described the public health consequences of war was published[MASK] they came to an incredible provocative conclusion [MASK] these researchers concluded[MASK] that the vast majority of death and disability from war happens after the cessation of conflict so the most dangerous time to be a person living in a[MASK] <unk> after the cessation of hostilities <unk> it 's after the peace deal has been signed it 's when that political solution has been achieved <unk> that seems so puzzling but of course it 's not [MASK] because war kills people[MASK] by robbing them of their clinics of their hospitals of their supply chains their doctors are[MASK] <unk> on the run and more invisible and yet more deadly[MASK] is the destruction of the health governance institutions and their finances <unk> [MASK] so this is really not surprising at all to me <unk> [MASK] but what is surprising and somewhat dismaying is how little impact this insight has had in terms of how we think about human suffering[MASK] <unk> let me give you a couple examples last year you may remember ebola hit[MASK] the west african country of liberia[MASK] there was a lot of reporting about this group doctors without borders sounding the alarm and calling for aid and assistance <unk> [MASK] but not a lot of that reporting answered the question why is doctors without borders even in liberia [MASK] <unk> borders is an amazing organization <unk> dedicated and designed to provide emergency care in war zones [MASK] liberia 's civil war had ended in two thousand and three that was eleven years before ebola even struck [MASK] when ebola struck liberia there were less than fifty doctors in the entire country of four point five million people [MASK] doctors without borders is in liberia[MASK] because liberia still doesn 't really have a functioning health system eleven years later [MASK] when the earthquake hit haiti in two thousand and ten <unk> the outpouring of international aid was phenomenal [MASK] but did you know that only two percent of that funding[MASK] went to rebuild haitian public institutions including its health sector from that perspective <unk> haitians continue to die from the earthquake even[MASK] <unk> he 's the minister of health in the northern autonomous region of iraq in kurdistan here he is announcing[MASK] that in the last nine months [MASK] his country <unk> his region has increased from four million people to five million people [MASK] that 's a twenty five percent increase <unk> thousands of these new arrivals have experienced[MASK] <unk> his budget has not increased by twenty five percent it has decreased by twenty percent as funding has flowed to security concerns[MASK] and to short term relief efforts when his health sector fails and if history is any guide it will[MASK] how do you think that 's going to influence the decision making of the five million people in his region as they think about whether[MASK] <unk> should flee that type of vulnerable living situation [MASK] so as you can see this is a frustrating topic for me and i really try to understand <unk> why the reluctance[MASK] to protect and support indigenous health systems and security systems i usually tier two concerns two arguments[MASK] <unk> the first concern is about corruption and the concern that people in these settings are corrupt and[MASK] <unk> and they are untrustworthy <unk> and i will admit that i have met unsavory characters working in health sectors in these situations but i will tell you that the opposite[MASK] is absolutely true in every case i have worked on from afghanistan to libya to kosovo to haiti to liberia[MASK] i have met inspiring people who when the chips were down for their country <unk> they risked everything to save their health institutions[MASK] the trick for the outsider who wants to help[MASK] is identifying who those individuals are and building a pathway for them to lead <unk> that is exactly what happened in afghanistan [MASK] one of the[MASK] unsung and untold success stories of our nation building effort in afghanistan[MASK] involved the world[MASK] bank in two thousand and two investing heavily in identifying training and promoting[MASK] afghani health sector leaders [MASK] these health sector leaders have pulled off an incredible feat in afghanistan <unk> they have[MASK] aggressively increased access to health care for the majority of the population they are rapidly improving the health status of the afghan population which used to be the worst in the[MASK] <unk> in fact the afghan ministry of health does things that i wish we would do in america <unk> they use things like data to make policy <unk> it 's incredible [MASK] laughter the other concern i hear a lot about is we just can 't afford it we just don 't have the money it 's just unsustainable [MASK] i would submit to you that the current situation and the current system we have is the most expensive[MASK] <unk> inefficient system we could possibly conceive of the current situation is that when governments like the us or let 's say the collection of governments that make up the european commission[MASK] every year <unk> they spend fifteen billion dollars on just humanitarian and emergency and disaster relief worldwide[MASK] that 's nothing about foreign aid that 's just disaster relief ninety five percent of it[MASK] goes to international relief[MASK] <unk> that then[MASK] have to import resources into these areas and knit together some type of temporary health system let 's say which they then dismantle and send away when they run out of money <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] our job it turns out is very clear [MASK] we as the global health community policy experts our first job[MASK] <unk> how to monitor the strengths and vulnerabilities of health systems in threatened situations[MASK] <unk> and that 's when we see doctors fleeing when we see health resources drying up when we see institutions crumbling[MASK] that 's the emergency <unk> that 's when we need to sound the alarm and wave our arms <unk> ok [MASK] not now <unk> everyone can see that 's an emergency they don 't need us to tell them that[MASK] <unk> places like where i work at harvard need to take their cue from the world bank experience in afghanistan and we need to and we will build robust platforms to support health sector leaders like these[MASK] these people risk their lives i think we can[MASK] match their courage with some support number three we need to reach out and make new partnerships at our global health center[MASK] <unk> we have launched a new initiative with nato and other security policy makers to explore with them what they can do to protect[MASK] health system institutions during deployments we want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions[MASK] is an integral part of their mission it 's not just about avoiding collateral damage <unk> it 's about winning the peace[MASK] but the most important partner we need to engage is you [MASK] the american public and indeed the world public because unless you[MASK] understand the value of[MASK] social institutions like health systems in these fragile settings you won 't support efforts to save them you won 't click on that article[MASK] that talks about hey <unk> all those doctors[MASK] <unk> are on the run in country x i wonder what that means <unk> i wonder what that means for that health system 's ability to let 's say detect[MASK] influenza hmm it 's probably not good that 's what i 'd tell you <unk> up on the screen i 've put up my[MASK] three favorite[MASK] american institution defenders and builders over here is[MASK] <unk> george c marshall he was the guy that proposed the marshall plan to save all of europe 's economic institutions after world war ii [MASK] and this eleanor roosevelt her work on human rights really serves as the foundation for all of our international human rights organizations [MASK] then my big favorite is ben franklin[MASK] <unk> did many things in terms of creating institutions but was the midwife of our constitution <unk> and i would say to you[MASK] that these are folks who when our country was threatened or our world was threatened <unk> [MASK] they didn 't retreat <unk> they didn 't talk about building walls <unk> they talked about building institutions[MASK] to protect human security [MASK] for their generation and also for ours <unk> and i think our generation should do the same[MASK]
