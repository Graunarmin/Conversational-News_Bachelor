 <unk> faith is not very well thought of as being one that[MASK] <unk> that is grounded in compassion the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran[MASK] consists of one hundred and fourteen chapters[MASK] and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala the saying in the name of god[MASK] the all compassionate the all merciful[MASK] or as sir richard burton not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a world wide[MASK] <unk> traveler and translator of many works of literature[MASK] translates it as in the name of god the the compassionating the compassionate[MASK] and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity[MASK] god says to his prophet muhammad whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning[MASK] <unk> with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad[MASK] said that we have not sent you oh muhammad except as a raham except as a source of compassion to humanity[MASK] and for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims[MASK] whose mission and whose purpose[MASK] in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet[MASK] and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves with the attributes of god[MASK] and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion[MASK] in fact[MASK] <unk> the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion or reigned himself in by compassion[MASK] therefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion[MASK] activators of compassion[MASK] actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and[MASK] <unk> do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world[MASK] for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path[MASK] in every religious tradition there is what you call the outer path and the inner path[MASK] or the exoteric path and the esoteric path[MASK] the esoteric path of islam is more popularly[MASK] <unk> known as sufism or tasawwuf in arabic[MASK] and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition[MASK] refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lie[MASK] in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his[MASK] followers we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle[MASK] and they said messenger of god we are battle weary[MASK] how can we go to a greater battle he said that is the battle of the self[MASK] the battle of the ego[MASK] the sources of human problems[MASK] have to do with egotism i[MASK] the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you has a story[MASK] in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend[MASK] and knocks on the door[MASK] and a voice answers who 's there[MASK] it 's me or more grammatically correctly it is i as we might say in english[MASK] the voice says go away[MASK] after many years of training of disciplining of[MASK] of search and struggle he comes back and with much greater humility he knocks again on the door[MASK] <unk> the voice asks who is there he said it is you oh heartbreaker[MASK] the door swings open[MASK] and the voice says come in for there is no room in this house for two is[MASK] two capital i not not these eyes[MASK] for two egos[MASK] and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path[MASK] in the presence of god there is no room for more than one i[MASK] and that is the i of divinity[MASK] in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant or my creature my human[MASK] <unk> creature does not approach me[MASK] by anything that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do[MASK] and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean you want your employees your employees to do what you ask them to do[MASK] and if they 've done that then they can do extra but don 't ignore what you 've asked them to do[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> god says my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do extra credit we might call it[MASK] until i love him or love her[MASK] and when i love my servant god says i become the eyes by which he[MASK] or she sees[MASK] the ears by which he[MASK] <unk> or she listens[MASK] the hand by which he or she grasps and the foot[MASK] by which he or she walks and the heart by which he or she understands[MASK] it is this merging[MASK] of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose[MASK] <unk> of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions[MASK] muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism[MASK] the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path[MASK] when he says i am the spirit and i am the way[MASK] when the prophet muhammad said whoever has[MASK] <unk> seen me has seen god[MASK] it is because they became so much an instrument[MASK] of god they became part of god 's steam[MASK] so that god 's will was manifest through them and not acting from their own self and their own ego[MASK] compassion on earth is given it is in us all we have[MASK] <unk> to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way[MASK] i 'm sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you[MASK] have had what you might call a spiritual experience[MASK] a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute[MASK] <unk> perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at[MASK] that minute you felt at one[MASK] with the universe[MASK] one with that jug of water one with every human being one with the creator[MASK] and you felt[MASK] in the presence of power of awe of the deepest love[MASK] the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives[MASK] that is a moment which is a gift of god to us a gift when for a moment[MASK] <unk> he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on i i i me me me[MASK] and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say oh this is all you[MASK] this is all you and this is all us[MASK] and us and i and us are all part of you all creator all the objective[MASK] the source of our being and the end of our journey you[MASK] are also the breaker of our hearts you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live[MASK] and for whose purpose[MASK] we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to god[MASK] to what extent we have been compassionate beings our message today[MASK] and our purpose today and those of you who are here today and the purpose of this charter of compassion[MASK] is to remind for the koran always urges us[MASK] to remember to remind each[MASK] <unk> other because the knowledge of truth is within every human being[MASK] we know it all[MASK] we have access to it all jung may have called it the subconscious[MASK] through our subconscious in your dreams which[MASK] <unk> our state of sleep the lesser death the temporary death[MASK] in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions we travel[MASK] even outside of our bodies for many of us and we[MASK] we see wonderful things[MASK] we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it[MASK] and beyond the limitations of time as we know it but all this is for us to[MASK] glorify the name of the creator[MASK] whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate god bokh whatever[MASK] <unk> name you want to call him with allah ram om whatever the name might be[MASK] through which you name or access the presence of divinity is the locus[MASK] of absolute being[MASK] absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus[MASK] <unk> call satchidananda the language differs[MASK] but the objective is the same[MASK] rumi has another story[MASK] about three a turk an arab and i forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay[MASK] one is asking for angour one is say an englishman one is asking for eneb and one is asking for[MASK] <unk> grapes[MASK] and they have a fight and an argument because i want grapes i want eneb i want angour[MASK] not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages[MASK] there 's only one absolute reality by definition[MASK] one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition[MASK] <unk> single and absolute and singular[MASK] there 's this absolute concentration of being[MASK] the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute[MASK] locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity[MASK] <unk> and that should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human[MASK] for what defines humanity perhaps biologically[MASK] is our physiology but god defines humanity by our[MASK] <unk> koran says[MASK] he speaks to the angels and says when i have finished the formation of adam from clay[MASK] and breathed into him of my spirit then fall in prostration to him[MASK] the angels[MASK] prostrate not before the human body[MASK] but before the human soul[MASK] <unk> soul why because the soul the human soul embodies[MASK] a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul[MASK] this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image[MASK] what is the imagery of god[MASK] the imagery of god[MASK] is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love[MASK] and therefore for us to be human[MASK] in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human means that we too[MASK] have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us[MASK] and to seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive of beingness[MASK] the attribute of wisdom of of consciousness of awareness[MASK] and the attribute of being compassionate and loving[MASK] beings this[MASK] is what i understand from my faith tradition[MASK] and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions[MASK] and this is the common platform on which we must all stand[MASK] and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced that[MASK] <unk> we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally[MASK] that we 're on the verge[MASK] and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about[MASK] the prophecy of isiah for he foretold of a period when[MASK] <unk> shall transform their swords into plowshares[MASK] and will not learn war and make war anymore[MASK] we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option[MASK] we must we must[MASK] lower our[MASK] <unk> egos[MASK] control our egos whether it is individual ego personal ego family ego[MASK] national ego[MASK] and let all be for the glorification of the one thank you and god[MASK]
