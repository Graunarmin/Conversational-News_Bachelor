 <unk> cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over fifty years last october there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies[MASK] and how bad the situation would get[MASK] <unk> knowing where help was needed[MASK] always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most [MASK] we 've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage [MASK] but we still can 't do that with water [MASK] and here 's why right now if you want to test water in the field you need a trained technician expensive equipment like this[MASK] <unk> and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results <unk> it 's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground[MASK] before they change too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing and it ignores the fact that in the meanwhile people still need to drink water [MASK] most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak[MASK] didn 't come from testing water <unk> it came from[MASK] <unk> forms like this which documented all the people we failed to help [MASK] countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they 're safe [MASK] i 've been inspired by that simplicity as i 've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i 've ever known [MASK] we think there 's a simpler solution to this problem one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday[MASK] 's in its early stages <unk> but this is what it looks like right now <unk> [MASK] we call it the water canary it 's a fast <unk> cheap device that answers an important question is this water contaminated [MASK] it doesn 't require any special training and instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place <unk>[MASK] <unk> that means there 's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place no need to use reagents that can run out[MASK] and no need to be an expert to get actionable information [MASK] to test water <unk> you simply insert a sample and within seconds it either displays a red light <unk> indicating contaminated water <unk> or a green light indicating the sample is safe [MASK] this will make it possible for anyone to collect life saving information[MASK] and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold[MASK] <unk> we 're also on top of that integrating wireless networking into an affordable device[MASK] with gps and gsm what that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time [MASK] with enough users maps like this will make it possible to take preventive[MASK] <unk> containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from [MASK] and then instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most it can happen automatically <unk> [MASK] we 've seen how distributed networks big data[MASK] and information can transform society <unk> i think it 's time for us to apply them to water <unk> our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field[MASK] and to open source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation so we can tackle this problem together <unk> thank you[MASK]
