 <unk> as you might imagine i 'm absolutely passionate about dance <unk> i 'm passionate about making it about watching it about encouraging others to participate in it and i 'm also really passionate about creativity[MASK] <unk> creativity for[MASK] <unk> something that 's absolutely critical and i think it 's something that you can teach i think the technicities of creativity can be taught and shared <unk> and i think you can find out things about your own personal physical <unk>[MASK] signature your own cognitive habits and use that as a point of departure to misbehave beautifully [MASK] and john travolta was big in those days grease saturday night fever and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing my parents were very up for me going[MASK] <unk> encouraged me to take risks to go to try to try <unk> i had an opportunity an access to a local[MASK] dance studio <unk> and i had an enlightened teacher[MASK] who allowed me to make up my own and invent my own dances <unk> so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and latin american dances to teach to my peers[MASK] <unk> and that was the very first time that i found an opportunity to feel that i was able to express my own voice and that 's what 's fueled me then to become a choreographer i feel like i 've got something to say and something to share <unk> [MASK] and i guess what 's[MASK] interesting is is that i am now obsessed with the technology of the body i think it 's the most technologically literate thing[MASK] that we have <unk> and i 'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them touch them[MASK] <unk> think differently about things [MASK] so for me choreography is very much a process of physical thinking it 's very much in mind as well as in body <unk> and it 's a collaborative process it 's something that i have to do <unk>[MASK] <unk> with other people you know it 's a distributed cognitive process in a way i work often with[MASK] <unk> but also more and more with[MASK] economists anthropologists neuroscientists cognitive scientists people really who come from very different domains of expertise where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process[MASK] <unk> what i thought we would do today a little bit is explore this idea of physical thinking <unk> and we 're all experts in physical thinking[MASK] <unk> you all have a body right <unk> and we all know what that body is like in the real world so one of the aspects of physical thinking that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception the sense of my own body in the space <unk>[MASK] in the real world so we all understand what it feels like to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms <unk> yeah <unk> you absolutely know that when you 're going to grab a <unk>[MASK] <unk> cup or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it so we 're experts in physical thinking already we just don 't think about our bodies very much we only think about them when they go wrong so when[MASK] <unk> 's a broken arm or when you have a heart attack then you become really very aware of your bodies <unk> but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking kinesthetic intelligence to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally[MASK] what i thought i 'd do is i 'd make a ted premiere <unk> i 'm not sure if this is going to be good or not i 'll just be doing it[MASK] <unk> i[MASK] <unk> use three versions of physical thinking to make something i want to introduce you this is paolo <unk> this is catarina [MASK] applause they have no idea what we 're going to do <unk> so[MASK] this is not the type of choreography where i already have in mind what i 'm going to make where i 've fixed the routine in my head and i 'm just going to teach it to them and these so called empty vessels are just going to learn it that 's not the methodology at all that we work with[MASK] <unk> but what 's important about it is how[MASK] <unk> it is that they 're grasping information how they 're taking information how they 're using it and how they 're thinking with it i 'm going to start really really simply usually dance has a stimulus or stimuli <unk> [MASK] and i thought i 'd take something simple ted logo we can all see it it 's quite easy[MASK] to work with <unk> and i 'm going to do something very simply where you take one idea from a body and it happens to be my body <unk> and translate that into somebody else 's body <unk> so it 's a direct transfer <unk> transformation of energy[MASK] and i 'm going to imagine this you can do this too if you like that i 'm going to just take the letter t and i 'm going to imagine it in mind <unk> and i 'm going to place that outside in the real world so i absolutely see <unk>[MASK] a letter t in front of me <unk> yeah it 's absolutely there i can absolutely walk around it when i see it <unk> yeah <unk> it has a kind of a grammar <unk> i know what i 'm going to do with it <unk> and i can start to describe it <unk> [MASK] <unk> hand and then i move my hand i can describe it whoa in my head you know whoa <unk> okay <unk> i can do also my shoulder <unk> yeah it gives me something to do something to work towards <unk> [MASK] if i were to take that letter t and flatten it down on the floor [MASK] here <unk> maybe just off the floor all of a sudden i could do maybe something with my knee yeah [MASK] whoa so if i put the knee and the arms together i 've got something physical yeah and i can start to build something <unk> so what i 'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is[MASK] <unk> take that concept i 'm going to make something and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it they 're going to snapshot it they 're going to take aspects of it <unk> [MASK] and it 's almost like i 'm offloading memory and they 're holding onto memory yeah [MASK] and we 'll see what we come up with so just have a little watch about how they 're how they 're accessing this and what they 're doing and i 'm just going to take this letter[MASK] <unk> so i have to get myself in the zone[MASK] this space of t and flashing through it with some[MASK] action <unk> i 'm not remembering what i 'm doing i 'm just working on my task my task is this t going to watch it from the side[MASK] <unk> what they 're doing is grasping aspects of that movement[MASK] and they 're generating it into a phrase <unk> you can see the speed is extremely quick yeah i 'm not asking them to copy[MASK] exactly they 're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase[MASK] <unk> i can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they 're moving yeah they 're super quick right [MASK] so i 've taken this aspect of ted and translated it into something that 's physical [MASK] some dancers when they 're watching action take the overall shape <unk> the arc of the movement the kinetic sense of the movement [MASK] and use that for memory some work very much in specific detail they start with small[MASK] <unk> little units and build it up [MASK] okay you 've got something one more thing[MASK] so they 're solving this problem for me [MASK] having a little[MASK] they 're constructing that phrase <unk> they have something and they 're going to hold on to it yeah one way of making that[MASK] 's going to be my beginning in this world premiere <unk> okay <unk> from there i 'm going to do a very different thing so[MASK] basically i 'm going to make a duet i want you to think about them as architectural objects <unk> so what they are are just pure lines <unk>[MASK] <unk> no longer people just pure lines <unk> and i 'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with yeah <unk> so what i 'm thinking about is taking[MASK] a few physical extensions from the body as i move <unk> and i move them and i do that by suggesting things to them if then if then [MASK] okay so here we go just grab this arm [MASK] can you place that down into the floor[MASK] <unk> so from there from there we 're both getting up we 're both getting up going in this direction going underneath[MASK] <unk> don 't care where kick <unk> kick replace change a leg <unk> kick replace change the leg <unk> yeah <unk> okay <unk> cat <unk> almost get his head <unk> almost get his head[MASK] let me slow down here fancy having eight laughter[MASK] fancy having eight hours with me in a day so maybe too much so here we go ready and[MASK] <unk> a little bit more <unk> [MASK] yeah <unk> just a little bit more here we go from that place separate face the front [MASK] separate face the front imagine that there 's a circle in front of you yeah avoid it <unk> avoid it <unk> whoom <unk> kick it out of the way <unk> [MASK] kick it out of the way <unk> [MASK] throw it into the audience whoom throw it into the audience again we 've got mental architecture we[MASK] <unk> from the beginning can we do our phrases first and then that and we 're going to build something now organize it the phrases here we go[MASK] <unk> with an outside mental architecture that i work with that they hold memory with for me [MASK] the second one which is using them as objects to think with their architectural objects i do a series of provocations i say if this happens then that if this if that happens i 've got lots of methods like that but it 's very very quick <unk> and this is a third method they 're starting it already and this is[MASK] <unk> do a little mental dance a little [MASK] in this little one minute <unk> so what i 'd love you to do is imagine you can do this with your eyes closed <unk> or open and if you don 't want to do it you can watch them it 's up to you [MASK] just for a second think about that word ted in front of you so it 's in mind and it 's there right in front of your mind what i 'd like you to do is transplant that outside into the real[MASK] <unk> of the[MASK] bottom[MASK] rib of the letter e and i 'm thinking about it and i 'm imagining this space that 's really high and above <unk> if i asked you to reach out you don 't have to literally do it but in mind[MASK] reach out to the top of the e where would you reach if you reach with your finger where would it be if you reach with your elbow where would it be if i[MASK] <unk> said about that space that you 're in let 's infuse it with the color red what does that do to the body <unk> [MASK] if i then said to you what happens if that whole wall on the side of e collapses and you have to use your weight to put it back up what would you be able to do with it <unk> [MASK] so this is a mental picture i 'm describing a mental vivid picture[MASK] that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make [MASK] okay you can open your eyes if you had them closed so the dancers have been working on them so just keep working on them for a little second so they 've been working on those[MASK] mental architectures in the here i know[MASK] i think we should keep them as a surprise so here goes world premiere dance yeah here we go ted dance okay <unk> here it comes i 'm going to organize it quickly [MASK] so you 're going to do the first[MASK] solo that we made <unk> yeah blah blah blah blah <unk> we go into the duet yeah blah blah blah blah <unk> the next solo blah blah[MASK] <unk> and both at the same time you do the last solutions <unk> okay okay <unk> ladies and gentlemen world premiere ted dance three versions of physical thinking[MASK] <unk> three versions of physical thinking i 'm hoping that today what you 're going to do is go away and make a dance for yourself <unk> and if not that at least misbehave more beautifully more often[MASK]
