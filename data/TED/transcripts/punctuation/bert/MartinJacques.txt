 <unk> changing with really remarkable speed <unk> if you look at the chart at the top here you 'll see that in <unk>[MASK] <unk> these goldman sachs projections suggest that the chinese economy will be almost the same size as the american economy and if you look at the[MASK] chart for two thousand and fifty <unk> it 's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size[MASK] of the american economy and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy and[MASK] we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the western financial crisis a couple of weeks ago <unk> i was looking[MASK] at the latest[MASK] <unk> projection by bnp paribas for when china will[MASK] have a larger economy than the united states goldman sachs projected two thousand and twenty seven the[MASK] projection is two thousand and twenty that 's just a decade[MASK] decade away china[MASK] is going to change the world[MASK] in two fundamental respects first of all it 's a huge developing country[MASK] with a population of one point[MASK] three billion people [MASK] which has been growing for over thirty years at around ten percent a year and within a decade it will have the largest[MASK] economy in the world never before in the modern era[MASK] <unk> has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country <unk> rather than a developed country <unk> [MASK] secondly <unk> for the first time in the modern era <unk> the dominant country in the world which i think is what china will become[MASK] will be not from the west and from very very different civilizational roots[MASK] now i know it 's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries[MASK] modernize they also[MASK] westernize this is an illusion it 's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition markets and technology it is not it is also shaped[MASK] equally by history and culture[MASK] <unk> is not like the west and it will not become like the west <unk> it will remain in very fundamental respects[MASK] very different [MASK] now the big question here is obviously how do we make sense of china <unk> how do we try to understand what china is <unk> and the problem we have in the west at the moment [MASK] by and large is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms[MASK] <unk> using western ideas we can 't <unk> now i want to offer you three building blocks[MASK] for trying to understand what china is like just as a beginning <unk> the first is this that china[MASK] is not really a nation state okay <unk> it 's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years <unk> but everyone who knows anything about china knows it 's a[MASK] <unk> lot older than this [MASK] this was what china looked like with the victory of the qin dynasty in two hundred and twenty one b c at the end of the warring state period the birth of modern china and you can see it against the boundaries of modern china <unk> [MASK] or immediately afterward the han dynasty still two thousand years ago and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and live now [MASK] <unk> now what is extraordinary about this is what gives china its sense of being china what gives[MASK] the chinese the sense of what it is to be chinese comes not from the last hundred years not from the nation state period <unk> which is what happened in the west <unk> [MASK] but from the period if you like of[MASK] <unk> notion of the state likewise a very distinctive notion of the family <unk> social relationships like guanxi[MASK] <unk> confucian values and so on these are all things that come from the period of the <unk>[MASK] in other words china <unk> unlike the western states and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization its existence as[MASK] <unk> and there 's one other thing to add to this [MASK] and that is this of course we know china 's big huge demographically and geographically with a population of one point three billion people [MASK] what we often aren 't really aware of[MASK] is the fact that china is[MASK] extremely diverse and very pluralistic and in many ways very decentralized[MASK] <unk> you can 't run a place on this scale simply from beijing even though we think[MASK] this to be the case <unk> it 's never been the case so this is china <unk>[MASK] <unk> rather than[MASK] a nation state and what does it mean well <unk> i think it has all sorts of profound implications i 'll give you two quick ones [MASK] the first is that the most important political[MASK] value for the chinese[MASK] is unity is the maintenance of[MASK] chinese civilization [MASK] you know two thousand years ago <unk> europe <unk> breakdown the fragmentation of the holy roman empire <unk> it divided <unk> and it 's remained divided ever since <unk> china <unk> over <unk>[MASK] <unk> the same time period <unk> went in exactly the opposite direction <unk> very painfully holding this huge[MASK] <unk> prosaic <unk> which is hong kong do you remember the handover of hong kong[MASK] by britain to china in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven you may remember what the chinese constitutional proposition was [MASK] one country two systems and i 'll lay a wager[MASK] that barely anyone in the west believed them window dressing when china gets its hands on hong kong that won 't be the case thirteen years on[MASK] <unk> the political and legal system in hong kong is as different now as it was in <unk>[MASK] we were wrong why were we wrong we were wrong[MASK] because we thought naturally enough in nation state ways think of german unification one thousand nine hundred and ninety what happened <unk> [MASK] well basically the east was swallowed by the west <unk> one nation one system that is the nation state mentality <unk> but you can 't run[MASK] a country like <unk>[MASK] on the basis of one civilization one system it doesn 't work so actually the response of[MASK] china to the question of hong kong as it will be to the question of taiwan was a natural response one civilization <unk> many systems [MASK] let me offer you[MASK] another building block to try and understand[MASK] <unk> china maybe not sort of a comfortable one the chinese have a very very different conception of race[MASK] to most other countries do you know of the[MASK] one point three billion chinese over ninety percent of them think they belong to the same race[MASK] <unk> most populous countries india the united states indonesia brazil all of them[MASK] are multiracial the chinese don 't feel like that china is only[MASK] multiracial really at the margins <unk> so the question is[MASK] <unk> history of at least two thousand years <unk> a history of conquest occupation <unk> absorption <unk> assimilation and so on led to the process by which over time this notion <unk>[MASK] <unk> of the han emerged of course nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity <unk> [MASK] the han china could never have held together <unk> the han identity has been the cement which has[MASK] held this country together <unk> the great disadvantage of it[MASK] is that the han have a very weak conception of cultural difference they really believe in[MASK] their[MASK] <unk> and they are disrespectful[MASK] of those who are not hence their attitude for example to the uyghurs and to the tibetans [MASK] or let me give you my third building block the chinese state <unk> now the relationship[MASK] between the state and society in china is very different from that[MASK] in the west <unk> now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think in these days at least that the authority and[MASK] <unk> legitimacy of the state[MASK] is a function of democracy the problem with this proposition is that the chinese state[MASK] enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the chinese[MASK] <unk> reason for this[MASK] is because[MASK] well there are two reasons i think and it 's obviously got nothing to do with democracy <unk> because in our terms the chinese certainly don 't have a democracy <unk> and the reason for this is firstly <unk> [MASK] because[MASK] the state in china is given a very special it enjoys a very special significance[MASK] <unk> the embodiment and the guardian of chinese civilization of the <unk>[MASK] this is as close as china gets to a kind of[MASK] spiritual[MASK] role <unk> and the second reason[MASK] is because <unk> whereas in europe and north america the state 's power is continuously[MASK] <unk> i mean in the european tradition <unk> historically against the church against other sectors of the aristocracy <unk> against merchants and so on[MASK] for one thousand years <unk> the power of the chinese state[MASK] has not been challenged it 's had no serious rivals so you can see[MASK] that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western history the result[MASK] <unk> way is that the chinese have[MASK] a very different view[MASK] of the state[MASK] <unk> whereas we tend to view it as an intruder <unk> a stranger <unk> certainly[MASK] an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained the chinese don 't see[MASK] <unk> the chinese view the state[MASK] as an intimate not just as an intimate actually as a member of the family not just in fact as a member of the family <unk> but as the head of the family <unk> the patriarch[MASK] of the family <unk> this is the chinese view of the state[MASK] very very different to ours <unk> it 's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case[MASK] in the west and i would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing[MASK] <unk> with here in the chinese context is a new kind of paradigm <unk> which is different from anything we 've had to[MASK] think about in the past [MASK] know that that china believes in the market and the state i mean adam smith already writing in[MASK] the late 18th century said the chinese market is larger and more developed[MASK] and more sophisticated than anything in[MASK] <unk> europe and apart from the mao period that has remained more or less the case ever since <unk> but this is combined with an extremely strong[MASK] and ubiquitous state the state is everywhere in china <unk> i mean <unk> it 's leading firms many of them are still[MASK] publicly owned private firms <unk> however large they are like lenovo <unk> depend in many ways on state patronage targets for the economy and so on are set by the[MASK] <unk> state and the state of course <unk> its authority flows into lots of other areas as we are familiar with with something like the one child policy <unk> moreover [MASK] this is a very old state tradition a very old tradition of statecraft i mean if you want an illustration of this <unk> [MASK] the great wall is one <unk> but this is another this is the grand canal which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b c and was finally completed[MASK] in the seventh century <unk> a d it went for one thousand one hundred and fourteen miles linking[MASK] beijing with hangzhou and shanghai [MASK] so there 's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china <unk> which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today <unk> which is something like the three gorges dam and many other[MASK] <unk> expressions of state competence within china <unk> [MASK] so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china[MASK] the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society [MASK] <unk> and yet we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china[MASK] by simply drawing on western experience looking at it through western eyes <unk> using western concepts [MASK] if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong our predictions about what 's going to happen to china are incorrect <unk> this is[MASK] <unk> i have to say that i think[MASK] attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality[MASK] it 's kind of arrogant it 's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best <unk> and therefore[MASK] we have the universal measure <unk> and secondly <unk> it 's ignorant we refuse to really address the issue[MASK] of difference you know there 's a very[MASK] <unk> interesting passage in a book by paul cohen the american historian <unk> and paul cohen argues[MASK] that the west thinks of itself[MASK] as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures <unk> but it 's not in many ways <unk> it 's the most[MASK] <unk> because for two hundred years the west has been so dominant in the world that it 's not really needed to understand[MASK] other cultures [MASK] other civilizations <unk> because at the end of the day <unk> it could if necessary by force get its own way <unk> [MASK] whereas those cultures virtually the rest of the world in[MASK] <unk> which have been in a far weaker position <unk> vis a vis the west have been thereby forced to understand the west because of the west 's presence in those societies <unk> and therefore [MASK] they are as a result more cosmopolitan[MASK] in many ways[MASK] than the west i mean take the question of east asia <unk> east asia <unk> japan korea <unk> china etc a third of the world 's population lives there <unk> now the largest economic region in the world[MASK] <unk> from east asia <unk> are far more knowledgeable[MASK] about the west[MASK] than the west is about[MASK] east[MASK] asia now this point is very germane i 'm afraid [MASK] to the present because what 's happening back to that chart at the beginning <unk> the goldman sachs chart what is happening[MASK] is that very rapidly in historical terms the world is being driven[MASK] and shaped not by the old developed countries <unk> but by the developing world we 've seen this in terms of[MASK] the g20 usurping very rapidly the position of the g7 or the g8 [MASK] and there are two consequences of this [MASK] <unk> the west is rapidly[MASK] losing its influence in the world there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago copenhagen climate change conference [MASK] europe was not at the final negotiating table <unk> when did that last happen i would wager it was probably about two hundred years ago <unk> [MASK] and that is what is going to happen in the future <unk> and the second implication[MASK] is that the world will inevitably as a consequence become increasingly unfamiliar to us[MASK] <unk> because it 'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with or[MASK] conversant with and at last i 'm afraid take europe america is slightly different[MASK] but europeans by and large i have to say are ignorant are unaware[MASK] about the way the world is changing <unk> some people[MASK] <unk> an english friend in china and he said the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion [MASK] well <unk> maybe that 's true maybe that 's an exaggeration <unk> [MASK] but there 's another problem which goes along with this this that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world and that is[MASK] a sort of[MASK] loss[MASK] <unk> but this alas is no longer true if you want to feel the future <unk> if you want to taste the future <unk> try china there 's old confucius <unk> this[MASK] is a railway station the likes of which you 've never seen before it doesn 't even look like a railway station this is the new[MASK] <unk> bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together <unk> [MASK] or take this now this is an idea <unk> [MASK] but it 's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing here you have a megabus[MASK] <unk> on the upper deck carries about two thousand people it travels on rails down a suburban road <unk> and the cars travel[MASK] underneath it and it does speeds of up to about one hundred miles an hour <unk> now[MASK] this is the way things are going to move because china has a very specific problem which is different from europe and different from the united states [MASK] china has huge numbers of people and no space <unk> so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have[MASK] <unk> so how would i like to finish well what should our attitude be towards this world that we see[MASK] very rapidly developing before us[MASK] <unk> i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it but i want to argue [MASK] <unk> for two hundred years the world was essentially[MASK] governed by a fragment[MASK] of the human population [MASK] that 's what europe and north america represented [MASK] the arrival of countries like china and india between them thirty eight percent of the world 's population and others like indonesia and brazil and so on[MASK] <unk> represent[MASK] the most important single act of democratization[MASK] in the last two hundred years civilizations and cultures which had been ignored which had no voice which were not listened to which were not known about will have[MASK] a different sort of representation in this world as humanists we must welcome surely[MASK] <unk> transformation <unk> and we will have to learn about these civilizations <unk>[MASK] this big ship here was the one sailed in by zheng he[MASK] in the early <unk> 15th century on his great voyages around the south china sea the east china sea and across the indian ocean to east africa <unk> [MASK] the little boat[MASK] in front of it was the one[MASK] in which eighty years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic or look carefully at this[MASK] silk scroll made by[MASK] zhuzhou[MASK] i think they 're playing golf christ the chinese even invented golf <unk> welcome to the future <unk> thank you[MASK]
