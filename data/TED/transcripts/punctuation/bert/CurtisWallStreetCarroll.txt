custody of my mother the first words my uncle said was how 'd you get caught [MASK] <unk> were small what am i supposed to do [MASK] and ten minutes later <unk> he took me to burglarize another arcade game we needed gas money to get home that was my life <unk> [MASK] i grew up in oakland california with my mother and members of my immediate family addicted to crack cocaine my environment consisted of[MASK] living with family <unk> friends and homeless shelters[MASK] <unk> shelters <unk> oftentimes <unk> dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens the big homey told me this money rules the world[MASK] and everything in it <unk> and in these streets money is king <unk> and if you follow the money it 'll lead you to the bad guy or the good guy <unk> [MASK] soon after <unk> i committed my

<unk> [MASK] i mean how was i supposed to do that i couldn 't read write or spell <unk> i was illiterate <unk> so i always thought crime was my way to go <unk> [MASK] and then one day[MASK] i was talking to somebody and he was telling me about this robbery that we could do <unk> and we did it the reality was[MASK] <unk> was that i was growing up in the strongest financial nation in the world <unk> the united states of america <unk> while i watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank[MASK] to sell her blood for forty dollars just to try to feed her kids <unk> she still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that <unk> [MASK] so i never[MASK] <unk> care about my life <unk> everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted the drug dealers the robbers the blood bank <unk> [MASK] everybody was taking blood money <unk> so i got mine by any means necessary i got mine [MASK] financial literacy really did rule the world [MASK] and i was a child slave to it[MASK] following the bad guy [MASK] at seventeen years old i was arrested for robbery and murder[MASK] <unk> and i soon learned that finances in prison rule more than they did on the streets <unk> so i wanted in [MASK] one day i rushed to grab the sports page of the newspaper so my cellie could read it to me [MASK] and i accidentally picked up the business section [MASK] and this old man said <unk> hey youngster you pick stocks and i said what 's that he said that 's the place where white folks keep all their money [MASK] and it was the first time[MASK] that i saw a glimpse of hope a future <unk> he gave me this brief description of what[MASK] <unk> stocks were but it was just a glimpse <unk> [MASK] i mean how was i supposed to do it i couldn 't read write or spell <unk> [MASK] the skills that i had developed to hide my illiteracy no longer worked in this environment <unk> [MASK] i was trapped in a cage prey among predators <unk> fighting for freedom i never had i was lost[MASK] <unk> and i was out of options <unk> so at twenty years old <unk> i did the hardest thing i 'd ever done in my life i picked up a book <unk> [MASK] and it was the most agonizing time of my life <unk> [MASK] trying to learn how to read <unk> the ostracizing from my family <unk> the homeys [MASK] it was rough man it was[MASK] <unk> but little did i know i was receiving the greatest gifts

section of the newspaper i wanted to find these rich white folks [MASK] so i looked for that glimpse <unk> [MASK] as i furthered my career in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest i soon learned that i had to take responsibility for my own actions <unk> true[MASK] <unk> i grew up in a very complex environment but i chose to commit crimes <unk> and i had to own up to that i had to take responsibility for that and i did [MASK] i was building a curriculum that could teach incarcerated men how to manage money through prison employments [MASK] properly managing our lifestyle would provide transferrable tools that we can use to manage money when we reenter society like the majority of people did who didn 't commit crimes then[MASK] i discovered[MASK] that according to marketwatch[MASK] <unk> sixty percent of the american population has under one thousand dollars in savings [MASK] sports illustrated said that over sixty percent of nba players and nfl players go broke <unk> forty percent of marital problems derive from financial issues <unk> [MASK] what the hell [MASK] you mean to tell me that people worked their whole lives buying[MASK] <unk> and material stuff but were living check to check [MASK] how in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals back into society if they couldn 't manage they own stuff[MASK] <unk> we screwed [MASK] i needed a better plan <unk> [MASK] this is not going to work out too well <unk> so [MASK] <unk> i now had an obligation to meet those on the path[MASK] and help <unk> and it was crazy because[MASK] i now cared about my community <unk> wow imagine that i cared about my community <unk> [MASK] financial illiteracy is a disease that has crippled minorities and the lower class in our society for generations and generations [MASK] and we should be furious about that [MASK] ask yourselves this how can fifty percent[MASK] of the american population be financially illiterate in a nation driven by financial prosperity <unk> [MASK] our access to justice our social status living conditions transportation and food are all dependent on money that most people can 't manage it 's crazy it[MASK] 's an epidemic and a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue <unk> [MASK] according to the[MASK] <unk> department of corrections <unk> over seventy percent of those incarcerated have committed or have been charged with money related crimes <unk> robberies <unk> burglaries fraud <unk> larceny <unk> extortion[MASK] and the list goes on check this out a typical incarcerated person would enter the california prison system[MASK] with no financial education <unk> earn thirty cents an hour[MASK] <unk> hour <unk> over eight hundred dollars a year with no real expenses and save no money [MASK] upon his parole he will be given two hundred dollars gate money and told hey good luck stay out of trouble don 't come back to prison [MASK] with no meaningful preparation or long term financial plan <unk> what does he do [MASK] at sixty [MASK] get a good job or go back[MASK] <unk> to the very criminal behavior that led him to prison in the first place [MASK] you taxpayers you choose <unk> well his education already chose for him probably <unk> so how do we cure this disease [MASK] i cofounded a program that we call financial empowerment emotional literacy we call[MASK] <unk> and it teaches how do you separate your emotional decisions from your financial decisions [MASK] and the four timeless rules to personal finance the proper way to save <unk> [MASK] control your cost of living [MASK] borrow money effectively[MASK] and diversify your finances by allowing your money to work for you instead of you working for it incarcerated people need these life skills before we reenter society [MASK] you can 't have full rehabilitation[MASK] without these life skills [MASK] this idea that only professionals can invest and manage money is absolutely ridiculous <unk> and whoever told you that is lying [MASK] a professional[MASK] is a person who knows his craft better than most and nobody knows how much money you need have or want better than you[MASK] which means you are the professional financial literacy is not a skill ladies and gentlemen it 's a lifestyle [MASK] financial stability is a byproduct of a proper lifestyle [MASK] a financially sound incarcerated person can become a taxpaying citizen [MASK] and a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one this allows us to create a bridge between those people[MASK] <unk> who we influence family <unk> friends and those young people who still believe that crime and money are related <unk> [MASK] so let 's lose the fear and anxiety of all the big financial words and all that other nonsense that you 've been out there hearing <unk> [MASK] and let 's get to the heart of what 's been crippling our society from taking care of your responsibility to be better life managers[MASK] and let 's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum that gets to the heart the heart of what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is[MASK]
