 <unk> less than a year from now the world is going to celebrate the international year of astronomy <unk> which marks the 400th anniversary of galileo 's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope[MASK] <unk> in a few months the world is also going to celebrate[MASK] the launch of a new invention[MASK] <unk> from microsoft research <unk> which i think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as galileo did four centuries ago [MASK] it 's called the worldwide telescope [MASK] and i want to thank ted and microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention [MASK] and i want to urge you <unk> when you get a chance to give it a closer look at the ted lab downstairs[MASK] <unk> the worldwide telescope[MASK] takes the best images from the[MASK] world 's greatest telescopes on earth and in space <unk> and has woven them seamlessly[MASK] to produce a holistic view of the universe[MASK] <unk> it 's going to change the way we do astronomy <unk> it 's going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it 's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe <unk> [MASK] if we were having this ted meeting in our grandparents ' day that might not be so big a claim [MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and twenty for example you weren 't allowed to drink if you were a woman you weren 't allowed to vote <unk> and if you[MASK] looked up at the stars and the milky way[MASK] <unk> way on a summer night <unk> what you saw[MASK] was thought to be the entire universe in fact the head of harvard 's[MASK] observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the milky way galaxy was the entire universe <unk> [MASK] harvard was wrong big time of course we know today[MASK] that galaxies extend far beyond our[MASK] <unk> we can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe <unk> [MASK] all the way back in time <unk> almost to the moment of the big bang itself <unk> we can see across the entire spectrum of light <unk> [MASK] revealing worlds that had previously been invisible[MASK] <unk> we see these magnificent star nurseries where[MASK] nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise we[MASK] <unk> see alien worlds we see alien solar systems three hundred now and still counting[MASK] and they 're not like us <unk> [MASK] we see black holes at the heart of our galaxy <unk> in the milky way <unk> and elsewhere in the universe where time itself seems to stand still [MASK] <unk> our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented and i think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks and that 's changing <unk> i want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and i [MASK] in astronomy and in education are so excited about the worldwide telescope and why we think it 's truly transformative [MASK] first it enables you to experience the universe <unk> the worldwide telescope for me[MASK] <unk> a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go second [MASK] you can tour the universe[MASK] with astronomers as your guides <unk> and i 'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you 're seeing but really[MASK] people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe <unk> who can share their enthusiasm[MASK] and can make the universe a welcoming place <unk> and third you can create your own tours you can share them with friends you can create them with friends[MASK] and that 's the part that i think i 'm most excited about because i think that at heart we are all storytellers and in telling stories <unk> [MASK] each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way [MASK] we 're going to have a personal universe <unk> i think we 're going to[MASK] <unk> see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge <unk> before i introduce the[MASK] person responsible for the worldwide telescope i just want to leave you with this brief thought [MASK] when i ask people how does the night sky make you feel they often say oh tiny i feel tiny and insignificant [MASK] well [MASK] <unk> and thanks to the creators of the worldwide telescope[MASK] <unk> we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe <unk> [MASK] i think the worldwide telescope will convince you that we may be tiny <unk> but we are truly wonderfully significant <unk> [MASK] thank you i[MASK] <unk> what you 're seeing here is[MASK] a wonderful presentation but it 's one of the tours and actually this tour is one that was created earlier and the tours are all totally interactive <unk> so that if i were to go somewhere you may be[MASK] <unk> you can pause anywhere along the way <unk> pull up other information[MASK] there are lots of web and information sources about places you might want to go[MASK] you can zoom in you can pull back out the whole resources are there available for you [MASK] so microsoft this is a project that worldwide telescope is dedicated[MASK] to jim gray who 's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible [MASK] it 's a labor of love for us and our small team[MASK] and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe so basically kids of all ages like us[MASK]
