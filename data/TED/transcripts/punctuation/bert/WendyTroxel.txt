 <unk> it 's six o 'clock in the morning <unk> pitch black outside[MASK] my 14 year old son is fast asleep in his bed <unk> sleeping the reckless <unk> deep sleep of a teenager <unk> [MASK] i flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake because i know that like ripping off[MASK] band aid it 's better to get it over with quickly [MASK] i have a friend who yells fire just to rouse her sleeping teen [MASK] and another who got so fed up that she had to dump cold water on her son 's head just to get him out of bed[MASK] <unk> sound brutal <unk> but perhaps familiar <unk> [MASK] every morning i ask myself[MASK] <unk> i[MASK] knowing what i know and doing what i do for a living[MASK] be doing this to my own son you see <unk> i 'm a sleep researcher [MASK] laughter so i know far too much about sleep <unk> and the consequences of sleep loss [MASK] i know that i 'm depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs[MASK] as a rapidly growing teenager <unk> i also[MASK] <unk> know that by waking him up hours before his natural biological clock tells him he 's ready <unk> i 'm literally robbing him of his dreams[MASK] the type of sleep most associated with learning <unk> memory consolidation and emotional processing <unk> [MASK] but it 's not just my kid that 's being deprived of[MASK] <unk> sleep deprivation among american teenagers is an epidemic <unk> [MASK] only about one in ten gets the eight to ten hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians <unk> [MASK] now if you 're thinking to yourself phew we 're doing good my kid 's getting eight hours [MASK] remember eight hours is the minimum recommendation <unk> you 're barely passing [MASK] eight hours is kind of like getting a c on your report card[MASK] there are many factors contributing to this epidemic <unk> but a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need[MASK] is actually a matter of public policy <unk> not hormones <unk> social lives[MASK] or snapchat across the country <unk> many schools are starting[MASK] <unk> despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high school start no earlier than eight 30am [MASK] these early start policies have a direct effect on how much[MASK] or really how little sleep american teenagers are getting they 're also pitting teenagers[MASK] and their parents in a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies[MASK] around the time of puberty teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock <unk> which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy [MASK] this is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin teenagers ' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around[MASK] <unk> which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children [MASK] this means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at <unk>[MASK] <unk> the unfortunate days when i have to wake up at 4am [MASK] i 'm a zombie <unk> functionally useless i can 't think straight <unk> i 'm irritable and i probably shouldn 't be driving a car[MASK] <unk> car [MASK] but this is how many american teenagers feel every single school day [MASK] in fact many of the shall we say <unk> [MASK] unpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager moodiness <unk> irritability laziness depression[MASK] could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation for many teens battling chronic sleep loss their[MASK] <unk> to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine in the form of venti frappuccinos or energy drinks and shots [MASK] so essentially we 've got an entire population[MASK] of tired but wired youth <unk> [MASK] advocates of sleep friendly start times know that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain[MASK] <unk> development <unk> particularly in the parts of the brain that are responsible for those higher order thinking processes <unk> including reasoning[MASK] and good judgment in other words the very type of brain activity that 's responsible for reining in those impulsive[MASK] and often risky behaviors that are so characteristic of adolescence[MASK] and that are so terrifying to us parents of[MASK] <unk> teenagers they know that like the rest of us when teenagers don 't get the sleep they need their brains their bodies and behaviors suffer[MASK] with both immediate and lasting effects <unk> they can 't concentrate their attention plummets[MASK] and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic[MASK] but the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom[MASK] sadly contributing to many of the mental health problems that skyrocket during adolescence [MASK] including substance use <unk> depression and suicide [MASK] in our work with teens from la unified school district [MASK] we found that teens with sleep problems were fifty five percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month [MASK] in another study with over thirty[MASK] <unk> thousand high school students <unk> they found that for each hour of lost sleep <unk> [MASK] there was a thirty eight percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless [MASK] and a fifty eight percent increase in teen suicide attempts <unk> [MASK] and if that 's not enough teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems that plague our country[MASK] obesity <unk> heart disease and diabetes <unk> [MASK] then there 's the risk of putting a sleep deprived teen with a newly minted driver 's license <unk> behind the wheel <unk> [MASK] studies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night[MASK] is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol[MASK] <unk> start times and researchers in this area have produced tremendous science showing the tremendous benefits of later start times [MASK] the findings are unequivocal and as a sleep scientist <unk> i rarely get to speak with that kind of[MASK] <unk> teens from districts with later start times get more sleep to the naysayers who may think that if schools start later teens will just stay up later [MASK] the truth is their bedtimes stay the same but their wake up times get extended <unk> resulting in more sleep [MASK] they 're more likely to show up for school school absences dropped by twenty five percent in one district <unk> and they 're less likely to drop out [MASK] not surprisingly[MASK] <unk> they do better academically <unk> so this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap <unk> [MASK] standardized test scores in math and reading go up by two to three percentage points [MASK] that 's as powerful as reducing class sizes by <unk> one third fewer students [MASK] or replacing a so so teacher in the classroom[MASK] with a truly outstanding one[MASK] <unk> their mental and physical health improves <unk> and even their families are happier <unk> [MASK] i mean who wouldn 't enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens and a little less crankiness [MASK] even their communities are safer because car crash rates go down[MASK] a seventy percent reduction in one district[MASK] <unk> given these tremendous benefits you might think well this is a no brainer right <unk> [MASK] so why have we as a society failed to heed this call [MASK] often the argument against later start times goes something like this [MASK] why should we delay start times for teenagers we need to toughen them up so they 're ready for the real world but that 's like saying[MASK] <unk> to the parent of a two year old don 't let johnny nap or he won 't be ready for kindergarten [MASK] delaying start times also presents many logistical challenges not just for students and their families but for communities as a whole <unk> [MASK] updating bus routes increased transportation costs <unk> impact on sports <unk> care before or after school these[MASK] are are the same concerns that come up in district after district[MASK] <unk> time and again around the country as school start times are debated <unk> [MASK] and they 're legitimate concerns [MASK] but these are problems we have to work through <unk> [MASK] they are not valid excuses for failing to do the right thing for our children <unk> [MASK] which is to start middle and high schools no earlier[MASK] <unk> and in districts around the country big and small who have made this change <unk> they found that these fears are often unfounded[MASK] and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits[MASK] for student health and performance and our collective public safety [MASK] so tomorrow morning when coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour and you get that[MASK] <unk> delicious extra hour of sleep [MASK] and the day seems a little longer <unk> and a little more full of hope [MASK] think about the tremendous power of sleep and think about what a gift it would be for our children[MASK] to be able to wake up naturally in harmony with their own biology[MASK]
