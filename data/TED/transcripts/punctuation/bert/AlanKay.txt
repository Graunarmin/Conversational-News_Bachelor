 <unk> way to start i think with my view of simplicity is to[MASK] take a look at ted here you are understanding why we 're here what 's going on[MASK] with no difficulty at all the best a i in the planet would find it[MASK] <unk> complex and confusing <unk> and my little dog watson[MASK] would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point [MASK] he would have a great time <unk> and of course if you 're a speaker[MASK] here like hans rosling a speaker finds this complex tricky <unk> but in hans rosling 's case[MASK] <unk> he had a secret weapon yesterday literally in his sword swallowing[MASK] act <unk> and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow[MASK] today and finally gave up on but he just did it and that was[MASK] a wonderful thing so puck meant[MASK] not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we 're easily fooled in fact what[MASK] <unk> shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled <unk> so we 're actually looking forward to it [MASK] we go to magic shows in order to be fooled <unk> and this makes[MASK] many things fun <unk> but it makes it difficult[MASK] to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves and our friend betty edwards the drawing on the[MASK] <unk> right side of the brain lady shows these two tables to her[MASK] drawing class and says the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can 't move your hand but[MASK] that the way your brain perceives images[MASK] is faulty it 's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what 's there and to prove it she says[MASK] <unk> size and shape of these tabletops[MASK] is the same <unk> and i 'm going to prove it to you she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here i 'll[MASK] just rotate this little guy around and [MASK] now having seen that and i 've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can[MASK] <unk> that they 're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either <unk> so what do artists do well what artists do is to measure [MASK] they measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm[MASK] and a straight edge you 'll see that those two shapes are exactly the[MASK] same[MASK] <unk> the talmud[MASK] saw this a long time ago <unk> saying we see things[MASK] not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight[MASK] back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion [MASK] so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are then[MASK] what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it 's a waking[MASK] <unk> dream <unk> and understanding that that is what[MASK] we actually exist in is[MASK] one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history <unk> [MASK] and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and[MASK] things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable[MASK] somehow we have to understand ourselves to get[MASK] <unk> around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel [MASK] the way i think of it is we can 't learn to see until we admit we 're blind once you start[MASK] down at this very humble level then you can start[MASK] finding ways to see things and what 's happened over the last four hundred years in particular is that human beings have invented[MASK] little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and[MASK] these are in the form of sensory apparatus telescopes microscopes reasoning apparatus various ways of thinking[MASK] and most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things i 'll talk about that a little bit[MASK] it 's this change in perspective on what it is we think we 're perceiving[MASK] that has helped us make more progress in the last four hundred years than we have in the rest of human[MASK] history <unk> and yet [MASK] it is not taught in[MASK] any k through twelve curriculum in america that i 'm aware of [MASK] <unk> the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more [MASK] we like more if we do more in a kind of a stupid way the simplicity gets complex[MASK] and in fact <unk> we can keep on doing it for a very long time <unk> [MASK] but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties <unk> another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor[MASK] <unk> taking the same old material and thinking about[MASK] <unk> ways of combining it and in fact <unk> what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty[MASK] of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar all goes down to the[MASK] <unk> the idea that the elementary particles[MASK] are both sticky and standoffish <unk> and[MASK] they 're in violent motion those three things give rise to all the different levels of[MASK] what seem to be complexity in our world[MASK] <unk> a few years ago i just thought it was the greatest thing i 'd seen[MASK] in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it 's too simple and i put some effort in[MASK] to try and check[MASK] to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the[MASK] <unk> side and i found that they matched up very well <unk> so the roslings have been able to do simplicity[MASK] without removing what 's important about the data <unk> whereas the[MASK] the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist[MASK] <unk> i didn 't like that at all not because it wasn 't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand[MASK] about molecular biology and that is why is there[MASK] any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed [MASK] and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous <unk> they just swooped in the air and bound[MASK] <unk> something happened <unk> [MASK] but in fact those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second [MASK] they 're agitating back and forth their size[MASK] every two nanoseconds they 're completely crowded together they 're jammed they 're bashing up against each other[MASK] <unk> and if you don 't understand that in your mental model of this stuff [MASK] what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that 's exactly the wrong image[MASK] for when you 're trying to teach science <unk> [MASK] so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication[MASK] with the actual understanding of some principle <unk> so a kid who 's fourteen in high school[MASK] gets this version of the pythagorean[MASK] theorem <unk> which is a truly subtle and interesting proof <unk> but in fact it 's not a good way to start learning about[MASK] mathematics so a more direct one one that gives you more of the feeling of math[MASK] <unk> is something closer to pythagoras <unk> ' own proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that[MASK] c square with three more triangles and we copy that notice that we can[MASK] move those triangles down like this and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious <unk> [MASK] and bingo <unk>[MASK] <unk> that is all you have to do <unk> and this kind of proof is the kind of proof[MASK] that you need to learn when you 're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the literally <unk>[MASK] <unk> hundred or one thousand five hundred proofs of pythagoras ' theorem that have been discovered [MASK] now let 's go to young children this is a very unusual teacher who[MASK] was a kindergarten and[MASK] <unk> teacher but was a natural mathematician <unk> so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific[MASK] musician she just had a feeling for math <unk> and[MASK] here are her six year olds and she 's got them[MASK] making shapes out of a shape so they pick a shape they like[MASK] <unk> like a diamond or a square or a triangle or a trapezoid and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape and the next larger shape you can see the trapezoids[MASK] are a little challenging there and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children[MASK] act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they had created these artifacts now she had[MASK] <unk> them look at them and do this laborious <unk> which i thought[MASK] for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down[MASK] so they 'll think so they 're cutting out the[MASK] little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up but the whole point of this thing is[MASK] for them to look at this chart[MASK] and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did[MASK] <unk> lauren there noticed that the first one took one and the second one took three more[MASK] and the total was four on that one the third one took five more[MASK] and the total was nine on that one and then the next one <unk> she saw right away that[MASK] the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by[MASK] <unk> so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six [MASK] where she wasn 't sure what six times six was[MASK] and what seven times seven was but then she was confident[MASK] again <unk> so that 's what lauren did and then the teacher <unk> gillian ishijima had the[MASK] kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit[MASK] <unk> shit <unk> they 're the same no matter what the shapes were the growth law[MASK] is the same <unk> and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize[MASK] these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete[MASK] differential equation[MASK] <unk> what we usually try to teach six year olds so let 's take a look now at[MASK] how we might use the computer for some of this and so the first[MASK] first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children[MASK] do i 'm using the software that we 're putting on the $ one hundred laptop[MASK] <unk> so i 'd like to draw a little car here i 'll just do this very quickly[MASK] and put a big[MASK] tire on him[MASK] and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object i 'll call it a car and here[MASK] <unk> little behavior car forward each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out[MASK] and set them going <unk> [MASK] and i can try steering the car here by see the car turn by five here <unk> so what if i click this down to zero it[MASK] goes straight that 's a big revelation for[MASK] nine year olds make it go in the other direction <unk> but of course that 's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as[MASK] driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel <unk> so they draw a steering wheel [MASK] and we 'll call this a wheel <unk>[MASK] <unk> this wheel 's heading here if i turn this wheel you can see that number over there going minus and positive [MASK] that 's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out[MASK] there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can[MASK] steer the car with the steering wheel and it[MASK] 's interesting you know how much trouble the children have with[MASK] <unk> but by learning it this way in a situated fashion they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it [MASK] and we can reflect here the way gillian ishijima did so[MASK] if you look at the little script here the speed is always going to be thirty we 're going to move the car according to that over and over again <unk> [MASK] and i 'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things they 're evenly[MASK] spaced because they 're thirty apart <unk> [MASK] and what if i do this progression that the <unk> six year olds did of saying ok <unk> i 'm going to increase the speed by two each time [MASK] and then i 'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time what do i get there [MASK] we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration <unk> so how do the children do science[MASK] <unk> not pay any attention to what anybody else[MASK] is[MASK] <unk> putting on[MASK] <unk> aristotle never asked a child[MASK] about this particular point because of course he didn 't bother doing the experiment and neither did <unk> st thomas aquinas and[MASK] it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only four hundred[MASK] <unk> years ago <unk> we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids[MASK] who will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely <unk> we can take a movie[MASK] of what 's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it 's tricky to see what 's going on <unk> [MASK] and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up <unk> [MASK] so when the children see[MASK] <unk> this they say ah acceleration [MASK] remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways <unk> and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration[MASK] it is [MASK] so what i 'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later [MASK] like that and they 're getting[MASK] <unk> faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys up [MASK] then we see the differences <unk> the increase in the speed[MASK] is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we 've done that already <unk>[MASK] how shall we look and verify that we actually[MASK] have it so you can 't tell much from just making the ball[MASK] drop there <unk> but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time <unk> [MASK] we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model [MASK] galileo by the[MASK] <unk> did this[MASK] very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute [MASK] i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that[MASK] this is actually[MASK] probably a newton and the apple type story but it 's a great story <unk> and i thought i would do just one thing[MASK] on the $ one hundred laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here[MASK] <unk> so once you have gravity here 's this[MASK] increase the speed by something increase the ship 's[MASK] speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it 'll crash the space ship [MASK] but if i oppose gravity here we go[MASK]
