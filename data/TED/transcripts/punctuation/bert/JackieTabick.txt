 <unk> one of my favorite cartoon characters is snoopy <unk> [MASK] i love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life <unk> [MASK] so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he 's lying there[MASK] and he says [MASK] i really understand <unk> and i really appreciate how one should love one 's neighbor as one love 's oneself <unk> [MASK] the only trouble is the people next door i can 't stand them this in a way is[MASK] <unk> of the challenges[MASK] of how to interpret a really good idea we all i think believe in compassion if[MASK] you look at all the world religions all the main world religions you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion <unk> so in judaism we have from our torah that you should love your[MASK] neighbor as you love yourself and within jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings[MASK] <unk> have hillel who taught that you shouldn 't do to others what you don 't like being done to yourself [MASK] and all the main religions have similar teachings <unk> [MASK] and again within judaism <unk> we have a teaching about god <unk> who is called the compassionate one ha rachaman [MASK] after all how could the world exist without god being compassionate [MASK] and we as[MASK] <unk> taught within the torah that we are made in the image of god <unk> so we too have to be compassionate <unk> [MASK] but what does it mean how does it impact on our everyday life sometimes of course being compassionate[MASK] can produce feelings within us that are[MASK] <unk> i know there are many times[MASK] when i 've gone and conducted a funeral <unk> or when i have been sitting with the bereaved <unk> or with people who are dying <unk> [MASK] and i am[MASK] overwhelmed by the[MASK] sadness by the[MASK] difficulty the challenge that is there for the family for the person <unk> and i 'm touched <unk> so that[MASK] <unk> tears come to my eyes [MASK] and yet <unk> if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings i wouldn 't be doing my job[MASK] because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to[MASK] <unk> and yet on the other hand if i didn 't feel this compassion then i feel[MASK] that it would be time for me to hang up my robe[MASK] and give up being a rabbi and these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world who <unk>[MASK] be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war[MASK] <unk> famine <unk> or earthquakes <unk> or tsunamis <unk> [MASK] i know some people who say well <unk> you know there 's just so much out there i can 't do anything i 'm not going to even begin to try [MASK] and there are some[MASK] charity workers who call this compassion[MASK] <unk> there are others who feel they can 't confront compassion[MASK] anymore <unk> and so they turn off the television and don 't watch [MASK] in judaism though we tend to always say <unk> there has to be a middle way [MASK] you have to of course be aware of the needs of[MASK] <unk> but you have to be aware in such a way[MASK] that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people so part of compassion has to be[MASK] an understanding[MASK] of what makes people tick and of course you can 't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more and there 's a lovely rabbinic[MASK] interpretation of the beginnings of creation <unk> which says that when[MASK] <unk> god created the world <unk> god thought that it would be best to create the world[MASK] only with the divine attribute of justice <unk> [MASK] because after all god is just therefore there should be justice throughout the world <unk> [MASK] and then god looked to the future and realized if the world was created just with justice[MASK] <unk> world couldn 't exist so god thought nope i 'm going to create the world[MASK] just with compassion and then god looked to the future[MASK] and realized[MASK] that in fact if the world were just filled with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos there had to be limits[MASK] to all things <unk> the rabbis[MASK] describe[MASK] <unk> this as[MASK] being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass bowl [MASK] if you put too much cold water in it will[MASK] shatter if you put boiling water in it will shatter <unk> what do you have to do put in a mixture of the two <unk> [MASK] and so god put both of these possibilities[MASK] into the world[MASK] there is something more though that has to be there and that is[MASK] the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion[MASK] into the wider world into action so like[MASK] <unk> just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors we actually have to do something about it <unk> [MASK] and so there is also within judaism this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important chesed [MASK] all these three things then have to be melded together <unk> the idea of justice[MASK] <unk> which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a[MASK] feeling of of what 's right about life what 's right about living <unk> what should we be doing <unk> social justice [MASK] there has to be a willingness to do good deeds <unk> [MASK] but not of course at the expense[MASK] of our own sanity <unk> you know there 's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things and balancing[MASK] <unk> them all in the middle[MASK] is this notion of compassion <unk> which has to be there if you like at our very roots [MASK] this idea of compassion[MASK] comes[MASK] to us because we 're made in the image of god <unk> who is ultimately the compassionate one [MASK] what does this compassion entail[MASK] it entails understanding the pain of the other but even more than that it means[MASK] understanding one 's connection[MASK] to the whole of creation[MASK] understanding that one is part of that creation <unk> that there is a unity that underlies all that we see [MASK] all that we hear[MASK] <unk> that we feel i call that unity god <unk> and that that unity is something[MASK] that connects all of creation and of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we 're becoming even more aware[MASK] of the connectivity of things <unk> that something i do here[MASK] <unk> that if i use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain[MASK] in central and eastern africa <unk> [MASK] so there is a connectivity <unk> and i have to understand that[MASK] as part of the creation <unk> as part of me being made in the image of god <unk> and i have to understand[MASK] <unk> understand[MASK] that[MASK] my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs this eighteen minutes business <unk> i find quite fascinating [MASK] because in judaism <unk>[MASK] the number eighteen in hebrew letters <unk> stands for life the word[MASK] in life <unk> this is what 's important in terms of compassion but something else as well [MASK] actually eighteen minutes is important because at passover when we have to eat unleavened bread the[MASK] rabbis say what is the difference between dough that is made into bread and dough that is made into unleavened bread[MASK] <unk> that 's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven <unk> [MASK] what does it mean dough becomes leaven it means it gets filled with hot air [MASK] what 's matzah what 's unleavened bread <unk> you don 't get it <unk> [MASK] symbolically <unk> what the rabbis say[MASK] is that at passover <unk> what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air[MASK] our pride[MASK] <unk> pride our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve round us [MASK] so we try and get rid of those[MASK] and so doing try to get rid of the habits the emotions the ideas that enslave[MASK] <unk> that make our eyes[MASK] closed <unk> give us tunnel vision so we don 't see the needs of others and free ourselves and free ourselves from that and[MASK] that too is a basis[MASK] for having compassion for understanding our place in the world <unk> [MASK] now there is [MASK] <unk> gorgeous story[MASK] of a rich man[MASK] who sat in synagogue one day [MASK] and as many people do he was dozing off during the sermon [MASK] and as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of leviticus[MASK] in the torah <unk> and they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in jerusalem the priests used to have bread[MASK] <unk> used to place into a special table in the temple in jerusalem <unk> [MASK] the man was asleep <unk> but he heard the words bread <unk> temple god <unk> and he woke up he said god[MASK] wants bread that 's it god wants bread i know what god wants and he rushed[MASK] <unk> after the sabbath he made[MASK] twelve loaves of bread <unk> [MASK] took them to the synagogue went into the synagogue <unk> [MASK] opened the ark and said god i don 't know why you want this bread but here you are and he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the torah [MASK] then he went home <unk> [MASK] the cleaner came into the synagogue[MASK] <unk> goes to the ark he opens the ark there 's bread <unk> god you 've answered my plea you 've answered my question [MASK] takes the bread and goes home <unk> [MASK] meanwhile the rich man thinks to himself[MASK] <unk> who rules the entire universe wants my bread he rushes to the synagogue i 'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it he goes in there and it 's not there [MASK] and he says god you really did want it you wanted my bread <unk> next week with raisins [MASK] this went on for years <unk> [MASK] <unk> the man would bring bread with raisins with all sorts of good things put it into the ark <unk> [MASK] every week the cleaner would come god you 've answered my plea again take the bread <unk> take it home <unk> went on until a new rabbi came rabbis always spoil things the[MASK] rabbi came in[MASK] and saw what was going on and he called the two of them to his office <unk> and he said you know this is what 's happening [MASK] <unk> you mean god didn 't want my bread and the poor man said and you mean[MASK] god didn 't answer my pleas and the rabbi said you 've misunderstood me you 've[MASK] misunderstood totally he said of course[MASK] <unk> what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering god 's plea that we should be compassionate [MASK] and god he said to the poor man is answering your plea[MASK] that people should be compassionate and give he looked at the rich man he held the rich man 's hands[MASK] and said don 't you understand he[MASK] <unk> so that[MASK] is the way[MASK] i feel that i can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate [MASK] of understanding[MASK] that there is a connectivity that there is a unity in this world that i want to try and serve[MASK] that unity <unk> [MASK] and that i can try and do that by understanding i hope <unk> trying to understand something of the pain of others <unk> [MASK] but understanding that there are limits that people have to bear responsibility[MASK] for some of the problems that come upon them and that i have to understand that there are limits to my energy to the giving i can give[MASK] i have to reevaluate them try and separate out[MASK] the the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me <unk> so that i can see the world clearly[MASK]
