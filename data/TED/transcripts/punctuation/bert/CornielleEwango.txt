this this is not local population this is rebels[MASK] they are now happy sending the news that they have protected the okapi with the war because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching

it that they are now going to dissect it <unk> until i do my[MASK] my report and then i see[MASK] the chief commander <unk> and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and they just got the[MASK] the tusks what we are doing after that that was the[MASK] situation of the war we have to rebuild <unk> i had some money <unk> i was paid one hundred and fifty dollars <unk> i devoted[MASK] half of it[MASK] <unk> to rebuild the herbarium because we didn 't have good[MASK] infrastructure to start plants <unk> wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants <unk> [MASK] i started this with

built this now it 's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing [MASK] my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity <unk> and what the

we have now data of about fifteen years <unk> [MASK] to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions <unk> [MASK] and that is i think it[MASK] 's difficult for me this is a very
