 <unk> in our hands today and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs[MASK] is too costly <unk> takes far[MASK] <unk> and it fails more often than it succeeds [MASK] it really just isn 't working <unk> [MASK] and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them and diseases are going[MASK] we seem to be spending more and more money <unk> so for every billion dollars we spend in r & d we 're getting less drugs approved into the market [MASK] more money <unk> [MASK] less drugs[MASK] so what 's going on here <unk> [MASK] well there 's a multitude of factors at play <unk> but i think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug <unk>[MASK] is going to work whether it has efficacy or whether it 's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical[MASK] <unk> not predicting what 's going to happen in humans <unk> and we have two main tools available at our disposal they are[MASK] cells in dishes and animal testing now let 's talk about the first one [MASK] cells in dishes so cells are happily functioning in our bodies <unk> [MASK] we take them and rip them out of their native environment <unk> throw them in one of these dishes and expect them to work guess what [MASK] they don 't[MASK] they don 't like that environment because it 's nothing like what they have in the body what about animal testing <unk> well animals[MASK] do and can provide extremely useful information they teach us about what happens in the complex organism [MASK] we learn more about the biology itself <unk>[MASK] <unk> more often than not animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they 're treated with a particular drug [MASK] so we need better tools [MASK] we need human cells <unk> but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body [MASK] our <unk> bodies are dynamic environments we 're in constant motion [MASK] our cells experience that they 're in dynamic environments in our body <unk> they 're under constant[MASK] <unk> mechanical forces <unk> so if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies we need to become cell architects we need to[MASK] design <unk> build and engineer a home away from home for the cells [MASK] and at the wyss institute we 've done just that we call it an[MASK] <unk> it but it 's pretty incredible right here in my hand[MASK] is a breathing living[MASK] human lung on a chip <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just beautiful <unk> it can do a tremendous amount of things we have living cells in that little chip [MASK] cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types[MASK] <unk> to grow cells in the lab <unk> they 've tried many different approaches <unk> [MASK] they 've even tried to grow little mini organs in the lab <unk> we 're not trying to do that here we 're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip[MASK] the smallest[MASK] functional[MASK] unit that represents the biochemistry the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies[MASK] <unk> how does it work <unk> [MASK] let me show you we use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment <unk> we have three <unk> fluidic channels [MASK] in the center <unk> we have a porous <unk> flexible membrane on which we can add human cells[MASK] <unk> they had capillary cells the cells in our blood vessels <unk> [MASK] and we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane <unk> so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did[MASK] when we breathe[MASK] and they experience them how they did in the body there[MASK] 's air flowing through the top channel <unk> and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel[MASK] <unk> now the chip is really beautiful <unk> but what can we do with it [MASK] we can get incredible functionality inside these little chips let me show you <unk> we could for example <unk> mimic infection <unk> where we add bacterial cells into the lung [MASK] then we can add human white blood cells white[MASK] blood cells are our body 's[MASK] defense against bacterial invaders and when they sense this inflammation due to infection <unk> they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria <unk> [MASK] well now you 're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip <unk> we 've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through <unk> and when they detect that infection they begin to stick <unk> they stick <unk> [MASK] and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel[MASK] <unk> and you can see here <unk> we can actually visualize[MASK] a single[MASK] white blood cell [MASK] it sticks it wiggles its way through between the cell layers through the pore <unk> comes out on the other side of the membrane <unk> [MASK] and right there it 's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green in[MASK] <unk> you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses[MASK] our body has to an infection it 's the way we respond[MASK] to an immune response it 's pretty exciting <unk> [MASK] now i want to share this picture with you not just because it 's so beautiful <unk> [MASK] but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips it tells us that these[MASK] cells from the small airways in our lungs actually have these[MASK] hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung these structures are called cilia and they actually move the mucus out of the lung <unk> yeah mucus <unk> yuck <unk> but mucus[MASK] <unk> is actually very important mucus traps particulates <unk> viruses potential allergens and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out [MASK] <unk> by cigarette smoke for example <unk> they don 't work properly and they can 't clear that mucus out <unk> and that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis [MASK] cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis <unk> [MASK] but now with the functionality that we get in these chips we can begin to look[MASK] for potential new treatments we didn 't stop with the lung on a chip <unk> we have a gut on a chip you can see one right[MASK] <unk> here <unk> and we 've put intestinal human cells[MASK] in a gut on a chip <unk> and they 're under constant peristaltic motion <unk> this trickling flow through the cells [MASK] and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine <unk> now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome[MASK] <unk> this is a disease that affects[MASK] a large number of individuals it 's really debilitating <unk> and there aren 't really many good treatments for it [MASK] now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs <unk> [MASK] now the true power of this[MASK] <unk> really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them there 's fluid flowing across these cells so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together[MASK] to form what we call a virtual human on a chip <unk> now we 're really getting excited[MASK] <unk> we 're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality[MASK] so that we can make better predictions of what 's going to happen in humans for example now we can begin[MASK] to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug those of you like me who have asthma when you take your inhaler <unk> we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs how it enters the body how it might affect[MASK] <unk> change the beating of your heart does it have a toxicity [MASK] does it get cleared by the liver is it metabolized in the liver is it excreted in your kidneys <unk> we can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug [MASK] this could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry [MASK] but a whole host of different industries <unk> including the cosmetics industry we can[MASK] potentially use the skin on a chip that we 're currently[MASK] <unk> developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you 're using are actually safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing <unk> [MASK] we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment such as chemicals in regular household cleaners <unk> [MASK] we could also use the organs on chips[MASK] for applications in bioterrorism[MASK] or radiation exposure <unk> we could use them to learn more about[MASK] <unk> such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as[MASK] sars <unk> organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future right now [MASK] the average participant in a clinical trial is that average[MASK] <unk> to be middle aged <unk> tends to be female [MASK] you won 't find many clinical trials in which children are involved <unk> yet every day we give children medications [MASK] and the only safety data we have on that drug[MASK] is one that we obtained from adults children are not adults they may not respond in the same way adults do [MASK] there are other things like genetic differences in[MASK] <unk> populations that may lead[MASK] to at risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction <unk> now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations put them on chips and create populations on a chip <unk> [MASK] this could really change the way we do clinical trials <unk> [MASK] and this is the team and the people that are doing this we have engineers we have cell biologists[MASK] <unk> we have clinicians all working together <unk> [MASK] we 're really seeing something quite incredible at the wyss institute it 's really a convergence of disciplines where biology is influencing the way we design [MASK] the way we engineer the way we build it 's pretty exciting <unk> [MASK] we 're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise[MASK] in large scale digital manufacturing <unk> [MASK] they 're going to help us make instead of one of these <unk> millions of these chips so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible <unk> and this is key to the potential of that technology <unk> [MASK] now let me show you our instrument this is an instrument[MASK] <unk> that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we 're going to require in order to link[MASK] ten or more organ chips together it[MASK] does something else that 's very important it creates an easy user interface <unk> so a cell biologist like me can come in [MASK] take a chip <unk> put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a c d and away you go <unk> plug and play[MASK] <unk> play <unk> easy <unk> now let 's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if i could take your stem cells and put them on a chip[MASK] or your stem cells and put them on a chip <unk> it would be a personalized chip just for you <unk> now all of us in here[MASK] are individuals <unk> and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently[MASK] and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs i myself a couple of years back had a really bad headache just couldn 't shake it[MASK] <unk> fatal <unk> so how do we prevent them well <unk> we could imagine one day[MASK] having geraldine on a chip having danielle on a chip <unk> having you on a chip <unk> personalized medicine <unk> thank you[MASK]
