 <unk> as a kid <unk> i was fascinated with all things air and space i would watch nova on pbs our school would show bill nye the science guy[MASK] when i was in elementary school my next door neighbor he gave me a book for my birthday it was an astronomy book[MASK] <unk> i poured over that thing for hours on end <unk> and it was a combination of all these things[MASK] that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream <unk> [MASK] and part of that dream was i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft <unk> well[MASK] <unk> a number of years later <unk> i graduated from ucla and i found myself at nasa working for the jet propulsion laboratory <unk> [MASK] and there our team was challenged[MASK] to create a 3d visualization of the solar system [MASK] and today i want to show you what we 've done so far now the kicker is <unk> everything i 'm about to do here[MASK] you can do at home because we built this for the public for you guys to use so[MASK] <unk> you 're looking at right now is the earth <unk> you can see the united states and california and san diego <unk> [MASK] and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around now this isn 't new <unk> anyone who 's used google earth has seen this before <unk> [MASK] but one thing we like to say in our group is <unk> we do the opposite of google earth google earth goes from this view down to your backyard [MASK] we go from this view out to the stars[MASK] so the earth is cool but what we really want to show are the spacecraft <unk> [MASK] so i 'm going to bring the interface back up [MASK] and now you 're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the earth these are a number of our science space earth orbiters <unk> we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites [MASK] <unk> if we did it would be a complete mess because there 's a lot of stuff out there [MASK] and the cool thing is <unk> we actually created 3d models for a number of these spacecraft <unk> [MASK] so if you want to visit any of these all you need to do is double click on them <unk> so i 'm going to find the international space station[MASK] double click and it will take us all the way down to the iss <unk> [MASK] and now you 're riding along with the iss where it is right now <unk> [MASK] and the other cool thing is[MASK] not only can we move the camera around we can also control time <unk> so i can slide this jog dial here[MASK] to shuttle time forward <unk> and now we can see what a sunset on the iss would look like [MASK] and they get one every ninety minutes [MASK] all right so what about the rest of[MASK] <unk> i can click on this home button over here <unk> and that will take us up to the inner solar system and now we 're looking at the rest of the solar system <unk> you can see there 's saturn there 's jupiter[MASK] <unk> and while we 're here i want to point out something <unk> [MASK] it 's actually pretty busy here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars just launched last weekend [MASK] here we have juno on its cruise to jupiter <unk> there <unk> we have dawn orbiting vesta <unk> and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to[MASK] <unk> pluto <unk> and i mention this because[MASK] there 's this strange public perception that nasa 's dead [MASK] that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there 's no more spacecraft out there <unk> [MASK] well a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration <unk> and we have a lot of spacecraft out there <unk> granted we 're not sending humans[MASK] <unk> with our own launch vehicles but nasa is far from dead <unk> [MASK] and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there 's so many other things that we 're doing <unk> [MASK] anyway while we 're here again if you want to visit anything all you need to do is double click so i 'm just going to <unk> double click on vesta <unk> [MASK] and here we have dawn orbiting vesta <unk> and this is happening right now <unk> [MASK] <unk> and we can see[MASK] uranus rotating on its side along with its moons <unk> you can see how it 's tilted at about eighty nine degrees <unk> and[MASK] just being able to visit different places and go through different times we have data from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to two thousand and fifty granted we don 't have everything in between because some of the data is hard to get [MASK] just being able to visit places in different times[MASK] you can explore this for hours literally hours on end <unk> [MASK] but i want to show you one thing in particular <unk> so i 'm going to open up the destination tab spacecraft outer planet missions voyager one [MASK] and i 'm going to bring up the titan flyby <unk> [MASK] so now we 've gone back in time[MASK] <unk> we 're now riding along with voyager one the date here is november eleven one thousand nine hundred and eighty [MASK] now there 's a funny thing going on here <unk> [MASK] it doesn 't look like anything 's going on it looks like i 've paused the program <unk> it 's actually running at real rate right now <unk> one second per second and in fact voyager one here[MASK] flying by titan at[MASK] i think it 's thirty eight thousand miles per hour <unk> it only looks like nothing 's moving because well saturn here is seven hundred thousand miles[MASK] <unk> away <unk> and titan here is four thousand to five thousand miles away it 's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing 's happening <unk> [MASK] but to make it more interesting i 'm going to speed up time <unk> and we can watch as voyager one flies by titan [MASK] which is a hazy moon of saturn it actually has a very thick atmosphere <unk> [MASK] and i 'm going to recenter the camera on saturn here <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to pull out[MASK] <unk> i want to show you[MASK] voyager one as it flies by saturn <unk> [MASK] there 's a point to be made here with a 3d visualization like this [MASK] we can not only just say voyager one flew by saturn <unk> there 's a whole story to tell here and even better because it 's an interactive application <unk> you can tell the story for yourself <unk>[MASK] if you want to pause it <unk> you can pause it if you want to keep going if you want to change the camera angle you can do that[MASK] and because of that i can show you that voyager one doesn 't just fly by saturn <unk> it actually flies[MASK] underneath saturn <unk> [MASK] now what happens is as it flies underneath saturn <unk> saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system <unk> [MASK] so if i just keep letting this go <unk> [MASK] you can see voyager one[MASK] fly up[MASK] <unk> like that and in fact i 'm going to go back to the solar system <unk> i 'm going to go back to today now <unk> and i want to show you where voyager one is [MASK] right there <unk> [MASK] above way above the solar system <unk> way beyond our solar system [MASK] and here 's the thing now you know how it got there <unk> now you know why and to me that 's the point of this program <unk> you can[MASK] <unk> manipulate it yourself <unk> you can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself [MASK] you know the theme today is the world in your grasp well <unk> we 're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp [MASK] and we hope once it 's there you 'll be able to learn for yourself what we 've done out there and what we 're about to do [MASK] and my personal dream is for kids[MASK] to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired[MASK] <unk> as i was as a kid to pursue stem education and to pursue a dream in space exploration[MASK]
