 <unk> about forty percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime[MASK] <unk> and half will not survive[MASK] this means that two out of five of your closest friends and relatives will be diagnosed with some form of cancer <unk> [MASK] and one will die <unk> [MASK] beyond the physical hardships roughly one third of cancer survivors here in the us will go into debt from treatment and they 're at least two and a half times more likely to declare bankruptcy than those[MASK] <unk> this disease is pervasive it 's emotionally draining and for many financially destructive <unk> [MASK] but a cancer diagnosis doesn 't have to be a death sentence <unk> finding cancer early <unk> [MASK] closer its genesis is one of the critical factors to improving treatment options <unk> reducing its emotional impact and minimizing financial burdens <unk>[MASK] <unk> finding cancer early which is one of the primary aims of my research[MASK] greatly enhances your odds of survival [MASK] if we just look at the case of breast cancer for example we find that those who are diagnosed and treated at stage one have a five year survival rate of nearly one hundred percent[MASK] odds that decrease to just twenty two percent if treated at stage four <unk> and similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer[MASK] <unk> now we 're all aware that an early diagnosis that is accurate is critical for survival [MASK] the problem is that many cancer diagnostic tools are invasive <unk> costly <unk> [MASK] often inaccurate and they can take an agonizing amount of time[MASK] to get the results[MASK] <unk> still worse when it comes to some forms of cancer such as[MASK] ovarian <unk> liver or pancreatic cancer <unk> good screening methods simply don 't exist [MASK] meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface which are themselves already indicators of late stage progression [MASK] like a tornado strike in an area without an early warning system <unk> there is[MASK] <unk> no alarm to warn for the danger is already at your doorstep when your odds of survival are greatly reduced [MASK] having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options that are[MASK] affordable noninvasive and could provide results much sooner would provide us with a formidable[MASK] weapon in the fight against cancer an early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease instead of merely following in its relentless wake[MASK] and this is exactly what i 've been doing for the past three years <unk> [MASK] i 've been developing technologies that could ultimately aid clinicians with rapid early stage cancer diagnostics <unk> [MASK] and i 've been fueled[MASK] by a deep scientific curiosity and a passion to change these statistics <unk> [MASK] last year however this fight became much more personal[MASK] when my wife was[MASK] <unk> diagnosed with breast cancer <unk> it was an experience that added a strong and unexpected emotional dimension to these efforts[MASK] i know firsthand how <unk> life altering treatment can be [MASK] and i 'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc that cancer can wreak on a family which in our case included our two young daughters [MASK] because we found it early[MASK] during a routine mammogram we were able to focus primarily on[MASK] treatment options for the localized tumor reaffirming to me how important an early diagnosis is [MASK] unlike other forms of cancer <unk> [MASK] mammograms do offer an early stage screening option for breast cancer <unk> [MASK] still not everyone has this done or they may develop breast cancer before the middle age recommendation for having[MASK] <unk> a mammogram [MASK] so there 's still a lot of room for improvement even for cancers that do have screening options and of course <unk> considerable benefits for those that don 't [MASK] a key challenge then for cancer researchers[MASK] is to develop methods that make regular screening for many types of cancers much more accessible[MASK] <unk> imagine a scenario where during your regular checkup your doctor can take a simple noninvasive urine sample or other liquid biopsy [MASK] and present you with the results before you even leave the doctor 's office [MASK] such a technology could dramatically reduce the number of people who slip through the net of an early stage cancer diagnosis[MASK] my research team of engineers and biochemists is working on exactly this challenge we 're working on ways to frequently activate[MASK] an early stage cancer alarm[MASK] by enabling regular screenings that would start when a person is healthy[MASK] so that action could be taken to stop cancer the moment it emerges <unk> and before it can progress beyond its infancy [MASK] the silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles <unk> little escape pods[MASK] pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes exosomes[MASK] are important biomarkers that provide an early warning system for the development of cancer <unk> [MASK] and because they 're abundantly present in just about every bodily fluid including blood urine and saliva <unk> they 're extremely attractive for noninvasive liquid biopsies[MASK] there 's just one problem an automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers is not currently available[MASK] we 've created a technology that we call[MASK] <unk> is capable of precisely this automated exosome isolation[MASK] to aid rapid cancer diagnostics [MASK] exosomes are the newest early warning weapon if you will to emerge on the liquid biopsy front <unk> and they 're really really small [MASK] they measure just thirty to one hundred and fifty nanometers in diameter[MASK] <unk> this is so tiny that you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell [MASK] that 's roughly the difference between a golf ball and a fine grain piece of sand <unk> [MASK] once thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste it has been found that cells actually communicate[MASK] by[MASK] producing and absorbing these exosomes which contain surface receptors <unk> proteins and other genetic[MASK] <unk> material collected from their cell of origin[MASK] when absorbed by a neighboring cell exosomes release their contents into the receiving cell <unk> [MASK] and can set in motion fundamental changes in gene expression some good <unk> and this is where cancer comes in some bad [MASK] because they are clothed in the material of the mother cell <unk> and contain a sample of its environment they provide a genetic[MASK] <unk> snapshot of that cell 's health[MASK] and its origin <unk> all of these qualities make exosomes invaluable messengers that potentially allow physicians to[MASK] eavesdrop on your health at the cellular level to catch cancer early however <unk> you have to frequently intercept these messages[MASK] to determine when[MASK] <unk> troublemakers within your body decide to start staging a coup which is why regular screening is so critical[MASK] and why we 're developing technologies to make this possible[MASK] while the first exosome based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year they are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options [MASK] in addition to their recent emergence another factor that 's limiting their widespread adoption[MASK] is that currently no automated[MASK] <unk> exists to make regular screening economically accessible [MASK] the current gold standard for exosome isolation includes <unk> ultracentrifugation a process requiring expensive laboratory equipment [MASK] a trained lab tech and about thirty hours of time to process a sample [MASK] we 've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation[MASK] from a sample such as urine[MASK] we use a chip based [MASK] continuous flow separation technique called deterministic lateral displacement [MASK] and we have done with it what the semiconductor industry has done so successfully for the past fifty years <unk> we shrunk the dimensions of this technology from the micron scale[MASK] to the true nanoscale so how does it work in a nutshell a set of tiny pillars separated by[MASK] <unk> nanoscopic gaps[MASK] are arranged in such a way that the system divides the fluid into streamlines with the larger cancer related nanoparticles being separated through a process of redirection[MASK] from the smaller healthier ones which can in contrast[MASK] move around the pillars in a zigzag type motion in the direction of fluid flow the net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations[MASK] <unk> you can visualize this separation process similar to traffic on a highway[MASK] that separates into two roads with one road going into a low clearance tunnel under a mountain and the other road going around it [MASK] here smaller cars can go through the tunnel[MASK] while larger trucks <unk> carrying potentially hazardous material are forced to take the detour route <unk> traffic is effectively separated by size[MASK] and contents without impeding its flow <unk> and this is exactly how our system works on a much much smaller scale [MASK] the idea here is that the separation process for screening[MASK] could be as simple as processing a sample of urine blood or saliva <unk> which is a near term possibility within the next few[MASK] <unk> it could be used to[MASK] isolate and detect[MASK] target exosomes associated with a particular type of cancer <unk> sensing and reporting their presence within minutes [MASK] this would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless <unk> [MASK] broadly speaking the ability to separate and enrich biomarkers with nanoscale precision in an automated way [MASK] opens the door to better understanding diseases such as cancer with applications ranging from[MASK] <unk> preparation to diagnostics and from drug resistance monitoring to therapeutics <unk> [MASK] even before my wife 's bout with cancer <unk> it was a dream of mine to facilitate the automation of this process[MASK] to make regular screening more accessible [MASK] similar to the way henry ford made the automobile accessible to the general population through development of the assembly line [MASK] automation is the key to accessibility[MASK] and in the spirit of the hoover dream a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage [MASK] we 're developing a technology that could ultimately place an early warning cancer detection system in every home [MASK] this would allow every man woman and child the opportunity to[MASK] be regularly tested while they 're still healthy catching cancer when it first emerges <unk> it is my hope and dream to help people around the[MASK] <unk> world[MASK] avoid the high costs physical financial and emotional faced by today 's cancer patients [MASK] hardships that i 'm well acquainted with [MASK] i 'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife 's cancer early <unk> her treatment was successful and she is now thankfully[MASK] <unk> is an outcome that i would like to see for everyone with a cancer diagnosis [MASK] with the work that my team has already done on separation of nanoscale biomarkers for rapid early stage cancer diagnostics <unk> [MASK] i am optimistic that within the next decade this type of technology will[MASK] <unk> helping protect our friends our family and future generations <unk> [MASK] even if we are so unlucky as to be diagnosed with cancer that early stage alarm will provide a strong beacon of hope <unk> [MASK]
