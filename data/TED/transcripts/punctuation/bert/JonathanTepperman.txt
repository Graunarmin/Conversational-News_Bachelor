 <unk> the conventional wisdom about our world today is that this is a time of terrible decline <unk> [MASK] and that 's not surprising given the bad news all around us from isis to inequality[MASK] <unk> and on and on [MASK] but here 's the thing and this may sound a little weird <unk> [MASK] i actually don 't buy this gloomy narrative [MASK] and i don 't think you should either <unk> look it 's not that i don 't see the problems <unk> i read the same headlines that you do [MASK] what i dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them <unk> [MASK] <unk> all screwed because the problems are unsolvable and our governments are useless <unk> [MASK] now <unk> why do i say this it 's not like i 'm particularly optimistic by nature [MASK] but something about the media 's constant doom mongering with its fixation on problems and not on answers[MASK] has always really bugged me <unk> so a few years ago i decided <unk> well <unk> i 'm[MASK] <unk> i should see if i can do any better by[MASK] going around the world and actually asking folks if and how they 've tackled their big economic and political challenges <unk> [MASK] and what i found astonished me [MASK] it turns out that there are remarkable signs of progress out there <unk> often in the most unexpected places <unk> [MASK] and they 've convinced me that our great global challenges may not be so unsolvable after all not only are there theoretical fixes[MASK] those fixes have been tried they 've worked <unk> and they offer hope for the rest of us <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to show you what i mean by telling you about how three of the countries i visited canada indonesia and mexico overcame three supposedly impossible problems [MASK] their stories matter because they contain tools the rest of us can use and not just for those particular problems[MASK] <unk> for many others too [MASK] when most people think about my homeland <unk> canada today if they think about canada at all they think[MASK] cold they think boring they think polite they think we say sorry too much in our funny accents <unk> and that 's all true[MASK] <unk> because of its triumph over a problem currently tearing many other countries apart immigration [MASK] consider canada today is among the world 's most welcoming nations even compared to other immigration friendly countries [MASK] its per capita immigration rate is four times higher than france 's and its percentage of foreign born residents is double that of sweden[MASK] <unk> ten times more syrian refugees in the last year than did the united states [MASK] and now canada is taking even more and yet if you ask canadians what makes them proudest of their country they rank[MASK] <unk> in other words at a time when other countries are now frantically building new barriers to keep foreigners out canadians want even more of them in <unk> [MASK] now here 's the really interesting part canada wasn 't always like[MASK] <unk> canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy [MASK] they called it white canada and as you can see <unk> they were not just talking about the snow [MASK] so how did that canada become today 's canada <unk> [MASK] well <unk> despite what my mom in ontario will tell you the answer had nothing to do with virtue canadians[MASK] <unk> inherently better than anyone else the real explanation involves the man who became canada 's leader in <unk>[MASK] pierre trudeau who is also the father of the current prime minister [MASK] the thing to know about that first trudeau is that he was very different from canada 's previous leaders <unk> he was a french <unk>[MASK] <unk> speaker in a country long dominated by its english elite <unk> he was an intellectual he was even kind of[MASK] <unk> the guy did yoga <unk> he hung out with the beatles and like all hipsters he could be infuriating at times <unk> [MASK] but he nevertheless pulled off one of the most progressive transformations any country has ever seen [MASK] his formula i 've learned involved two parts first canada threw out its old race based immigration rules and it replaced them with new[MASK] <unk> ones that emphasized education [MASK] experience and language skills instead and what that did was greatly increase the odds that newcomers would contribute to the economy <unk> [MASK] then part two trudeau created the world 's first policy of official multiculturalism to promote integration[MASK] and the idea that diversity was the key to canada 's identity[MASK] <unk> years that followed ottawa kept pushing this message <unk> [MASK] but at the same time ordinary canadians soon started to see the economic the material benefits of multiculturalism all around them [MASK] and these two influences soon combined to create the passionately open minded canada of today [MASK] let 's now turn to another country and an even tougher problem islamic extremism[MASK] <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight the people of indonesia took to the streets and overthrew their longtime dictator <unk> suharto [MASK] it was an amazing moment <unk> [MASK] but it was also a scary one with two hundred and fifty million people indonesia is the largest muslim majority country on earth it[MASK] 's also hot huge and unruly[MASK] <unk> made up of seventeen thousand islands where people speak close to a thousand languages <unk> [MASK] now <unk> suharto had been a dictator and a nasty one <unk> [MASK] but he 'd also been a pretty effective tyrant <unk> [MASK] and he 'd always been careful to keep religion out of politics so experts feared that without him keeping a lid on things the country would explode [MASK] or religious extremists would take over and turn indonesia into a tropical version of iran[MASK] <unk> and that 's just what seemed to happen[MASK] <unk> at first [MASK] in the country 's first free elections in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine islamist parties scored thirty six percent of the vote <unk> [MASK] and the islands burned as riots and terror attacks killed thousands <unk> [MASK] since then however <unk> indonesia has taken a surprising turn <unk> while ordinary folks[MASK] folks have grown more pious on a personal level i saw a lot more headscarves on a recent visit than i would have a decade ago[MASK] the country 's politics have moved in the opposite direction indonesia is now a pretty decent democracy <unk> [MASK] and yet its islamist parties have steadily lost support from a high of about thirty eight percent in two thousand and four down to twenty five percent in two thousand and fourteen[MASK] <unk> and while a few indonesians have recently joined isis their number is tiny <unk> far fewer in per capita terms[MASK] than the number of belgians <unk> [MASK] try to think of one other muslim majority country that can say all those same things in two thousand and fourteen i went to indonesia to ask its current president[MASK] <unk> many other muslim states are dying [MASK] well what we realized he told me is that to deal with extremism we needed to deal with inequality first [MASK] see indonesia 's religious parties like similar parties elsewhere had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption [MASK] so that 's what joko and his predecessors[MASK] <unk> thereby stealing the islamists ' thunder [MASK] they also cracked down hard on terrorism <unk> [MASK] but indonesia 's democrats have learned a key lesson from the dark years of dictatorship <unk> [MASK] namely that repression only creates more extremism <unk> [MASK] so they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy [MASK] they used the police instead of the army <unk> they only detained suspects if they had enough evidence <unk> [MASK] they held public trials <unk> they even sent liberal imams into the jails to persuade[MASK] <unk> the jihadists that terror is un islamic [MASK] and all of this paid off in spectacular fashion creating the kind of country that was unimaginable twenty years ago <unk> [MASK] so at this point [MASK] my optimism should i hope be starting to make a bit more sense <unk> neither immigration nor islamic extremism are impossible to deal with [MASK] join me now on one last trip this time to mexico[MASK] <unk> now of our three stories this one probably surprised me the most since as you all know the country is still struggling with so many problems [MASK] and yet a few years ago mexico did something that many other countries from france to india to the united states can still only dream of [MASK] it shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years [MASK] to understand how we need to rewind to the year two thousand[MASK] when mexico finally became a democracy <unk> rather than use their new freedoms[MASK] to fight for reform mexico 's politicians used them to fight one another [MASK] congress deadlocked and the country 's problems drugs <unk> poverty <unk> crime corruption spun out of control [MASK] things got so bad that in two thousand and eight <unk> the pentagon warned that mexico risked collapse[MASK] <unk> two thousand and twelve this guy named enrique pea nieto somehow got himself elected president <unk> [MASK] now <unk> this pea hardly inspired much confidence at first <unk> [MASK] sure he was handsome <unk> [MASK] but he came from mexico 's corrupt old ruling party the pri and he was[MASK] a notorious[MASK] <unk> in fact he seemed like such a pretty boy lightweight that women called him bombn sweetie at campaign rallies <unk> [MASK] and yet this same bombn soon surprised everyone[MASK] by hammering out a truce between the country 's three warring political parties [MASK] and over the next eighteen months <unk> they together passed an incredibly comprehensive set of reforms <unk> [MASK] they busted open mexico 's smothering monopolies <unk> they liberalized its rusting energy sector[MASK] <unk> they restructured its failing schools and much more [MASK] to appreciate the scale of this accomplishment <unk> try to imagine the us congress passing immigration reform campaign finance reform and banking reform <unk> now <unk> try to imagine congress doing it all at the same time [MASK] that 's what mexico did [MASK] not long ago[MASK] i met with pea and asked how he managed it all the president flashed me his famous twinkly smile [MASK] and told me that the short answer was <unk>[MASK] compromise of course i pushed him for details and the long answer that came out was essentially compromise compromise and more compromise [MASK] see pea knew that he needed to build trust early so he started talking to the opposition just days after his election to ward off pressure[MASK] <unk> from special interests he kept their meetings small and secret <unk> and many of the participants later told me that it was this intimacy <unk> [MASK] plus a lot of shared tequila that helped build confidence [MASK] so did the fact that all decisions had to be unanimous <unk> and that pea[MASK] even agreed to pass some of the other party 's priorities before his own as santiago creel an opposition senator put it to me[MASK] <unk> look <unk> i 'm not saying that i 'm special or that anyone is special <unk> but that group that was special [MASK] the proof when pea was sworn in the pact held and mexico moved forward for the first time in years <unk> [MASK] bueno <unk> so now we 've seen how these three countries overcame three of their great challenges <unk> and that 's very nice for them[MASK] right but[MASK] what good does it do the rest of us <unk> [MASK] well in the course of studying these and a bunch of other success stories like the way rwanda pulled itself back together after civil war[MASK] or brazil has reduced inequality or south korea has kept its economy growing faster and for longer than any other country on earth[MASK] <unk> i 've noticed a few common threads <unk> now <unk> before describing them i need to add a caveat <unk> i realize of course that all countries are unique so you can 't simply take what <unk>[MASK] <unk> worked in one <unk> port it to another and expect it to work there too <unk> nor do specific solutions work forever you 've got to adapt them as circumstances change <unk> [MASK] <unk> countries[MASK] and in boardrooms and in all sorts of other contexts too [MASK] number one <unk> embrace the extreme in all the stories we 've just looked at salvation came at a moment of existential peril <unk> [MASK] and that was no coincidence take canada when trudeau took office he faced two[MASK] <unk> looming dangers [MASK] first though his vast underpopulated country badly needed more bodies its preferred source for white workers europe had just stopped exporting them as it finally recovered from world war ii [MASK] the other problem was that canada 's long cold war between its french and its english communities had just become a hot one <unk> [MASK] quebec was threatening to secede and canadians were actually killing other canadians over politics <unk> now <unk> countries face crises all the time[MASK] <unk> 's nothing special [MASK] but trudeau 's genius was to realize that canada 's crisis had swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform [MASK] canada had to open up it had no choice <unk> [MASK] and it had to rethink its identity <unk> again <unk> it had no choice <unk> and that gave trudeau a[MASK] <unk> to break the old rules and write new ones <unk> and like all our other heroes <unk> he was smart enough to seize it [MASK] number two there 's power in promiscuous thinking [MASK] another striking similarity among good <unk> problem solvers is that they 're all pragmatists <unk> [MASK] they 'll steal the best answers from wherever they find them and they don 't let details like party or ideology[MASK] <unk> sentimentality get in their way [MASK] as i mentioned earlier indonesia 's democrats were clever enough to steal many of the islamists ' best campaign promises for themselves <unk> [MASK] they even invited some of the radicals into their governing coalition <unk> now <unk> that horrified a lot of secular indonesians <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] by forcing the radicals to actually help govern <unk> it quickly exposed the fact that they weren 't any good at the job <unk> and it got them mixed up in all of[MASK] <unk> the grubby compromises and petty humiliations that are part of everyday politics <unk> and that hurt their image so badly that they 've never recovered [MASK] number three please all of the people some of the time <unk> [MASK] i know i just mentioned how crises can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms <unk> and that 's true[MASK] <unk> often requires more than just boldness it takes showing restraint too just when that 's the last thing you want to do [MASK] take trudeau when he took office <unk> he could easily have put his core constituency that is canada 's french community first <unk> he could have pleased[MASK] some of the people all of the time [MASK] and pea could have used his power to keep attacking the opposition as was traditional in mexico [MASK] yet he chose to embrace his enemies instead <unk> while forcing his own party[MASK] <unk> to compromise and trudeau pushed everyone to stop thinking in tribal terms and to see multiculturalism not language and not skin color as what made them quintessentially canadian [MASK] nobody got everything they wanted <unk> but everyone got just enough[MASK] that the bargains held <unk> so at this point you may be thinking[MASK] <unk> are out there like you keep insisting then[MASK] why aren 't more countries already using them [MASK] it 's not like they require special powers to pull off i mean <unk> none of the leaders we 've just looked at were superheroes [MASK] they didn 't accomplish anything on their own <unk> and they all had plenty of flaws [MASK] take indonesia 's first democratic president abdurrahman wahid [MASK] this man was so powerfully uncharismatic[MASK] that he once fell asleep[MASK] in the middle of his own speech true story <unk> [MASK] so what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability <unk> [MASK] and it 's not circumstances <unk> it 's something much simpler <unk> [MASK] making big changes involves taking big risks [MASK] and taking big risks is scary[MASK] <unk> that fear requires guts <unk> and as you all know gutsy politicians are painfully rare <unk> [MASK] but that doesn 't mean we voters can 't demand courage from our political leaders i mean that 's why we put them in office in the first place <unk> [MASK] and given the state of the world today there 's really no other option <unk> [MASK] the answers are out there but now it 's up to[MASK] <unk> us to elect more women and men brave enough to find them to steal them and to make them work thank you[MASK]
