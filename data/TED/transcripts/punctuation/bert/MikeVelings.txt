 <unk> so i come from the tallest people on the planet the dutch <unk> [MASK] it hasn 't always been this way in fact all across the globe <unk> people have been gaining height <unk> in the last one hundred and fifty years <unk> in developed countries[MASK] <unk> on average we have gotten ten centimeters taller [MASK] and scientists have a lot of theories about why this is <unk> but almost all of them involve nutrition namely the increase of dairy and meat [MASK] in the last fifty years <unk> global meat consumption has more than quadrupled <unk> from seventy one million tons to three hundred and ten million tons[MASK] something similar has been going on with milk and eggs in every society where incomes have risen so has protein consumption <unk> [MASK] and we know that globally we are getting[MASK] <unk> richer[MASK] and as the middle class is on the rise so is our global population from seven billion of us today to nine point seven billion by two thousand and fifty [MASK] which means that by two thousand and fifty we are going to need at least seventy percent more protein than what is available to humankind today [MASK] and the latest prediction of the un puts that population number by the end of this century at eleven billion which means that we are going to need a lot more protein[MASK] this challenge is staggering so much so that recently a team at anglia ruskin global sustainability institute suggested that if we don 't change our global policies and food <unk>[MASK] <unk> production systems <unk> our societies might actually collapse in the next thirty years <unk>[MASK] <unk> at the same time our global fisheries are two and a half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support <unk> meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace <unk> [MASK] wwf recently published a report showing that just in the last forty years <unk> our global marine life has been slashed in half [MASK] and another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species such as[MASK] <unk> swordfish and bluefin tuna over ninety percent has disappeared since <unk>[MASK] and there are a lot of great sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better managed fisheries <unk> but ultimately all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant <unk> [MASK] it 's unlikely <unk> even with the[MASK] <unk> that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today <unk> [MASK] we have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have we need to alleviate the pressure on it and we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce <unk> we might face total collapse [MASK] our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population [MASK] so how do we fix this what 's the world going to look[MASK] <unk> short years when there 's two point seven billion more of us sharing the same resources <unk> [MASK] we could all become vegan <unk> [MASK] sounds like a great idea <unk> but it 's not realistic and it 's impossibly hard to mandate globally [MASK] people are eating animal protein whether we like it or not [MASK] and suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path <unk> [MASK] failing to meet demands the world health organization recently reported that eight hundred million people[MASK] are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage[MASK] <unk> is due to that same growing global population and the declining access to resources like water energy[MASK] and land [MASK] it takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest riots and further malnutrition people are hungry <unk> [MASK] and we are running dangerously low on natural resources <unk>[MASK] <unk> we need to change our global food production systems <unk> we must do better and there is a solution and that solution lies in aquaculture[MASK] the farming of fish plants like seaweed shellfish and crustaceans <unk> [MASK] as the great ocean hero jacques cousteau once said we must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters that 's what civilization is all about farming instead of hunting [MASK] fish is the last food that we hunt <unk> and why is it that we keep hearing phrases like[MASK] life 's too short for farmed fish or wild caught of course over fish that we know virtually nothing about we don 't know what it ate during its lifetime <unk> and we don 't know what pollution it encounters <unk>[MASK] and if it was a large predatory species it might have gone through the coast of fukushima yesterday <unk> [MASK] <unk> never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal <unk> but let 's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice <unk> [MASK] it 's healthy <unk> it prevents heart disease it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like <unk>[MASK] omega 3s which is very different from almost any other type of meat <unk> and aside from being healthy <unk> it 's also a lot more exciting and diverse <unk> think about it most animal farming is pretty monotonous <unk> cow is cow sheep is sheep pig 's pig [MASK] and poultry[MASK] <unk> pretty much sums it up and then there 's five hundred species of fish being farmed currently [MASK] not that western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves but that 's beside that point [MASK] and you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that 's good for us good for the planet and good for the fish [MASK] i know i sound fish obsessed [MASK] <unk> let me explain <unk> my brilliant partner and wife <unk> amy novograntz and i got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago <unk> [MASK] we were inspired by sylvia earle who won the ted prize in two thousand and nine we actually met on mission blue i in the galapagos[MASK] <unk> amy was there as the ted prize director me an entrepreneur from the netherlands and concerned citizen love to dive <unk> passion for the oceans <unk> [MASK] mission blue truly changed our lives <unk> we fell in love got married[MASK] and we came[MASK] <unk> away really inspired thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation something that was meant to last that could make a real difference[MASK] and something that we could do together [MASK] little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming <unk> [MASK] but a few months after we got off the boat <unk> we got to a meeting at conservation international where the director general of worldfish was talking about aquaculture[MASK] asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture[MASK] has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need <unk> [MASK] we were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn 't know more about this industry already and excited about[MASK] the chance to help get it[MASK] <unk> to talk about stats[MASK] right now the amount of fish consumed globally <unk> wild catch and farmed combined is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year <unk> [MASK] every single fishing vessel combined small and large across the globe together produce about sixty five million tons of wild caught seafood for human consumption [MASK] aquaculture this year for the first time in history actually produces more than what we catch from the wild <unk> but now this[MASK] <unk> is going to go up [MASK] in the next thirty five years <unk> we are going to need an additional eighty five million tons to meet demand <unk> [MASK] which is one and a half times as much almost as what we catch globally out of our oceans <unk> [MASK] an enormous number <unk> it 's safe to assume that that 's not going to come from the ocean <unk> it needs to come from farming [MASK] and talk about farming for farming you need resources[MASK] as a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive so does an animal [MASK] a cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost eight thousand liters of water to create just one pound of meat <unk> [MASK] experts agree that it 's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet we just don 't have enough feed or water [MASK] and we can 't keep cutting down rain forests for it [MASK] and fresh water[MASK] planet earth has a very limited supply <unk> we need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet [MASK] and now let 's compare that with fish farming [MASK] you can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed and depending on species <unk> even less <unk> and why is that well that[MASK] <unk> and it needs very little water which is counterintuitive <unk> but as we say <unk> it swims in it but it hardly drinks it fish are the most <unk>[MASK] animal protein available to humankind <unk> aside from[MASK] <unk> how much we 've learned since [MASK] for example on top of that sixty five million tons that 's annually caught for human consumption there 's an additional thirty million tons caught for animal feed [MASK] mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that 's turned into fish meal and fish oil <unk> this is madness[MASK] sixty five percent of these fisheries globally are badly managed some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it it 's destroying our oceans the worst slavery[MASK] <unk> issues imaginable are connected to it recently an article came out of stanford[MASK] saying that if fifty percent of the world 's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal our oceans would be saved now think about that for a minute now we know[MASK] that the oceans have far more problems they have pollution there 's acidification coral reef destruction and so on but it underlines the impact of our fisheries <unk> and it underlines how interconnected[MASK] <unk> everything is fisheries <unk> aquaculture deforestation climate change food security and so on [MASK] in the search for alternatives the industry on a massive scale has reverted to plant based alternatives like soy <unk> industrial chicken waste <unk> blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on [MASK] and we understand where these choices come from but this is not the right approach[MASK] <unk> it 's not sustainable <unk> it 's not healthy have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean of course not [MASK] if you feed salmon soy with nothing else it literally explodes <unk> salmon is a carnivore it has no way to digest soy <unk> [MASK] now fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to[MASK] <unk> but it 's had a really bad reputation there[MASK] 's been excessive use of chemicals there 's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations <unk> ecosystem destruction and pollution escaped fish breeding with wild populations altering the overall genetic pool <unk> and then of course <unk> [MASK] as just mentioned <unk> the unsustainable feed ingredients <unk> [MASK] how blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate whatever it was[MASK] <unk> once you know you know you can 't go back it 's not fun we really need a transparent food system that we can trust that produces healthy food [MASK] but the good news is that decades of development[MASK] and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better we can now farm fish without any of these issues [MASK] i think of agriculture before the green revolution[MASK] we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution[MASK] <unk> technologies means that we can now produce a feed that 's perfectly natural with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes <unk> insects <unk> seaweeds and <unk> micro algae [MASK] healthy for the people healthy for the fish healthy for the planet [MASK] microbes for example can be a perfect alternative for high grade fish meal at scale[MASK] <unk> first of all the perfect recycling because they 're grown on food waste but second <unk> think of fly fishing and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed [MASK] you don 't need large tracts of land for it <unk> and you don 't need to cut down rain forests for it [MASK] and microbes and insects are actually net water producers this revolution is starting as we speak it just needs scale <unk>[MASK] <unk> we can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled <unk> natural conditions creating happy fish [MASK] i imagine for example a closed system[MASK] that 's performing more efficiently than insect farming where you can produce healthy happy <unk> delicious fish with little or no effluent almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint <unk>[MASK] <unk> system where you grow up to ten species next to each other off of each other mimicking nature [MASK] you need very little feed very little footprint i think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish for example there[MASK] 's great technologies popping up all over the globe <unk> [MASK] from alternatives to battle disease so we don 't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore to automated feeders[MASK] that feel when the fish are hungry <unk> so we can save on feed[MASK] <unk> and create less pollution software systems that gather data across farms so we can improve farm practices there[MASK] 's really cool stuff happening all over the globe <unk> [MASK] and make no mistake all of these things are possible at a cost that 's competitive to what a farmer spends today <unk> [MASK] tomorrow there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing <unk> [MASK] so somebody needs to connect the dots and give these[MASK] <unk> developments a big kick in the butt and that 's what we 've been working on the last couple of years <unk> and that 's what we need to be working on together[MASK] rethinking everything from the ground up <unk> with a holistic view across the value chain connecting all these things across the globe alongside great entrepreneurs[MASK] that are willing to share a collective vision now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable[MASK] <unk> direction this industry is still young much of its growth is still ahead <unk> it 's a big task <unk> but not as far fetched as you might think it 's possible [MASK] so we need to take pressure off the ocean <unk> [MASK] we want to eat good and healthy and if we eat an animal <unk> it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life we need to have a meal that we can trust live long lives <unk>[MASK] <unk> and this is not just for people in san francisco or northern europe this is for all of us <unk> [MASK] even in the poorest countries <unk> it 's not just about money <unk> people prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about we 're all the same [MASK] the day will come where people will realize no demand farmed fish on their plate that 's farmed well and that 's farmed healthy[MASK] and refuse anything less <unk> you can help[MASK] <unk> speed this up <unk> ask questions when you order seafood where does my fish come from <unk> who raised it and what did it eat [MASK] information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available [MASK] and consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing <unk> so every time you order <unk> ask for detail[MASK] <unk> that you really care about what you eat and what 's been given to you and eventually they will listen and all of us will benefit <unk> thank you[MASK]
