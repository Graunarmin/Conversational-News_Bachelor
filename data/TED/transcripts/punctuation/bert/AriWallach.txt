 <unk> which is a term i made up [MASK] about three seconds ago i 've been futuring for about twenty years <unk> and when i first started i would sit down with people[MASK] <unk> been seeing that time horizon get shorter and shorter and shorter so much so that i met with a ceo two months ago and i said[MASK] we started our initial conversation he goes i love what you do i want to talk about the next six months [MASK] laughter we have a lot of problems[MASK] <unk> the issue though is we can 't solve them[MASK] using the mental models that we use right now to try and solve these problems yes a lot of great technical work is being done [MASK] but there is a problem that we need to solve for a priori before if we want to really move the needle on those big problems [MASK] <unk> there 's no marches there 's no bracelets there 's no petitions that you can sign to be against short termism i tried to put one up and no one[MASK] signed it was weird but it prevents us from doing so much[MASK] for many reasons has pervaded every nook and cranny of our reality i just want you to take a second and just think about[MASK] <unk> be personal it could be at work or it could be move the needle world stuff and think about[MASK] how far out you tend to think about the the solution set for that because[MASK] prevents the ceo from buying really expensive safety equipment it 'll hurt the bottom line <unk> so we get the deepwater[MASK] <unk> time with their students so right now in america a high school student drops out every twenty six seconds[MASK] short termism prevents congress sorry if there 's anyone in here from congress or[MASK] not really that sorry [MASK] from putting money into a real infrastructure bill so what we get is the[MASK] i 35w bridge collapse over the mississippi a few years ago thirteen killed [MASK] it wasn 't always like this we did the panama canal we[MASK] pretty much have eradicated global polio <unk> we did the transcontinental railroad the marshall plan <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just big physical infrastructure problems and issues <unk> women 's suffrage the right to vote <unk> but in our[MASK] <unk> seems to happen right now and we can only think out past the next tweet or timeline post we get <unk>[MASK] so what do we do [MASK] we take people who are fleeing their <unk> war torn country <unk> and we go after them <unk> we take low level drug offenders and we put them away for life <unk> and then we build[MASK] <unk> without even thinking about how people are going to get between them and their job it 's a quick buck now the reality is for a lot of these problems there are some[MASK] technical fixes a lot of them <unk> i call these technical fixes sandbag strategies[MASK] <unk> so you know there 's a storm coming the levee is broken no one 's put any money into it you surround your home with sandbags <unk> and guess what it works [MASK] storm goes away the water level goes down you get rid of the sandbags <unk> and you do this[MASK] <unk> storm after storm after storm and here 's the insidious thing a sandbag strategy[MASK] can get you reelected a sandbag strategy can help you make your quarterly numbers [MASK] now if we want to move forward into a different future than the one we have right now because i don 't think we 've hit[MASK] <unk> peak civilization there 's some more we can do but[MASK] my argument is that unless we shift our mental models and our mental maps on how we think about the short <unk> it 's not going to happen [MASK] so what i 've developed is something called longpath and it 's a practice and[MASK] <unk> i 'm sure everyone here at some point has done an off site with a lot of post it notes and whiteboards <unk> and you do you do no offense to the consultants in here who do that[MASK] and you do a long term plan <unk> and then two weeks later everyone forgets about it right [MASK] or a week later if you 're lucky three months <unk> it 's a practice because it 's not necessarily a thing that you[MASK] <unk> it 's a process where you have to revisit different ways of thinking for every major decision that you 're working on so i want to go through those three ways of thinking <unk> [MASK] so the first[MASK] <unk> transgenerational thinking <unk> i love the philosophers <unk> plato socrates habermas heidegger i was raised on them <unk> [MASK] but they all did one thing that didn 't actually seem like a big deal until i really started kind of looking into this and they all took [MASK] as a unit of measure[MASK] <unk> for their entire reality of what it meant to be virtuous and good the single lifespan <unk> [MASK] from birth to death <unk> [MASK] but here 's a problem with these issues [MASK] they stack up on top of us because the only way we know how to do something good in the world is if we do it between our birth and our death that 's what we 're programmed to do if you go to the self help section in any bookstore <unk> [MASK] it 's all about you <unk> [MASK] which is great[MASK] <unk> unless you 're dealing with some of these major issues <unk> and so with[MASK] <unk> thinking <unk> which is really kind of transgenerational ethics you 're able to expand how you think about these problems what is[MASK] your role in helping to solve them now this isn[MASK] <unk> this isn 't something that just has to be done at the security council chamber <unk> it 's something that you can do in a very kind of personal way <unk> so every[MASK] once in a while if i 'm lucky my wife and i like to go out to dinner <unk> and we have three children[MASK] under the age of seven <unk> so you can imagine it 's a very peaceful quiet meal so we sit down and literally all i want to do is just eat[MASK] and chill <unk> and my kids have a completely and totally different idea of what we 're going to be doing and so my[MASK] is my is my sandbag strategy right it 's to go into my pocket and take out the iphone and give them frozen or[MASK] some other bestselling game thing <unk> and[MASK] then i stop and i have to kind of put on this[MASK] and you have to kind of[MASK] think ok <unk> i can do this but what is this teaching them <unk> [MASK] so what does it mean if i actually bring some paper or engage with them in conversation it 's hard it 's not easy and i 'm making this very personal it 's actually more traumatic than some of the big issues that i work on in the world entertaining my kids[MASK] <unk> but what it does is it connects them here in the present with me but it also and this is the the crux of transgenerational thinking ethics[MASK] it sets them up to how they 're going to interact with their kids and their kids and their kids [MASK] second futures thinking when we think about the future ten fifteen years out [MASK] <unk> have to give it to me but think in your head and[MASK] what you 're probably going to see is the dominant cultural lens that dominates our thinking about the future right now technology <unk> [MASK] so when we think about the problems we always put it through a technological lens a[MASK] and there 's nothing wrong with that but it 's something that we have to really think deeply about[MASK] <unk> 're going to move on these major issues <unk> because it wasn 't always like this right the ancients had their way of thinking[MASK] about what the future was the church definitely had their idea of what the[MASK] future could be and you could actually pay your way into that future right <unk> and luckily for humanity <unk> we got the scientific revolution [MASK] from there we got the technology <unk> but what has happened and by the way this is not a critique[MASK] <unk> i love technology everything in my house talks back to me from my children to my speakers to everything [MASK] but we 've abdicated the future from from the high priests in rome[MASK] to the high priests[MASK] of silicon valley <unk> so when we think well how are we going to deal with climate or with poverty or homelessness our first reaction[MASK] <unk> is to think about it through a technology <unk> technology lens <unk> [MASK] and look i 'm not advocating that we go to this guy i love joel don 't get me wrong <unk> [MASK] but i 'm not saying we go we go to joel what i 'm saying is we have to rethink our base[MASK] assumption about only looking at the future in one way only[MASK] <unk> it through the dominant lens because our problems are so big and so vast that we need to open ourselves up so that 's why[MASK] i do everything in my power not to talk about the future i talk about futures <unk> it opens the conversation again so when you 're sitting[MASK] and thinking about how do we move forward on this major issue it could be at home it could be at work [MASK] <unk> on the global stage[MASK] don 't cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix because we 're more concerned about technological evolution right now than we are about moral evolution [MASK] and unless we fix for that we 're not going to be able to get out of short termism and get to where we want to be [MASK] the final telos thinking this comes from the greek root <unk> ultimate aim and ultimate purpose <unk> and it 's really asking one question to what end[MASK] <unk> when was the last time you asked yourself to what end <unk>[MASK] and when you asked yourself that how far out did you go because long isn 't long enough anymore [MASK] three five years doesn 't cut it it 's thirty forty fifty one hundred years [MASK] in homer 's epic the odyssey odysseus had[MASK] the answer to his what end it was ithaca <unk> it was this bold vision of[MASK] <unk> he wanted to return to to penelope <unk> and i can tell you because of the work that i 'm doing but also you know it intuitively we have lost our ithaca <unk> [MASK] we have lost our to what end so we stay on this hamster wheel and yes we 're trying to solve these problems <unk> but what comes after[MASK] we solve the problem <unk> and unless you define what comes after people aren 't going to[MASK] <unk> they 're telos they think about the futures and this is an ad for patek philippe they 're one hundred and <unk> seventy five years old and what 's amazing[MASK] is that they literally embody this kind of longpathian sense in their brand because by the way you never actually own a patek[MASK] <unk> unless somebody wants to just throw twenty five thousand dollars on the stage you merely look after it for the next generation <unk> [MASK] so it 's important that we remember the future <unk> [MASK] we treat it like a noun <unk> it 's not it[MASK] 's a verb it requires action <unk> it requires us to push into it it 's not this thing that washes over us it 's something that we actually have total control[MASK] <unk> we end up feeling like we don 't we feel like we 're trapped we can push through that [MASK] now i 'm getting more comfortable in the fact that at some point[MASK] in the inevitable future i will die <unk> but because of these new ways of thinking and doing <unk> both in the[MASK] <unk> and also with my family at home <unk> and what i 'm leaving my kids i get more comfortable in that fact and it 's something that a lot of us are really uncomfortable with [MASK] but i 'm telling you [MASK] think it through [MASK] apply this type of thinking and you can push yourself past what 's inevitably very very uncomfortable and it all begins really with yourself asking this question[MASK] what is your longpath [MASK] <unk> but i ask you when you ask yourself that now or tonight or behind a steering wheel or[MASK] in the boardroom or the situation room [MASK] push past the longpath quick oh what 's my longpath the next three years or five years [MASK] try and push past your own life if you can because it makes you do things a little bit bigger than you thought were possible [MASK] yes we have huge huge problems out there[MASK] <unk> with this process with this thinking <unk> [MASK] i think we can make a difference <unk> i think you can make a difference <unk> and i believe in you guys <unk> thank you[MASK]
