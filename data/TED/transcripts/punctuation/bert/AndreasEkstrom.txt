 <unk> so whenever i visit a school and talk to students i always ask them the same thing [MASK] why do you google why is google the search engine of choice for you <unk> [MASK] <unk> always get the same three answers one because it works which is a great answer that 's why i <unk>[MASK] somebody will say i really don 't know of any alternatives [MASK] it 's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually try to google the word ' search engine ' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives [MASK] and last but not least thirdly <unk> inevitably one student will raise her or his[MASK] <unk> with google i 'm certain to always get the best unbiased search result certain[MASK] to always get the best <unk> unbiased search result <unk> [MASK] now as a man of the humanities albeit a digital humanities man that just makes my skin curl even if i too realize that that trust that <unk>[MASK] idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of google[MASK] i will show you[MASK] why that philosophically is almost an impossibility <unk> but let me first elaborate just a little bit on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget [MASK] so whenever you set out to google something start by asking yourself this am i looking for an isolated fact what is the capital[MASK] <unk> what are the building blocks of a water molecule great google away [MASK] there 's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it 's actually london and h30 you don 't see a big conspiracy among those things we agree on a global scale <unk> what the answers are to these isolated facts [MASK] but if you complicate your question just a little bit[MASK] and ask something like why is there an[MASK] <unk> not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore you 're looking for knowledge <unk> [MASK] which is something way more complicated and delicate <unk> [MASK] and to get to knowledge <unk> you have to bring ten or twenty or one hundred facts to the table and acknowledge them and say yes these are all true but because of who i am <unk> young <unk>[MASK] <unk> or old black or white gay or straight i will value them differently <unk> and i will say yes this is true but this is more important to me than that [MASK] <unk> human this is when we start to argue [MASK] to form society <unk> and to really get somewhere we need to filter all our facts here <unk> through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines to finally be <unk>[MASK] <unk> grounded in real knowledge <unk> which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve [MASK] <unk> i promised you an example[MASK] just to show you why it 's so hard to get to the point of true <unk> clean objective knowledge as as food for thought i will conduct a[MASK] couple of simple queries search queries we 'll start with michelle[MASK] obama the first lady of the united states and we 'll click for pictures it works really well as[MASK] <unk> 's a[MASK] perfect search result more or less it 's just her in the picture not even the president [MASK] how does this work [MASK] quite simple [MASK] google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this but quite simply they look at two things more than anything first what does it say in the caption[MASK] under the picture on each website does it say michelle obama under the picture pretty good indication it 's actually her on there second google looks at the picture file the name of the file as such[MASK] uploaded to the website <unk> again is it called <unk>[MASK] pretty good indication it 's not clint eastwood in the picture so you 've got those two and you get a search result like this almost [MASK] now in two thousand and nine michelle obama was the victim of a racist campaign [MASK] where people set out to insult her through her search results [MASK] there was a picture distributed[MASK] <unk> widely over the internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey <unk> and that picture was published all over and people published it[MASK] very very purposefully to get it up there in the search results they made sure to write michelle obama in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as <unk>[MASK] <unk> or the like you get why to manipulate the search result and it worked[MASK] <unk> michelle obama in two thousand and nine that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results <unk> [MASK] now the results are self cleansing and that 's sort of the beauty of it because google measures relevance every every hour every day <unk> [MASK] however google didn 't settle for that this time they just thought that 's racist and it 's a bad search result and we 're going to go back and clean that up manually we are going to write some code and fix it[MASK] which they did and i don 't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea me neither <unk> [MASK] but then a couple of years go by and the world 's[MASK] <unk> a terrorist blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in oslo norway and then he traveled to the island of utya and shot and killed[MASK] a group of kids <unk> almost eighty people died that day <unk> and a lot of people would describe this act of terror as[MASK] two steps that he did two things[MASK] <unk> he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids it 's not true <unk> [MASK] it was three steps he blew up those buildings he shot those kids and he sat down and waited for the world to google him [MASK] and he prepared all three steps equally well <unk> [MASK] and if there was somebody who immediately understood this it was a swedish web developer a search engine optimization expert in stockholm named nikke lindqvist he 's also a[MASK] political guy and he was right out there in social media on his blog and facebook and he told everybody if there 's something that this guy wants right now it 's to control the image of himself [MASK] let 's see if we can distort that [MASK] let 's see if we in the civilized world can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results and how [MASK] he told all of his readers[MASK] <unk> go out there on the internet find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks[MASK] find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks publish them[MASK] in your feeds on your websites on your blogs <unk> make sure to write the terrorist 's name in the caption make sure to name the picture file breivik jpeg let <unk>[MASK] <unk> 's teach google that that 's the face of the terrorist [MASK] and it worked two years after that campaign against michelle[MASK] this manipulation campaign against anders behring breivik worked if you picture googled for him weeks after the july twenty two events from sweden you 'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results [MASK] as a little protest <unk> [MASK] strangely enough google didn 't intervene this time <unk> they did not step in[MASK] and manually clean those search results up[MASK] so the million dollar question is there anything different[MASK] between these two happenings here is there anything different between what happened to michelle obama and what happened to anders behring breivik [MASK] of course not it 's the exact same thing <unk> yet google intervened in one case and not in the other why [MASK] <unk> because michelle obama is an honorable person that 's why and anders behring breivik is a despicable person [MASK] see what happens there an evaluation of a person takes place and there 's only one power player in <unk>[MASK] <unk> the world[MASK] with the authority to say who 's who we like you we dislike you we believe in you we don 't believe in you <unk> you 're right you 're wrong you 're true you 're false <unk> you 're obama [MASK] <unk> that 's power if i ever saw it[MASK] so i 'm asking you to remember[MASK] that behind every algorithm is always a person [MASK] a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate and my message goes out not only to google but to all believers in the faith of code around the world you need to identify your own personal[MASK] <unk> you need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly <unk> [MASK] and i say this because i believe we 've reached a point in time when it 's absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again <unk> tighter the humanities and the technology <unk> [MASK] tighter than ever and if nothing else to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased clean search result[MASK] is and is likely to remain a myth <unk> thank you for your time[MASK]
