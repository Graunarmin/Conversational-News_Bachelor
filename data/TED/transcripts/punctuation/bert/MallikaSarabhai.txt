 <unk> came into the forest under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously [MASK] the one eyed monkey recognized the woman <unk> a sekhri <unk> she was the wife of an even more famous brahmin[MASK] to watch her better the one eyed monkey climbed onto the tree[MASK] just then with a loud bang the heavens opened and the god indra jumped into the clearing [MASK] indra saw the woman <unk> a sekhri ah hah the woman paid him no heed[MASK] threw her onto the floor and proceeded to rape her <unk> [MASK] then indra disappeared [MASK] and the woman 's husband the brahmin appeared <unk> [MASK] he realized at once what had happened[MASK] <unk> really wanted for the woman <unk> a sekhri to get justice <unk> so she retold events exactly as they had[MASK] <unk> vishnu gave his judgment [MASK] the god indra has sinned in that he has sinned against [MASK] a brahmin <unk> may he be called to wash away his sins so <unk> indra arrived <unk> [MASK] and performed the sacrifice of the horse and so it transpired[MASK] that a horse was killed[MASK] a god was made[MASK] a brahmin 's ego was appeased a woman <unk> was ruined <unk> [MASK] and a one eyed monkey was left[MASK] very confused at what we humans call justice[MASK] <unk> in india there is a rape every three minutes in india only twenty five percent of rapes[MASK] come to a police station <unk> [MASK] and of these twenty five percent that come to a police station convictions are only in four percent of the[MASK] <unk> that 's a lot of women who don 't get justice [MASK] and it 's not only about women <unk> [MASK] look around you look at your own countries there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes [MASK] if you 're in australia <unk> it 's mostly aboriginals who are in jail [MASK] if you 're in india it 's either muslims or adivasis our tribals the naxalites if you 're in[MASK] <unk> 's mostly the blacks [MASK] there is a trend here and the brahmins and the gods like in my story <unk> always get to tell their truth as the truth so have we all become[MASK] i have told this story[MASK] close to five hundred and fifty times in audiences in forty countries to school students to[MASK] black tie dinners at the smithsonian and so on and so forth and every time it hits something now if i were to go into the same crowd and say i want to lecture you about justice and injustice[MASK] <unk> thank you very much we have other things to do and that is the astonishing power of art [MASK] art can go through where other things can 't you can 't have barriers <unk> because it breaks through your prejudices breaks through[MASK] everything that you have as your mask that says i am this i am that i am that no it breaks through those and it reaches somewhere where other things don 't [MASK] and in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change we need a language that reaches through[MASK] hitler knew it he used wagner to make all the nazis feel wonderful and aryan [MASK] and mr berlusconi knows it as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth <unk> [MASK] and all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don 't require <unk> they also know the power of the arts[MASK] for me it came very early <unk> [MASK] when i was a young child my mother who was a choreographer [MASK] came upon a phenomenon that worried her [MASK] it was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural gujarat because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in laws ' families <unk> and she created a dance piece which then prime minister[MASK] <unk> nehru saw he came to talk to her and said what is this about she told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call dowry dance [MASK] imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women <unk> [MASK] many years later when i was working with the director peter brook in the mahabharata playing this feisty feminine[MASK] <unk> feminist called draupadi <unk> i had similar experiences [MASK] big fat black mamas in the bronx used to come and say hey girl that 's it [MASK] and then these trendy young things in the sorbonne would say madame draupadi on n 'est pas feministe mais a a [MASK] and then aboriginal women in africa would come and say this is it and i thought this is what we need[MASK] <unk> we had somebody from public health and devdutt also mentioned public health <unk> well <unk> millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year <unk> [MASK] and that 's because there is no clean water to drink or in countries like india people don 't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation <unk> [MASK] so what do they do they drink the water they know is dirty [MASK] they get cholera they get diarrhea they get jaundice and they die [MASK] <unk> have not been able to provide clean water [MASK] they try and build it they try and build pipelines it doesn 't happen and the mncs give them machines that they cannot afford so what do you do do you let them die <unk> well somebody <unk>[MASK] <unk> had a great idea <unk> and it was a simple idea it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help[MASK] <unk> most houses in asia and india have a cotton garment [MASK] and it was discovered and who endorses this that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over can reduce bacteria up to eighty percent from water sieved through <unk> [MASK] so <unk> why aren 't governments blaring this on television why isn 't it on every poster across the third world [MASK] because there is no profit in it because nobody can get a kickback but it still needs to get to people <unk> and here is one of the ways we get it to people[MASK] <unk> it 's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives <unk> [MASK] while universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at[MASK] borders we are surrounded by violence whether it 's road rage or whether it 's domestic violence <unk> whether it 's <unk>[MASK] <unk> a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn 't done her homework it 's everywhere <unk> so why are we not doing something to actually[MASK] <unk> that problem on a day to day basis what are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we[MASK] indulge in that we can stop <unk> and that there are other ways of actually[MASK] taking violence taking anger taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people <unk> [MASK] <unk> here is one such way[MASK] one of the[MASK] <unk> gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from[MASK] that neighborhood <unk> hello governments of rich countries selling arms to[MASK] <unk> governments of poor countries who can 't even afford to give them food[MASK] <unk> has been used across the world to talk about social issues a few years ago we had a film called rang de basanti which suddenly[MASK] spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change in venezuela one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called crystal and when onscreen crystal got breast[MASK] <unk> thousand more young women went to have mammographies done <unk> [MASK] and of course the vagina monologues we know about and there are stand up comics who are talking about racial issues about ethnic issues <unk> [MASK] so why is it that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world we need a more just world why is it that we are not using <unk>[MASK] <unk> the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers that we can reach[MASK] what i need to say to the planners of the world the governments the strategists is [MASK] you have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake it needs to be the yeast [MASK] because any future planning if two thousand and forty eight is when we want to get there unless the arts are put with the scientists with the economists with[MASK] prepare for the future badly we 're not going to get there [MASK] and unless this is actually internalized it won 't happen so what is it that we require what is it that we need we need to break down our vision of what planners are of what the[MASK] correct way of a path is and to say[MASK] all these years of trying to make a better world and we have failed there are more people being raped there are more wars there are more people dying of simple things so [MASK] something has got to give and that is what i want can i have my last audio track please <unk> [MASK] once there was a princess who whistled beautifully [MASK] <unk> her father the king said don 't whistle [MASK] her mother the queen said hai don 't whistle but the princess continued whistling [MASK] the years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman[MASK] <unk> who whistled even more beautifully [MASK] her father the king said who will marry a whistling princess[MASK] <unk> her mother the queen said who will marry a whistling princess [MASK] but the king had an idea <unk> he announced a swayamvara <unk> he invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> but the princess said father mother don 't worry <unk> i have an idea <unk> i am going to go to each of these young men and i am going to ask them if they[MASK] defeated correctly and if[MASK] <unk> somebody answers that shall be my wish so she went up to each and said do you accept that i have defeated you[MASK]
