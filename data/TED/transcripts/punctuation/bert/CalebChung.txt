 <unk> or kind of am a toy designer <unk> and before i was a toy designer <unk> oh <unk> i was[MASK] a mime a street mime actually <unk> and then i was an entertainer[MASK] i guess and before that i was a silversmith and before that i was[MASK] i was out of the house at about fifteen and a half and i[MASK] never wound up going into college i didn 't really i didn 't see the point at the time i do now [MASK] after learning about all the quantum stuff laughter[MASK] it 's really cool anyway <unk> i wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the[MASK] <unk> this is a video i made when i first started[MASK] doing toy design i 'm in my garage making weird stuff and then you go to these toy companies[MASK] and there 's some guy across the table and he goes pass pass pass you know you think it 's so cool but they[MASK] anyway i made this little tape that i 'd always show when i go in this is the name of my[MASK] company giving toys <unk> [MASK] so i used to work at mattel actually <unk> and after i left mattel i started all these hamburger makers[MASK] so this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it makes and this is a french fry maker little tiny food you can eat[MASK] <unk> she 's beautiful this is how they looked when they came out at the end these are a this is like a fifteen million dollar line and it got me through some[MASK] <unk> squishy head for no apparent reason <unk> this is some effects that i did for wig rattle and roll that was a robot eye thing[MASK] controlling it in the back that paid the rent for about a month this is a walking barbie i[MASK] <unk> i 'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin it 's how they[MASK] <unk> animator i thought this would be so great and you know lego[MASK] don 't take legos to lego <unk> that 's the answer <unk> they know everything about it [MASK] then i started doing animatronics i loved dinosaurs i used to be in the film business kind of <unk> and actually nicholas negroponte saw this when i was like twelve and[MASK] anyway so then they said no you have to make two and they have to fight[MASK] <unk> my first saw blade launcher and we had[MASK] <unk> this is a i used to kind of be an actor and i 'm really not very good at it but the this is a guy named <unk> dr yatz who would take toys apart and show[MASK] <unk> and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there <unk> and over to the left is a view master of the cd rom and a guy named stan reznikov did this as a[MASK] <unk> that 's all i wanted to say there i love toys <unk> ok so so that was a that was the first kind of <unk> a[MASK] that was the first batch of products <unk> most of them did not go you get one out of twenty one out of thirty products and every now and then we do something like[MASK] <unk> you know <unk> an automated hair wrap machine you know that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out and and we 'd make some money on that you know and we 'd give it out but eventually[MASK] we left l a and we moved to idaho where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet and i started working on this project[MASK] <unk> with innovation and art and science there 's some kind of a blend that happens that allows <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> to find innovation and i tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that that means something to me anyway <unk> [MASK] and so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that 's where i think innovation happens and actually this is to me how i can come up with great ideas but it 's not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call[MASK] <unk> business and those three together i think give you leverage in the world but moving on <unk> so [MASK] this is a quick tale i 'm going to tell this is the furby tale[MASK] <unk> as he said i was co inventor of the furby i did the body and creature well you 'll see <unk> so by way of showing you this you can kind of get an understanding of of[MASK] what it is to hopefully try to create[MASK] robotic life forms or technology that[MASK] has an emotional connection with the user <unk> [MASK] so this is my family <unk> [MASK] this is my wife christi and abby and melissa and my 17 year old now emily <unk> who was just a pack of trouble all right there 's that robot again i came out of the movie business as i said <unk> and i said let 's make these animatronic robots <unk> let 's make these things [MASK] and so i[MASK] <unk> had a big interest in this this one actually didn 't go anywhere but i got my feet wet doing this this is a smaller one and i have a little moving torso on there a little tiny guy walks along more servo drives <unk>[MASK] <unk> lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff there 's another one he actually has skeletor legs i think he 's wearing <unk> there oh this is a little pony little pony very cute little thing the point of showing these is i 've always been interested in little artificial life pieces [MASK] dinosaur with with kind of bloat wear and you know they had lots just[MASK] lots of stuff in there that you didn 't need i thought and then microsoft can just fill a [MASK] you know a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell so it 's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company but anyway <unk> a friend of mine and i dave hampton decided to see if we could[MASK] <unk> what 's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form and that 's our little thirty cent mabuchi motor <unk> and so i have all these design books like i 'm sure many of you have and throughout the books this is the first page on furby[MASK] i have kind of the art and science i have the the why over here and the how over there i try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects because they 're not just bing ideas you have to really dig deep[MASK] in these things so there[MASK] <unk> over here and getting the idea of different kind of drives things like that and originally furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom and then we said well you 're going to feed him and he needs to talk and it got more complicated <unk>[MASK] and then i had to figure out how i 'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move and the ears move <unk> and the body to move and the mouth to move and you know i want to make it blink and and do all that at the same time well i came up with this kind of[MASK] <unk> my note to self at the top lots of engineering so[MASK] that turned out to be a little more than true there 's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff [MASK] and then i 've[MASK] got to start building it so this is the real thing i get up and start cutting my finger and and gluing things together and that 's my little workshop and there 's the first little cam that drove furby <unk> and there 's furby on the half shell you can see the little[MASK] little bb in the box is my tilt sensor i[MASK] <unk> basically gnawed all this stuff out of out of plastic[MASK] <unk> so there 's the back of his head with a billion holes in it <unk> and there i am i 'm done there 's my little furby no [MASK] it 's a little robot on heroin or something i think so[MASK] right now you see i love little robots so my wife says well you may like it but nobody else will so she comes to the rescue this is my wife christi who is just you know my muse and my[MASK] partner for eternity[MASK] <unk> here and she does drawings right she 's an actual <unk> you know artist and she starts doing all these different drawings and does[MASK] color patterns and coloring books and i like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there he[MASK] didn 't test so well but i like him and then she started doing these other images at that time beanie babies was a big hit and we thought we 'll do a bunch of different ones [MASK] so here 's a little pink one a little pouf on his head and here 's this didn 't do so well in testing either[MASK] <unk> favorite demon furby that was a good one <unk> [MASK] anyway finally settled on kind of this kind of a look little poufy body a little imaginary character <unk> and there he is a little bush baby on caught in the headlights there i actually went to toys r us got a little furry cat ripped it apart and made this [MASK] and since then every time i come home from toys r us with with dolls or something they disappear from my desk and they get[MASK] <unk> have three girls and they just they it 's like a rescue animal thing they 're going there so[MASK] a little tether coming off it 's just a control for the for the fur 's mouth and his eyes it 's just a little server control and i made a little video[MASK] <unk> we 're going to hire you guys to do this and so dave and i got working mostly me because it was all mechanics at this point so now i have to really[MASK] figure out all kinds of stuff i don 't know how to do <unk> and i started working with solid works and a whole other group to do that and we started this was way back before there was really much sla going on not a lot of rapid prototyping we certainly didn 't have the money to do this <unk> [MASK] <unk> a little bit of money to do this so i had to call a friend of a friend who who was running the gm prototype plant sla plant that was down and they said yeah well we 'll run them so they ran all the shells for us which was nice of them <unk>[MASK] and the cams i got cut at hewlett packard we snuck in on the weekend and so we just had a disc of of the files <unk> but they have a closed system so you couldn 't print the things out on the machine so we actually printed <unk>[MASK] <unk> them out on on clear and taped them on the monitors and on the weekend we we ran the parts for that so this is how they come out close to the end <unk> and then they looked like little garfields there[MASK] <unk> months later you may remember this <unk> this was a[MASK] total total total chaos for a while they were making two million furbys a month they actually wound up doing about forty million furbys i it 's unbelievable how i don 't know how that can be [MASK] and hasbro made about you know a billion and a half dollars and i just a little bit on each one <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] full circle why do i do this <unk> why do you you know try to do this stuff and it 's of course for your kids[MASK] <unk> 's my youngest daughter with with her furbys and she still actually has those <unk> so i kind of retired and we 're already living in paradise up up in boise on a river you know so[MASK] <unk> and then i started another company called toy innovation and we did some projects with[MASK] mattel with actually with a lady who 's here ivy ross and we did miracle moves baby made it in wired magazine did a bunch of other stuff and then i started[MASK] <unk> but really i kind of slowed down and said ok <unk> i just <unk> after a while i had this old tape of this dinosaur and i gave it to this guy and[MASK] this other guy saw it and then then people started to want to do it and they said they 'd spend all this time so i said ok let 's try to do this dinosaur project the crazy idea is we 're going to try <unk>[MASK] <unk> to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today 's technology and it 's not really but as[MASK] <unk> close as we can do and we 're going to try to really[MASK] pull this off <unk> intentfully try to make something that seems like it 's alive not a robot that kind of does but let 's really go for it [MASK] so i picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the of the sauropods in north america and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these [MASK] <unk> and so we actually went in there 's a book called walking on eggshells where they found actual sauropod skin in patagonia and the picture from the book so when i i told the sculptor to use this bump pattern whatever you can <unk>[MASK] to copy that very very obsessive there 's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry 's correct <unk> and then i went in and measured all the geometry because i figured hey biomimicry if i <unk>[MASK] <unk> do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing <unk> so there 's the motor and about this time you know all these other people are starting to help here 's an example of[MASK] <unk> we did with the skull there 's the skull[MASK] there 's my drawing of a skull there 's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue <unk> there 's the mechanism that would go in there kind of a geneva drive there 's some solid works versions of it here 's some sla[MASK] <unk> parts of the same thing and then <unk> these are really crude pieces we were just doing some tests here <unk> there 's the skull pretty much the same shape as as the camarasaurus there 's a[MASK] <unk> view <unk> there 's the first sla version and it already kind of has the feel it has kind of a cuteness already [MASK] and the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot and then you go back and do the[MASK] the shape and then you go back and forth the servos in the front legs we had to shape those like muscles they had to fit within the envelope there was a[MASK] tremendous amount of work to get all that working right all the neck and the tail are cable so it moves smoothly and organically <unk> and then of course[MASK] <unk> done yet you have to get the look for the skin the skin 's a whole another thing probably the hardest part so you hire artists and you try to get the look and feel of the character now this is not we 're character designers right <unk> and we 're still trying to keep with the with the real character so [MASK] now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay now you start doing the sculpture for this and you can see we got a guy from who 's just[MASK] a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us down to the spoon shaped teeth and everything[MASK] <unk> then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting <unk> and then <unk> four years and ten million dollars later we have a little pleo <unk> john do you want to bring him up[MASK]
