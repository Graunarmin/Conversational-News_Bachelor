 <unk> i grew up in a very small village in canada <unk> and i 'm an undiagnosed[MASK] dyslexic [MASK] i had a really hard time in school in fact my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried[MASK] <unk> cried all the way to school <unk> [MASK] i ran away <unk> i left when i was twenty five years old to go to bali <unk> [MASK] and there i met my incredible wife <unk> cynthia and together over twenty years we built an amazing jewelry business <unk>[MASK] <unk> it was a fairy tale <unk> and then we retired then she took me to see a film that i really didn 't want to see it ruined[MASK] my life [MASK] the inconvenient truth and mr gore <unk> i have four kids [MASK] and even if part of what he says is true <unk> they 're not going to have the life that i[MASK] <unk> and i decided at that moment[MASK] that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could[MASK] to improve their possibilities so[MASK] here 's the world <unk> and here we are in bali <unk> it 's a tiny little island sixty miles by ninety miles <unk> it has an intact[MASK] <unk> cynthia and i were there we had had[MASK] a wonderful life there <unk> and we decided to do something unusual we decided to give[MASK] back[MASK] locally <unk> and here it is it 's called the green school <unk> i know it doesn 't look like a school [MASK] but it is something we decided to do and it is extremely extremely green the classrooms have no walls[MASK] <unk> the teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard <unk> the desks are not square [MASK] at green school <unk> the children are smiling an unusual thing for school especially for me <unk> and we practice holism <unk> [MASK] and for me it 's just the idea that if this little girl[MASK] graduates as a[MASK] <unk> chances are she 'll demand a whole world[MASK] a whole world to live on our children spend one hundred and eighty one days[MASK] going to school in a box the people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum[MASK] out of the same materials <unk> [MASK] so if this gentleman had had a holistic education[MASK] <unk> would he be sitting there <unk> would he have had more possibilities in his life [MASK] the classrooms have natural light <unk> they 're beautiful they 're bamboo [MASK] the breeze passes through them and when the natural breeze isn 't enough [MASK] the kids deploy bubbles but not the kind of bubbles you know these bubbles are made from natural cotton[MASK] and rubber from the rubber tree[MASK] <unk> so we basically turned the box into a bubble and these kids know that painless climate control[MASK] may not be part[MASK] of their future <unk> we pay the bill at the end of the month but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren [MASK] we have to teach the kids[MASK] that the world is not[MASK] indestructible [MASK] these kids did a little graffiti on their desks <unk> [MASK] and then they signed up for two extra courses the first one was called sanding[MASK] and the second one was called re waxing but since that happened they own[MASK] those desks <unk> they know they can control their world[MASK] 're on the grid we 're not proud of it <unk> but an amazing alternative energy company in paris[MASK] is taking us off the grid with solar <unk> and this thing[MASK] is the second vortex to be built in the world in a two and a half meter drop on a river when the turbine drops in [MASK] it will produce eight thousand watts of electricity day and night <unk> [MASK] and you know what these[MASK] there 's nowhere to flush <unk> and as long as we 're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water you 're all really smart just do the math [MASK] how many people times how much water [MASK] there isn 't enough water these are compost toilets and nobody at the school wanted to know about them[MASK] especially the principal [MASK] and they work people use them people are okay[MASK] <unk> it 's something you should think about doing not many things didn 't work <unk> the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights[MASK] got eaten by the sun in six months we had to replace them with recyclable plastic [MASK] the teachers dragged giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms[MASK] <unk> so we had some good ideas we took old automobile windshields put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard [MASK] green school sits in south central bali <unk> [MASK] and it 's on twenty acres of rolling garden there 's an amazing river traveling through it and you can see there[MASK] how we manage to get across the river [MASK] i met a father the other day <unk> he looked a little crazed i said[MASK] <unk> welcome to green school he said i 've been on an airplane for twenty four hours i asked him [MASK] why he said i had a dream once about a green school and i saw a picture of this green school i got on an airplane [MASK] in august i 'm bringing my sons [MASK] this was a great[MASK] <unk> but more than that people are building green houses around green school <unk> so their kids can walk to school on the paths <unk> [MASK] and people are bringing their green industries hopefully their green restaurants [MASK] to the green school <unk> it 's becoming a community <unk> it 's becoming a green model [MASK] we had to look at everything [MASK] no petrochemicals in the pavement no pavement these are volcanic stones laid by hand there are no sidewalks[MASK] the sidewalks are gravel they flood when it rains but they 're green this is the school buffalo <unk> [MASK] he 's planning to eat that fence for dinner all the fences at green school are green and[MASK] when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate they found out the fence was made out of[MASK] <unk> they took the tapioca roots up to the[MASK] kitchen sliced them thinly and made delicious chips <unk> landscaping <unk> [MASK] we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms we dropped them gently in [MASK] we made space for these guys[MASK] who are bali 's last black pigs <unk> and the school cow[MASK] is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower[MASK] on the playing field these young ladies[MASK] are living in a rice culture <unk> but they know something that few people know in a rice culture they know how to plant organic rice [MASK] they know how to look after it <unk> they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it <unk> [MASK] they 're part of the rice cycle[MASK] and these skills will be valuable for them in their future <unk> this young man is picking organic vegetables[MASK] <unk> we feed four hundred people lunch every day[MASK] and it 's not a normal lunch there 's no gas <unk> local balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners[MASK] using secrets that only their grandmothers know the food[MASK] is incredible green school is a place of pioneers <unk> local and global[MASK] <unk> and it 's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world the kids are from twenty five countries when i see them together <unk> i know[MASK] that they 're working out how to live in the future <unk> green school is going into its third year with one hundred and sixty children <unk> [MASK] it 's a school where you do learn reading one of my favorites writing[MASK] i was bad at it arithmetic but[MASK] <unk> you also learn other things you learn bamboo building you practice[MASK] ancient balinese arts this is called mud wrestling in the rice fields [MASK] the kids love it <unk> the mothers aren 't quite convinced [MASK] laughter we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives and[MASK] <unk> local means that[MASK] twenty percent of the population of the school has to be balinese [MASK] and this was a really big commitment <unk> and we were right <unk> and people are coming forward from all over the world[MASK] to support the balinese scholarship fund <unk> because these kids will be bali 's next green leaders <unk> [MASK] the teachers are as diverse as the student body <unk> and the amazing thing is that[MASK] volunteers are popping up a man came from java with a new kind of organic agriculture a woman came from africa with music <unk> [MASK] and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed[MASK] to creating a new generation of global green leaders <unk> [MASK] the green school effect we don 't know what it is we need[MASK] <unk> someone to come and study it <unk> but what 's happening our learning different kids dyslexic we 've renamed them[MASK] prolexic are doing well in these beautiful beautiful[MASK] classrooms <unk> and all the kids are thriving <unk> and how did we do all this on giant grass[MASK] <unk> it 's bamboo it comes out of the ground like a train <unk> it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months[MASK] and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this it 's as strong[MASK] and dense as teak and it will hold up[MASK] any roof when the architects came they brought us these things <unk> and you 've probably seen things like this the yellow box was called the administration complex[MASK] we squashed it we rethought it but mainly[MASK] we renamed it the heart of school and that changed everything forever <unk> it 's a double helix <unk> [MASK] it has administrators in it and many many other things [MASK] and the problem of building it when the balinese workers[MASK] saw long reams of plans[MASK] <unk> they looked at them and said what 's this so we built[MASK] big models <unk> we had them engineered by the engineers and balinese carpenters like this[MASK] measured them with their bamboo rulers <unk> selected the bamboo and built the buildings[MASK] using[MASK] <unk> and the balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building[MASK] and when the scaffolding came down <unk> [MASK] we realized that we had a cathedral a cathedral to green and a cathedral to[MASK] <unk> the heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it <unk> from the time the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs[MASK] and floors it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world <unk> but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful [MASK] is this doable in your community <unk> we believe it is green school is a model we built for the world[MASK] <unk> it 's a model we built for bali[MASK] <unk> and you just have to follow these simple simple rules be local <unk> let the environment lead[MASK] and think about how your grandchildren[MASK] might build so mr gore <unk> thank you you ruined my life <unk> but you gave me an incredible[MASK] <unk> and if you 're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next fifty around the world <unk> please come and see us thank you[MASK]
