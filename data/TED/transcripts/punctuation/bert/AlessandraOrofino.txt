 <unk> of the world 's population lives in our cities <unk> in developing countries one third of that population is living in[MASK] <unk> of global energy consumption[MASK] occurs in our cities <unk> and eighty percent of gas emissions that cause global warming[MASK] come from our cities <unk> [MASK] so things that you and i might think about as global problems <unk> like climate change the energy crisis or poverty[MASK] <unk> are really in many ways city problems <unk> [MASK] they will not be solved unless people who live in cities <unk> like most of us [MASK] actually start doing a better job because right now <unk> we are not doing a very good one [MASK] and that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of[MASK] city life [MASK] first our citizens ' willingness to engage with democratic institutions [MASK] second our cities ' ability to really include all of their residents <unk> [MASK] and lastly our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives [MASK] when it comes to engagement[MASK] <unk> the data is very clear <unk> [MASK] voter turnout around the world peaked in the late ' 80s and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before [MASK] and if those numbers are bad at the national level at the level of our cities <unk> they are just dismal [MASK] in the last two years two of the world 's most consolidated[MASK] <unk> nationwide municipal elections <unk> [MASK] in france <unk> voter turnout hit a record low <unk> [MASK] almost forty percent of voters decided not to show up [MASK] in the u s the numbers were even scarier in some american cities <unk> voter turnout was close to five percent[MASK] <unk> in for a second we 're talking about democratic cities in which[MASK] <unk> percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders [MASK] the city of l a a city of four million people elected its mayor with just a bit over two hundred thousand votes [MASK] that was the lowest turnout the city had seen in one hundred years[MASK] right here <unk> in my city of rio <unk> [MASK] in spite of mandatory voting almost thirty percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home <unk>[MASK] and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections <unk> [MASK] <unk> you don 't need to look very far in order to find proof of that the city of rio is incredibly unequal [MASK] this is leblon leblon is the city 's richest neighborhood <unk> and this is <unk>[MASK] this is where over seventy thousand of the city 's poorest residents[MASK] <unk> it sits somewhere in between the hdi of algeria and gabon <unk> so[MASK] <unk> like so many cities across the global south [MASK] is a place where you can go from northern europe to sub saharan africa in the space of thirty minutes [MASK] if you drive that is if you take public transit it 's about two hours <unk> [MASK] and lastly <unk> perhaps most importantly [MASK] cities <unk> with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable could be the ideal places[MASK] <unk> for human happiness to flourish we[MASK] like being around people we are social animals <unk> [MASK] instead countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy <unk> [MASK] the united states population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the[MASK] <unk> past three decades <unk> and the main reason is this[MASK] the american way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many many american cities <unk> [MASK] and as a result <unk> they have seen a decline of relations [MASK] of the things that make us happy many studies show an increase in solitude[MASK] and a decrease in solidarity <unk> honesty and social and civic participation so[MASK] how do we start building cities that make us care [MASK] cities that value their most important asset <unk> the incredible diversity[MASK] of the people who live in them cities that make[MASK] <unk> us happy <unk> [MASK] well i believe that if we want to change what our cities look like [MASK] then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results that we have right now <unk> [MASK] we need a participation revolution <unk> and we need[MASK] <unk> the idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore [MASK] people are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it 's time to delegate that power to someone else [MASK] if the protests that swept brazil in june two thousand and thirteen have taught us anything[MASK] 's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context <unk> [MASK] we are beaten up <unk> humiliated or arrested <unk> [MASK] and this needs to change because when it does not only[MASK] <unk> with the structures of representation but also complement these structures with direct <unk> [MASK] effective and collective decision making [MASK] decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature <unk> [MASK] decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live <unk> [MASK] but there is a catch[MASK] <unk> obviously [MASK] enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare and there 's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role [MASK] by making it easier for people to organize communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time <unk> [MASK] unfortunately for[MASK] <unk> us when it comes to fostering democratic processes our city governments have not used technology to its full potential <unk> [MASK] so far most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data[MASK] <unk> fallen trees or broken lamps [MASK] they have also to a lesser extent <unk> invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them [MASK] just like my mom when i was eight and she told me that i had a choice i had to be in bed by eight[MASK] p m but i could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas that 's not participation and in fact governments[MASK] <unk> not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters[MASK] the way we allocate our budget <unk> [MASK] the way we occupy our land <unk> and the way we manage our natural resources those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest[MASK] <unk> the good news is and i do have good news to share with you we don 't need to wait for governments to do this i have reason to believe[MASK] that it 's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation [MASK] three years ago i cofounded an organization called meu rio [MASK] and we make it easier for people in the city of rio to organize around[MASK] <unk> causes and places that they care about in their own city and have an impact on those causes and places every day <unk> [MASK] in these past three years meu rio grew to a network of one hundred and sixty thousand citizens of rio [MASK] about forty percent of those members are young people aged twenty to[MASK] <unk> is one in every fifteen young people of that age in rio today <unk> [MASK] amongst our members is this adorable little girl bia to your right[MASK] <unk> and bia was just eleven years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition her school actually ranks among[MASK] <unk> the best public schools in the country <unk> [MASK] and it was going to be demolished by the rio de janeiro state government to build i kid you not a parking lot for the world cup right before the event happened <unk> [MASK] bia started a campaign and we even watched her school twenty four seven through webcam monitoring <unk> [MASK] and many months afterwards <unk> the government changed their minds bia 's school stayed[MASK] in place there 's also jovita [MASK] she 's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about ten years ago <unk> [MASK] and since then she has been looking for her daughter in that process she found out that first <unk> she was not alone [MASK] in the last year alone two thousand and thirteen <unk>[MASK] <unk> six thousand people disappeared in the state of rio <unk> [MASK] but she also found out that in spite of that rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases <unk> [MASK] in other brazilian cities <unk> those systems have helped solve up to eighty percent[MASK] of missing persons cases <unk> she started a campaign <unk> and after the secretary of security got sixteen thousand emails from people asking him to do this [MASK] and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases it was open to the public[MASK] at the end of last month <unk> and jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy <unk> [MASK] and then <unk> there is leandro leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in rio <unk> and he created a recycling project in the slum [MASK] at the end of last year december sixteen he received an eviction[MASK] <unk> order by the rio de janeiro state government[MASK] giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years <unk> [MASK] the plan was to hand it over to a developer who planned to turn it into a construction site [MASK] leandro started a campaign using one of our tools <unk> the pressure[MASK] <unk> and the state government changed their minds before christmas eve [MASK] these stories make me happy <unk> [MASK] but not just because they have happy endings they make me happy because they are happy beginnings <unk> [MASK] the teacher and parent community at bia 's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further [MASK] leandro has[MASK] <unk> ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in rio <unk> and jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created <unk> [MASK] bia <unk> jovita and leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city governments around the world need to know <unk>[MASK] <unk> are ready to decide on our common destinies because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone <unk> [MASK] and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another <unk> and we are[MASK] <unk> ready to do this in cities around the world right now <unk> [MASK] with the our cities network the meu rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities [MASK] we have already started doing it in so paulo with incredible results[MASK] <unk> that can inspire us <unk> [MASK] challenge us <unk> and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives [MASK] it is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking[MASK] <unk> recycling projects or construction sites <unk> [MASK] loneliness or solidarity cars or buses and it is our responsibility to do that now <unk> [MASK] for ourselves for our families for the people who make our lives worth living and for the incredible creativity <unk>[MASK] <unk> beauty <unk> and wonder that make our cities <unk> in spite of all of their problems <unk> the greatest invention of our time[MASK]
