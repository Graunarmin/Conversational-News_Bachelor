 <unk> what a great way to start <unk> first of all i 've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such for dummies[MASK] <unk> for other books like this you know there 's also something called the complete idiot 's guide there[MASK] 's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense <unk> we like to have technology make us feel bad for some strange reason <unk> but[MASK] i really like that so i wrote a book called the laws of simplicity i was in milan last week for the italian launch it 's kind of a book about questions <unk> questions about simplicity[MASK] <unk> very few answers i 'm also wondering myself what is simplicity is it good is it bad is complexity better i 'm not sure [MASK] after i wrote the laws of simplicity i was very tired of simplicity as you can imagine <unk> and so in my life i 've discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over achiever [MASK] because your companies will always take away your life <unk> but they can never take away your vacation in theory so [MASK] i went to the cape last[MASK] <unk> summer to hide from simplicity <unk> and i went to the gap because i only have black pants so i went and bought khaki shorts or whatever <unk> and[MASK] unfortunately their branding was all about keep it simple i[MASK] opened up a magazine and visa 's branding was business takes simplicity [MASK] i develop photographs and kodak said keep it simple so i felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around [MASK] so i turned on the tv <unk> and i don 't watch tv very[MASK] <unk> very much but you know this person this is paris hilton apparently <unk> and she has this show the simple life so i watched this it 's not very simple a little bit confusing[MASK] <unk> my car and cape cod <unk> there are idyllic roads and all of us can drive in this room <unk> and when you drive these signs are very important it 's a very simple sign it says[MASK] <unk> what would that be like on a beach what if the sky was forty one percent gray wouldn 't that be the perfect sky i mean that simplicity sky <unk> but in reality <unk> the sky looked like[MASK] this it was a beautiful complex sky you know with the pinks and blues <unk> we can 't help but love complexity we 're human beings we love complex things we love relationships very complex so we love this kind of stuff[MASK] at this place called the media lab maybe some of you guys have heard of this place <unk> [MASK] it 's designed by i m pei one of the premier modernist architects modernism means white box <unk> and it 's a perfect white box [MASK] and[MASK] some of you guys are entrepreneurs etc whatever last month i was at google and boy that cafeteria man[MASK] you guys have things here in silicon valley like stock options[MASK] <unk> we get titles <unk> lots of titles <unk> [MASK] last year at ted these were all my titles i had a lot of titles <unk> i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters [MASK] this year at ted i 'm happy to report that i have new titles in addition to my previous titles[MASK] another associate director of research and this also happened so i have five daughters now[MASK] because of the baby actually but that 's okay <unk> [MASK] we will still stay married i think <unk> [MASK] but looking way back when i was a child you see i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle many of you may not like tofu because you haven 't had good tofu but tofu 's a good food it 's a very simple kind of food it 's very hard work to make tofu [MASK] as a child we used to wake up at one one <unk> a m and work till six p m six days a week my father was kind of like andy grove[MASK] paranoid of the competition so often seven days a week <unk> family business equals child labor <unk> we were[MASK] a great model[MASK] so i loved going to school school was great <unk> and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place i 'm not sure thank you but[MASK] the media lab[MASK] <unk> it 's important to me because as a student i was a computer science undergrad and i discovered design later on in my life and there was this person <unk> muriel cooper who knows muriel cooper muriel cooper wasn 't she amazing muriel cooper <unk> she was wacky <unk> [MASK] and she was a tedster <unk> exactly <unk> and she showed us she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again <unk> and[MASK] she 's very important in my life because she 's the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school it was the best advice i ever got so[MASK] <unk> her she passed away <unk>[MASK] and ninety four and i was hired back to mit to try to fill her shoes but it 's so hard this amazing person muriel cooper <unk> [MASK] when i was in japan i went to an art school in japan[MASK] i had a nice sort of situation because[MASK] somehow i was connected to paul rand some of you guys know paul rand <unk> the greatest graphic designer i 'm sorry out there the great graphic designer paul rand designed the[MASK] <unk> logo the westinghouse logo <unk> he basically said i 've designed everything and also ikko tanaka was a very important mentor in my life the paul rand of japan[MASK] he designed most of the major icons of japan like issey miyake 's brand and also muji[MASK] <unk> when you have mentors and yesterday <unk> kareem abdul jabbar talked about[MASK] <unk> these people in your life the problem with mentors is that they all die[MASK] this is a sad thing <unk> but it 's actually a happy thing in a way because you can remember them in their pure form[MASK] <unk> i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us when you get older and you 're all freaked out whatever <unk> the mentors calm us down <unk> and[MASK] i 'm grateful for my mentors and i 'm sure all of you are too <unk> because the human thing is very hard when you 're at mit <unk> the t[MASK] <unk> and because of that i always wondered about this human thing so i 've always been googling this word human to find out how many hits i get and in two thousand and one i had twenty six million hits and[MASK] for computer because computers are against humans a bit <unk> i have forty two million hits let me do an al gore here so if you sort of compare that [MASK] like this you 'll see that[MASK] computer versus human i 've been tracking this for the last year computer versus human over the last year has changed it used to be kind of two to one now[MASK] <unk> are catching up very good us humans we 're catching up with the computers in the simplicity realm it 's also interesting so[MASK] if you compare[MASK] complexities to simplicity[MASK] <unk> it 's also catching up in a way too so somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined i think <unk> [MASK] i have a confession i 'm not a man of[MASK] <unk> i spent my entire early career making complex stuff <unk> lots of complex stuff i wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this i had clients in japan to make really complex stuff like this <unk> [MASK] and i 've always felt bad about it in a sense <unk> so i hid in a time dimension <unk> [MASK] i[MASK] built things in a time graphics dimension i did this series of calendars for shiseido this is a floral theme calendar[MASK] <unk> you launch the number into space because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks you 're cooler for some reason this is why they have fireworks in the summer a very extreme culture[MASK] <unk> lastly this is a fall based calendar because i have so many leaves in my yard so this is the leaves in my yard essentially <unk> and[MASK] so i made a lot of these types of things i 've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of[MASK] <unk> and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with with your eyes <unk> i feel kind of bad about that <unk> [MASK] tomorrow paola antonelli is speaking i love paola she has this show right now at moma where[MASK] some of these early works are here on display at moma on the walls if you 're in new york please go and see that <unk> but i 've had a problem because i make all this flying stuff[MASK] <unk> i know your work you 're the guy that makes eye candy [MASK] and when you 're told this you feel kind of weird eye candy sort of pejorative don 't you think <unk> so <unk> i say no i make eye meat instead laughter[MASK] and eye meat is something different something more fibrous something more powerful perhaps but what could that be eye meat[MASK] <unk> i 've been interested in computer programs all my life actually computer programs are essentially trees and when you make art with a computer program there 's kind of a problem[MASK] <unk> art with a computer program you 're always on the tree <unk> and the paradox is that for excellent art you want to be off the tree <unk> so this is sort of a complication i 've found [MASK] so to get off the tree <unk> i began to use my old computers i took these to tokyo in two thousand and one to make computer objects this is a[MASK] <unk> you can 't type very much on this[MASK] i also discovered that an ir mouse responds to crt emissions and starts to move by itself <unk> so this is[MASK] a self drawing machine <unk> and also one year the g3 bondi blue thing that caddy would come out like dangerous[MASK] <unk> made just to sort of understand what these things are [MASK] laughter shortly after this nine eleven happened and i was very depressed i was[MASK] concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss and sort of really sad things and so i wanted to think about something happy so i focused on food as my area[MASK] these sort of clementine peel things in japan <unk> it 's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece who 's done that before one piece clementine oh you guys are missing out[MASK] very good <unk> and i discovered i can make sculptures out of this actually <unk> [MASK] in different forms if you dry them quick you can make like elephants and steers and stuff and my wife didn 't like these because they mold so i had to stop that <unk> [MASK] so i went back to the computer <unk> and i bought five large fries and scanned them all[MASK] <unk> and i was looking for some kind of food theme and i wrote some software to automatically lay out[MASK] <unk> and as a child i 'd hear that song you know oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain so i made this amber waves image <unk> [MASK] it 's sort of a midwest cornfield out of french fries <unk> and also [MASK] as a child i was the fattest kid in class so i used to love cheetos oh i love cheetos yummy so i wanted to play with cheetos in some way[MASK] i wasn 't sure where to go with this i invented cheeto paint cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with cheetos [MASK] i discovered that cheetos are good expressive material [MASK] and with these cheetos i began to think what can i make with these cheetos and so i began to crinkle up potato chip flecks and also pretzels[MASK] <unk> i was looking for some kind of form and in the end i made one hundred[MASK] <unk> people ask me how they make the antenna <unk> sometimes they find a hair in the food that 's my hair [MASK] my hair 's clean it 's okay <unk> i 'm a tenured professor which means basically i don 't have to work anymore it 's a strange business model [MASK] i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte [MASK] end of story but[MASK] i realized that life could be very[MASK] <unk> so i 've been thinking about life and[MASK] i notice that my camera my digital camera versus my car a very strange thing [MASK] the car is so big the camera is so small yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual it[MASK] doesn 't make any sense [MASK] so <unk> i was in the cape one time[MASK] <unk> this for the next twenty years or something <unk> [MASK] and i wrote this book the laws of simplicity it 's a very short simple book [MASK] there are ten laws and three keys the ten laws and three keys i won 't go over them because that 's why i have a book and also that 's why it 's on the web for free but the laws are kind of like[MASK] sushi in a way <unk> there are all kinds in japan they say that sushi is challenging you know the uni is the most challenging so number ten is challenging <unk> people hate number ten like they hate uni actually <unk> [MASK] <unk> the three keys are easy to eat so this is anago <unk> cooked already so easy to eat so enjoy your sushi meal later with the laws of simplicity[MASK] <unk> i have what 's called the cookie versus laundry thing <unk> anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie <unk> which cookie are they going to take [MASK] the big cookie you can say the small cookie has godiva chocolate bits in it but it doesn 't work they want the big cookie <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold the small pile[MASK] or the big pile <unk> which will they choose <unk> strangely not the big pile so i think it 's as simple as this <unk> you know when you want more[MASK] <unk> it 's because you want to enjoy it when you want less <unk> it 's because it 's about work <unk> and so to boil it all down [MASK] simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain i think this is sort of simple more versus less basically [MASK] it always depends [MASK] this book i wrote because i want to figure out life <unk> i love life i love being[MASK] <unk> to see things and so life is a big question i think in simplicity because you 're trying to simplify your life <unk> [MASK] and i just love to see the world the world is an amazing place by being at ted we see so many things at one time[MASK] <unk> and i can 't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world like everything you see every time you wake up it 's such a joy to sort of experience[MASK] everything in the world from everything from a weird hotel lobby to saran wrap placed over your window to this moment where i had my road in front of my house[MASK] <unk> paved dark black and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun <unk> and so this whole thing has struck me as[MASK] exciting to be here because life is finite[MASK] <unk> this was given to me by the chairman of shiseido <unk> he 's an expert in aging this horizontal axis is how old you are twelve years old twenty four years old[MASK] <unk> years old and this is some medical data so brain strength increases up to[MASK] <unk> sixty <unk> and then after sixty <unk> it sort of goes down kind of depressing in a way [MASK] also if you look at your physical strength you know i have a lot of cocky freshmen at mit so i tell them oh your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger but in your late twenties and mid thirties cells they die [MASK] ok it gets them to work harder sometimes <unk> and[MASK] if you have your vision vision is interesting as you age from infant[MASK] age[MASK] <unk> your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties you 're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that [MASK] your social responsibility is very interesting so as you get older you may like have kids whatever and then the kids graduate and you have no responsibility any more that 's very good[MASK]
