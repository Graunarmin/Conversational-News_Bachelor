 <unk> it is said[MASK] that the grass is always greener[MASK] on the other side of the fence <unk> and i believe[MASK] this is true <unk> especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success[MASK] well i can tell you that in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system [MASK] also known as pressure cooker not everyone can do well[MASK] in that environment <unk> while many people responded in different ways about our education system my response[MASK] high pressure environment[MASK] was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building <unk> why bows i[MASK] 'm not quite sure <unk> [MASK] perhaps in the face of constant pressure [MASK] my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows <unk> [MASK] if you think about it[MASK] <unk> bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times [MASK] the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty [MASK] where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves [MASK] in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact the government has planted mulberry trees[MASK] the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there[MASK] nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway[MASK] that has been built around the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight olympics [MASK] the area near these walls <unk> which nobody bothers to pay attention to had been left free from major intervention [MASK] and this is where i first[MASK] <unk> found my treasures [MASK] as i fell deeper into bow making <unk> i began to search far and beyond my neighborhood <unk> [MASK] when i went on school field trips <unk> family vacations or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes <unk> [MASK] i wandered around wooded areas[MASK] and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked[MASK] <unk> inside my school bag <unk> and they would be somethings like saws <unk> knives <unk> sickles and axes[MASK] that i covered up with with a piece of towel <unk> [MASK] i would bring the branches home <unk> riding buses and subways <unk> barely holding them in my hands <unk> and[MASK] i did not bring the tools here to long beach[MASK] <unk> security [MASK] in the privacy of my room <unk> covered in sawdust <unk> i <unk>[MASK] and polish wood all night long[MASK] until a bow took shape <unk> one day <unk> i was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place[MASK] <unk> the rooftop of my apartment building a place where ninety six families call home [MASK] a customer from a department store across from my building called nine hundred and eleven [MASK] and i ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned <unk> [MASK] i want to take this opportunity to tell my mom in the audience today mom <unk> i was really[MASK] and i will be more careful with open fire from now on [MASK] my mother had to do a lot of explaining <unk> telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson <unk> [MASK] i also researched extensively on bows around the world in that[MASK] <unk> i tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow <unk> [MASK] i also worked with many different types of wood such as maple <unk> yew and mulberry [MASK] and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that i mentioned before [MASK] the most effective bow for me would be like this [MASK] <unk> when you draw and shoot the arrow [MASK] two belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight which means more power [MASK] three <unk> sinew used in the outer layer of the limb[MASK] for maximum tension storage and four <unk> horn used to store energy in compression[MASK] after fixing breaking redesigning <unk> mending bending and amending [MASK] my ideal bow began to take shape <unk> and when it was finally done [MASK] it looked like this <unk> [MASK] i was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own[MASK] this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum <unk> and see[MASK] how my bow resembles them [MASK] thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention[MASK] <unk> of my heritage <unk> learning the information that has accumulated over time[MASK] and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice[MASK] any living adults could give me [MASK] you see <unk> i searched far and wide <unk> but never bothered to look close and near [MASK] from this realization <unk> i began to take[MASK] <unk> interest in korean history <unk> which had never inspired me before in the end the grass[MASK] is often greener on my side of the fence <unk> although we don 't realize it <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i am going to show you how my bow works <unk> and[MASK] <unk> a bow may function in a simple mechanism <unk> but in order to make a good bow a great amount of sensitivity is required[MASK] you need to console and communicate with the wood material <unk> each fiber in the wood[MASK] has its own reason and function for being <unk> [MASK] and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow <unk> [MASK] i may be an [ odd ] student with[MASK] <unk> i hope[MASK] i am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you [MASK] my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind where everyone is needed[MASK] exactly where they are like the fibers and the tendons in a bow [MASK] a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is[MASK] <unk> the bow resembles me <unk> and i resemble the bow now <unk> i am shooting a part of myself to you [MASK] no better yet a part of my mind has just been shot over to
