 <unk> few weeks ago a friend of mine gave this toy car to his 8 year old son <unk> but instead of going into a store[MASK] and buying one like we do normally he went to this website and he downloaded a file <unk> and then he printed it on this printer[MASK] so this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines[MASK] is something that the economist magazine defined as the third industrial revolution [MASK] actually <unk> i argue that there is another revolution going on and it 's the one that has to do with open source hardware and the maker 's movement <unk> because[MASK] the printer that my friend used to print the toy[MASK] is actually[MASK] <unk> so you go to the same website you can download all the files that you need in order to make[MASK] that printer <unk> the construction files the hardware <unk> the software all the instruction is there [MASK] and also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers and there 's a lot of innovation happening because it 's all[MASK] <unk> don 't need anybody 's permission to create something great [MASK] and that space is like the personal computer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six like the apples with the other companies are fighting and we will see in a few years there will be the apple of this kind of market come out well[MASK] there 's also another[MASK] interesting thing[MASK] i said the electronics are open source because at the heart of this printer there is something i 'm really attached to these arduino boards the motherboard that sort of powers this printer [MASK] is a project i 've been working on for the past seven years it 's an open source project i worked with[MASK] with these friends of mine that i have here so the five of us two americans two italians[MASK] and a spaniard we you know <unk> it 's a[MASK] <unk> so we came together[MASK] in this design institute called the interaction design institute ivrea <unk> [MASK] which was teaching interaction design this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object[MASK] and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things [MASK] well when you design an object that 's supposed to interact with a human being if you make a foam model of a mobile phone <unk> it doesn 't make any sense you have to have something that actually interacts[MASK] <unk> worked on arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use so that our students could just build things that worked but they don 't have five years to become an electronics engineer we have one month [MASK] so how do i make something that even a kid can use and actually with arduino we have kids like sylvia that you see here that actually make projects with arduino[MASK] <unk> kids stop me and show me stuff they built for arduino that 's[MASK] really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them[MASK] the tools <unk> so let 's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly so one of the examples that i like to sort of kick off this[MASK] discussion is is this example of this cat feeder <unk> the gentleman who made this project had two cats one was sick and the other one was healthy[MASK] <unk> so he had to make sure they ate the proper food so he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip[MASK] mounted inside on the collar of the cat and opens the door and the cat can eat the food this is made by recycling an old cd player that you can get from an old computer some cardboard tape [MASK] couple of sensors a few blinking leds and then suddenly you have a tool you build something that you cannot find on the market[MASK] <unk> like this phrase scratch your own itch if you have an idea you just go and you make it this is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics [MASK] so one of the features that i think is important about our work is that[MASK] our hardware on top of being made with love in italy as you can see from the back of the circuit is that[MASK] it 's open <unk> so we publish all the design files[MASK] <unk> for the circuit online <unk> so you can download it[MASK] and you can actually use it to make something or to modify to learn you know [MASK] when i was learning about programming i learned by looking at other people 's code or looking at other people 's circuits in magazines and this is[MASK] a good way to learn by looking at other people 's work <unk> so the different elements of the project are all open so the hardware is released with a creative commons license[MASK] <unk> so you know i like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon like it was a song or a poem with creative commons [MASK] or the software is gpl so it 's open source as well <unk> the documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the creative commons[MASK] <unk> just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is arduino and what isn 't now[MASK] arduino itself is made of a lot of different[MASK] open source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a 12 year old kid <unk> so arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies[MASK] where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly <unk> so you have situations like this where[MASK] some people in chile decided to make[MASK] <unk> their own boards instead of buying them to organize a workshop and to save money [MASK] or there are companies that make their own variations of arduino that fit in a certain market <unk> and there 's probably <unk> maybe like a one hundred and fifty of them or something at the moment [MASK] this one is made[MASK] by a company called adafruit <unk> which is run by this woman called limor fried also known as ladyada who is one of the[MASK] <unk> heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement so this idea that you have a new sort of[MASK] diy community that believes in open source in collaboration <unk> collaborates online collaborates in different spaces [MASK] there is this magazine called make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community and you see a very technical project explained[MASK] <unk> in a very simple language beautifully typeset <unk> [MASK] or you have websites like this one like instructables [MASK] where people actually teach each other about anything so this one is about arduino projects the page you see on the screen but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake[MASK] and everything else so[MASK] let 's look at some projects <unk> so this one is a quadcopter <unk> it 's a small model helicopter in a way it 's a toy[MASK] and so this one was military technology a few years ago and now it 's open source easy to use you can buy it online <unk> diy drones is the community they do this thing called arducopter <unk> [MASK] but then somebody actually launched this start up called matternet where they figured out that you could use this to actually[MASK] transport things from one village to another in africa and the fact that this was easy to find open source easy to hack enabled them[MASK] <unk> to prototype their company really quickly or other projects matt richardson i 'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on tv over and over and over again <unk> so i decided to do something about it [MASK] this arduino project which i call the enough already will mute the tv anytime any of these[MASK] <unk> our producers caught up with kim kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her mb eh mr it should do a[MASK] pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of kim kardashian 's wedding mb [MASK] okay so you know <unk> again what is interesting here is that matt found this module[MASK] <unk> lets arduino process tv signals he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the tv put it together and then created this great project it[MASK] 's also used arduino 's used in serious places like you know the large hadron collider there 's some arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters <unk> [MASK] <unk> so this is a musical[MASK] interface built by a student from italy[MASK] <unk> and he 's now turning this into a product <unk> because it was a student project becoming a product[MASK] or it can be used to make an assistive device this is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds[MASK] <unk> and writes the words that you 're signing on a display and again this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell <unk>[MASK] <unk> parts and you assemble it into a a project <unk> or this is a project from the itp part of nyu where they met with this boy who has a severe disability cannot play with the ps3 so they built this device[MASK] that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited[MASK] <unk> or you can find it in arts projects so this is the txtbomber <unk> so you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall [MASK] and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans <unk> so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages[MASK] <unk> module in the plant <unk> and it 's measuring the well being of the plant and it 's creating a twitter account where you can actually[MASK] interact with the plant so you know <unk> this plant will start to say this is really hot or there 's a lot of[MASK] <unk> baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks [MASK] or this is a 14 year old kid in chile who made a system that detects earthquakes and publishes on twitter he has two hundred and eighty thousand followers he 's fourteen and he anticipated a governmental project by one year [MASK] applause or[MASK] <unk> another project where by analyzing the twitter feed of a family you can basically point where they are like in the harry potter movie <unk> [MASK] so you can find out everything about this project on on the website <unk> [MASK] or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts [MASK] it 's interesting how in two thousand and nine gizmodo basically defined said that this project actually gives a meaning to twitter so it[MASK] <unk> so very serious project when the fukushima disaster happened [MASK] a bunch of people in japan they realized that the information that the government was giving wasn 't really open and really reliable so they built this geiger counter <unk> plus arduino plus network <unk>[MASK] <unk> interface they made one hundred of them and gave them to people around japan <unk> and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called cosm another website they built [MASK] <unk> information from the field and you can get unbiased information <unk> or this machine here it 's from the diy bio movement[MASK] and it 's one of the steps that you need in order to process dna and again it 's completely open source from the ground up <unk> [MASK] or you have students in developing countries making[MASK] replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make actually they just build[MASK] <unk> them themselves for a lot less using arduino and a few parts this is a ph probe <unk> [MASK] or you get kids like these kids they 're from spain they learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably like eleven <unk> and then they started to use arduino to make these robots that play football they became world champions by making an arduino based robot [MASK] and so when we had to make our own educational robot we just went to them and said you know you design it because you know[MASK] <unk> exactly what is[MASK] needed to make a great robot that excites kids not me i 'm an old guy what am i supposed to excite huh but as i[MASK] in terms of educational assets there 's also companies like google that are using the technology[MASK] to create interfaces between mobile phones tablets and the real world so the accessory development kit from google[MASK] <unk> based on arduino as opposed to the one from apple which is[MASK] sign your life to apple here you are there 's a giant maze and joey 's sitting there and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet [MASK] also i come from italy and the design is important in italy and yet very[MASK] <unk> so we worked with a design studio called habits in milan to make this mirror which is completely open source this doubles also as an ipod[MASK] speaker <unk> so the idea is that the[MASK] hardware <unk> the software the design of the object the fabrication everything about this project is open source and you can make it yourself <unk> [MASK] so we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great[MASK] devices to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real <unk> but when you have this[MASK] <unk> idea <unk> [MASK] you know what happens to all these ideas there 's like thousands of ideas that i you know it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations [MASK] i will not take all the seven hours <unk> [MASK] thank you but let 's start from this example so the group of people that started this company called pebble they prototyped a watch that[MASK] <unk> via bluetooth with your phone and you can display information on it and they prototyped with an old lcd screen from a nokia mobile phone[MASK] and an arduino and then when they had a final project they actually went to kickstarter and they were asking for one hundred thousand dollars[MASK] to make a few of them to sell <unk> they got ten million dollars <unk> they got a completely fully funded start up and they don 't have[MASK] <unk> get vcs involved or anything just excite the people with their great project <unk> [MASK] the last project i want to show you is this it 's called ardusat it 's currently on kickstarter so if you want to contribute <unk> please do it <unk> [MASK] it 's a satellite that goes into space which is probably the least open source thing you can imagine <unk> [MASK] and it contains an arduino connected to a bunch of sensors so if you know how to use arduino you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite[MASK] and run them so imagine <unk> if you as a high[MASK] <unk> school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite satellite space experiments[MASK] like that [MASK] so as i said there 's lots of examples and i 'm going to stop here <unk> and i just want to thank the arduino community for being the best <unk> and just every day making lots of[MASK] <unk> you told me earlier today that you had no idea of course that it would take off like this mb no ca i mean how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you 've unlocked <unk>[MASK] <unk> lot of people so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff and i just feel overwhelmed <unk> it 's just it 's[MASK] difficult to describe this every morning i wake up and i look at all the stuff that google alerts sends me [MASK] and it 's just amazing it 's just going into every field that you can imagine[MASK]
