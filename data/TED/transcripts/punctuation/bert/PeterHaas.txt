 <unk> i learned about the haiti earthquake by skype my wife sent me a message[MASK] <unk> across the u s felt i was afraid of a tsunami <unk> what i didn 't realize was there was a greater terror[MASK] in haiti <unk> and that was building collapse[MASK] <unk> we 've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in haiti [MASK] these are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake while i was making my way through the d r into[MASK] <unk> the country this[MASK] is the national palace the equivalent of the white house this is the largest supermarket in the caribbean[MASK] at peak shopping time[MASK] <unk> this is a nurses ' college[MASK] there are three hundred nurses studying the general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed[MASK] this is the ministry of economics and finance <unk> [MASK] we have all heard about the tremendous human loss[MASK] in the earthquake in haiti <unk> [MASK] but we haven 't heard enough about why all those lives were lost <unk> we haven 't heard about why the buildings failed[MASK] <unk> after all it was the buildings not the earthquake that killed two hundred and twenty thousand people [MASK] that injured three hundred and thirty thousand [MASK] that displaced one point three million people [MASK] that cut off food and water and supplies[MASK] <unk> and it was not a natural disaster[MASK] it was a disaster of engineering[MASK] aidg has worked in haiti since two thousand and seven[MASK] <unk> providing engineering and business support to small businesses <unk> and after the quake we started bringing in earthquake engineers[MASK] to figure out why[MASK] <unk> the buildings collapsed to examine what was safe and what wasn 't [MASK] working with minustah <unk> which is the u n mission in haiti [MASK] with the ministry of public works with different ngos <unk> we inspected over one thousand five hundred buildings <unk> [MASK] we inspected schools and private residencies <unk> we inspected medical centers and food warehouses[MASK] <unk> we inspected government buildings this is the ministry of justice <unk> behind that door is the national judicial archives [MASK] the fellow in the door <unk> andre filitrault who 's the[MASK] director of the center for interdisciplinary earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives[MASK] <unk> told me after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way that there is no new research here [MASK] there is nothing here that we don 't know the failure points were the same [MASK] walls and slabs not tied properly into columns that 's a roof slab hanging off the building[MASK] cantilevered structures[MASK] <unk> structures that were asymmetric that shook violently and came down <unk> [MASK] poor building materials not enough concrete not enough compression in the blocks [MASK] rebar that was smooth <unk> [MASK] rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away <unk> now there 's a solution to all these problems <unk> [MASK] and we know[MASK] <unk> how to build properly the proof of this came[MASK] in chile <unk> almost a month later <unk> when eight point eight magnitude earthquake[MASK] hit chile <unk> that is five hundred times the power of the seven point zero[MASK] that hit port au prince five hundred times the power yet only under[MASK] <unk> a thousand casualties <unk> [MASK] adjusted for population density that is less than one percent of the impact of the haitian quake <unk> [MASK] what was the difference between chile and haiti <unk> [MASK] seismic standards and confined masonry[MASK] <unk> acts as a whole walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together[MASK] to support each other[MASK] instead of breaking off into separate members and failing [MASK] if you look at this building in chile <unk> [MASK] it 's ripped in half but it 's not a pile of rubble <unk> [MASK] chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades right[MASK] <unk> now aidg is working with kpff consulting engineers architecture for humanity to bring more confined masonry training[MASK] into haiti <unk> [MASK] this is xantus daniel <unk> he 's a mason just a general construction worker not a foreman who took one of our[MASK] <unk> on his last job he was working with his boss and they started pouring the columns wrong[MASK] <unk> he took his boss aside and he showed him the materials on confined masonry [MASK] he showed him you know we don 't have to do this wrong <unk> it won 't cost us any more to do it the right way [MASK] and they redid that building they tied the rebar right they poured the columns[MASK] <unk> and that building will be safe and every building that they build going forward[MASK] will be safe to make sure these buildings are safe it 's not going to take policy[MASK] it 's going to take reaching out[MASK] to the masons on the ground[MASK] and helping them learn the proper techniques now there are many groups doing this and the fellow in the vest there[MASK] <unk> craig toten <unk> [MASK] he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this [MASK] through haiti rewired through build change architecture for humanity <unk>[MASK] there is the possibility to reach out[MASK] to thirty thousand forty thousand masons across the country and create a[MASK] <unk> movement of proper building [MASK] if you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it 's extremely affordable [MASK] for the billions spent[MASK] on reconstruction you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime[MASK] <unk> there are two ways that you can rebuild haiti [MASK] the way at the top is the way that haiti 's been building for decades <unk> the way at the top[MASK] is a poorly constructed building that will fail the way at the bottom is a confined masonry building where the walls are tied together the building[MASK] <unk> and it will stand up to an earthquake for all the disaster there is an opportunity here[MASK] to build better houses for the next generation <unk> so that when the next earthquake hits it[MASK] is a disaster but not a tragedy[MASK]
