 <unk> half a century of trying to help prevent wars there 's one question[MASK] that never leaves me how do we deal with extreme violence without using[MASK] <unk> when you 're faced with brutality whether it 's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence[MASK] or on the streets of syria today facing tanks and shrapnel [MASK] what 's the most effective thing to do fight back give in [MASK] use more force this[MASK] <unk> how do i deal with a bully[MASK] without becoming a thug in return has been with me ever since i was a child <unk> i remember[MASK] i was about thirteen <unk> glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room[MASK] as soviet tanks[MASK] rolled into budapest <unk> and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down[MASK] <unk> and i rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase <unk> and my mother came up and said what on earth are you doing and i said i 'm going to budapest [MASK] and she said what on earth for and i said kids are getting killed there there 's something terrible happening and she said don 't be so silly [MASK] and i started to cry <unk> [MASK] and she got it she said okay i see it 's serious[MASK] much too young to help you need training i 'll help you but just unpack your suitcase [MASK] and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s [MASK] but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn 't get from training courses <unk> [MASK] i wanted to understand how violence how oppression[MASK] works and what i 've discovered since[MASK] is this [MASK] bullies use violence in three ways they use political violence[MASK] to intimidate physical violence to terrorize[MASK] and mental or emotional violence[MASK] <unk> to undermine [MASK] and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence <unk> [MASK] nelson mandela[MASK] went to jail believing in violence and twenty seven years later[MASK] he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills[MASK] <unk> the incredible skills that they needed[MASK] to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy <unk> [MASK] and they did it in a total devotion to non violence [MASK] they realized[MASK] that[MASK] using force against[MASK] <unk> does work [MASK] over time i 've collected about a half dozen methods that do work of course there are many more that do work and that are effective [MASK] and the first is that the change that has to take place has to take[MASK] place here inside me it 's my[MASK] <unk> my attitude to oppression that i 've got control over and that i can do something about and what i need to develop is <unk>[MASK] to do that that means i need to know how i tick <unk> when i collapse <unk> where my[MASK] formidable points are where my weaker points are when do i give[MASK] <unk> not the only one it 's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power[MASK] <unk> and my heroine here like satish 's is aung san suu kyi in burma [MASK] she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon[MASK] <unk> came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns <unk> and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers[MASK] were more scared than the student protesters behind her but she told the students to sit down <unk> and she walked[MASK] forward with such calm and such clarity[MASK] and such total lack of fear[MASK] that she could walk right up to the first gun put her hand on it[MASK] and lower it [MASK] and no one got killed[MASK] so that 's what the mastery of fear can do not only faced with[MASK] <unk> machine guns but if you if you meet a knife fight in the street but we have to practice <unk> so what about our fear <unk> [MASK] i have a little mantra [MASK] my fear[MASK] grows fat on the energy i feed it and if it grows very big it probably happens so[MASK] <unk> we all know the three o 'clock in the morning syndrome <unk> when something you 've been worrying about wakes you up i see a lot of people[MASK] and[MASK] for an hour you toss and turn it gets worse and worse and by four o 'clock[MASK] you 're pinned to the pillow[MASK] by a monster this big the only thing to do is to get up make a cup of tea and sit down[MASK] <unk> the fear like a child beside you <unk> [MASK] you 're the adult the fear is the child and you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants what it needs [MASK] how can this be[MASK] made[MASK] better how can the child feel stronger <unk> and you make a plan[MASK] <unk> now we 're going back to sleep half past seven we 're getting up and that 's what we 're going to do [MASK] i had one of these three <unk> a m episodes on sunday[MASK] paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you [MASK] so i did the thing i got up made the cup of tea <unk> sat down with it did it all and i 'm here[MASK] <unk> that 's fear what about anger wherever there is[MASK] injustice there 's anger <unk> [MASK] but anger is like gasoline <unk> and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match you 've got an inferno <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] anger as an engine in an engine is powerful if we can put our anger inside[MASK] <unk> inside an engine it can drive us forward it can get us through the dreadful moments[MASK] and it can give us real inner power <unk> and i learned this[MASK] in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were[MASK] <unk> exposing us to[MASK] that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong <unk> totally ineffective in order to develop[MASK] a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger it 's okay to be angry with[MASK] the the thing the nuclear weapons in this case but it is hopeless to be angry with the[MASK] <unk> they are human beings just like us and they 're doing what they think is best and that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them <unk> [MASK] so that 's the third one anger <unk> and it brings me to the crux[MASK] of what 's going on or what i perceive as going on in the world today which is that[MASK] last century was top down power it was still governments telling people what to do [MASK] this century there 's a shift it[MASK] 's bottom up or grassroots power it 's like mushrooms coming through concrete <unk> [MASK] it 's people joining up with people as bundy just said miles away[MASK] to[MASK] bring about change <unk> and[MASK] peace direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do[MASK] <unk> they know best what to do so peace direct gets behind them to do that and the kind of thing they 're doing is[MASK] demobilizing militias <unk> rebuilding economies <unk> resettling refugees[MASK] <unk> even liberating child[MASK] <unk> they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this <unk> and[MASK] what they 've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only[MASK] less humane but it 's less effective than using methods that connect people with people that rebuild[MASK] and i think that the u s military is finally beginning to get this [MASK] up to now their <unk>[MASK] policy[MASK] has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost <unk> and if civilians get in the way that 's written as[MASK] and this is so infuriating and[MASK] humiliating for the population of afghanistan [MASK] that it makes the recruitment for al qaeda very easy <unk> when people are so disgusted by for example the burning of the koran [MASK] so the training of the troops has to change <unk> and i think[MASK] <unk> signs that it is beginning to change the british military have always been much better at this but there is[MASK] one magnificent example for them to take their cue from and that 's a brilliant[MASK] u s lieutenant colonel called chris hughes <unk> and he was leading his men[MASK] down the streets of najaf[MASK] in iraq actually[MASK] and suddenly people were[MASK] pouring out of the houses on either side of the road screaming <unk> yelling <unk> furiously angry and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified <unk> [MASK] didn 't know what was going on couldn 't speak arabic <unk> [MASK] and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his[MASK] <unk> and these[MASK] huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor <unk> wobbled to the ground <unk> [MASK] and complete silence fell [MASK] and after about two minutes everybody[MASK] moved aside and went home now[MASK] that to me is[MASK] <unk> wisdom in action in the moment that 's what he did [MASK] and it 's happening[MASK] everywhere now you don 't believe me have you asked yourselves[MASK] why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last thirty years[MASK] <unk> dictatorships in czechoslovakia <unk> east germany[MASK] <unk> and this hasn 't just happened [MASK] a lot of it[MASK] is due to a book written by an 80 year old man in boston gene sharp [MASK] he wrote a book called from dictatorship to democracy[MASK] <unk> the world and it 's being used by young people and older people everywhere[MASK] because it works and it 's effective <unk> [MASK] so this is what gives me hope not just hope this is what makes me feel very positive right now[MASK] <unk> beings are getting it we 're[MASK] getting practical <unk> [MASK] doable methodologies to answer my question how do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug [MASK] we 're using the kind of skills that i 've outlined[MASK] <unk> recognizing and working with our fear using anger as a fuel <unk> [MASK] cooperating with others <unk> banding together with others <unk> courage [MASK] and most importantly <unk> commitment[MASK] to active[MASK] have to believe in it i see evidence everywhere of how it works and[MASK] i see that we <unk> ordinary people can do what aung san suu kyi and ghandi[MASK] and mandela did we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known[MASK] and we can organize to overcome oppression[MASK] by opening our hearts as well as[MASK] strengthening this incredible resolve <unk> and <unk>[MASK] <unk> this open heartedness is exactly what i 've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since i got here yesterday <unk> thank you[MASK]
