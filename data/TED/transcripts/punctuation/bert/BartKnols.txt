 <unk> hate them don 't you <unk> [MASK] that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy [MASK] knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood <unk> [MASK] that 's awful right <unk> in fact <unk> there 's only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitos [MASK] when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife[MASK] but that 's fascinating right <unk> why[MASK] does she receive more bites than i do <unk> and the answer is smell the smell of her body <unk> [MASK] and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin[MASK] that either attract or repel mosquitos some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than i do[MASK] <unk> i just stink more than she does[MASK] <unk> either way mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us [MASK] and during my ph d i wanted to know exactly[MASK] what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used african malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night and there[MASK] 's a whole range of compounds that they do use and this was not going to be an easy task[MASK] and therefore we set up various experiments <unk> [MASK] why did we set up these experiments <unk> because half the world 's population runs the risk of contracting[MASK] a killer disease like malaria[MASK] through a simple mosquito bite [MASK] every thirty seconds <unk> somewhere on this planet a child dies of malaria <unk> and paul levy this morning he was talking about the metaphor of the seven[MASK] <unk> united states well in africa <unk> we have the equivalent of seven jumbo <unk>[MASK] crashing every day <unk> [MASK] but perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps bait it with our smell <unk> we may be able to stop transmission of disease <unk> [MASK] now solving this puzzle was not an easy[MASK] <unk> because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments[MASK] that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed[MASK] that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body <unk> strange so we set up an experiment[MASK] whereby we put a naked volunteer[MASK] in a large cage and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person <unk> and we found some remarkable[MASK] <unk> differences on the left here you see the bites[MASK] by the dutch malarial mosquito on this person <unk> they had a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the african malarial mosquito[MASK] had a very strong preference for biting the ankles[MASK] and feet of this person <unk> and that of course we should have known all along[MASK] <unk> and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature[MASK] that said that cheese smells after feet[MASK] rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried[MASK] <unk> with a tiny little piece[MASK] of limburger cheese <unk> which smells badly after feet to attract african malaria mosquitos and you know what it worked [MASK] in fact <unk> it worked so well[MASK] that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of limburger cheese[MASK] that we 're using in tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos[MASK] <unk> than humans <unk> [MASK] limburg <unk> be proud of your cheese [MASK] as it is now used in the fight against malaria [MASK] that 's the cheese just to show you [MASK] my second story[MASK] is remarkable as well <unk> it 's about man 's best friend it 's about dogs[MASK] <unk> and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria [MASK] one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults[MASK] and bite people and transmit disease <unk> it 's to kill them when they 're still in the water[MASK] as larvae <unk> why because they are just like the cia in that pool of water these larvae[MASK] <unk> are concentrated they 're all together there they are immobile they can 't escape from that water they can 't fly[MASK] and they 're accessible you can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there right <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools of water with the larvae they are scattered all over the place[MASK] <unk> it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides <unk> [MASK] and last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem <unk> [MASK] until we realized that just like us we have a unique smell <unk> that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell <unk> [MASK] and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae[MASK] <unk> put it on pieces of cloth <unk> and then did something very remarkable [MASK] here we have a bar with four holes <unk> and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole ooh that was very quick <unk> [MASK] and then you see the dog it 's called tweed it 's a border collie he 's examining these holes and now he 's got it already <unk> [MASK] he 's going back to check the control holes again <unk> but he 's coming back to the first one <unk> and now he 's locking into that smell <unk> which means that now we can use dogs[MASK] <unk> with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria [MASK] this lady is ellen van der zweep she 's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more [MASK] since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites[MASK] smell different compared to people that are uninfected she 's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite[MASK] that means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way <unk> and there 's few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give the final blow to malaria <unk> [MASK] man 's best friend in the fight against malaria [MASK] my third story is perhaps even more remarkable <unk> and i should say <unk> has never been shown to the public until today[MASK] <unk> yeah <unk> it 's a crazy story <unk> but i believe it 's perhaps the best[MASK] and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos[MASK] <unk> and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos <unk> and the answer[MASK] i have right here[MASK] in my pocket[MASK] <unk> if i get it it 's a tablet a simple tablet <unk> and when i take it with water[MASK] <unk> here in this box i have a cage[MASK] with several hundred hungry female mosquitos[MASK] that i 'm just about to release [MASK] just kidding <unk> just kidding what i 'm going to show you is i 'm gonna stick my arm into it[MASK] and i will show you how quickly they will bite[MASK] don 't worry i do this all the time in the lab there we go [MASK] now on the video [MASK] on the video here [MASK] i 'm going to show you exactly the same thing except that what i 'm showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet have a look [MASK] that doesn 't work[MASK] <unk> sorry about that [MASK] i 'm sticking in my arm i 'm giving them a big juicy blood meal i 'm shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion [MASK] and three hours later[MASK] what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos [MASK] very dead mosquitos <unk> and i 'm going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitos[MASK] <unk> don 't kill us we kill <unk>[MASK] now[MASK] maastricht <unk>[MASK] <unk> be prepared[MASK] <unk> now think of what we can do with this we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito born diseases of epidemics [MASK] right <unk> [MASK] and better still imagine what would happen if in a very large area <unk> everyone would take these drugs this drug for just three weeks <unk> [MASK] that would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease[MASK]
