 <unk> in new york and i 've been working in advertising for ever since i left school so about seven eight years now <unk> and it was draining <unk> i worked a lot of late nights <unk> i worked a lot of[MASK] <unk> i found myself never having time for all the projects that i wanted to work on on my own [MASK] and one day i was at work and i saw a talk by stefan sagmeister on ted and it was called the power of time off and he spoke about how[MASK] every seven years he takes a year off from work so he could[MASK] do his own creative projects and i was instantly inspired and i just said i have to do that i have to take a year off [MASK] i need to take time to travel and and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas[MASK] so the first of those projects[MASK] ended up being something i called one second every day basically i 'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life <unk> [MASK] chronologically compiling these <unk> one second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video[MASK] <unk> i can 't record them anymore [MASK] the purpose of this project is one <unk> i hate not remembering things that i 've done in the past <unk> [MASK] there 's all these things that i 've done with my life that i have no recollection of unless someone brings it up and sometimes i think oh yeah [MASK] that 's something that i[MASK] did and something that i realized early on in the project was that[MASK] if i wasn 't doing anything interesting i would probably forget to record the video so[MASK] the day the first time that i forgot <unk> it really hurt me because it 's something that i really wanted to from the moment that i turned thirty i wanted to keep this project going until[MASK] forever and having missed that one second i realized <unk> it just kind of created this thing in my head where i never forgot ever again <unk> [MASK] <unk> so if i live to see eighty years of age <unk> i 'm going to have a five hour video[MASK] that encapsulates fifty years of my life when i turn forty i 'll have a one hour video that includes just my <unk>[MASK] this has really invigorated me day to day when i wake up to try and do something interesting with my day[MASK] <unk> one of the things that i have issues with is that as the days[MASK] and weeks and months go by time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and you know <unk> [MASK] i hated that and[MASK] <unk> this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that i 've done [MASK] even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day <unk> [MASK] it 's difficult sometimes to pick that one second on a good day i 'll have maybe three or four seconds that i really[MASK] <unk> want to choose but i 'll just have to narrow it down to one <unk> but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway [MASK] it 's also kind of a protest a personal protest <unk> against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert and they 're disturbing you they 're not even enjoying the show they 're watching the concert[MASK] <unk> i hate that i admittedly used to be that guy a little bit back in the day <unk> and i 've decided that the best way[MASK] for me to still capture and keep[MASK] a visual memory of my life and not be that person is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of yeah that concert was amazing i really loved that concert and it just takes a quick [MASK] quick second [MASK] i was on a[MASK] three month road trip this summer it was something that i 've been dreaming about doing my whole life just driving around the u s and canada and[MASK] just figuring out where to go the next day and it was was kind of outstanding <unk> [MASK] i actually ran out <unk> i spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that i had to take my year off so i[MASK] <unk> i went to seattle and i spent some time with friends working on a really neat project[MASK] one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family and[MASK] this really tragic thing happened where my sister in law her intestine suddenly strangled one day <unk> and[MASK] we took her to the emergency room <unk> and she was[MASK] she was in really bad shape we almost almost lost her a couple of times and i was there with my brother every day <unk> [MASK] it helped me realize something else during this project is that[MASK] recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult <unk> it 's not we tend to take our cameras out when[MASK] awesome things or we 're oh yeah this party let me take a picture but we rarely do that when we 're having a bad day and something horrible is happening[MASK] <unk> and i found that it 's actually been very very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment[MASK] it really helps you appreciate the good times <unk> it 's not always a good day <unk> so[MASK] when you have a bad one[MASK] <unk> it 's important to remember it just as much as it is important to remember the [ good ] days [MASK] now one of the things that i do is i don 't use any filters i don 't use anything to[MASK] i started a rule of first person perspective <unk> early on i think i had a couple of videos where you would[MASK] see me in it but i realized that wasn 't the way to go the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it[MASK] <unk> now a couple of things that i have in my head about this project are wouldn 't it be interesting if[MASK] thousands of people were doing this i turned thirty one last week which is there <unk> [MASK] i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this i think everyone would have a different interpretation of it <unk> i think everyone would benefit from just having that one second[MASK] <unk> to remember every day <unk> personally i 'm tired of[MASK] forgetting and this is a really easy thing to do i mean we all have hd capable cameras in our pockets right now most people in this room i bet[MASK] and it 's something that 's <unk> i never want to forget another day that i 've ever lived and this is my way of doing that and it 'd be really interesting also to[MASK] <unk> if you could just type in on a website june eighteen <unk> two thousand and[MASK] eighteen and you would just see a stream of people 's lives on that particular day from all over the world and[MASK] i don 't know i think this project has a lot of possibilities and i encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day so you can never forget that[MASK]
