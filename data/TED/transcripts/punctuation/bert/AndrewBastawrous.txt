 <unk> million people in the world who are blind eighty percent of them[MASK] are living in <unk> low income countries such as kenya <unk> and the absolute majority[MASK] do not need to be blind they are blind from diseases that are either completely[MASK] <unk> curable or preventable <unk> [MASK] knowing this with my young family we moved to kenya <unk> we secured equipment <unk> funds <unk> vehicles <unk> we trained a team <unk> [MASK] we set up a hundred clinics throughout the great rift valley[MASK] to try and understand a single question why are people going[MASK] <unk> and what can we do [MASK] the challenges were great <unk> [MASK] when we got to where we were going we set up our high tech equipment [MASK] power was rarely available we 'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators <unk> [MASK] and then something occurred to me there has to be an easier way <unk> [MASK] because it 's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it [MASK] more people in kenya <unk> and in[MASK] have access to a mobile phone than they do clean running water <unk> so we said could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way[MASK] and so we developed peek a smartphone [ system ] that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere <unk> [MASK] we set about replacing traditional hospital equipment <unk> which is bulky expensive and fragile[MASK] <unk> smartphone apps and hardware[MASK] that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age [MASK] here we have a demonstration of a three month old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker[MASK] we 've got many trials going on in the community and in schools <unk> and through the lessons that we 've learned in the field we[MASK] <unk> realized it 's extremely important to share the data in non medical jargon so that people understand[MASK] what we 're examining and what that means to them <unk> so here for example we use our sight sim application once your vision has been measured to show carers[MASK] and teachers[MASK] what the visual world is like for that person so they can empathize with them and help them once we 've discovered somebody has low vision the next[MASK] <unk> big challenge is to work out why and to[MASK] be able to do that we need to have access to the inside of the eye <unk> [MASK] traditionally this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina the retina is the single part of the eye that has[MASK] huge amounts of information about the body and its health <unk> we 've developed[MASK] <unk> hardware that comes in at less than five dollars to produce <unk> which can then be clipped onto a[MASK] <unk> smartphone and makes it possible to get views of the back of the eye of a very high quality <unk> and the beauty is anybody can do it [MASK] in our trials on over two and half thousand people [MASK] the smartphone with the add on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport <unk> [MASK] when we first moved to kenya we went with one hundred and fifty thousand dollars of equipment[MASK] <unk> a team of fifteen people and that was what was needed to deliver health care now all that 's needed[MASK] is a single person on a bike[MASK] with a smartphone and it costs just five hundred dollars [MASK] the issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar our healthcare workers travel with a solar powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and[MASK] <unk> backed up now we go to the patient[MASK] rather than waiting for the patient never to come[MASK] <unk> we go to them in their homes[MASK] and we give them the most comprehensive high tech accurate examination which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training <unk> [MASK] we can link global experts with people in the most rural[MASK] <unk> places that are beyond the end of the road <unk> effectively putting those experts in their homes <unk> allowing us to make diagnoses and make plans for treatment <unk> [MASK] project managers hospital directors are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in here in nakuru where i 've been living we can search <unk>[MASK] <unk> for people by whatever condition here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract <unk> [MASK] <unk> each red pin depicts somebody[MASK] who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable <unk> and they 're locatable we can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we 're coming to arrange a treatment what[MASK] 's more we 've learned that this is something that we haven 't built just for the community but with the community [MASK] those blue pins that drop represent elders or local leaders that are connected to those people who can ensure[MASK] <unk> that we can find them and arrange treatment <unk> [MASK] so for patients like mama wangari who have been blind for over ten years and never seen her grandchildren <unk> for less than forty dollars we can restore her eyesight <unk> [MASK] this is something that has to happen it[MASK] 's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions [MASK] the reality is everyone goes blind on their own <unk> [MASK] but now they might just be a text message away from help[MASK] now because live demos are always a bad idea to try a live demo [MASK] so here we have the peek vision app okay [MASK] and what we 're looking at here[MASK] <unk> this is sam 's optic nerve which is a direct extension of her brain so i 'm actually looking at her brain as we look there we can see all parts of the retina [MASK] it makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body[MASK] that would not be possible without access to the eye and that clip on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars <unk> and people can be cured of blindness and i think it says a lot about us[MASK] as a human race if we 've developed cures and we don 't deliver them but now we can thank you[MASK]
