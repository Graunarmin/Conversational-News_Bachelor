 <unk> you know cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy for students it 's quite an experience [MASK] but for a school <unk> it could be very difficult[MASK] or expensive to maintain <unk> so we learned the[MASK] <unk> majority of anatomic classes taught [MASK] they do not have a cadaver dissection lab <unk> [MASK] maybe those reasons <unk> or depending on where you are cadavers may not be easily available <unk> so to address this [MASK] we developed with a dr brown in stanford <unk> [MASK] virtual dissection table[MASK] <unk> so with this anatomage table students can experience[MASK] the dissection without a human cadaver and the table form is important and since <unk>[MASK] just like the way they do dissections in the lab or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact[MASK] <unk> with your table our digital body[MASK] is one to one life size <unk> [MASK] so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy i[MASK] 'm going to do[MASK] some demonstrations <unk> as you can see[MASK] <unk> i use my finger to interact with my digital body[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to do some cuts i can cut any way i want to so i cut right here <unk> [MASK] then it 's going to show inside [MASK] and i can change my cut to see different parts <unk> [MASK] maybe i can cut there see the brain[MASK] <unk> and i can change my cut you can see some internal organs[MASK] <unk> so we call this[MASK] the slicer mode <unk> [MASK] <unk> going to do another cut [MASK] right there [MASK] this shows a lot of internal structures[MASK] <unk> so if i want to see the back side i can flip[MASK] and see from behind [MASK] <unk> images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you that means[MASK] we did the right job <unk> [MASK] so our doctors said these are eye candies[MASK] <unk> so instead of just butchering the body <unk> i 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to peel off all the skin[MASK] <unk> muscles and bones <unk> just to see a few internal organs <unk> [MASK] right here <unk> [MASK] let 's say[MASK] i 'm going to cut the liver right here[MASK] <unk> let 's say i 'm interested in looking at the heart <unk> i 'm going to do some surgery here[MASK] <unk> going to make a cut right there <unk> [MASK] and then you can see the inside of the heart you can see the atrium and the ventricles how blood flows to our[MASK] <unk> and veins[MASK] <unk> just like this students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to [MASK] it doesn 't have to be always dissection since it 's digital we can do reverse dissection [MASK] so let me show you i 'm going to start with the skeletal structure and i can add a few internal organs[MASK] yep maybe i can add quickly this way [MASK] and i can build muscles gradually just[MASK] like that we can see tendons and muscles [MASK] wish i could build my muscle this fast[MASK] <unk> way to[MASK] learn anatomy another thing i can show you is more often than not doctors get to meet patients[MASK] in x ray form so anatomage table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear[MASK] <unk> and also if you want you can compare[MASK] with how anatomy would appear in x ray too so when you are done <unk> just bring back[MASK] the body[MASK] and then it 's ready for another session it[MASK] looks like our table also can transform gender too it 's a female now[MASK]
