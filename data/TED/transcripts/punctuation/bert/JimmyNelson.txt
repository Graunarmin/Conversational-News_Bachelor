 <unk> been making pictures for quite a long time and normally speaking a picture like this for me should be straightforward <unk> i 'm in southern ethiopia i[MASK] 'm with the <unk> daasanach there 's a big family there 's a very beautiful[MASK] <unk> and i make these pictures with this very large extremely cumbersome very awkward technical plate film camera does anybody know <unk>[MASK] <unk> sheets of film and[MASK] you 're setting it up putting it on the tripod i 've got the family spent the better part of a day talking with them <unk> they sort of understand what i 'm on about they think i 'm a bit crazy but that 's another story [MASK] and[MASK] what 's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic and that 's based on the light <unk> so the light 's setting on my[MASK] and there 's a balance in the communication with the daasanach the family of thirty all ages there 's babies and there 's grandparents i[MASK] 'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set <unk> and it 's going going and i 've got one sheet of film left [MASK] and i think i 'm okay i 'm in control i 'm in control i 'm setting it up and i 'm setting up and the light 's just about to go and i want it to be golden i[MASK] <unk> to be beautiful i want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people in all the potential glory that they could be presented <unk> and it 's about to go and it 's about to go and i put my sheet in the camera it 's all focused <unk> [MASK] and all of a sudden there 's a massive whack and[MASK] i 'm looking around and in the top corner of the tree one of the girls slaps the girl next to her and the girl next to her pulls her hair <unk> and all hell breaks loose <unk> and i 'm[MASK] <unk> around and starts screaming shouting <unk> [MASK] and the whole tree collapses not the tree but the people in the tree they 're[MASK] all running around screaming and they run back off into the village in this sort of cloud of smoke and i 'm left there standing behind my tripod [MASK] i 've got my sheet and the light 's gone and i can 't make the picture where have they all gone <unk> i had no idea <unk> it took me a week it took[MASK] <unk> 's your story who are you and it all turned out to be about a boyfriend for crying out loud i mean i have teenage kids <unk> i should know <unk> [MASK] it was about a boyfriend the girl on the top she 'd kissed the wrong boy <unk> and they 'd started having a fight[MASK] <unk> a very very beautiful lesson for me in that if i was going to photograph these people in the dignified respectful way that i had intended <unk> and put them on a pedestal i had to understand them it wasn 't just <unk>[MASK] <unk> about turning up it wasn 't just about shaking a hand it wasn 't about just saying i 'm jimmy i 'm a photographer i had to get to know every single one of them <unk> right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who [MASK] <unk> they all came back i put them all back up in the tree <unk> i made sure the girls were in the right position and the ones that slapped one was over there they did look at each other if you look at it later they 're staring at each other very angrily <unk> [MASK] and i 've got the tree and everything and then at the last minute i go the goat the goat i need something for the eye to look at i need a white goat in the middle so i swapped all the goats around i put[MASK] <unk> but even then i got it wrong because if you can see on the left hand side another little boy storms off because i didn 't choose his goat so[MASK] the moral being i have to learn to speak goat as well as daasanach but anyway the effort that goes into that picture[MASK] and the story that i 've just related to you as you can imagine there are hundreds of other bizarre eccentric stories of hundreds of other people around the world <unk> [MASK] and this was about four years ago and i set off on a journey to be honest a very indulgent journey <unk> i 'm a real romantic[MASK] 'm an idealist [MASK] perhaps in some ways naive <unk> [MASK] but i truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful it 's very very simple it 's not rocket science[MASK] i wanted to put these people on a pedestal i wanted to put them on a pedestal like they 'd never been seen before <unk> so i chose about thirty five different groups [MASK] tribes[MASK] <unk> indigenous cultures [MASK] they were chosen purely because of their aesthetic and i 'll talk more about that later i 'm not an anthropologist i have no technical study with the subject <unk> [MASK] but i do have a very very very deep passion <unk> [MASK] and i believe that i had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in and put the two together and present them to you <unk> [MASK] about a year ago i published the first pictures[MASK] <unk> and something[MASK] extraordinarily exciting happened the whole world came running [MASK] and it was a bizarre experience because everybody from everywhere who are they what are they how many are they where did you find them are they real <unk> you faked it [MASK] tell me tell me tell me tell me millions of questions for which to be honest <unk> i don 't have the answers <unk> i really didn 't have the answers and i could sort of understand okay they 're beautiful that was my intention[MASK] <unk> but who 's ted do i have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage [MASK] and no no the ted group you must know about it and i said i 've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last[MASK] <unk> we have to do a ted talk [MASK] researched oh exciting that 's great <unk> and then eventually you 're going to go to tedglobal even more exciting <unk> [MASK] but what you need to do you need to teach the people lessons lessons that you 've learned on your travels around the world with these tribes i thought lessons okay well what did i learn good question three you need three lessons and they need to be terribly[MASK] <unk> so i thought long and hard and i stood here two days ago and[MASK] i had my test run and i had my cards and my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen <unk> and i had my three lessons <unk> and i started presenting them <unk> [MASK] and i had this very odd out of body experience i sort of[MASK] <unk> had more of these talks they 've heard more lessons in their life who are you to tell them what you 've learned who are you to guide them and who are you to show them what is right what is wrong what these people have to say [MASK] and i had a little bit of a it was very private a little bit of a meltdown i went back and a[MASK] little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats very[MASK] <unk> it wasn 't what i wanted to communicate <unk> and i thought long and hard about it and i thought well the only thing i can communicate is very very basic <unk> you have to turn it all the way around <unk> there 's only one person i know here and that 's me[MASK] <unk> i 'm still getting to know myself <unk> and it 's a lifelong journey and i probably won 't have all the answers but i did learn some extraordinary things[MASK] on this journey <unk> so what i 'm going to do is share with you my lessons <unk> it 's a very[MASK] <unk> as i explained at the beginning very indulgent very personal how and why i made these pictures and i leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons have meant to me what they could perhaps mean to you <unk> [MASK] i traveled enormously as a child i was very nomadic it was actually very exciting all around the world <unk> and i[MASK] <unk> feeling that i was pushed off at[MASK] great speed to become somebody become that individual jimmy go off into the planet and so i ran and[MASK] i ran and my wife sometimes kids me jimmy you look a bit like forrest gump but i 'm no it 's all about something trust me so i kept running and i kept running [MASK] and i sort of got somewhere and i sort of stood there and looked around me and i thought well[MASK] <unk> where do i belong where do i fit what am i where am i from i had no idea[MASK] <unk> 't too many psychologists in this audience perhaps part of this journey is about me trying to find out where i belonged <unk> so[MASK] whilst going and don 't worry i didn 't when i arrived with these tribes i didn 't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths[MASK] <unk> but what i did find were people that belonged themselves and they inspired me some extraordinary people and i 'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine[MASK] <unk> people on the planet <unk> they 're proud <unk> they live in the papua new guinean highlands <unk> there 's not many of them left and they 're called the huli wigmen [MASK] and images like this i mean this is what it 's all about for me and you 've spent weeks and months there talking with them getting there <unk> and i want to put them on a pedestal and i said you have something that many people have not seen you sit in this[MASK] <unk> it really does look like this and they really do look like this this is the real thing <unk> and you know why they 're proud you know why they look like this [MASK] and why i broke my back literally to photograph them and present them to you it 's because they have these extraordinary rituals <unk> and the huli have this ritual [MASK] when they 're teenagers[MASK] <unk> becoming a man they have to shave their heads <unk> and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single[MASK] <unk> and what they do with that hair <unk> they make it into a creation a creation that 's a very personal creation it 's their creation <unk> it 's their huli creation so they 're called the huli wigmen [MASK] that 's a wig on his head <unk> it 's all made out of his human hair <unk> and then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise and don 't worry there are many birds there there 's very few people living so[MASK] nothing to get too upset about <unk> and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats[MASK] <unk> further and further and it 's extraordinary and there 's another group they 're called the kalam and they live in the next valley <unk> but they speak a completely different language they look completely different and they wear a hat <unk> and it 's built out of scarabs these fantastic emerald green little scarabs [MASK] and sometimes there are five thousand or six thousand scarabs in this hat <unk> and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs to build these hats [MASK] so[MASK] <unk> inspired me in that they belong <unk> perhaps i have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where i actually fit[MASK] an extremely important part of this project was about how[MASK] i photograph these extraordinary people <unk> and it 's basically beauty [MASK] i think beauty matters we spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty beautiful places beautiful things and ultimately [MASK] beautiful people[MASK] <unk> very very very significant i 've spent all of my life analyzing what do i look like [MASK] am i perceived as beautiful does it matter if i 'm a beautiful person or not or is it purely based on my aesthetic <unk> [MASK] and then when i went off i came to a very narrow conclusion do i have to go around the world photographing <unk> [MASK] excuse me <unk> women between the age of twenty five and thirty is that what beauty is going to be is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant[MASK] <unk> was only until i went on a journey <unk> a journey that was so extreme <unk> i still[MASK] get shivers when i think about it i went to a part of the world and i don 't know whether any of you have ever heard of chukotka has anybody ever heard of chukotka chukotka[MASK] probably is technically as far as one can go and still be on on the living planet[MASK] <unk> it 's thirteen hours ' flight from moscow <unk> first you 've got to get to moscow and then thirteen hours ' flight nonstop from moscow <unk> and that 's if you get there as you can see some people sort of miss the runway [MASK] and then when you land there in chukotka are the chukchis now the chukchis are the last indigenous inuits of siberia <unk> [MASK] and they 're people i 'd heard about i 'd hardly seen any images of but i knew they were there and i 'd been in touch with this guide and this guide said there 's this fantastic tribe there 's only about forty of them you 'll be okay[MASK] off we went on this journey when we arrived there after a month of traveling across the ice <unk> and we 'd got to them <unk> but then i was not allowed to photograph them they said you cannot photograph us[MASK] <unk> you have to wait <unk> you have to wait until you get to know us you have to wait until you understand us you have to wait until you see how we interact with one another [MASK] and only then it was many many weeks later i saw a respect <unk> they had zero judgment <unk> they observed one another[MASK] from the youth from the middle aged to the old they need each other the children need to chew the meat all day because the adults don 't have any teeth <unk> but at the same time the children take the old aged <unk>[MASK] <unk> people out to the toilet because they 're infirm so there 's this fantastic community of respect <unk> and they adore and admire one another and they truly taught me what beauty[MASK] <unk> a little bit of audience interaction[MASK] this is extremely important for the end of my talk <unk> [MASK] if you could look at somebody left to the right of you and i want you to observe them <unk> and i want you to give them a compliment <unk> this is very important now it may be their nose or their hair <unk>[MASK] <unk> or even their aura <unk> i don 't mind <unk> but please look at each other give them a compliment you have to be[MASK] <unk> because i 'm running out of time and you have to remember it [MASK] okay thank you thank you thank you you 've given each other compliments[MASK] hold that compliment very very tightly <unk> hold it for later[MASK] <unk> and the last thing it was extraordinarily profound and it happened only two weeks ago two weeks ago i went back[MASK] to the himba now the himba live in northern namibia on the border of angola and i 'd been there a few times before and i 'd gone back to present this book[MASK] <unk> them the pictures to get into a discussion with them to say this is how i saw you <unk> this is how i love you this is how i respect you <unk> what do you think am i right am i wrong so i wanted this debate <unk> it was very <unk>[MASK] <unk> very very emotional and one night we were sitting around the campfire and i have to be honest i think i 'd had a little bit too much to drink and i was sort of sitting under the stars going this is great you 've seen my pictures <unk> we love each[MASK] <unk> look up at the stars again look at the campfire <unk> chief die what on earth does chief die have to do with the fence chief die <unk> first we destroy[MASK] then we reflect [MASK] then we rebuild then we respect [MASK] and i burst out in tears because my father had only just died prior to this journey <unk> [MASK] and i didn 't ever acknowledge him <unk> i didn 't ever appreciate him for the fact that i 'm probably standing here today because of him [MASK] these people taught me that we are only who we are[MASK] <unk> because of our parents and our grandparents and our forefathers going on and on and on before that and i [MASK] no matter how romantic or how idealistic i am on this journey <unk> i did not know that until two weeks ago i did not know that until two weeks ago <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] what 's this all about well there 's an image i 'd like to show you <unk> quite a special image and it wasn 't essentially the image i wanted to choose i was sitting[MASK] <unk> finish on a strong image <unk> [MASK] and somebody said you have to show them the picture of the nenets <unk> the nenets i was like yeah but that 's not my favorite picture she went no no no no no no no <unk> it 's an amazing picture you 're in his eyes [MASK] i said what do you mean i 'm in his eyes it 's a picture of the nenets she said no look look closely you 're in his eyes and[MASK] when you look closely at this picture there is a reflection of me in[MASK] <unk> so i think perhaps[MASK] he has my soul and i 'm in his soul <unk> and whilst these pictures look at you i ask you to look at them you may not be reflected in his eyes[MASK] <unk> but there is something extraordinarily important about these people i don 't ultimately have the answers as i 've just shared with you <unk> [MASK] but you must do there must be something there <unk> [MASK] so if you can[MASK] briefly reflect on what i was[MASK] <unk> beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots <unk> and i need you all to stand for me please [MASK] now you have no excuse it 's almost lunchtime <unk> and this is not a standing ovation so don 't worry i 'm not fishing for compliments[MASK] but you were given a compliment a few minutes ago now i want you to stand tall <unk> <unk> i want you to breathe in this is what i say i 'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks i 'm not going to ask you to carry a goat <unk> and i know you don 't have any camels[MASK] <unk> photography 's extraordinarily powerful it 's this language which we now all understand we truly do all understand it and we have this global digital fireplace don 't we <unk> but i want to share you with the world because you are also a tribe <unk> [MASK] you are the ted tribe yeah <unk> but you have to remember that compliment <unk> you have to stand tall[MASK] <unk> breathe in through your nose[MASK] <unk> and i 'm going to photograph you okay i need to do a panoramic shot so it 's going to take a minute so you have to concentrate <unk> okay breathe in stand tall <unk> no laughing shh breathe through your nose i 'm going to photograph[MASK]
