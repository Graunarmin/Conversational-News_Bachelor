 <unk> you have heard that phrase uttered by your friends <unk> family schools and the media for decades it 's a norm <unk> it 's a social norm <unk> [MASK] but it 's a special kind of social norm <unk> because it 's a social norm that wants to tell[MASK] <unk> us who we can relate to and who we shouldn 't relate to don 't talk to strangers says[MASK] from anyone who 's not familiar to you <unk> stick with the people you know <unk> stick with people like you [MASK] how appealing is that it[MASK] 's not really[MASK] <unk> 're at our best [MASK] when we 're at our best we reach out to people who are not like us <unk> because when we do that we learn from people who are not like us [MASK] my phrase for this value of being with not like us is strangeness [MASK] and my point is that in today 's digitally intensive world strangers are quite frankly not the point [MASK] the point that we should be worried about is how much strangeness are we getting[MASK] why strangeness <unk> because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data [MASK] and data turns our social relations into digital relations <unk> [MASK] and that means that our digital relations now depend[MASK] extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness a sense of discovery a sense of surprise and unpredictability <unk> [MASK] <unk> strangers <unk> [MASK] because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries [MASK] they belong to a world of people i know versus people i don 't know [MASK] and in the context of my digital relations i 'm already doing things with people i don 't know <unk> [MASK] the question isn 't whether or not i know[MASK] <unk> the question is what can i do with you <unk> what can i learn with you <unk> what can we do together that benefits us both [MASK] i spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing <unk> how new technologies create new constraints[MASK] and new opportunities for people the most important changes facing us today have to do with data[MASK] and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future[MASK] economies of the future depend on that our social lives in the future depend on that the threat to worry about[MASK] isn 't strangers <unk> the threat to worry about is whether or not we 're getting our fair share of strangeness [MASK] now 20th century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers <unk> but they weren 't thinking so dynamically about human relations [MASK] and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices[MASK] stanley milgram from the ' 60s and ' 70s the creator of the small world experiments which became later popularized as six degrees of separation <unk> made the point that any two <unk>[MASK] <unk> arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps [MASK] <unk> in his seminal essay the strength of weak ties made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks these strangers are actually more effective at diffusing information to us[MASK] than are our strong ties the people closest to us [MASK] he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us these strong ties[MASK] <unk> lives actually have a homogenizing effect on us they produce sameness my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years[MASK] looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives what kinds of new routines are possible [MASK] we 've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms[MASK] that have enabled us to take our possessions those things that used to be very restricted[MASK] <unk> to us and to our friends in our houses and to make them available to people we don 't know <unk> [MASK] whether it 's our clothes whether it 's our cars whether it 's our bikes <unk> whether it 's our books or music [MASK] we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we 've never met <unk> [MASK] and we concluded a very important insight which was that as people 's relationships to the things in their lives change[MASK] <unk> so do their relations with other people [MASK] and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat it continues to try to predict what i need[MASK] based on some past characterization of who i am of what i 've already done security technology after security technology continues[MASK] <unk> to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks [MASK] keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations <unk> [MASK] categories like friends and family and contacts and colleagues don 't tell me anything about my actual relations [MASK] a more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance where at any given point in time with any single person[MASK] <unk> i am both close and distant from that individual <unk> all as a function of what i need to do right now [MASK] people aren 't close or distant [MASK] people are always a combination of the two and that combination is constantly changing <unk> [MASK] what if technologies could intervene[MASK] to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that i need right now[MASK] <unk> strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance[MASK] that enables me to find the people that i need right now [MASK] that enables me to find the sources of intimacy of discovery <unk> and of inspiration that i need right now <unk> strangeness is not about meeting strangers <unk> [MASK] it simply makes the point[MASK] that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity so[MASK] <unk> jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness and it 's a problem faced not just by individuals today <unk> but also by organizations [MASK] organizations that are trying to embrace[MASK] massively new opportunities <unk> whether you 're a political party[MASK] insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not whether you 're the government protecting social institutions like marriage[MASK] and restricting[MASK] <unk> access of those institutions to the few [MASK] whether you 're a teenager in her bedroom who 's trying to jostle her relations with her parents strangeness is a way to think about[MASK] how we pave the way to new kinds of relations we have to change the norms we have to change the norms[MASK] in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses[MASK] what interesting questions[MASK] lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers <unk> [MASK] how might we think differently about our relations with people [MASK] how might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people [MASK] how might we think differently about our relations with technologies things that effectively become social participants in their own right[MASK] the range of digital relations[MASK] is extraordinary in the context[MASK] of this broad range of digital relations <unk> safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation <unk> thank you[MASK]
