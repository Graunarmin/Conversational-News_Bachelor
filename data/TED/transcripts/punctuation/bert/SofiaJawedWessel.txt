 <unk> we 're going to share a lot of secrets today you and i and in doing so i hope that we can lift some of the shame many of us feel about sex [MASK] how many here have ever been[MASK] <unk> for me the time i remember best is when that stranger was a student of mine he came up to me after class that night[MASK] and his words confirmed what i already knew i am so sorry professor <unk> if i had known it was you <unk> i would never have said those things [MASK] <unk> a person to him until i was his professor <unk> [MASK] this concept called objectification [MASK] is the foundation of sexism <unk> and we see it reinforced through every aspect of our lives <unk> [MASK] we see it in the government that refuses to[MASK] punish men for raping women <unk> we see it in advertisements how many of you have seen an advertisement that[MASK] uses a woman 's breast to sell an entirely unrelated product <unk> or[MASK] movie after movie after movie that portrays women as only love interests [MASK] these examples might seem inconsequential and harmless but they 're insidious <unk> slowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people [MASK] we see this in the[MASK] <unk> that sends home[MASK] a <unk> 10 year old girl because her clothes were a distraction to boys trying to learn[MASK] <unk> or the government that refuses to punish men for raping women[MASK] over and over [MASK] or the woman who is killed because she asked a man to stop grinding on her on the dance floor <unk> [MASK] media plays a large role in perpetuating[MASK] the objectification of women [MASK] let 's consider the classic romantic comedy we 're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies [MASK] two kinds of desirable women anyway[MASK] <unk> the first is the sexy bombshell <unk> this is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body our leading man has no trouble identifying her and even less trouble having sex with her [MASK] <unk> second is our leading lady the beautiful but demure woman our leading man falls in love with[MASK] despite not noticing her at first or not liking her if he did <unk> [MASK] the first is the slut <unk> she is to be consumed and forgotten <unk> she is much too available <unk> [MASK] the second is desirable but modest and therefore worthy of our leading man 's future babies <unk> marriage material[MASK] <unk> we 're actually told that women have two roles but these two roles have a difficult time existing within the same woman [MASK] on the rare occasion that i share with a new acquaintance that i study sex if they don 't end the conversation right then they 're usually pretty intrigued[MASK] <unk> in studying the sexual behaviors of pregnant and postpartum couples at this point i get a different kind of response [MASK] oh huh do pregnant people even have sex have you thought about[MASK] studying sexual desire[MASK] or orgasms[MASK] <unk> tell me what are the first words that come to mind when you picture a pregnant woman [MASK] i asked this question in a survey of over five hundred adults and most responded with belly or round and [MASK] cute this didn 't surprise me too much what else do we label as cute[MASK] <unk> when we label an adult as cute though <unk> we take away a lot of their intelligence their complexity <unk> [MASK] we reduce them to childlike qualities <unk> [MASK] i also asked heterosexual men to imagine a woman that they 're partnered with is pregnant <unk> [MASK] and then asked women to imagine that they are pregnant and then tell me the first words that come to mind when they imagine having sex[MASK] most of the responses were negative[MASK] <unk> from sexuality <unk> we are removing <unk>[MASK] the constraints of sexual objectification they experience less sexism right [MASK] not exactly what happens instead is a different kind of objectification [MASK] in my efforts to explain this to others one conversation led to the venus of[MASK] <unk> a paleolithic figurine scholars assumed was a goddess of love and beauty hence the name venus [MASK] this theory was later revised though when scholars noted the sculptor 's obvious focus[MASK] on the figurine 's reproductive features large breasts considered ideal for nursing [MASK] a round possibly pregnant belly <unk> the remnants of red dye alluding to menstruation or birth [MASK] they also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed[MASK] <unk> lying down because her tiny feet don 't allow her to be freestanding <unk> she also had no face[MASK] for this reason it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility and not a[MASK] a portrait of a person she was an object [MASK] in the history of her interpretation she went from object of ideal beauty and love to object of reproduction <unk> [MASK] i think this[MASK] <unk> transition speaks more about the scholars who have interpreted her purpose than[MASK] the actual purpose of the figurine herself <unk> [MASK] when a woman becomes pregnant <unk> [MASK] she leaves the realm realm of men 's sexual desire and slides into her reproductive and child rearing role [MASK] in doing so <unk> she also becomes the property of the community[MASK] considered very important but only because she 's pregnant right [MASK] i 've taken to calling this the willendorf effect and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life [MASK] has anyone here ever been visibly pregnant yeah lots of you [MASK] right so how many of you ever had a stranger touch your belly during[MASK] <unk> maybe without even asking your permission first or told what you can and cannot eat[MASK] by somebody who is not your doctor your medical care provider <unk> or asked private questions about your birth plan <unk> [MASK] and then told why those choices are all wrong yeah [MASK] me too or had a server refuse to bring bring you a glass of wine <unk> this one might give you[MASK] i know but stay with me <unk> this is a huge secret it is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy [MASK] many of us don 't know this because doctors don 't trust pregnant women with this secret [MASK] especially if she 's less educated or a woman of color what this tells us is[MASK] <unk> when the government reminds women with every new anti choice bill that the contents of her uterus are not her own or when[MASK] while it 's safe to have sex during pregnancy sometimes you never know <unk> better safe than sorry right she 's denied basic[MASK] privacy and bodily autonomy under the guise of be a good[MASK] <unk> mother we don 't trust her to make her own decisions she 's cute <unk> remember[MASK] when we tell women that sexual pleasure[MASK] excuse me when we tell women that sex isn 't worth the risk during pregnancy what we 're telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn 't matter <unk> [MASK] so what we are telling her is that she[MASK] <unk> in fact doesn 't matter even though the needs of her her fetus are not at odds with her own needs so[MASK] medical providers <unk> such as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists have the opportunity to educate about[MASK] the safety of sex during pregnancy <unk> so what do the experts say <unk> acog actually has no public official statement about[MASK] the the safety of sex during pregnancy[MASK] <unk> guidance from the mayo clinic is generally positive[MASK] but presented with a caveat [MASK] although most women can safely have sex throughout pregnancy <unk> sometimes it 's best to be cautious some women don 't want to have sex during pregnancy <unk> and that 's ok <unk> some women do want to have sex during pregnancy <unk> and that 's ok too[MASK] <unk> needs to stop is society telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies [MASK] pregnant women are not[MASK] faceless identity less vessels of reproduction who can 't stand on their own two feet [MASK] but the truth is the real secret is we tell all women that their sexual pleasure doesn 't matter <unk> we refuse to even acknowledge that women[MASK] <unk> who have sex with women or women who don 't want children even exist oh it 's just a phase she just needs the right man to come along [MASK] every time a woman has sex[MASK] simply because it feels good it is revolutionary <unk> she is revolutionary <unk> she is pushing back against society 's insistence that she exist simply for men 's pleasure or for reproduction[MASK] <unk> a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary [MASK] because a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself [MASK] that is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal that is a woman who insists that you make[MASK] <unk> at the table of power <unk> and that is the most terrifying of all because we can 't make room for her without some of us giving up the extra space we hold [MASK] i have one last secret for you <unk> i am the mother of two boys and we could use your help[MASK] <unk> hear me say regularly that it 's important for men to recognize women as equals[MASK] and they see their father modeling this we need what happens in the world to reinforce what happens in our home <unk> [MASK] this is not a men 's problem or a women 's problem <unk> this is everyone 's problem and we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality [MASK] for starters we have got to stop telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies[MASK] this includes not treating pregnant women like community property if you don 't know her don 't even ask to touch her belly [MASK] you wouldn 't anybody else don 't tell her what she can and cannot eat don 't ask her private details about her medical decisions <unk> this also includes understanding that even if you are personally against abortion you can still[MASK] <unk> fight for a woman 's right to choose when it comes to women 's equality the two need not oppose one another <unk> [MASK] if you 're somebody who has sex with women prioritize her pleasure if you don 't know how ask [MASK] if you have children [MASK] have conversations about sex as[MASK] <unk> in the dictionary anymore they look it up on the internet[MASK] and when you 're having those conversations about sex [MASK] don 't center them on reproduction only people have sex for many reasons some because they want a baby but most of us have sex because it feels good admit it [MASK] and regardless of whether you have children or not support comprehensive sex education that doesn 't shame our teenagers[MASK] applause nothing positive comes from shaming teens for their sexual desires behaviors <unk> [MASK] other than positive std and pregnancy tests [MASK] every single day we are all given the opportunity to disrupt patterns of inequality[MASK] <unk> think we can all agree that it 's worth the trouble to do so <unk> thank you[MASK]
