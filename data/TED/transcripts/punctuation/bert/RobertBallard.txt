 <unk> the first question is this our country[MASK] has two exploration programs one is[MASK] nasa with a mission to explore the the great beyond to explore the heavens which we all want to go to if we 're lucky <unk> and you can see we have sputnik and we have[MASK] saturn and we have other[MASK] <unk> manifestations of space exploration well there 's also another program in another agency within our government in ocean exploration <unk> it 's in noaa <unk> the national oceanic and atmospheric administration [MASK] and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans [MASK] here 's the reason <unk> or not the reason but here 's why i ask that question if you compare nasa 's annual budget to[MASK] <unk> explore the heavens that one year budget would fund noaa 's budget to explore the oceans for one thousand six hundred years [MASK] why [MASK] why are we looking up is it because it 's heaven <unk> and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean [MASK] or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark[MASK] <unk> place that has nothing to offer i 'm going to take you on a 16 minute trip[MASK] on seventy two percent of the planet so buckle up <unk> ok <unk> [MASK] and what we 're going to do is we 're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what i 'm going to try i hope i make the following points i 'm going to make it right now in case i forget[MASK] <unk> everything i 'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when i went to school and most of all it was not even in my college textbooks[MASK] i 'm a geophysicist and all my earth science books when i was a student i had to give the wrong answer to get an a [MASK] we used to ridicule continental drift it was something we laughed at we learned of marshall kay 's geosynclinal cycle which is a bunch of crap <unk> in today 's context[MASK] <unk> it was a bunch of crap but it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we 're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans[MASK] were mostly discoveries made by accident mostly discoveries made by accident we were looking for something and found something else <unk> and[MASK] everything we 're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse because that 's all we[MASK] <unk> i have a characterization this is a characterization[MASK] of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it 's a map it is not a map in fact i <unk>[MASK] <unk> have another version at my office and i ask people why are there mountains here on this area here <unk> but there are none over here and they go[MASK] <unk> most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored <unk> we had more exploration ships down there during captain cook 's time than now <unk> [MASK] it 's amazing all right so we 're going to immerse ourselves in the seventy two percent of the planet because you know it 's really naive to think[MASK] that the easter bunny[MASK] put all the resources[MASK] <unk> we are always constantly playing the zero sum game you know we 're going to do this we 're going to take it away from something else <unk> i believe in just enriching the economy[MASK] and we 're leaving so much on the table seventy two percent of the planet and as i will point out later in the presentation fifty percent[MASK] <unk> of the united states of america[MASK] lies beneath the sea [MASK] fifty percent of our country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all rights to do whatever we want <unk> lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of mars than that fifty percent [MASK] why <unk> [MASK] ok <unk> now <unk> i began my explorations the hard way[MASK] back then actually my first expedition was when i was[MASK] <unk> i went out to sea on a scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and i was too young to be you know i thought it was great i was a body surfer and i thought wow [MASK] that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but i became[MASK] enraptured with mounting expeditions <unk> and over the last forty nine years i 've done about one hundred and twenty one hundred[MASK] <unk> keep doing them[MASK] expeditions but in the early days the only way i could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine <unk> a very small submarine and go down to the bottom i dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles <unk>[MASK] alvin and sea cliff and cyana and all the major deep submersibles we have which are about eight <unk> [MASK] on a good day <unk> we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth[MASK] maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we 've got going and so it 's very[MASK] <unk> difficult to get there if you do it physically <unk> but i was enraptured and in my[MASK] graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics <unk> and we realized that the greatest mountain range on earth lies beneath the sea the mid ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball <unk> [MASK] this is on a[MASK] on a mercator projection but if you were to put it on an equal area[MASK] <unk> percent of the earth 's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range[MASK] and we didn 't enter it until after neil armstrong and buzz aldrin went to the moon [MASK] so we went to the moon <unk> played golf up there before we went to the largest feature on our own planet <unk> [MASK] and our interest in this mountain range as earth scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet <unk> [MASK] but the role it plays in the genesis of the earth 's outer skin because it 's along the axis of the[MASK] <unk> ridge where the great crustal plates are separating and like a a living organism <unk> you tear it open <unk> it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere [MASK] hardens forms new tissue and and moves laterally <unk> [MASK] but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it into the rift valley until a group of seven of us[MASK] crawled in our little submarines in the summer of[MASK] <unk> the first human beings to enter the great rift valley <unk> we went down into the rift valley this is[MASK] all accurate except for one thing it 's pitch black it[MASK] 's absolutely pitch black because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean which is twelve thousand feet in the rift valley it 's nine thousand feet <unk> most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun <unk> [MASK] most of our planet is in eternal darkness [MASK] and for that reason you do not have[MASK] <unk> photosynthesis in the deep sea and with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life living in this underworld or so we thought <unk> [MASK] and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring[MASK] the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic[MASK] features running along that entire forty two thousand[MASK] <unk> running along this entire forty two thousand miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude [MASK] so it 's a phenomenally active region <unk> it 's not just a[MASK] dark <unk> boring place it 's a very alive place and it 's then being ripped open <unk> but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back[MASK] <unk> we couldn 't understand why you had a mountain under tension in plate tectonic theory we knew that if you had plates collide it made sense <unk> they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you 'd uplift it that 's why you get you know [MASK] you get seashells up on mount everest it 's not a flood it was pushed up there [MASK] we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension it should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal[MASK] <unk> ridge must be a cooling curve we said let 's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except at the axis there was missing heat [MASK] it was missing heat it was hot it wasn 't hot enough so we came up with multiple hypotheses there 's little green people down there taking it there 's all sorts of things going on <unk> but the only logical [ explanation ] was that there were hot <unk>[MASK] <unk> springs so there must be underwater hot springs we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat <unk> [MASK] <unk> the missing heat it was amazing these giant chimneys <unk> huge giant chimneys we went up to them with our submersible we wanted to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it it pegged off scale the[MASK] pilot made this great observation that 's hot [MASK] and then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature[MASK] was six hundred and fifty degrees f hot enough to melt lead <unk> this is what a real one looks like on the juan de fuca ridge what you 're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean <unk> [MASK] <unk> everything you see in this picture is commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold <unk> so the easter bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits <unk>[MASK] <unk> that we 're making in this mountain range we 're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed[MASK] <unk> a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist [ in ] [MASK] giant tube worms ten feet tall i remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pickle it because we don 't carry formaldehyde [MASK] we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock [MASK] large clams and when we opened them they didn 't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn 't have the[MASK] <unk> had been totally taken over by another organism a bacterium that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in our textbooks <unk> [MASK] none of this in our textbooks <unk> we did not know about this life system <unk> we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat[MASK] <unk> we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from this silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean twelve thousand feet two and half hours to get to work in the morning two and half hours to <unk>[MASK] <unk> get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile [MASK] <unk> using robotic systems to replicate myself so i wouldn 't have to cycle my vehicle system <unk> we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic <unk>[MASK] <unk> technologies again looking for something else <unk> moving from one part of the mid ocean ridge to another the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms they <unk>[MASK] <unk> came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand[MASK] <unk> were not above a magma chamber they shouldn 't be there[MASK] and we called it lost city [MASK] and lost city was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools look at that how do you do that that 's water upside down <unk>[MASK] we went in underneath and tapped it and we found that it had the ph of drano[MASK] <unk> the ph of eleven and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment and the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment <unk> all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a ph of eleven life existed so life was much more[MASK] creative than we had ever thought again discovered by accident just two years ago working off santorini where people are sunning themselves on the beach <unk> unbeknownst to them[MASK] <unk> we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems this was two miles from where people go to sunbathe and they were oblivious to the existence of this system <unk> [MASK] again <unk> you know we stop at the water 's edge recently diving off in the gulf of mexico <unk> [MASK] finding[MASK] pools of water <unk> this time not upside down right side up bingo[MASK] <unk> swims by you 're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs near that was methane <unk> i 've never seen volcanoes of methane[MASK] instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava <unk> but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by i 've never seen this before[MASK] moving on there 's more[MASK] <unk> than just natural history beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the titanic the realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on earth it contains <unk>[MASK] <unk> more history than all of the museums on land combined <unk> and yet we 're only now penetrating it finding the state of preservation we found the bismarck in sixteen thousand feet <unk> we then found the yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship[MASK] <unk> on the stern [MASK] more recently <unk> finding ancient history how many ancient mariners have had a bad day the number 's a million <unk> [MASK] we 've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they 're not supposed to be this shipwreck sank one hundred years before the birth of christ this one sank[MASK] carrying a prefabricated[MASK] <unk> home depot roman temple [MASK] and then here 's one that sank at the time of homer at seven hundred and fifty b c [MASK] more recently into the black sea where we 're exploring because there 's no oxygen there it[MASK] 's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth [MASK] shipwrecks are perfectly preserved all their organics are perfectly preserved <unk> we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their dna look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a of a carpenter look at the state of[MASK] artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping [MASK] when they dropped they sealed it [MASK] this ship sank one thousand five hundred years ago <unk> [MASK] fortunately we 've been able to convince congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the united states navy the okeanos explorer on its mission <unk>[MASK] its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet earth[MASK] <unk> and i was looking at it yesterday it 's up in seattle <unk> ok <unk>[MASK] <unk> it comes online this summer and it begins its journey of exploration <unk> but we have no idea what we 're going find when we go out there with our technology <unk> but certainly it 's going to be going to the unknown america <unk>[MASK] <unk> this is that part of the united states that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like i say[MASK] <unk> the western territorial trust we don 't have maps of them we don 't have maps of them we have maps of venus but not of the western territorial trust <unk> [MASK] the way we 're going to run this we have no idea what we 're going to discover we have no idea what we 're going to discover we 're going to discover an ancient[MASK] shipwreck a phoenician off brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we 're going to run it like an emergency[MASK] <unk> we 're going to connect our command center via a high bandwidth satellite link to a building we 're building at the university of rhode island [MASK] called the interspace center and within that we 're going to run it just like you run a[MASK] nuclear submarine blue gold team switching them off and on running twenty four hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center[MASK] <unk> a second later but then it 's connected through internet too the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway[MASK] with ten gigabits of bandwidth we 'll go into areas we have no knowledge of it 's a big blank sheet on our planet we 'll map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out[MASK] that ninety percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at twelve universities they 're all on i 2 [MASK] we can then build a command center this is a remote center at the university of washington she 's talking to the pilot[MASK] <unk> she 's five thousand miles away but she 's assumed command but the beauty of this too is we can then disseminate it to children <unk> [MASK] we can disseminate they can follow this expedition i 've started a program where are you jim jim young who helped me start a program called the jason project more recently we 've started <unk>[MASK] <unk> a program with the boys and girls clubs of america so that we can use exploration <unk> and the excitement of live exploration to motivate[MASK] <unk> them and excite them and then give them what they 're already ready for i would not let an adult drive my robot you don 't have enough gaming experience <unk> but i will let a kid with no license take over control of[MASK] my vehicle system [MASK] because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it 's all being done [MASK] you win or lose[MASK] <unk> engineer or a scientist by[MASK] eighth grade <unk> the game is not over it[MASK] 's over by the eighth grade it 's not beginning we need to be not only proud of our universities we need to be proud of our middle schools <unk> and when we have the best middle schools in the world we 'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you [MASK] because this is what we want [MASK] this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching[MASK] <unk> a basketball game watching exploration live from thousands of miles away <unk> and it 's just dawning on her what she 's seeing and when you get a jaw drop you can inform [MASK] <unk> you can put so much information into that mind it 's in full [ receiving ] mode [MASK] my final question[MASK] why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build[MASK] habitation on mars and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon <unk> but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet <unk> and the technology is at hand <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
