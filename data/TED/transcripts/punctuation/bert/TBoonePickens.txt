 <unk> i 'm a believer <unk> [MASK] i 'm a believer in global warming <unk> and my record is good on the subject <unk> [MASK] but my subject is national security <unk> [MASK] we have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy[MASK] <unk> about opec oil and let me take you back one hundred years[MASK] to one thousand nine hundred and twelve <unk> you 're probably thinking that was my birth year[MASK] it 's the same energy question that you 're looking at today <unk> but it 's different sources of fuel <unk> [MASK] a hundred years ago we were looking at coal of course and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil [MASK] at that point <unk> we were looking for a fuel[MASK] that was cleaner <unk> it was cheaper[MASK] <unk> and it wasn 't ours though <unk> [MASK] it was theirs <unk> so at that point one thousand nine hundred and twelve <unk> we selected crude oil over whale oil and[MASK] some[MASK] more coal <unk> [MASK] but as we moved on to the period now one hundred years later we 're back really at another decision point [MASK] what is the decision point it[MASK] <unk> what we 're going to use in the future <unk> so[MASK] from here <unk> it 's pretty clear to me[MASK] <unk> we would prefer to have cleaner cheaper <unk> domestic ours[MASK] and we have that we have that which is natural gas <unk> [MASK] <unk> million barrels of oil <unk> give or take a few barrels every day and the cost annually is three trillion dollars [MASK] and one trillion of that goes to opec <unk> [MASK] that has got to be stopped now if you look at the cost of opec[MASK] <unk> it cost seven trillion dollars on the milken institute study last year seven trillion dollars since <unk>[MASK] <unk> is what we paid for oil from opec now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both <unk> [MASK] but it 's the greatest transfer of wealth[MASK] from one group to another in the history of mankind <unk> and it continues now when you look[MASK] where is the transfer of wealth <unk> you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid east and away from us <unk> [MASK] and with that we have found ourselves to be the world 's policemen [MASK] we are policing the world <unk> and how are we[MASK] <unk> i know the response to this [MASK] i would bet there aren 't ten percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world [MASK] raise your hand if you think you know [MASK] there are twelve <unk> one is under construction by the chinese and the other eleven belong to us <unk> [MASK] why do we have eleven aircraft carriers[MASK] <unk> do we have a corner on the market [MASK] are we smarter than anybody else <unk> [MASK] i 'm not sure if you look at where they 're located and on this slide it 's the red blobs on there there are five that are operating in the mid east and the rest of them are in the united states [MASK] they just move back to the mid east and those come[MASK] <unk> of the eleven we have are tied up in the mid east why why are they in the mid east they[MASK] 're there to control keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available and the united states uses about twenty million barrels a day [MASK] which is about twenty five percent of all the oil used everyday in the[MASK] <unk> doing it with four percent of the population <unk> [MASK] somehow that doesn 't seem right <unk> [MASK] that 's not sustainable <unk> so where do we go from here <unk> does that continue <unk> [MASK] yes it 's going to continue <unk> the slide you 're looking at here is one thousand nine hundred and ninety to two thousand and forty [MASK] over that period you are going to double your demand [MASK] and when you look at what we 're using the oil for seventy percent of it is used for[MASK] <unk> transportation fuel <unk> [MASK] so when somebody says let 's go more nuclear <unk> let 's go wind <unk> let 's go solar fine <unk> i 'm for anything american [MASK] anything american <unk> but if you 're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil <unk> you have to address[MASK] <unk> so here we are using twenty million barrels a day producing eight importing twelve <unk> and from the twelve five <unk>[MASK] comes from opec [MASK] when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user <unk> we use twenty million barrels and the chinese use ten the chinese have[MASK] a little bit better plan or they have a plan <unk> we have no[MASK] <unk> in the history of america we 've never had an energy plan <unk> we don 't even realize the resources that we have available to us <unk> if you take the last ten years[MASK] and bring forward <unk> you 've transferred[MASK] to opec a trillion dollars <unk> if you go forward the next ten years and cap the price of oil at one hundred dollars a barrel <unk> [MASK] you will pay two point two trillion[MASK] that 's not sustainable either <unk> but the days of cheap oil are over [MASK] they 're over they make it very clear to you[MASK] <unk> the[MASK] saudis do they have to have ninety four dollars a barrel to make their social commitments now i had people[MASK] <unk> the oil for five dollars a barrel <unk> [MASK] that has nothing to do with it <unk> [MASK] it 's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil [MASK] there is no free market for oil the oil is priced off the margin and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil [MASK] so where are we headed from here we 're headed[MASK] to natural gas <unk> natural gas will do[MASK] everything we want it to do it 's one hundred and thirty octane fuel [MASK] it 's twenty five percent cleaner than oil <unk> it 's ours we have an abundance of it [MASK] and it does not require a refinery it[MASK] comes out of the ground at one hundred and thirty octane run it through the separator and you 're ready to use it it 's going to be very simple for us to use it 's going to be simple to accomplish this[MASK] 're going to find and i 'll tell you in just a minute what you 're looking for[MASK] to make it happen <unk> but here you can look at the list natural gas will fit all of those it will replace or be able to be used for that [MASK] it 's for power generation transportation it 's peaking fuel <unk> it 's all those do we have enough natural gas <unk> look at the bar on the left[MASK] <unk> trillion it 's what we use a year[MASK] go forward and the estimates that you have from the eia and onto the industry estimates the industry knows what they 're talking about[MASK] we 've got four thousand trillion cubic feet of natural gas that 's available to us how does that translate to[MASK] barrels of oil equivalent it would be three times what the saudis claim they have [MASK] and they claim they have two hundred and fifty billion barrels of oil which i do not believe i think it 's probably[MASK] billion barrels <unk> but anyway <unk> whether they say they 're right or whatever we have plenty of natural gas <unk> [MASK] so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas and where i 've targeted is on[MASK] <unk> of them you take eight million trucks[MASK] these are 18 wheelers and take them to natural gas <unk> reduce carbon by thirty percent it is cheaper[MASK] and it will cut our our imports three million barrels <unk> so you will cut sixty percent off of opec[MASK] with eight million trucks there are two hundred and fifty million vehicles in america[MASK] <unk> so what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel is the way i see it <unk> i don 't have to worry about the bridge to where[MASK] at my age [MASK] that 's your concern <unk> [MASK] but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas <unk> because you have plenty of natural gas[MASK] but as i said i 'm for anything american now let me take you i 've been a realist i went from theorist early to realist i 'm back to theorist <unk>[MASK] <unk> again <unk> if you look at the world you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent <unk> [MASK] <unk> if that 's the way you 're going to go [MASK] that there 's plenty of methane natural gas is methane methane and natural gas are interchangeable but if you decide that you 're going to use some methane and i 'm gone <unk> so it 's up to you[MASK] but we do have plenty of methane hydrates so[MASK] i think i 've made my point that <unk>[MASK] that we have to get on our own resources in america <unk> if we do[MASK] it 's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil [MASK] and yet we have no energy plan so there 's nothing going on that[MASK] impresses me in washington on that plan other than i 'm trying to focus on that eight[MASK] <unk> if we could do that i think we would take our first step to an energy plan <unk> [MASK] if we did we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine <unk> thank you[MASK] <unk> plan that was based on wind energy and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed[MASK] <unk> what happened tbp i lost one hundred and fifty[MASK] and so the margin is natural gas and at the time i went into the wind business natural gas was nine dollars <unk> today it 's two dollars and forty cents [MASK] you cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an mcf ca [MASK] so what happened was that through[MASK] increased[MASK] <unk> ability to use fracking technology <unk> the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted <unk> [MASK] which made wind uncompetitive [MASK] in a nutshell that 's what happened tbp that 's what happened we found out that we could go to the source rock <unk> which were the carboniferous shales in the basins the first one was barnett shale[MASK] in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across[MASK] new york pennsylvania west virginia and haynesville in louisiana[MASK] <unk> louisiana this stuff is everywhere we are overwhelmed with natural gas ca and now you 're a big investor in in that and bringing that to market tbp well you say a big investor[MASK] <unk> it 's my life i 'm a geologist got out of school in ' fifty one and i 've been in the industry my entire life now[MASK] i do own stocks[MASK] <unk> i 'm not a big natural gas producer somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas producer in the united states don 't i wish[MASK] but no i 'm not [MASK] i own stocks <unk> but i also am in the fueling business ca but natural gas is a fossil fuel <unk> you burn it you release[MASK] <unk> you 're going to have to use something <unk> what do you have to replace it[MASK] no no the argument that it 's a bridge fuel makes sense because[MASK] the amount of co2 per unit of energy is lower than[MASK] <unk> oil and coal correct and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas <unk>[MASK] but if that if that 's it and and that becomes the reason that renewables don 't get invested in <unk>[MASK] <unk> screwed anyway right tbp well i 'm not ready to give up but jim and i talked there as he left and i said how do you feel[MASK] <unk> you 're a person who believes in your legacy <unk> you 've made the money you need you 're one of the few people in a position to[MASK] really swing the debate <unk> do you support the idea of of some kind of[MASK] <unk> don 't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program i can tell you it will be a failure the government is not successful[MASK] on these things they just aren 't it 's a bad deal look at[MASK] solyndra or whatever it was i mean that was told to be a bad idea ten times they went ahead and did it anyway[MASK] <unk> i think it 's closer to a <unk>[MASK] but chris <unk> i think where we 're headed <unk>[MASK] i don 't mind going back to nuclear <unk> and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be [MASK] one don 't build a reformer on a fault[MASK] <unk> of methane leaking from that methane being a worse global warming gas than[MASK] <unk> age was i got out of school in ' fifty one i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in one thousand [MASK] nine hundred and fifty three fracking came out in ' forty seven and don 't believe for a minute when when our president gets up there and says the department of energy thirty years ago developed fracking <unk> i don 't know what in the hell he 's talking about <unk>[MASK] <unk> i mean seriously the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking <unk> the first frack job was in ' forty seven i saw my first one in ' fifty three i <unk>[MASK] <unk> 've fracked over three thousand wells in my life <unk> never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else <unk> now[MASK] <unk> hundred thousand wells fracked in oklahoma texas kansas in that aquifer[MASK] there 's no problems <unk> i don 't understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania ca all[MASK] right so you don 't support a carbon tax of any kind or a[MASK] <unk> it 's a bridge fuel[MASK] <unk> to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution are you ready to invest in those technologies <unk> even if they aren 't maximized for profits they might be maximized for the future health of the planet tbp i lost one hundred and fifty million on the wind[MASK] and[MASK] anything american will work for me ca boone[MASK] i really really appreciate you coming here <unk> engaging in this conversation i think there 's a lot of people who will want to engage with you and that that was a real gift you gave this audience <unk> thank you so much[MASK]
