 <unk> fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope it was a 200 foot diameter geodesic sphere[MASK] to be suspended suspended over the east river in new york city in full view of the united nations it was a big idea for sure <unk> and it was one that[MASK] he he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through[MASK] through animations of of global data <unk> trends and other information regarding the globe on this sphere <unk> [MASK] and today forty five years later we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity[MASK] <unk> what we do have is improved technology today we don 't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display we can use <unk>[MASK] <unk> are smaller they 're cheaper they 're longer lasting they 're more efficient [MASK] most importantly for this they 're faster <unk> and this speed combined with today 's <unk> high performance micro controllers allows us to actually simulate [MASK] in this piece over seventeen thousand[MASK] <unk> and the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision but as this ring rotates at about one thousand seven hundred rpm that 's <unk> twenty eight times per second [MASK] the equator 's speed is actually about sixty miles per hour[MASK] there are four <unk>[MASK] that each time this ring rotates it as it passes the rear of the display it picks up a position signal and from that [MASK] <unk> can extrapolate the position of the ring[MASK] at all points around the revolution[MASK] and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations but this is really just the beginning [MASK] in addition to higher resolution versions of this display <unk> my father and i are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon[MASK] it achieves this by rotating leds about two axes so as you can see here this is a eleven inch diameter circuit board these blocks represent[MASK] <unk> you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis it will create[MASK] a disc of light that we can control that 's nothing new that 's a propeller clock that 's[MASK] the rims that you can buy for your car but what is new is that when we rotate this disc about this axis[MASK] this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light and so we can control[MASK] <unk> and create a fully volumetric three dimensional display with just two hundred and <unk>[MASK] now this piece is currently in process due out in may[MASK] but what we 've done is we 've put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere <unk>[MASK] i 've got a little video to show you but[MASK] keep in mind that this is with no electronic control <unk> and this is also with only four[MASK] <unk> this is actually only about one point five percent of what the final display will be in may so take a look <unk> [MASK] and here you can see it 's rotating about the vertical axis only creating circles <unk> [MASK] and then as the other axis kicks in those actually blur into a volume and[MASK] the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case <unk> but this piece is due out in may it 'll be on display at the interactive telecommunications spring show in[MASK] <unk> greenwich village in new york city that 's open to the public definitely invite you all to come and attend it 's a fantastic show there are[MASK] hundreds of student innovators with with fantastic projects [MASK] this piece actually <unk> will be on display down in the sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show so i 'd[MASK] love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a closer look it[MASK] 's an honor to be here thanks very much[MASK]
