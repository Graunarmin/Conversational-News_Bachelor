 <unk> when i was growing up in montana [MASK] i had two dreams <unk> i wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist <unk> and i wanted to have a pet[MASK] <unk> and so[MASK] that 's what i 've been striving for all of my life <unk> [MASK] i was very fortunate early in my career <unk> [MASK] i was fortunate in finding things <unk> i wasn 't very good at reading things in fact i don 't read much of anything [MASK] i am extremely dyslexic <unk> and so reading is the hardest thing i do [MASK] but instead i go out and i find things then i just pick things up[MASK] <unk> i basically[MASK] practice[MASK] for finding money on the street and i wander about the hills and i have found a few things and[MASK] i have been fortunate enough to find things like[MASK] the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests the first dinosaur embryos and[MASK] <unk> massive accumulations of bones <unk> and[MASK] it happened to be at a time when[MASK] people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren 't the big <unk> [MASK] stupid green reptiles that people had thought for so many years people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special <unk> [MASK] and so at that time i was able to make some[MASK] <unk> interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had that dinosaurs[MASK] built nests and lived in colonies[MASK] and cared for their young <unk> brought food to their babies and traveled in[MASK] <unk> it was pretty interesting stuff <unk> i have gone on to find more things and[MASK] and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found[MASK] a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different[MASK] which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles[MASK] <unk> the juveniles can recognize the adults <unk> and so[MASK] we 're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like and they didn 't just all chase jeeps around [MASK] but[MASK] it is that social thing that that i guess attracted[MASK] michael crichton and in his book he talked about the social animals and then steven spielberg[MASK] <unk> of course <unk> depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures <unk> the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so[MASK] we come to that part of jurassic park michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life [MASK] you all know the story right[MASK] <unk> i assume everyone here has seen jurassic park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap[MASK] otherwise known as amber[MASK] that has some blood sucking insects in it[MASK] <unk> good ones [MASK] and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna <unk> because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days[MASK] sucked dinosaur dna out and you take your[MASK] <unk> dna back to the laboratory and you clone it and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then[MASK] you wait and lo and behold out pops[MASK] a little baby dinosaur <unk> and everybody 's happy about that [MASK] and they 're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and[MASK] <unk> and then then then and[MASK] then then[MASK] the dinosaurs being social [MASK] act out their socialness <unk> and they get together <unk> and they conspire [MASK] and of course that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie[MASK] conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber[MASK] and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you[MASK] got something out of that insect and you cloned it <unk> and you did it over and over and over again [MASK] you 'd have a room full of mosquitos [MASK] applause and probably a whole bunch of trees as[MASK] <unk> if you want dinosaur dna i say[MASK] go to the dinosaur <unk> [MASK] so that 's what we 've done back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the national science foundation[MASK] to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur <unk> [MASK] and we chose the dinosaur on the left a tyrannosaurus rex <unk> which was a very nice specimen <unk> and one of my former doctoral students[MASK] <unk> mary schweitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so[MASK] she looked into the bone of this <unk> t rex one of the thigh bones <unk> and she actually found some very interesting structures in there [MASK] they found these red <unk>[MASK] <unk> objects <unk> and they looked for all the world like red blood cells <unk> and they 're in what appear to be the[MASK] blood channels that go through the bone <unk> and so[MASK] she thought well what the heck so she[MASK] sampled some material out of it <unk> now it wasn 't dna she didn 't find dna <unk> but she did find[MASK] heme <unk> which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin[MASK] <unk> we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell creek project and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get[MASK] as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully[MASK] find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern montana[MASK] there 's a lot of space a lot of badlands and not very many people and so[MASK] you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of[MASK] tyrannosaurs <unk> but we found one special tyrannosaur <unk> and we called it b rex and b rex was found[MASK] under a thousand cubic yards of rock it wasn 't a very complete t rex <unk> and it wasn 't a very big t rex <unk> [MASK] but it was a very special b rex and i and my colleagues cut into it and[MASK] <unk> we were able to determine by looking at lines of arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of sixteen <unk> [MASK] we don 't really know how long dinosaurs lived because we haven 't found the oldest one yet[MASK] <unk> but this one died at the age of sixteen <unk> [MASK] we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female[MASK] based on medullary tissue found on the[MASK] <unk> inside of the bone <unk> medullary tissue is the calcium build up [MASK] the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant <unk> when a bird is pregnant <unk> [MASK] so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs <unk> but mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid <unk> now[MASK] we all know that bones are fossilized <unk> and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn 't be anything left <unk> [MASK] but there was something left <unk> there were blood vessels left <unk> there were flexible clear blood vessels <unk> [MASK] and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur it was extraordinary <unk> [MASK] but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find dna[MASK] <unk> but she did find evidence of proteins <unk> but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that[MASK] the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast <unk> [MASK] and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field[MASK] where we could get better samples and we did we got[MASK] <unk> better material [MASK] the cells looked better the vessels looked better [MASK] found the protein collagen i mean it was wonderful stuff <unk> but it 's not dinosaur dna <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] we have discovered that dinosaur dna and all dna just breaks down too[MASK] <unk> going to be able to do what they did in jurassic park we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on[MASK] a dinosaur <unk> but[MASK] birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs <unk> we actually classify them[MASK] as dinosaurs we now call them[MASK] <unk> dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs so the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct <unk> [MASK] avian dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them[MASK] <unk> you can call it a dinosaur <unk> but look at the velociraptor the velociraptor is cool the chicken is not [MASK] so this is our problem as you can imagine <unk> the chicken is a dinosaur i mean it really[MASK] <unk> you can 't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way [MASK] but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken [MASK] laughter so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken[MASK] <unk> so we have a number of of ways that we actually can[MASK] <unk> fix the chicken <unk> because evolution works <unk> we actually have some evolutionary tools we[MASK] 'll call them biological modification tools <unk> we have selection [MASK] and we know selection works <unk> we started out with a <unk> wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese[MASK] <unk> definitely genetic modification [MASK] or any of the other funny looking little dogs[MASK] <unk> we also have transgenesis transgenesis is really cool too that 's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one <unk> that 's how people make glofish [MASK] you take a glow gene out of[MASK] <unk> and you stick it in a zebrafish and puff they glow and that 's pretty cool <unk> and they obviously make a lot of money off of them [MASK] and now they 're making <unk> glow rabbits and glow all sorts of things i guess we could make a glow chicken [MASK] but i don 't think that 'll satisfy the sixth graders either[MASK] <unk> but there 's another thing there 's what we call atavism activation and atavism activation is basically[MASK] an atavism is an ancestral characteristic <unk>[MASK] you heard that occasionally children are born with tails <unk> [MASK] and it 's because it 's an ancestral characteristic <unk> [MASK] and so there are a number of[MASK] <unk> can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs <unk> and here 's an example this is a chicken[MASK] with teeth a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison[MASK] actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene[MASK] for teeth <unk> and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on[MASK] and produce teeth in[MASK] <unk> 's a good characteristic <unk> we can save that one we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth[MASK] that 's getting closer <unk> that 's better than a glowing chicken [MASK] a friend of mine <unk> a colleague of mine dr hans larsson at mcgill university is actually looking at atavisms <unk> and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo[MASK] <unk> genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he 's interested in how birds actually lost their tail <unk> he 's also interested in the transformation <unk>[MASK] of the arm the hand to the wing <unk> he 's looking for those genes as well <unk> and i said [MASK] and so he agreed and so[MASK] that 's what we 're looking into [MASK] if you look at dinosaur hands a[MASK] velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it <unk> archaeopteryx which is a bird <unk> a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand [MASK] but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else another bird has kind of a weird looking[MASK] <unk> the hand is a wing <unk> but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing[MASK] the hand actually[MASK] looks[MASK] pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand it has the three fingers the three digits <unk> but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together <unk> [MASK] and so what we 're looking for is that gene we want to stop that gene from turning on fusing those hands together <unk> so we can get a chicken that hatches out[MASK] with a three fingered hand <unk> like the archaeopteryx and the same goes for the tails <unk> birds have basically[MASK] rudimentary tails <unk> and so[MASK] we know that[MASK] in embryo <unk> as the animal is developing it actually has[MASK] a relatively long tail <unk> but a gene turns on and resorbs the[MASK] <unk> tail <unk> gets rid of it <unk> so that 's the other gene we 're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so[MASK] what we 're trying to do really is[MASK] take our chicken <unk> modify it[MASK] and make the chickenosaurus[MASK] <unk> just the very basics <unk> so that really is what we 're doing <unk> and people always say why do that why make this thing what good is it [MASK] well that 's a good question [MASK] actually i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and[MASK] quite frankly i think if[MASK] <unk> sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece [MASK] anyway[MASK] when our dino chicken hatches [MASK] it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call a poster chick for technology <unk> entertainment and design <unk> thank you[MASK]
