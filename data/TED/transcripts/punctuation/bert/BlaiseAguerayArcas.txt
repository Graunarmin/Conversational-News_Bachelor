 <unk> about a year and a half ago <unk> stephen lawler <unk> who also gave a talk here at ted in two thousand and seven on virtual earth brought me over[MASK] to become the architect of bing maps which is microsoft 's[MASK] <unk> in the past two and a half we 've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online <unk> [MASK] and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that that one is used to [MASK] so the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning which if you 're familiar at all with seadragon that 's where it comes from [MASK] mapping is of course <unk> not just about[MASK] <unk> it 's also about imagery so as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city like[MASK] virtual view at forty five degrees this can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3d structure of the city all the facades [MASK] now <unk> we see this space this three dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts[MASK] <unk> are really just one of them if you click on[MASK] on this you 'll see some of the ones that we 've put out just in the past couple of months since we 've launched so for example a couple of days after the disaster in haiti we had[MASK] an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky <unk> this wonderful one which i don 't have time to show you is taking[MASK] <unk> blogs in real time and mapping those stories those entries[MASK] to the places that are referred to on the blogs it 's wonderful <unk> but i 'm <unk> i 'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff so[MASK] we see the imagery of course not stopping at the sky <unk> these little green bubbles[MASK] represent photosynths that users have made <unk> i 'm not going to dive into them[MASK] <unk> but photosynths are integrated into the map everything that 's cased in blue is an area where we 've taken imagery on the ground as well [MASK] and so when you fly down thank you when[MASK] you fly down to the ground <unk> and you see this this kind of panoramic imagery the first thing that you might notice is that it 's not just a picture <unk> there 's[MASK] <unk> just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of of the three dimensional city from above so if i click on[MASK] <unk> something to get a closer view of it <unk> [MASK] then the fact that that transition looks as it does is a function of all of that geometry all of that 3d understanding behind this model [MASK] now i 'll[MASK] show you a a fun app[MASK] that we 've we 've been working on a collaboration[MASK] friends at flickr this takes flickr <unk> georegistered imagery[MASK] and uses photosynth like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery so[MASK] i 'm not sure if that 's the one i actually meant to pull up but [MASK] but notice this is of course a popular tourist site and there are lots of photos around here <unk> and these photos are all taken at different[MASK] <unk> taken around five <unk> so that 's the flickr photo that 's our imagery[MASK] <unk> so you really see how how this kind of crowd sourced imagery is integrating in a very deep way <unk> into the map itself[MASK] there are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them of course is time travel and i 'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery[MASK] <unk> there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well <unk> but what 's what 's cool about this is that not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with[MASK] things that are coming in from users but it also is the is the foundation for augmented reality <unk> and that 's something that i 'll be showing you more of in just a moment [MASK] now i just made a transition indoors that 's also interesting ok notice there 's now a roof above us we 're inside[MASK] the pike place market <unk> and this is something that we 're able to do with a backpack camera so we 're now[MASK] <unk> not only not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars <unk> but we 're also imaging[MASK] inside and from here we 're able to do the same sorts of registration <unk> not only of[MASK] of still images but also of video so this is something that we 're now going to try[MASK] <unk> all right i 'm hitting it i 'm punching play <unk> i 'm live <unk> all right there we go so these are our friends in pike place market[MASK] <unk> you pan back over to the corner market <unk> because i want to show points of interest [MASK] no no the other way yeah yeah back to the corner back to the corner i don 't want to see you[MASK] <unk> back to the corner <unk> back to the corner <unk> back to the corner <unk> ok never mind <unk> [MASK] what i wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way <unk> if you 're actually on the spot[MASK] you can think about this this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality[MASK] <unk> let me just take a moment and thank the team they 've done a fantastic job of[MASK] <unk> 'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside <unk> and while i while i walk outside i 'll just mention that[MASK] here we 're using this for telepresence but you can equally well use this[MASK] on the spot for augmented reality when you use it on the spot it means that you 're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you so here we 're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it that was being broadcast by the way on a[MASK] <unk> all right and now there 's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years[MASK] <unk> and that 's curtis wong worldwide telescope [MASK] so we 're going to head over to the dumpsters where it 's traditional after a long day at the market to go out for a break but also stare up at the sky [MASK] this is the integration of worldwide telescope[MASK] into[MASK] our maps[MASK] <unk> current[MASK] thank you this is the current time <unk> if we scrub the time then we can see how[MASK] the sky will look at different times and we can get all of this very detailed information about[MASK] different different times different dates <unk> let 's move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe change the[MASK] change the date i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon[MASK] <unk> so this is an astronomically complete representation of the of the sky integrated right into[MASK] right into the earth all right now i 've overrun my time so i 've got to stop thank you all very much[MASK]
