 <unk> my dad [MASK] my dad has alzheimer 's disease <unk> [MASK] he started showing the symptoms about twelve years ago <unk> and he was officially diagnosed in two thousand and five [MASK] now he 's really pretty sick he needs help eating he needs help getting dressed[MASK] <unk> dressed he doesn 't really know where he is or when it is [MASK] and it 's been really really hard [MASK] my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life <unk> and i 've spent the last decade watching him disappear [MASK] my dad 's not alone there 's about[MASK] thirty five million people globally living with some kind of dementia <unk> and by two thousand and thirty they 're expecting that to double[MASK] <unk> to seventy million that 's a lot of people [MASK] dementia scares us the confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia <unk> the big numbers of people who get it <unk> [MASK] they frighten us <unk> and because of that fear [MASK] we tend to do one of two things [MASK] we go into denial it 's not me <unk> it has nothing to do with me it 's never going to happen to me[MASK] <unk> decide that we 're going to prevent dementia <unk> and it will never happen to us because we 're going to do everything right and it won 't come and get us <unk> [MASK] i 'm looking for a third way <unk> i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease <unk> [MASK] prevention is good <unk> and i 'm doing the things that you can do to prevent alzheimer 's <unk> i 'm eating right <unk> i 'm[MASK] <unk> i 'm keeping my mind active that 's what the research says you should do but the research also shows that there 's nothing that will one hundred percent protect you [MASK] if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get you [MASK] that 's what happened with my dad my dad was a bilingual college professor his hobbies were chess bridge and writing op eds [MASK] he got dementia anyway if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get[MASK] especially if you 're me ' cause alzheimer 's tends to run in families <unk> [MASK] so i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease <unk> [MASK] based on what i 've learned from taking care of my father and researching what it 's like to live with dementia <unk> i 'm focusing on three things in my preparation <unk> [MASK] i 'm changing what i do for fun <unk>[MASK] <unk> i 'm working to build my physical strength <unk> and this is the hard one i 'm trying to become a better person <unk> [MASK] let 's start with the hobbies [MASK] when you get dementia <unk> it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself you can 't sit and have long talks with your old friends because you don 't know who they are [MASK] it 's confusing to watch television and often very frightening <unk> and reading is just about impossible [MASK] when you care for someone with dementia and you get training[MASK] <unk> they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar[MASK] with my dad <unk> that turned out to be letting him fill out forms [MASK] he was a college professor at a state school he knows what paperwork looks like <unk> [MASK] he 'll sign his name on every line he 'll check all the[MASK] <unk> 'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers but it got me thinking what would my caregivers do with me [MASK] i 'm my father 's daughter <unk> i read i write <unk> i think about global health a lot [MASK] would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins would they give me charts and graphs that i could color <unk> [MASK] so i 've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on i 've always liked to draw so i 'm doing it more even though i 'm really very bad at it[MASK] <unk> i am learning some basic origami i can make a really great box [MASK] and i 'm teaching myself to knit which so far i can knit a blob but you[MASK] know it doesn 't matter <unk> if i 'm actually good at it what matters is that my hands know how to do it because the more things that are familiar[MASK] <unk> the more things my hands know how to do the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain 's not running the show anymore [MASK] they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier <unk> easier for their caregivers to look after and[MASK] it may even slow the progress of the disease <unk> [MASK] that all seems like win to me <unk> i want to be as happy as i can for as long as i can [MASK] a lot of people don 't know that alzheimer 's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms[MASK] <unk> lose your sense of balance <unk> you get muscle tremors <unk> [MASK] and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile <unk> they get scared to walk around <unk> they get scared to move <unk> [MASK] so i 'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance <unk> i 'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance so that when i start to lose it i[MASK] 'll still be able to be mobile <unk> [MASK] <unk> so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither <unk> i have more time that i can still move around <unk> [MASK] finally the third thing i 'm trying to become a better person [MASK] my dad was kind and loving before he had alzheimer 's <unk> and he 's kind and loving now [MASK] i 've seen him lose his intellect his sense of humor <unk> his language skills but i 've also seen this <unk> he[MASK] <unk> he loves my sons <unk> he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers <unk> [MASK] and that love makes us want to be around him even now even when it 's so hard when you take away everything[MASK] that he ever learned in this world his naked heart still shines [MASK] i was never as kind as my dad <unk> and i was never as loving <unk> [MASK] and what i need now is to learn to be like that i need a heart so pure that if it 's stripped bare by dementia [MASK] it will survive[MASK] i don 't want to get alzheimer 's disease <unk> what i want is a cure in the next twenty years soon enough to protect me[MASK] <unk> but if it comes for me <unk> i 'm going to be ready <unk> thank you[MASK]
