 <unk> whenever i get to travel for work i try to find out where my drinking water comes from and where my poop and pee go [MASK] this has earned me the nickname the poo princess in my family and it 's ruined many family[MASK] <unk> because this is not normal <unk> but[MASK] thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee [MASK] yeah <unk> and if we use them well <unk> we can live healthier and more beautifully <unk> check out this landscape[MASK] in santa fe new mexico just notice what kinds of words and feelings come to mind [MASK] this landscape was watered with treated sewage water[MASK] does that change anything for you i imagine it might <unk> and that 's ok [MASK] how we feel about this[MASK] is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be <unk> and[MASK] i want to explain how it works <unk> but[MASK] <unk> poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community[MASK] <unk> it looks more like a park than a treatment plant the poo at the very bottom of all those layers of gravel not touching anyone[MASK] is providing solid food for those marsh plants and the clean clear water that comes out the other end[MASK] is traveling underground to water each person 's yard <unk> so even though they 're in a desert they get their own personal oasis [MASK] this approach is called integrated[MASK] <unk> water management or holistic or <unk> closed loop [MASK] whatever you want to call it it 's in conflict with the status quo of how we think about sanitation which is contain <unk> treat push it away <unk> [MASK] but in this approach we 're doing one step better we 're designing for reuse from the very beginning because everything does get reused[MASK] <unk> now we 're planning for it and often that makes for really beautiful spaces <unk> but the most important thing[MASK] about this system isn 't the technicals of how it works it 's how you feel about it [MASK] do you want this in your yard <unk> why not [MASK] i got really curious about this question <unk> why don 't we see more innovation[MASK] <unk> why isn 't that kind of thing the new normal <unk> [MASK] and i care so much about this question <unk> that i work for a nonprofit called recode we want to accelerate adoption of sustainable building and development practices <unk> [MASK] we want more innovation [MASK] but a lot of times whole categories of innovation ones that can help us live more beautifully[MASK] turn out to be illegal today 's regulations and codes were written under the assumption that[MASK] best practices would remain best practices with incremental updates forever and ever [MASK] but innovation isn 't always incremental[MASK] it turns out how we feel about any particular new technique gets into everything we do how we talk about it <unk> how we encourage people to study our jokes our codes and it ultimately determines how innovative we can be [MASK] so that 's the first[MASK] <unk> reason we don 't innovate in sanitation <unk> [MASK] we 're kind of uncomfortable talking about sanitation <unk> [MASK] that 's why i 've gotten called the poo princess so much <unk> the second reason is [MASK] we think the problem is solved here in the us <unk> but not so here in the us we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water <unk>[MASK] <unk> seven million people get sick every year nine hundred die annually and we 're not taking a holistic approach to making it better so we[MASK] 're not solving it [MASK] where i live in portland oregon <unk> i can 't take echo for a swim during the rainy season because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river [MASK] our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant [MASK] too much rain[MASK] overflows into the river <unk> and portland is not alone here forty[MASK] <unk> percent of municipalities <unk> self report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways <unk> [MASK] the other bummer going on here with our status quo[MASK] is that half of all of your poop and pee is going to fertilize farmland <unk> the other half is being incinerated[MASK] or land filled and that 's a bummer to me because there are amazing nutrients in your daily doody it is comparable[MASK] <unk> to pig manure we 're omnivores they 're omnivores think of your poo and pee as a health smoothie for a tree [MASK] the other bummer going on here is that we 're quickly moving all the drugs we take into our waterways <unk> [MASK] the average wastewater treatment plant[MASK] can remove maybe half of the drugs that come in the[MASK] <unk> other half goes right out the other side consider what a cocktail of[MASK] pharmaceuticals hormones steroids vicodin does to a fish to a dog to a child <unk> [MASK] but this isn 't just some problem that we need to contain <unk> [MASK] if we flip this around we can create a resource that can solve so many of our other problems <unk> [MASK] and i want to get you[MASK] <unk> comfortable with this idea <unk> so[MASK] imagine the things i 'm going to show you these technologies <unk> and this attitude that says we[MASK] 're going to reuse this let 's design to make it beautiful as advanced potty training [MASK] i think you 're ready for it <unk> i think we as a culture are ready for advanced potty training <unk> and there are three[MASK] <unk> great reasons to enroll today number one [MASK] we can fertilize our food <unk> [MASK] each one of us is pooping and peeing something that could fertilize half or maybe all of our food depending on our diet <unk>[MASK] that dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what dead stuff bacteria <unk> [MASK] that 's carbon <unk> and carbon if we 're getting that into the soil is going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients[MASK] <unk> chemical fertilizers by definition don 't have carbon in them imagine if we could move our animal manure and our human manure[MASK] to our soil we might not need to rely on fossil <unk> fuel based fertilizers mine minerals from far away <unk> [MASK] imagine how much energy we could[MASK] <unk> some of us are concerned about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle [MASK] that can be addressed <unk> but we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee[MASK] so we can calmly[MASK] talk about how we want to reuse it and what things we don 't want to reuse and get this [MASK] if we change our approach to sanitation we can start to[MASK] <unk> slow down climate change [MASK] remember that carbon in the poop <unk> [MASK] if we can get that into our soil bank it 's going to start to absorb carbon dioxide that we put into the air <unk> [MASK] and that could help slow down global warming <unk>[MASK] i want to show you some brave souls who 've had the courage to[MASK] <unk> embrace this advanced potty training approach [MASK] so those folks in new mexico why did they do it ' cause[MASK] they 're in a desert ' cause they save money <unk> yeah <unk> but more importantly <unk> they felt comfortable[MASK] seeing what was going down the toilet as a resource [MASK] here 's an average house in portland oregon <unk> this house is special because they have a composting toilet turning all their poo and[MASK] <unk> over time into a soil amendment [MASK] their wash water their shower water is going underground to a series of mulch basins <unk> and then watering that orchard downhill <unk> [MASK] when they went to get this permitted <unk> it wasn 't allowed in oregon <unk> but it was allowed in five other states nearby that <unk>[MASK] my organization 's first code change campaign [MASK] here 's a great example where the integrated water management approach[MASK] was the cheapest this is three <unk> high rise residential buildings in downtown portland <unk> and they 're not flushing to the sewer system [MASK] how well their wash water is getting reused[MASK] to flush toilets cool mechanical systems water the landscape <unk> [MASK] and then once the building has thoroughly used everything aka shat in it it 's treated to highest standard right[MASK] <unk> on site by plants and bacteria <unk> and then infiltrated into the groundwater right below and all that[MASK] was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure so that[MASK] 's the last reason we should get really excited about doing things differently we can save a lot of money[MASK] <unk> i keep showing examples where everyone 's reusing everything on site why well when we look at our aging infrastructure and it is old[MASK] and we look at the cost of updating it three quarters of that cost is[MASK] <unk> the pipes snaking through our city <unk> so as we build anew as we renovate it might make more sense[MASK] to treat and reuse everything on site [MASK] san francisco realized that it made sense to invest in rebates for every household to reuse their wash water and their rainwater to water the backyard <unk> [MASK] because the amount of water they would save as a community would be so big[MASK] <unk> but why were all these projects so innovative the money piece <unk> yeah <unk> [MASK] but more importantly they felt comfortable with this idea of advanced potty training [MASK] imagine[MASK] if we embraced innovation for sanitation[MASK] the way we have for say solar power[MASK] <unk> think about it solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable now it 's more a part of our web of power than ever before [MASK] and it 's creating resiliency <unk> we now have sources of power like the sun[MASK] that don 't vary with our earthly dramas [MASK] what 's driving all that innovation it[MASK] 's us we 're talking about energy <unk> it 's cool to talk about energy [MASK] some folks are even talking about the problems with the limited resources where our current[MASK] <unk> energy is coming from we encourage our best and brightest[MASK] to work on this issue better solar panels better batteries everything [MASK] so let 's talk about where our drinking water is coming from where our poo and pee are actually going [MASK] if we can get over this discomfort[MASK] with this entire topic we could create something that creates our future goldmine[MASK] <unk> every time you flush the toilet i want you to think where is my poop and pee going will they be gainfully employed [MASK] or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway if you don 't know find out and if you don 't like the answer <unk> figure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change that you have advanced[MASK] <unk> you are ready for reuse how all of you feel is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be thank you so much[MASK]
