 <unk> friend 's house and she had on her shelf a copy of the dsm manual <unk> which is the manual of mental disorders it lists every known mental[MASK] <unk> and it used to be back in the ' 50s a very slim pamphlet and then it got[MASK] bigger and bigger and bigger and now it 's[MASK] eight hundred and eighty six pages long and it lists currently three hundred and seventy four mental disorders <unk> so i was leafing through it wondering if[MASK] i had any mental disorders and it turns out i 've got twelve i 've got generalized anxiety disorder <unk> which is a[MASK] <unk> i 've got nightmare disorder <unk> which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure <unk> and[MASK] all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going[MASK] <unk> malingering and generalized anxiety disorder because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious <unk> anyway i was looking through this book wondering if i was much crazier than i thought i was <unk>[MASK] or maybe it 's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you 're not a trained professional [MASK] <unk> disorder i didn 't know which of these was true but i thought it was kind of interesting and i thought maybe i should[MASK] meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view <unk> which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists [MASK] it was a man called brian who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies they 're called the cchr <unk> [MASK] and i said to him[MASK] <unk> prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can 't be trusted[MASK] <unk> it 's where they send the serial killers and the people who can 't help themselves and[MASK] i said to brian well what did tony do and he said <unk> hardly anything he[MASK] beat someone up or something <unk> and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence <unk> but he faked[MASK] <unk> now he 's stuck in broadmoor[MASK] and nobody will believe he 's sane do you want us to try and get you into broadmoor to meet tony so i said yes please [MASK] so i got the train to broadmoor i began to yawn uncontrollably around kempton park [MASK] which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious they yawn uncontrollably[MASK] <unk> center <unk> which is where you get to meet the patients <unk> it looks like a giant[MASK] hampton inn <unk> it 's all peach and pine and calming colors and the only[MASK] bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons and the patients started drifting in and they were quite[MASK] <unk> the worst evil in the world but i 'm thinking it 's probably a good idea [MASK] and then brian said here 's tony and a man was walking in and he wasn 't overweight he was in very good physical[MASK] <unk> he was wearing a pinstripe suit and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice he looked like[MASK] a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was[MASK] very sane <unk> [MASK] and he sat down and i said so is it true that you faked your way in here [MASK] and he said yep yep absolutely i beat someone up when i was seventeen and i was in prison awaiting trial and my cellmate said to me ' you know what you have to do[MASK] <unk> fake madness [MASK] tell them you 're mad you 'll get sent to some cushy hospital <unk> nurses will bring you pizzas you 'll have your own playstation ' i said well how did you do it he said well i asked to see the[MASK] prison psychiatrist and i 'd just seen a film called ' crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls[MASK] <unk> a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library anyway he faked madness[MASK] too well <unk> he said and they didn 't send him to some cushy hospital[MASK] and the minute he got there said he took one look at the place asked to see the psychiatrist said there 's been a terrible misunderstanding <unk> i 'm not mentally ill [MASK] i said how long have you been here for [MASK] he said well if i 'd just done my time in prison for the original crime i 'd have got five years <unk> [MASK] i 've been in broadmoor for twelve years [MASK] tony said that it 's a lot harder[MASK] to convince people you 're sane than it is to convince them you 're crazy he said [MASK] i thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what 's on tv <unk> [MASK] i subscribe to new scientist and recently they had an article about how the u s army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives[MASK] <unk> did you know that the u s army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives '[MASK] when i read my medical notes i saw they 'd written ' believes bees can sniff out explosives ' he said [MASK] you know they 're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state <unk> but[MASK] how do you sit in a sane way how do you cross your legs in a sane way it 's just impossible when tony said that to me i thought to myself am i[MASK] sitting like a journalist[MASK] am i crossing my legs like a journalist he said <unk> you know <unk> i 've got the[MASK] stockwell strangler on one side of me <unk> [MASK] and i 've got the ' tiptoe through the tulips ' rapist on the other side of me <unk> so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening <unk> and they take that as a sign of madness <unk> they say it proves that i 'm aloof[MASK] <unk> only in broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness anyway he seemed completely normal to me but what did i know [MASK] and when i got home i emailed his clinician anthony maden i said what 's the story [MASK] and he said yep we accept that tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because[MASK] his hallucinations that had seemed quite cliche to begin with just[MASK] <unk> vanished the minute he got to broadmoor however <unk> we have assessed him and we 've determined that what he is[MASK] is a psychopath [MASK] and in fact faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath it 's on the checklist cunning manipulative [MASK] so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong <unk> and i spoke to other experts and[MASK] they said the pinstripe suit classic psychopath speaks to items one and two on[MASK] <unk> the checklist <unk> glibness superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth and i said well but why didn 't he hang out with the[MASK] the other patients classic psychopath it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy so all the things that had seemed most[MASK] normal about tony was evidence according[MASK] to his clinician that he was mad in this new way <unk> he was a psychopath <unk> and his clinician said to me if you want to know more[MASK] <unk> about psychopaths you can go on a[MASK] course run by robert hare who invented the psychopath checklist so i did i went on a <unk> psychopath spotting course and i am now[MASK] a certified and i have to say extremely adept psychopath spotter [MASK] <unk> 's the statistics one in a hundred regular people is a psychopath so there 's one[MASK] thousand five hundred people in his room <unk> fifteen of you are psychopaths <unk> [MASK] although that figure rises to four percent of[MASK] ceos and business leaders so i think there 's a very good chance there 's about[MASK] thirty or forty psychopaths in this room[MASK] <unk> be carnage by the end of the night [MASK] laughter hare said the reason why is because[MASK] capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior the[MASK] lack of empathy the glibness <unk> cunning[MASK] <unk> in fact capitalism perhaps at its most remorseless is a physical manifestation of psychopathy it 's like a form of psychopathy that 's[MASK] come down to[MASK] affect us all[MASK] hare said you know what forget about some guy at broadmoor who[MASK] may or may not have faked madness who cares that 's not a big story the big story he said is corporate psychopathy you want to go and interview yourself[MASK] <unk> so i gave it a try i wrote to the[MASK] enron people i said could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you 're psychopaths and[MASK] they didn 't reply [MASK] so i changed tack i emailed chainsaw al dunlap the[MASK] asset stripper from the <unk>[MASK] he would come into failing businesses and close down thirty percent of the workforce just turn american towns into[MASK] <unk> ghost towns and[MASK] i emailed him and i said i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and[MASK] interested in the predatory spirit and fearless can i come and interview you about your special brain anomaly and he said come on over [MASK] so i went to al dunlap 's grand[MASK] <unk> 've got sharks and he was saying this in a less effeminate way you 've got more sharks and you 've got[MASK] tigers it was like narnia [MASK] and then we went into his kitchen[MASK] now al dunlap would be brought in to[MASK] save failing companies he 'd close down thirty percent of the workforce and he 'd quite often fire people with a joke like[MASK] for instance one famous story about him somebody came up to him and said i 've just bought myself a new car and he said <unk> well you may have a new car but i 'll tell you what you don 't have[MASK] <unk> so in his kitchen he was in there with his wife judy and his bodyguard sean and i said you know how i said in my email that you might have a special[MASK] brain anomaly that makes you special he said yeah it 's an amazing theory it 's like star trek you 're going where no man has gone before and i said[MASK] <unk> i 've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket can i[MASK] go through them with you and he looked intrigued despite himself and he said okay go on and i said okay <unk> [MASK] grandiose sense of self worth which i have to say would have been[MASK] <unk> who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions[MASK] <unk> going down the psychopath checklist basically turning it into who moved my cheese [MASK] but i did notice something happening to me the day i was with al dunlap whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal like <unk>[MASK] <unk> he said no to juvenile delinquency he said he got accepted into west point <unk> and[MASK] <unk> 's only ever been married twice admittedly his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like but people say[MASK] stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted forty one years <unk> so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of <unk>[MASK] <unk> i thought to myself well i 'm not going to put that in my book <unk> and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned[MASK] me a little bit psychopathic because i was desperate to shove him in a[MASK] box marked psychopath i was desperate to define him by his[MASK] maddest edges and i realized my god this is what i 've been doing for twenty years it 's what all journalists do we travel across the world with our notepads[MASK] <unk> we wait for the gems <unk> and the gems are always the[MASK] outermost aspects of our interviewee 's personality and we stitch them together like medieval monks and we[MASK] leave the normal stuff on the floor <unk> and you know this is a country that[MASK] <unk> certain mental disorders hugely childhood bipolar children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums[MASK] <unk> which scores them high on the[MASK] bipolar checklist <unk> when i got back to london tony phoned me he said why haven 't you been returning my calls[MASK] <unk> say you feel remorse for your crime they say ' typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn 't ' it 's like witchcraft <unk> they turn everything <unk>[MASK] <unk> i 've got a tribunal coming up will you come to it [MASK] so i said okay <unk> so i went to his tribunal and after fourteen years in broadmoor they let him go[MASK] <unk> decided that he shouldn 't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of[MASK] recidivism so they let him go and outside in the corridor he said to me you know what jon everyone 's a bit psychopathic[MASK] <unk> to go to belgium there 's a woman there that i fancy but she 's married so i 'm going to have to get her split up from her husband [MASK] anyway that was two years ago and that 's where my book ended and for the last twenty[MASK] <unk> everything was fine nothing bad happened he was living with a girl outside london <unk> he was according to brian the scientologist making up for lost time <unk> [MASK] which i know sounds ominous but isn 't necessarily ominous <unk> [MASK] unfortunately after twenty months he did go back to jail for[MASK] a month he[MASK] got into a fracas in a bar he called it ended up going to jail for a month which i know is bad but at least a month implies that[MASK] <unk> 't too bad <unk> and then he phoned me <unk> and you know what i think it 's right[MASK] that tony is out because you shouldn 't define people by their maddest edges and what tony is is he 's <unk>[MASK] he 's a gray area in a world that[MASK] <unk> the gray areas are where you find[MASK] the complexity it 's where you find the[MASK] humanity and it 's where you find the truth [MASK] and tony said to me jon[MASK] <unk> could i buy you a drink in a bar i just want to thank you for everything you 've done for me and i didn 't go what would[MASK] <unk> you have done thank you[MASK]
