 <unk> first year of grad school i found myself in my bedroom eating lots of ben jerry 's watching some trashy tv and maybe maybe listening to taylor swift[MASK] i had just gone through a breakup laughter so for the longest time all i would do is recall the memory of this[MASK] <unk> person over and over again wishing that i could get rid of that gut wrenching visceral blah feeling[MASK] now as it turns out i 'm a neuroscientist[MASK] so i knew that the memory of that person and the awful emotional undertones that color in that memory are largely mediated by separate brain systems[MASK] and so i thought what if we could go into the brain and edit out that nauseating feeling but while keeping the memory of that person intact[MASK] then i realized maybe that 's a little bit lofty for now so what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with[MASK] could we jump start that memory back to life maybe even play with the contents of that memory[MASK] all that said there is one person in the entire world right now that i really hope is not watching this talk laughter[MASK] so there is a catch there[MASK] <unk> a catch[MASK] these ideas probably remind you of total recall eternal sunshine of the spotless mind or of inception but the movie stars that we work with are the celebrities of the lab xu liu[MASK] test mice laughter[MASK] as neuroscientists we work in the lab with mice trying to understand how memory works[MASK] and today we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a[MASK] <unk> memory in the brain at the speed of light[MASK] to do this there 's only two simple steps to follow first you find and label a memory in the brain[MASK] and then you activate it with a switch as simple as that laughter sr are you convinced[MASK] so turns out finding a memory in the brain isn 't all that easy xl indeed this is way more difficult than let 's say[MASK] <unk> finding a needle in a haystack[MASK] because at least you know the needle is still something you can physically put your fingers on but memory is not[MASK] and also there 's way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a[MASK] typical haystack[MASK] so yeah this task does seem to be daunting but luckily we got help from the brain itself it turned out that[MASK] <unk> all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory and then the brain will tell us which cells are involved in that particular memory sr[MASK] so what was going on in my brain while i was recalling the memory of an ex if you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory[MASK] now one brain region that would be[MASK] <unk> robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory xl[MASK] when you zoom in into the hippocampus of course you will see lots of cells[MASK] but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory[MASK] because whenever a cell is active like[MASK] <unk> when it 's forming a memory it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active sr[MASK] so the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody 's probably working there at any given moment in a very real sense there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working[MASK] <unk> sort of biological windows that light up to let us know that that cell was just active xl so we clipped part of this sensor and attached that to a switch to control the cells[MASK] and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice[MASK] so whenever a memory is being formed any active cells for that memory will also have this switch installed sr[MASK] so here is what the hippocampus looks like after forming a fear memory for example[MASK] the sea of blue that[MASK] <unk> see here are densely packed brain cells but the green brain cells the green brain cells are the ones that are holding on to a specific fear memory[MASK] so you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear[MASK] you 're actually looking at the cross section of a memory right now xl[MASK] now for the switch we have been talking about ideally the switch has to act really fast it shouldn 't take minutes or hours to work it should act[MASK] at the speed of the brain in milliseconds sr so what do you think xu could we use let 's say pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells xl nah[MASK] drugs are pretty messy they spread everywhere and also it takes them forever to act on cells so it will not allow us to control a memory in real time[MASK] so steve how about let 's zap the brain with electricity sr so[MASK] <unk> electricity is pretty fast but we probably wouldn 't be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory and we 'd probably fry the brain xl oh that 's true[MASK] so it looks like hmm indeed we need to find a better way to impact the brain at the speed of light sr so[MASK] it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light[MASK] so maybe we could activate or[MASK] <unk> memories by just using light xl that 's pretty fast sr and because normally brain cells don 't respond to pulses of light so those that would respond to pulses of light are those that contain a light <unk>[MASK] <unk> sensitive switch now to do that first we need to trick brain cells to respond to laser beams xl yep you heard it right we are trying to shoot lasers into the brain laughter sr[MASK] and the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics optogenetics gave us this light[MASK] <unk> switch that we can use to turn brain cells on or off and the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin seen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell[MASK] you can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light sensitive switch that can be artificially installed in brain cells so that now we can use that switch to activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it and in this case we click it on with pulses of light xl[MASK] so we attach this light sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin to[MASK] <unk> the sensor we 've been talking about and inject this into the brain[MASK] so whenever a memory is being formed any active cell for that particular memory will also have this light sensitive switch installed in it[MASK] so that we can control these cells by the flipping of a laser just like this one you see sr[MASK] so let 's put all of this to the test now what we can do is we can take our mice[MASK] <unk> then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box they learn that something bad happened here[MASK] now with our system the cells that are active in the hippocampus[MASK] in the making of this memory only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin xl when you are as small as a mouse[MASK] <unk> the whole world is trying to get you so your best response of defense is trying to be undetected[MASK] whenever a mouse is in fear it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box trying to not move any part of its body and this posture is called freezing[MASK] so if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box and when[MASK] <unk> put them back into the same box it will basically show freezing because it doesn 't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box sr so you can think of freezing as[MASK] <unk> you 're walking down the street minding your own business and then out of nowhere you almost run into an ex girlfriend or ex boyfriend[MASK] if you put the mouse in a completely different new box like the next one[MASK] it will not be afraid of this box because there 's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment[MASK] but what if we put the mouse in this new box but at the same time we activate the fear memory using lasers just like we did before[MASK] are we going to bring back the fear[MASK] <unk> memory for the first box into this completely new environment sr all right and here 's the million dollar experiment now to bring back to life the memory of that day[MASK] <unk> i remember that the red sox had just won it was a green spring day perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the north end to get some cannolis justsaying[MASK] <unk> and i on the other hand were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen[MASK] <unk> we were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique xl and this is what we saw[MASK] they want to know what 's going on in this new box it 's interesting[MASK] but the moment we turned on the laser like you see now[MASK] all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode it stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body[MASK] clearly it 's freezing[MASK] so indeed it looks like we are able to bring back the fear memory for the first box in this completely new environment[MASK] <unk> while watching this steve and i are as shocked as the mouse itself laughter[MASK] so after the experiment the two of us just left the room without saying anything[MASK] after a kind of long awkward period of time[MASK] steve broke the silence sr did that just work xl yes i said indeed it worked[MASK] we 're really excited about this[MASK] and then we published[MASK] <unk> our findings in the journal nature[MASK] ever since the publication of our work we 've been receiving numerous comments from all over the internet maybe we can take a look at some of those[MASK] <unk> scale of zero to morgan freeman 's voice it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that i 've heard come our way laughter but[MASK] as you 'll see it 's not the only opinion that 's out there this scares the hell out of me what if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years oh my god we 're doomed xl indeed if we take a look at the second one i think we can all agree that it 's meh[MASK] probably not as positive[MASK] but this also reminds us that although we are still working with mice it 's probably a good idea to start thinking and[MASK] <unk> discussing about the possible ethical ramifications of memory control sr[MASK] now in the spirit of the third quote we want to tell you about a recent project that we 've been working on in lab that we 've called project inception they should make a movie about this where they plant ideas into peoples minds[MASK] so they can control them for their own personal gain we 'll call it inception so[MASK] we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory what if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory could we possibly even turn it into a false memory[MASK] <unk> so all memory is sophisticated and dynamic but if just for simplicity let 's imagine memory as a movie clip[MASK] so far what we 've told you is basically we can control this play button of the clip so that we can play this video clip any time anywhere[MASK] but is there a possibility that we can actually get inside the brain and edit this movie clip so that we can make it different[MASK] <unk> the original yes we can[MASK] turned out that all we need to do is basically reactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before but at the same time if we present new <unk>[MASK] <unk> information and allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory[MASK] <unk> remix tape sr so[MASK] how do we do this[MASK] rather than finding a fear memory in the brain we can start by taking our animals and let 's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before[MASK] now the next day we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they 've never experienced before we can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box[MASK] so what would happen here if while the[MASK] <unk> animal is recalling the memory of the blue box we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks[MASK] so here we 're trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves we 're just trying to connect the two[MASK] so to test if we had done so we can take our animals once again and place them back in the blue box again we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box[MASK] while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks[MASK] and now the animal suddenly freezes it 's as though it 's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened[MASK] so it formed a false memory because it 's falsely fearing an environment where technically speaking nothing bad actually happened to it xl[MASK] so so far we are only talking about this light controlled on switch[MASK] in fact we also have a light[MASK] <unk> off switch[MASK] and it 's very easy to imagine that by installing this light controlled off switch we can also turn off a memory any time anywhere[MASK] so everything we 've been talking about today is based on this[MASK] philosophically charged principle of neuroscience that the mind with its seemingly mysterious properties is actually made of physical stuff that[MASK] we can tinker with sr and for me personally i see a world where we can reactivate any kind of memory that we 'd like i also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories[MASK] now i even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality because we 're living in a time where it 's possible to pluck questions from the tree of science fiction and to ground them in experimental reality xl[MASK] nowadays people in the lab and people in other groups all over the world are using similar methods to activate or edit memories whether that 's old or new positive[MASK] or negative[MASK] all sorts of memories so that we can understand how memory works sr for example one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted <unk>[MASK] <unk> them into a pleasurable memory just like that that 's exactly what i mean about editing these kinds of processes[MASK] <unk> we are living in a very exciting moment where science doesn 't have any arbitrary speed limits but is only bound by our own imagination sr and finally what <unk>[MASK] <unk> do we make of all this how do we push this technology forward these are the questions that should not remain just inside the lab[MASK] <unk> to actively engage everybody in this conversation[MASK] so let 's think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here because xu and i think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us[MASK]
