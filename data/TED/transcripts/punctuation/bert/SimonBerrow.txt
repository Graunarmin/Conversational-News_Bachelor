 <unk> basking sharks are awesome creatures <unk> they are just magnificent <unk> they grow ten meters long some say bigger[MASK] <unk> they might weigh up to two tons [MASK] some say up to five tons they 're the second largest fish in the world <unk> they 're also harmless plankton feeding animals and they are thought to be able to[MASK] <unk> filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour[MASK] and can feed on thirty kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive <unk> they 're fantastic creatures we 're very lucky in ireland we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them <unk> [MASK] they were very important to coastal communities going back hundreds of years[MASK] especially around the claddaghduff connemara[MASK] <unk> subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats sometimes way offshore to a place called the sunfish bank <unk> about thirty miles west of achill island to kill the basking sharks this is a woodcut from about the <unk>[MASK] <unk> they were very important for the oil out of their liver a third of the basking shark 's size is their liver and it 's full of oil gallons of oil <unk> that oil was used especially for lighting but also for dressing wounds and other things in fact the streetlights in one thousand seven[MASK] <unk> of galway dublin and waterford were lit with sunfish oil sunfish is one of the words for basking sharks <unk> so they were incredibly important animals <unk> they 've been around a long time very important to coastal communities [MASK] <unk> basking shark fishery in the world is that from achill island <unk> this is keem bay up in achill island <unk> sharks used to come into the bay and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland string it out an[MASK] <unk> and as the shark came round <unk> it would hit the net the net would collapse on it it would often drown and suffocate or at times they would row out in their small <unk> curraghs and kill it with a lance through the back <unk>[MASK] <unk> of the neck and then they 'd tow the sharks back to purteen harbour <unk> boil them up use the oil <unk> they also used[MASK] <unk> maybe five or six people get killed by by sharks every year <unk> there was someone recently wasn 't there just a couple weeks ago <unk> we kill about one hundred million sharks a year so i don 't[MASK] know what the balance is but i think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them <unk> [MASK] it was a well documented fishery as you can see here it peaked in the ' 50s where they were killing one thousand five hundred sharks a year <unk> and it declined very fast a classic boom and bust fishery <unk> which suggests that[MASK] a stock has been depleted or there 's low reproductive rates <unk> they killed about twelve thousand sharks within this period literally just by stringing[MASK] a manila rope off the tip of of keem bay up in achill island [MASK] sharks were still killed up into the <unk> mid 80s especially out of places like dunmore east in county waterford about two and a half three thousand sharks were killed up till ' eighty five[MASK] <unk> but these are norwegian basking shark hunting vessels the black line in the crow 's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a[MASK] whaling vessel <unk> the importance of basking sharks to to the coast communities is recognized through the language[MASK] i don 't pretend to [ know many irish words ] but in kerry they were often known as[MASK] <unk> the great fish of the sun that 's a lovely evocative name on tory island a strange place anyway they were known as muldoons no one seems to know why hope[MASK] there 's no one from tory here lovely place [MASK] but more commonly all around the island they were known as the sunfish and this[MASK] <unk> represents their habit of basking on the surface[MASK] when the sun is out there 's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout throughout the world[MASK] some say it 's not population decline it might be a change in the distribution of plankton it 's been suggested that these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change as they 're basically continuous plankton recorders <unk> swimming around with their mouth open <unk> [MASK] they 're now listed as vulnerable under the <unk>[MASK] <unk> to try and stop catching them there 's now a ban on catching <unk> and even landing them even landing ones caught accidentally <unk> they 're not protected in ireland in fact they have no legislative status in ireland whatsoever <unk>[MASK] despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside [MASK] behavior on the surface i only found out[MASK] last year at a conference on the isle of man just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly frequently and predictably come to the surface to <unk>[MASK] it 's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks they are awesome creatures[MASK] it gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them to get access to them what we 've been doing for a couple years last year was a big year is we started tagging[MASK] sharks <unk> so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity[MASK] <unk> and movement and things like that <unk> so we concentrated mainly in north donegal and west kerry as the two areas where where i was mainly active <unk> and[MASK] we tagged them very simply not very high tech with a big long pole this is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end you go up in your boat[MASK] and tag the shark[MASK] and we were[MASK] <unk> one hundred and five sharks last summer we got fifty in three days[MASK] off inishowen peninsula <unk> half the challenge to get access is to be in the right place at the right time <unk> but it 's a very simple easy technique [MASK] i 'll show you what it looks like [MASK] we use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark one it 's to try and work out the gender of the shark <unk> we also deployed some satellite tags so we did use high tech stuff as well <unk> these are archival tags[MASK] <unk> what they do is store the data a satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite and sharks and fish are underwater most of the time so this tag actually works out the locations of shark <unk> depending on the[MASK] timing and the setting of the sun plus water temperature and depth <unk> and you have to kind of reconstruct the path [MASK] what happens is you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period in this case eight months and literally to the day the tag popped off drifted up said hello to the satellite and[MASK] not all the data but enough data for us to use <unk> this is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements when they 're underwater <unk> [MASK] and here 's a couple of maps that we 've done in that one [MASK] you can see that we tagged both off kerry basically it spent all its time the last eight months in irish waters on christmas it was out on the shelf edge <unk> here 's one we haven 't[MASK] <unk> and water depth <unk> but again the second shark spent most of its time in and around the irish sea <unk> colleagues from the isle of man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the isle of man to nova scotia <unk>[MASK] in about ninety days <unk> nine and a half thousand kilometers we never thought that happened another colleague in the states tagged about twenty sharks off massachusetts his tags didn 't really work all he knows <unk>[MASK] is where he tagged them and where they popped off his tags popped off in the caribbean <unk> and even in brazil[MASK] <unk> basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in[MASK] our latitudes but in actual fact <unk> they 're obviously crossing the equator as well <unk> so very simple things like that we 're trying to learn about basking sharks <unk> [MASK] one thing that i think is a very[MASK] surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is i 'm not a geneticist so i won[MASK] <unk> to understand the genetics and that 's why it 's great to have collaboration whereas i 'm a field person i get panic attacks if i have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on [MASK] take me away[MASK] <unk> so we can work with geneticists who understand that <unk> so when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks <unk> they found that the diversity was incredibly low if you look at the first line really you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar[MASK] <unk> come from a common ancestry [MASK] but if you look at nucleotide diversity <unk> which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents you see that basking sharks if you look at the first study [MASK] was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species you can see this work was only done in two thousand and six before two thousand and six we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks we had no idea did they distinguish into different populations[MASK] <unk> that 's very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals <unk> so [MASK] les noble in aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really <unk> so[MASK] he did another study using[MASK] microsatellites which is much more expensive much more time consuming and to his surprise came up with almost identical results <unk> [MASK] so it does seem to be that basking sharks for some reason have incredibly low diversity and it 's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck[MASK] <unk> thought to have been twelve thousand years ago <unk> and this has caused a very low diversity and yet if you look at the whale shark which is the other plankton eating large[MASK] shark <unk> its diversity is much greater so it doesn 't really make sense at all [MASK] they found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world 's oceans of basking sharks even though they 're found throughout the world you couldn 't tell the difference genetically from one from the pacific atlantic new zealand[MASK] <unk> africa <unk> they all basically seem the same which again <unk> is kind of surprising you wouldn 't expect that <unk> [MASK] i don 't understand or pretend to understand this i suspect most geneticists don 't either but they produce the numbers so you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics [MASK] and rus hoelzel came up with an effective population size eight thousand two hundred animals that 's it[MASK] eight thousand animals in the world you 're thinking[MASK] that 's ridiculous no way so les did a finer study <unk> and he found out it came out about nine thousand[MASK] using different microsatellites gave the different results but the mean of all these studies[MASK] <unk> is about five thousand <unk> which i personally don 't believe but then i am a skeptic <unk> [MASK] but even if you toss a few numbers around you 're probably talking an effective population of about twenty thousand animals do you remember how many they killed off achill[MASK] <unk> in the 70s and the 50s so what it tells us actually is that[MASK] there 's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small in fact of those twenty thousand eight thousand were thought to be females there[MASK] 's only eight thousand basking shark females in the world <unk> i don 't know <unk> i don 't believe it [MASK] the problem with this is they were[MASK] <unk> didn 't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail so where do you get[MASK] samples from for your genetic analysis [MASK] well one obvious source is dead sharks dead sharks washed up we might get two or three dead sharks washed up in ireland a year if we 're kind of lucky <unk> [MASK] another source would be fisheries ' bycatch we were getting quite a few caught in in surface drift nets that 's banned now[MASK] <unk> and some are caught in nets in trawls this is a shark that was actually landed in howth[MASK] just before christmas illegally <unk> because you 're not allowed to do that under eu law and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak they even put a recipe up on the wall until they were told it was illegal they actually did get a fine for that <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] if you look at all those studies i showed you the total number of[MASK] <unk> it 's very important work and they can ask some really good questions and tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure <unk> but they 're constrained by lack of samples[MASK] when we were out tagging our sharks this is how we tagged them on on the front of a rib get in there fast[MASK] occasionally the sharks do react on one occasion when we were up in malin head in[MASK] <unk> the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail more i think in startle to the fact that a boat came near it rather than[MASK] the tag going in <unk> and that that was fine we got wet <unk> no problem <unk> and then when myself and emmett got back to[MASK] to malin head [MASK] to the pier <unk> i noticed some black slime on the front of the boat i used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats and i remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net because it leaves a black slime behind[MASK] in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable <unk> we would use conventional methods i have a crossbow you see it in my hand there [MASK] which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well <unk> so i tried that i tried many techniques all it was doing was breaking my arrows <unk> [MASK] because the shark 's skin is just so strong there was no way we were going to get a sample from that[MASK] <unk> that wasn 't going to work <unk> so when i saw the black slime on the on the bow of the boat i thought if you take what you 're given in this world so i scraped it off i had a little tube[MASK] with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists so i scraped the slime off and sent it to aberdeen and said [MASK] you might try that and they sat on it for months it was only because we had a conference on the isle of man <unk> but i kept emailing les saying have you had a chance to look at my slime[MASK] he might lose face if he hadn 't done the thing i sent him[MASK] and he was amazed that they actually got dna from the slime they amplified it and they tested it and they found yes this was actually basking shark[MASK] dna which was got from the slime <unk> so he was very excited it became known as simon 's shark slime[MASK] <unk> slime <unk> so having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags [MASK] i then thought i 'd invest seven point nine five the price is still on it in my local hardware store in kilrush for a mop handle [MASK] and even less money on some oven cleaners <unk> and i wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle[MASK] <unk> desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks and this was into august now and normally sharks peak in june july and you rarely see them or rarely can be in the right place to find sharks into august <unk>[MASK] we were desperate so we rushed out to the blaskets as soon as we heard there were sharks there [MASK] and managed to find some sharks so by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat[MASK] you see a shark running under the boat here[MASK] <unk> we managed to collect slime <unk> and here it is look at that lovely black[MASK] shark slime <unk> [MASK] and in about half an hour <unk> we got five samples five individual sharks were sampled using simon 's shark slime sampling system [MASK] <unk> a bit more dramatic you probably saw the humpback whale footage we got a month or two ago off county wexford <unk> and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind and i was thinking of[MASK] humpback whales breaching and dolphins <unk> but hey[MASK] sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come so this is possibly going to be my my legacy[MASK] <unk> we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples one thing that <unk> that is very useful is that we use a pole camera this is my colleague joanne with a pole camera where you can look underneath <unk>[MASK] <unk> the shark what you 're trying to look at is the males have claspers <unk> which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark <unk> so you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark <unk> if we can tell the gender of the shark before we[MASK] <unk> we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female <unk> because in the moment they have no way <unk> genetically of telling the difference between a male and a female <unk> which i find staggering[MASK] because they don 't know what primers to look for being able to tell the gender of a shark is very important for things like[MASK] policing the trade in in basking shark and other species through the sightings because it is illegal to trade[MASK] <unk> and they are caught and are on the market[MASK] <unk> so as a field biologist you just want to get encounters with these animals and learn as much as you can they 're often quite brief they 're often very seasonally constrained you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can[MASK] but[MASK] isn 't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines such as the geneticists who can gain so much more from that[MASK] <unk> as i said these things are sent to you in strange ways grab them while you can i 'll take that as my scientific legacy hopefully i might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before i die <unk> but[MASK] for the time being thank you for that and keep an eye out for sharks <unk> if you 're more interested we have a basking shark website now set up so thank you and thank you for listening[MASK]
