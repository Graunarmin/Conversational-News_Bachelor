<unk>[MASK] what was going to become of us [MASK] my mom applied for refugee status <unk> she 's a wonderful smart woman that one and we were lucky australia said we will take you in[MASK] good job aussies before[MASK] we were meant to travel my mom came home one day and said we 're going on a little holiday a little trip [MASK] she put us in a car and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in gambia [MASK] in this bush we found two huts an old lady[MASK] came towards us she was <unk>[MASK] <unk> very old she had a chat with my mom <unk> and went back then she came back and walked[MASK] away from us into a second hut <unk> [MASK] i 'm standing there thinking this is very confusing i don 't know what 's going on the next thing i knew my mom took me into this hut <unk> [MASK] she took my clothes off <unk> and then she pinned me down on[MASK] <unk> the floor [MASK] i struggled and tried to get her off me but i couldn 't [MASK] then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife one of the sharp knives orange looking has never seen water or sunlight before [MASK] i thought she was going to slaughter me <unk> but she didn 't [MASK] she slowly slid down my body[MASK] and ended up where my vagina is[MASK] <unk> she took hold of what i now know to be my clitoris [MASK] she took that rusty knife <unk> and started cutting away inch[MASK] by inch i screamed <unk> i cried <unk> and asked my mom to get off me[MASK] so this pain will stop but all she did was say[MASK] <unk> quiet this old lady sawed away[MASK] at my flesh for what felt like forever and then when she was done she threw that piece of flesh[MASK] across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she 's ever touched [MASK] they both got off me and left me there bleeding crying and confused as to[MASK] <unk> what[MASK] just[MASK] happened <unk> [MASK] we never talked about this again very soon we found that we were coming to australia [MASK] and this is when you had the sydney olympics at the time <unk> and people said we were going to the end of the world there was nowhere else to go after australia [MASK] yeah that comforted us a bit it[MASK] took us three days to get here <unk> we went to senegal <unk> then france and[MASK] <unk> singapore <unk> we went to the bathroom to wash our hands <unk> we spent fifteen minutes opening the tap like this [MASK] then somebody came in slid their hand under and water came out and we thought is this what we 're in for like seriously[MASK] <unk> we got to adelaide [MASK] <unk> small place where literally they dumped us in adelaide that 's what i would say they dumped us there we were very grateful [MASK] we settled and we liked it we were like we 're home we 're here [MASK] then somebody took us to rundle mall adelaide has only one mall it 's this small place <unk> [MASK] and we saw a lot of asian people my mom said all of a sudden panicking you brought us to the wrong place <unk> you must take us back to australia[MASK] <unk> had to be explained to her that[MASK] there were a lot of asians in australia and we were in the right place <unk> so fine it 's all good [MASK] my mom then had this brilliant idea that i should go to a girls school because they were less racist i don 't know where she read that publication [MASK] never found evidence of it to this day <unk> [MASK] six hundred white kids <unk> and i was the only black child[MASK] <unk> person with a bit of a color on me <unk> let me say that chocolate color <unk> [MASK] there were no asians no indigenous [MASK] all we had was some tan girls girls who felt the need to be under the sun it wasn 't the same as my chocolate though not the same [MASK] settling in australia was quite hard but it became harder when i started volunteering for an organization called women 's health statewide[MASK] and i joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about <unk> [MASK] or that it related to me in any way <unk> [MASK] i spent months educating nurses and doctors about what female genital mutilation was and where it was practiced <unk> africa the middle east asia and now australia and london and america because [MASK] as we all know we live in a multicultural society[MASK] and people who come from those backgrounds[MASK] come with their culture <unk> [MASK] and sometimes sometimes <unk> they have cultural practices that we may not agree with but they continue to practice them <unk> [MASK] one day <unk> i was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation fgm i will just say fgm for short [MASK] type i is when they cut off the hood[MASK] ii is when they cut off the whole clitoris and some of your labia majora <unk> or your outer lips <unk> [MASK] and type iii is when they cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period [MASK] my eyes went onto type ii [MASK] before all of this i pretty much had amnesia <unk> i was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened i didn 't remember any of it[MASK] yes i was aware something bad happened to me <unk> but i had no recollection of what had happened [MASK] i knew i had a scar down there <unk> but i thought everybody had a scar down there this had happened to everybody else but[MASK] when i looked at type ii [MASK] it all came back to me <unk> i remembered what was done to me <unk> i remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down[MASK] <unk> words cannot express the pain[MASK] i felt the confusion that i felt because now i realized that what was done to me was a terrible[MASK] thing that in this society was called barbaric it was called mutilation <unk> my mother had said it was called circumcision but here it was[MASK] <unk> i went home and said to my mom you did something this is not the african thing to do pointing at your mother <unk> but[MASK] <unk> she 's used to me mouthing off <unk> [MASK] i 'm like those years ago <unk> you circumcised me <unk> you cut away something that belonged to me [MASK] she said yes i did [MASK] i did it for your own good <unk> [MASK] it was in your best interest[MASK] <unk> if you were not circumcised you would get itchy down there women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time <unk> then they sleep around with everybody [MASK] you are not going to sleep around with anybody[MASK] <unk> empowerment was very strange [MASK] that was the end of our first conversation <unk> i went back to school [MASK] these were the days when we had dolly and girlfriend magazines there was always the sealed section anybody remember those sealed sections <unk> the naughty bits[MASK] <unk> pleasure and relationships and of course sex[MASK] but it always assumed that you had a clitoris <unk> though and i thought [MASK] this doesn 't fit me this doesn 't talk about people like me i don 't have a clitoris <unk> [MASK] i watched tv and those women would moan like oh oh i was like these people and their damned clitoris[MASK] <unk> what is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life <unk> that 's what i want to know i want to do that too oh oh and all of that [MASK] didn 't happen so i came home once again and said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said[MASK] i deserve pleasure <unk> that i should be having[MASK] <unk> was dolly that said that and[MASK] i thought to myself i had an inner joke in my head that said [MASK] i will marry a white man he won 't have that problem with me [MASK] so i said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said[MASK] <unk> i deserve pleasure and do you know[MASK] what you have taken away from me what you have denied me [MASK] you have invaded me in the most sacred way <unk> i want pleasure <unk> i want to get horny dammit[MASK] <unk> she didn 't get it we came from two different worlds when she was growing up not having a clitoris was the norm <unk> it was celebrated [MASK] i was an african australian[MASK] <unk> so once i went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion [MASK] i remember booking an appointment with my therapist yes i 'm an african who has a therapist there you go <unk> [MASK] and i said to her [MASK] i was thirteen i was a child i was settling in a new country i was dealing with racism and discrimination <unk> [MASK] english is my third language <unk> and then[MASK] <unk> to her i feel like i 'm not a woman[MASK] because of what was done to me <unk> i feel incomplete <unk> [MASK] am i going to be asexual [MASK] because from what i knew about fgm the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women <unk> it 's so that we don 't have any sexual desire[MASK] <unk> asexual now will i just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex not enjoying sex [MASK] she couldn 't answer my questions so they went unanswered [MASK] when i started having my period around the age of fourteen i realized i didn 't have normal periods because of fgm [MASK] my periods were heavy they were long and they were very[MASK] painful <unk> then they told me i had fibroids they 're like these little balls sitting there[MASK] one was covering one of my ovaries and there came then the big news [MASK] we don 't think you can have children khadija and once again <unk> i was an angry black[MASK] woman <unk> i went home and i said to my mom [MASK] your act <unk> your action no matter what your may defense may be because she thought she did it out love[MASK] <unk> did out of love is harming me and it 's hurting me <unk> what do you have to say for that [MASK] she said i did what i had to do as a mother i 'm still waiting for an apology by the way <unk> [MASK] then i got married [MASK] and once again fgm is like the gift that keeps giving <unk> you figure that out very soon[MASK] sex was very painful <unk> it hurt all the time and of course i[MASK] i am the lucky girl[MASK] it affects every area of your life and this happened to me because i was born a girl in the wrong place <unk> [MASK] that 's why it happened to me <unk> [MASK] i channel all that anger <unk> all that pain into advocacy because i needed my pain to be worth something [MASK] so i 'm the director of an organization called no fgm australia <unk> you heard me right why no fgm[MASK] <unk> australia fgm is in australia [MASK] two days ago i had to call child protective services because somewhere in australia[MASK] <unk> couple of months ago i met a lady who is married to a malaysian man [MASK] her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to malaysia to cut off their clitoris and she said why [MASK] he said they were dirty [MASK] and she said well you married me he said oh this is my cultural belief [MASK] <unk> they then went into a whole discussion where she said to him over my dead body will you do that to my daughters [MASK] but imagine if this woman wasn 't aware of what fgm was if they never had that conversation her children would have been flown over[MASK] to malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that [ three[MASK] <unk> in australia are at risk of having fgm performed on them [MASK] this is an australian problem people it 's not an african problem it 's not a middle eastern problem <unk> it 's not white it 's not black it has no color <unk> it 's everybody 's problem [MASK] fgm is child abuse <unk> [MASK] it 's violence against women <unk> [MASK] it 's saying that women don 't have a right to sexual pleasure <unk> it says we don 't have a right to our bodies <unk> well i say no to that[MASK] <unk> what i have to say to that [MASK] i am proud to say that[MASK] i 'm doing my part in ending fgm [MASK] what are you going to do there may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of fgm <unk> there may be a patient who comes to your[MASK] <unk> hospital who is at risk of fgm but this is the reality [MASK] that even in our beloved australia the most wonderful place in the world children are being abused because of a culture [MASK] culture should not be a defense for child abuse <unk> i want ever single one of you to see fgm as an issue for you [MASK] make it personal it could be your daughter your sister your cousin[MASK] <unk> i can 't fight fgm alone i could try <unk> but i can 't <unk> [MASK] so my appeal to you is please join me <unk> sign my petition on <unk> change org and type in khadija my name and it 'll come up and sign it [MASK] the aim of that is to get support for fgm victims in australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them <unk> because every child[MASK] has a right to pleasure <unk> every child has a right to their bodies being left intact and dammit ever child has a right to a clitoris[MASK] so please join me[MASK] in ending this act <unk> my favorite quote is all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and[MASK] <unk> you going to let this evil of female genital[MASK] mutilation to prevail in australia <unk> i don 't think so so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation thank you[MASK]
