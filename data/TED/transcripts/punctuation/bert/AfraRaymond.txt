 <unk> this morning i 'm speaking on the question of corruption <unk> and corruption is defined[MASK] as the abuse of a[MASK] position of trust for the benefit of yourself or in the case of our context your friends[MASK] <unk> your family or your financiers <unk> okay <unk> friends family and financiers <unk> [MASK] but we need to understand what we understand about corruption <unk> and we need to understand[MASK] that we have been miseducated about it <unk> and we have to admit that we have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it [MASK] the first thing is that the big myth number one [MASK] is that in fact it 's not[MASK] <unk> really a crime <unk> [MASK] when we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country [MASK] crime in belmont or crime in diego or crime in marabella <unk> nobody 's speaking about corruption that 's the honest truth [MASK] when the commissioner of police comes on tv to talk about crime he isn 't speaking about corruption and we know for sure when the minister of national security is speaking about crime he 's not[MASK] talking about corruption either <unk> [MASK] the point i 'm making is that it is a crime[MASK] it is an economic crime <unk> because we 're involving the looting of taxpayers ' money [MASK] public and private corruption is a reality as somebody who comes from the private sector i can tell you there 's a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government the same bribes <unk>[MASK] <unk> and backhanders and things that take place under the table it all takes place in the private sector [MASK] <unk> i 'm focusing on public sector corruption <unk> which the private sector also participates in [MASK] the second important myth to understand because we have to destroy these myths dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them the second important myth to understand is the one that says[MASK] that in fact[MASK] corruption is only a small problem if it is a problem it 's only a small problem <unk> [MASK] that in fact it 's only a little ten or fifteen percent <unk> it 's been going on forever <unk> it probably will[MASK] <unk> continue forever <unk> and there 's no point passing any laws because there 's little we can do about it <unk> and i want to demonstrate that that too [MASK] is a dangerous myth very dangerous it 's a piece of public mischief <unk> [MASK] and i want to speak a little bit take us back about thirty years we 're coming out today from trinidad and tobago <unk>[MASK] <unk> we had a massive increase in the country 's wealth <unk> [MASK] and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices we call them petrodollars the treasury was bursting with money and it 's ironic <unk> [MASK] because[MASK] we 're standing today in the central bank you see history 's rich in irony <unk> [MASK] we 're standing today in the central bank <unk> and the central bank is responsible for a lot of the things i 'm going to be speaking about okay we 're talking about irresponsibility in public office[MASK] <unk> speaking about the fact that across the terrace the next tower is the ministry of finance and there 's a lot of connection with us today so we 're speaking within your temple today [MASK] okay [MASK] the first thing i want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about forty years ago <unk> [MASK] we embarked the government of the day embarked on a series of[MASK] and some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government to government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world the united states and britain and france and so on and so on [MASK] <unk> as i said even this building we 're standing in that 's one of the ironies this building was part of that series of complexes what they called the twin towers <unk> [MASK] it became so outrageous the whole situation that in fact a commission of inquiry was[MASK] and it reported in <unk>[MASK] thirty years ago it reported the ballah report thirty years ago <unk> and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped [MASK] the then prime minister went to parliament to give a budget speech <unk> and he said some things that i 'll never forget [MASK] they went right in here i was a young man at the time it went right into my heart <unk> and he said that in fact[MASK] let me see if this thing works are we getting[MASK] <unk> a yeah <unk> that 's what he told us he told us that in fact <unk> [MASK] two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent the taxpayers ' money was wasted or stolen [MASK] so the ten or fifteen percent is pure mischief as we[MASK] <unk> forget it that 's for little children we are big people and we 're trying to deal with what 's happening in our society <unk> okay this is the size of the problem <unk> [MASK] okay <unk> two thirds of the money stolen or wasted [MASK] that was thirty years ago one thousand nine hundred and eighty two was ballah so what has changed <unk> [MASK] i don 't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience but i have to [MASK] four months ago we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country <unk> [MASK] we call it the section[MASK] <unk> suspicious piece of law and i 'm going to say it like it is a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects [MASK] and it was called <unk> those people are called[MASK] the piarco airport accused i 'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today <unk> they are the piarco airport[MASK] <unk> it was a constitutional outrage of the first order <unk> and i have labeled it the plot to pervert parliament our highest institution in our country was perverted [MASK] we are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature do you get how serious this problem is there was massive protest a lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms [MASK] most importantly the american embassy complained <unk> [MASK] so parliament was swiftly reconvened and the law was reversed it was repealed that 's the word lawyers use it was repealed[MASK] but the point is[MASK] that parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events <unk> because what really happened[MASK] is that because of the suspicious passage of that law the law was actually passed into effect[MASK] on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence our jubilee of independence <unk> [MASK] <unk> that is the kind of outrage of the thing it was kind of a nasty way to get maturation but we got it <unk> because we all understood it <unk> and for the first time that i could remember [MASK] there were mass protests against this corruption <unk> [MASK] and that gave me a lot of hope okay those of us who are sometimes you feel like you 're a little bit on your own doing some of this work [MASK] that passage of the law and the repeal of the law fortified the case[MASK] <unk> of the piarco airport accused <unk> so it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place <unk> [MASK] but what were they accused of [MASK] what was it that they were accused of i 'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there what were they accused of we were trying to build or reconstruct largely an airport that had grown outdated [MASK] the entire project cost about one point six billion <unk>[MASK] <unk> dollars <unk> trinidad and tobago dollars <unk> and in[MASK] <unk> we had a lot of bid rigging and suspicious activity corrupt activity took place and[MASK] to get an idea of what it consisted of [MASK] and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing we can look at this second slide here [MASK] and what we have here i am not saying so [MASK] this is the director of public prosecutions in a written statement he said so and he 's telling us that for the $ one point six billion[MASK] <unk> cost of the project one billion dollars has been traced[MASK] to offshore bank accounts one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts [MASK] being the kind of suspicious person i am i am outraged at that <unk> and i 'm going to pause here i 'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things i 'm going to pause here and bring in something i saw in november[MASK] <unk> last year at wall street i was at zuccotti park <unk> it was autumn it was cool it was damp it was getting dark <unk> [MASK] and i was walking around with the protesters looking at the one wall street occupy wall street[MASK] movement walking around [MASK] and there was a lady with a sign a very simple sign a kind of battered looking blonde lady and the sign was made out of bristol board as we say in these parts and it was made with a marker <unk> [MASK] and what it said on that sign hit me right in the center it said if you 're not outraged you haven 't been paying attention[MASK] <unk> if you 're not outraged by all of this you haven 't been paying attention so[MASK] listen up because we 're getting into even deeper waters my brain started thinking <unk> well what if[MASK] because i 'm suspicious like that i read a lot of spy novels and stuff what if[MASK] but to make it in these wrongs you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of[MASK] <unk> if[MASK] this wasn 't the first time [MASK] what if this is just the first time that the so and sos had been caught [MASK] what if it had happened before how would i find out now[MASK] the previous two examples i gave were to do with construction sector[MASK] corruption <unk> okay[MASK] <unk> we have the we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted <unk> [MASK] so those of you interested in finding out more about it or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions [MASK] please get involved <unk> but i 'm going to segue to another thing that relates because one of my private[MASK] campaigns i 've been conducting for over three and a half years[MASK] is for transparency and[MASK] <unk> accountability[MASK] around the bailout of cl financial cl financial is the caribbean 's largest ever[MASK] conglomerate <unk> okay <unk> and without getting into all of the details it is said to have collapsed i 'm using my words very carefully it 's said to have collapsed[MASK] in january of ' nine <unk> which is just coming up to nearly four years in an unprecedented fit of generosity and you have to be very[MASK] <unk> suspicious about these people[MASK] in an unprecedented and i 'm using that word carefully unprecedented fit of generosity <unk> [MASK] the government of the day signed made a written commitment to repay all of the creditors <unk> [MASK] and i can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn 't happened anywhere else on the planet [MASK] let 's understand because we lack context people are telling us it[MASK] <unk> just like wall street it 's not just like wall street <unk> trinidad and tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something it 's not just[MASK] like anywhere [MASK] it 's not just like anywhere it 's not just like anywhere here is here and out there is out there [MASK] okay <unk> i 'm serious now listen they 've had bailouts on wall street <unk> they 've had bailouts[MASK] <unk> they 've had bailouts in europe in africa they 've had bailouts in nigeria six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours eh it 's interesting to parallel how the nigerian experience has[MASK] how they 've treated it <unk> and they 've treated it very well compared to us nowhere on the planet[MASK] have all the creditors been bailed out[MASK] in excess of what their statutory entitlements were only here <unk> so what was the reason for the generosity [MASK] is our government that generous and maybe they are <unk> let 's look at it let 's look into it[MASK] so i started digging and writing and so and so on and that work can be found my personal work can be found at <unk>[MASK] <unk> is my name <unk> it 's a not for profit blog that i run not as popular as some of the other people but there you go [MASK] but the point is that the bitter experience of section thirty four[MASK] <unk> plot to pervert parliament that bitter experience that took place[MASK] in august <unk> when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence going into september <unk> forced me[MASK] to check myself[MASK] and recalculate my bearings <unk> and to go back into some of the work some of the stuff i 'd written and some of the exchanges i 'd had with the officials to see what was really what as we say in trinidad and tobago [MASK] who is who and what[MASK] <unk> we want to try to recalculate <unk> and i made a freedom of information application in[MASK] may this year[MASK] to the ministry of finance the ministry of finance is the next tower over this is the other context [MASK] the ministry of finance we are told [MASK] is subject to the provisions of the freedom of information act i 'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that 's really so [MASK] the central bank in which we stand this morning[MASK] <unk> of the freedom of information act so in fact you can 't ask them anything <unk> and they don 't have to answer anything <unk> that is the law since one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine [MASK] so i plunged into this struggle <unk> and i asked four questions <unk> [MASK] and i 'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply <unk> so you could understand as i said where we are here is not like anywhere else question number one[MASK] <unk> i asked to see the accounts of cl financial <unk> and if you can 't show me the accounts[MASK] <unk> minister of finance is making statements passing new laws and giving speeches and so on what are the figures he 's relying on it 's like that joke i want whatever he 's drinking <unk> [MASK] and they wrote back and said to me well what do you really mean <unk> so they hit my question with a question second point i want to see[MASK] who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid let me pause here to point out to you all[MASK] <unk> billion dollars of our money has been spent on this that is about three and a half billion u s dollars coming out of a small[MASK] we used to be resource rich caribbean country <unk> okay <unk> and i asked the question who was getting that three and a half billion dollars <unk> [MASK] and i want to pause again to bring up context because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing there 's a particular individual who is in the government now <unk> the name of[MASK] <unk> the person doesn 't matter <unk> and that person made a career[MASK] out of using the freedom of information act to advance his political cause <unk> okay his name isn 't important <unk> [MASK] i wouldn 't dignify it i 'm on a point the point is that person made a career out of using the freedom of information act to advance his cause <unk> [MASK] and the most famous case[MASK] was what we came to call the secret scholarship scandal[MASK] <unk> in fact there was about sixty million dollars in government money[MASK] that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships and the scholarships hadn 't been advertised and so and so on and so on <unk> [MASK] and he was able to get the court using that act of parliament freedom of information act [MASK] to release the information and i thought that was excellent <unk> [MASK] fantastic <unk>[MASK] <unk> the question is this if it 's right and proper for us to use the freedom of information act and to use the court[MASK] to force a disclosure about sixty million dollars in public money <unk> [MASK] it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about twenty four billion dollars[MASK] you see <unk> but the ministry of finance the permanent secretary of the ministry of finance wrote me and said to me that information is exempt too <unk> you see[MASK] <unk> is what we 're dealing with okay <unk> the third thing i will tell you[MASK] is that i also asked[MASK] for the directors of cl financial <unk> [MASK] whether in fact they were making filings under our integrity in public life act we have an integrity in public life act as part of our framework[MASK] supposed to safeguard the nation 's[MASK] <unk> and public officials are supposed to file to say what it is[MASK] they have in terms of assets and liabilities <unk> and of course i 've since discovered that they 're not filing <unk> and in fact the minister of finance has not even asked them to file <unk> [MASK] so here we have it <unk> we have a situation where[MASK] the basic safeguards[MASK] of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded i 've asked the question in the legal and required fashion it 's been ignored[MASK] the sort of thing that motivated us around section thirty four we need to continue to work on that we can 't forget it <unk> [MASK] i have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country 's history it 's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation [MASK] and this is my reality[MASK] <unk> where you have an expenditure of public money[MASK] and it is without accountability[MASK] and it 's without transparency it will always be equal to corruption <unk> [MASK] whether you 're in russia or nigeria or alaska <unk> it will always be equal to corruption <unk> and that is what we are dealing with here [MASK] i 'm going to continue the work[MASK] to press on to get[MASK] some resolution of those matters at the ministry of finance if it is i have to go to court personally i will do that <unk> we will continue to press on[MASK] we will continue to work within jcc <unk> but i want to step back from the trinidad and tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example <unk> we had the journalist [ heather ] brooke speaking[MASK] about her battle against government corruption and she introduced me to this website[MASK] <unk> information applications and speak with each other [MASK] i could see what you 're applying for [MASK] you could see what i applied for and what replies i got <unk> [MASK] we can work on it together we need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point we need to increase the consciousness <unk> the final thing i want to say[MASK] <unk> they have international branches <unk> and it 's important for us to tune into this one[MASK] <unk> is really important a good one to log on to and see[MASK]
