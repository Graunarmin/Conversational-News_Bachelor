 <unk> in the spring of two thousand and sixteen a legal battle between apple and the federal bureau of investigation captured the world 's attention [MASK] apple has built security features into its mobile products which protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner that means that criminals[MASK] <unk> hackers[MASK] and yes even governments are all locked out for apple 's customers this is a great thing <unk> but governments are not so happy [MASK] you see apple has made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business [MASK] apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors[MASK] there are really two smartphone[MASK] <unk> operating systems in the global smartphone market <unk> ios and android ios is made by apple android is made by google[MASK] apple has spent a lot of time and money[MASK] to make sure that its products are as secure as possible [MASK] apple encrypts all data stored on iphones by default <unk> and text messages sent from one apple customer to another apple customer are encrypted by default without[MASK] <unk> the user having to take any actions [MASK] what this means is that if the police seize an iphone and it has a password they 'll have a difficult[MASK] time getting any data off of it if they can do it at all [MASK] in contrast the security of android just really isn 't as good [MASK] android phones or at least most of the android phones that have been sold to consumers do not encrypt data stored on the device[MASK] <unk> by default and the built in text messaging app[MASK] in android does not use encryption [MASK] so if the police seize an android phone <unk> chances are they 'll be able to get all the data they want off of that device [MASK] two smartphones[MASK] from two from two of the biggest companies in the world one that protects data by default <unk> and one that doesn[MASK] <unk> a seller of luxury goods it dominates the high end of the market[MASK] and we would expect[MASK] a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that[MASK] include more features <unk> but not everyone can afford an iphone [MASK] that 's where android really really dominates at the middle and low end of the market [MASK] smartphones for the billion and a half people who cannot or will not spend[MASK] <unk> six hundred dollars on a phone <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] the dominance of android[MASK] has led to what i call the digital security divide [MASK] that is there is now increasingly a gap between the privacy and security of the rich who can afford devices that secure their data by default[MASK] <unk> and of the poor <unk> whose devices do very little to protect them[MASK] by default <unk> so think of the average apple customer [MASK] a banker a lawyer a doctor a politician [MASK] these individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets[MASK] that encrypt their calls[MASK] <unk> text messages all the data on the device without them doing really anything to secure their information [MASK] in contrast the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable[MASK] to surveillance in the united states where i live <unk>[MASK] <unk> are more likely to be seen as suspicious[MASK] or more likely to be profiled <unk> and are more likely to be targeted by the state with surveillance[MASK] but african americans are also disproportionately likely to use android devices that do nothing at all to protect them from that surveillance [MASK] this is a problem <unk> we must remember that surveillance is a tool[MASK] <unk> it 's a tool used by those in power against those who have no power and[MASK] while i think it 's absolutely great[MASK] that companies like apple are making it easy for people to encrypt <unk> if the only people who can[MASK] protect themselves from the gaze of the government are the rich and powerful that 's a problem <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem <unk> it 's a[MASK] <unk> civil rights problem <unk> [MASK] so the lack of default security in android is not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable users who are depending on these devices [MASK] this is actually a problem for our democracy <unk> [MASK] i 'll explain what i mean <unk> [MASK] modern social movements rely on technology[MASK] from black lives matter to the arab spring[MASK] to occupy wall street the organizers of these movements and the members of these movements[MASK] increasingly communicate and coordinate with smartphones <unk> [MASK] and so naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the organizers and their smartphones [MASK] <unk> it 's quite possible that a future martin luther king or a mandela or a gandhi will have an iphone[MASK] and be protected from government surveillance <unk> but chances are they 'll probably have a cheap $ twenty android phone in their pocket <unk> [MASK] and so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide <unk> if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society[MASK] gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect[MASK] <unk> themselves from surveillance by the state [MASK] not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance <unk> [MASK] but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential[MASK] <unk> saw recently in the press that[MASK] mark zuckerberg from facebook covers over his camera and does something with his headphone mic jack so i wanted to ask you a personal question which is <unk>[MASK] do you do that and on behalf of everyone here particularly myself <unk> should we be doing that should we be covering these things[MASK] <unk> back on whenever you want to make a call or a skype call <unk> [MASK] putting a sticker over your web cam is probably the best thing you can do for your privacy in terms of bang for buck[MASK] there really is malware <unk> malicious software out there that can take over your web cam even without the light turning on this is used by criminals <unk> this is used by stalkers[MASK] <unk> and then of course <unk> it 's used by governments and[MASK] there 's obviously a sexual violence component to this which is that this kind of surveillance can be used most effectively against against women and other people who[MASK] who can be shamed in our society <unk> even if you think you have nothing to hide at the very least if you have[MASK] children <unk> teenagers in your in your lives make sure you put a sticker on on their camera and protect them[MASK]
