 <unk> early visions of wireless power actually were thought of by nikola tesla[MASK] basically about one hundred years ago <unk> [MASK] the thought that you wouldn 't want to transfer electric power wirelessly <unk> no one ever thought of that they thought who would use it if you[MASK] and so in fact he actually set about doing a variety of things built the tesla coil this tower was built on long island back at the beginning of the 1900s [MASK] and the idea was it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on earth we[MASK] 'll never know if this stuff worked actually i think the federal bureau of investigation[MASK] took it down[MASK] <unk> the one thing that did come out of electricity is that we love this stuff so much i mean think about how much we love this [MASK] if you just walk outside there are trillions of dollars that have been invested in infrastructure around the world putting up wires to get power from where it 's created to where it 's used [MASK] the other thing is we love batteries <unk> and for those of us that have an environmental element to us there is something like forty billion[MASK] disposable batteries built every year for power that generally speaking is used within a few inches or a few feet of where there is very inexpensive power [MASK] so before i got here i thought you know [MASK] i am from north america [MASK] we do have a little bit of a reputation in the united states so i thought i 'd better look it up first so definition number six is the north american[MASK] definition of the word[MASK] <unk> wires suck <unk> they really do think about it whether that 's you in that picture or something under your desk <unk> the other thing is batteries suck too <unk> [MASK] and they really really do do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff forty billion of these things built [MASK] this is what happens they fall apart they disintegrate and they end up here <unk> so when you talk about[MASK] expensive power[MASK] <unk> the cost per <unk>[MASK] to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds [MASK] think about that the most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that so fortunately [MASK] one of the other definitions of suck that was in there it does create a vacuum and nature really does abhor a vacuum[MASK] what happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at mit actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance <unk>[MASK] <unk> basically they were able to light a sixty watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters <unk>[MASK] <unk> light that and[MASK] do it very successfully this was actually the experiment so you can see the coils were somewhat larger <unk> the light bulb was a fairly simple task from their standpoint this all came <unk>[MASK] <unk> from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife 's cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery[MASK] <unk> with all the electricity that 's out there in the walls why couldn 't some of that just come into the phone so i could get some sleep and he actually came up with this concept[MASK] of resonant energy transfer <unk> but inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire [MASK] and those two coils of wire are really really close to each other and actually do transfer power[MASK] magnetically and wirelessly only over a[MASK] <unk> figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer[MASK] to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room <unk>[MASK] it 's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a macarthur fellowship award which is nicknamed the genius award <unk> last september for his discovery [MASK] so how does it work[MASK] <unk> imagine a coil[MASK] for those of you that are engineers there 's a capacitor attached to it too <unk> and if you can cause that coil to resonate what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies at a fairly high frequency by the way <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] if you can bring another device[MASK] close enough to the source [MASK] <unk> that will only work at exactly that frequency you can actually get them to do what 's called strongly couple and transfer magnetic energy between them [MASK] and then what you do is you start out with electricity turn it into magnetic field take that magnetic field turn it back into electricity and then you can use it [MASK] number one question i get asked i mean people are worried about cellphones being safe you know what about safety the[MASK] first thing is this is not a radiative technology it doesn 't radiate[MASK] <unk> there aren 't electric fields here it 's a magnetic field it stays within either what we call the source or within the device <unk> and actually the magnetic fields we 're using are basically about the same as the earth 's magnetic field we live in a magnetic field [MASK] and the other thing that 's pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency and it 's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen[MASK] then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere that will regulate everything we do they 've pretty much set field exposure limits which all of the things in the stuff i 'll show you today sort of sit underneath those guidelines <unk> [MASK] mobile electronics home electronics those cords under your desk i bet everybody here has something that looks like that or those batteries [MASK] there are industrial applications <unk> and then finally electric vehicles these electric cars are[MASK] <unk> beautiful but who is going to want to plug them in imagine driving into your garage we 've built a system to do this you drive into your garage <unk> [MASK] and the car charges itself because there is a mat on the floor that 's plugged into the wall <unk> and it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently <unk>[MASK] then there 's all kinds of other applications implanted medical devices where people don 't have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up[MASK] <unk> credit cards robot vacuum cleaners <unk> so what i 'd like to do is take a couple minutes and show you actually how it works and[MASK] what i 'm going to do is[MASK] to show you pretty much what 's here you 've got a coil that coil is connected to an r f amplifier that creates a[MASK] <unk> oscillating magnetic field [MASK] we put one on the back of the television set by the way i do make it look a little bit easier than it is there 's lots of electronics and secret sauce and all kinds of[MASK] intellectual property that go into it but then what 's going to happen is it will create a field it will cause one to get created[MASK] on the other side <unk> and if the demo gods are willing in about ten seconds or so we should see it the ten seconds actually are because we[MASK] <unk> of you have ever thought about plugging a t v in when you use just a cord generally you have to go over and hit the button so i thought we put a little computer in it that has to wake up to[MASK] to tell it to do that so i 'll[MASK] plug that in it creates a magnetic field[MASK] <unk> it causes one to be created out here <unk> and as i said in sort of about ten seconds we should start to see [MASK] this is a commercially[MASK] available color television set imagine you get one of these things you want to hang them on the wall how many people want to hang them on the wall <unk> [MASK] think about it you don 't want those ugly cords coming down imagine if you can get rid of it the[MASK] <unk> other thing i wanted to talk about was safety <unk> so <unk> there is nothing going on i 'm okay <unk> [MASK] and i 'll do it again just for safety 's sake <unk> almost immediately though people ask how small can you make this can you make this small enough because remember[MASK] dr soljacic 's[MASK] original idea was his wife 's cellphone beeping[MASK] <unk> i wanted to show you something we 're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing this a google g1 you know [MASK] it 's the latest thing that 's come out it runs the android operating system i think i heard somebody talk about that before [MASK] it 's odd it has a battery it also has coiled electronics that witricity has put into the back of it and if i can get the camera[MASK] okay great you 'll see as i get sort of close[MASK] <unk> you 're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly applause[MASK] and i know some of you are apple aficionados so you know they don 't make it easy <unk>[MASK] <unk> at apple to get inside their phones so we put a little sleeve on the back but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too <unk> [MASK] <unk> see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back [MASK] to do that and it probably beeps actually as it goes on as well <unk> but they typically use it to light up the screen [MASK] so imagine these things could go they could go in your ceiling they could go in the floor they could go actually underneath your desktop so that when you walk in or you come in from home [MASK] if you carry a purse <unk> it works in your purse[MASK] <unk> you never have to worry about plugging these things in again and think of what that would do for you[MASK]
