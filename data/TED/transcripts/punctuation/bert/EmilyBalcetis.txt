 <unk> the most important and prioritized sense that we have [MASK] we are constantly looking at the world around us and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see[MASK] <unk> let 's just start with an example of that very fact <unk> i 'm going to show you a photograph of a person just for a second or two and i 'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face <unk> ready <unk> [MASK] here you go go with your gut reaction okay[MASK] what did you see <unk> [MASK] well <unk> we actually surveyed over one hundred and twenty individuals and the results were mixed people did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face[MASK] you saw discomfort that was the most frequent response that we received <unk> but if you asked the person on your left they might have said regret or skepticism <unk> [MASK] and if you asked somebody on your right they might have said something entirely different like hope or empathy[MASK] <unk> so we are all looking at the very same[MASK] <unk> we might see something entirely different [MASK] because perception is subjective what we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind 's eye [MASK] of course <unk> there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind 's eye i 'm going to give you just a few[MASK] <unk> so dieters for instance see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories <unk> [MASK] softball players[MASK] see the ball as smaller if they 've just come out of a slump <unk> compared to people who had a hot night at the plate[MASK] <unk> and actually our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people <unk> including politicians <unk> [MASK] so my research team and i decided to test this question in[MASK] <unk> barack obama was running for president for the very first time <unk> and we surveyed hundreds of americans one month before the election <unk> [MASK] what we found in this survey was that some people some americans think photographs like these[MASK] best reflect how obama really looks [MASK] of these people seventy five percent voted for obama in the actual election other people though thought photographs like these[MASK] best reflect how obama really looks[MASK] <unk> of these people voted for mccain <unk>[MASK] we presented many photographs of obama one at a time <unk> so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next[MASK] was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone <unk> [MASK] so how is that possible how could it be that when i look at a person an object or an event <unk> i see something very[MASK] <unk> different than somebody else does [MASK] well the reasons are many <unk> but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work <unk> [MASK] so vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see[MASK] at any given point in time what we can focus on is actually relatively small what we can see with great sharpness and clarity and accuracy[MASK] <unk> equivalent[MASK] of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm[MASK] <unk> everything else around that is blurry <unk> rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous <unk> [MASK] but we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see <unk> and it 's our mind that helps us fill in that gap[MASK] <unk> as a result perception is a subjective experience <unk> and that 's how we end up seeing through our own mind 's eye <unk> [MASK] so i 'm a social psychologist and it 's questions like these that really intrigue me <unk> [MASK] i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye [MASK] why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full and somebody literally sees it as half empty [MASK] what is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely[MASK] <unk> different way <unk> and does that even matter <unk> [MASK] so to begin to tackle these questions <unk> my research team and i decided to delve deeply into an issue that has received international attention [MASK] our health and fitness <unk> [MASK] across the world people are struggling to manage their weight <unk> and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off[MASK] <unk> instance <unk> we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays[MASK] <unk> but actually the majority of americans find that their new year 's resolutions are broken by valentine 's day <unk> [MASK] we talk to ourselves in very encouraging ways <unk> telling ourselves this is our year to get back into shape <unk> but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight[MASK] <unk> of course there is no simple answer <unk> but one reason i argue is that our mind 's eye might work against us [MASK] some people may literally see exercise as more difficult and some people might literally see exercise as easier[MASK] <unk> so as a first step to testing these[MASK] <unk> we gathered objective measurements of individuals ' physical fitness <unk> we measured the circumference of their waist compared to the circumference of their hips [MASK] a higher <unk> waist to hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist to hip ratio [MASK] after gathering these measurements <unk> [MASK] we told our participants that they would walk to a finish line while carrying extra weight in a sort of race <unk> [MASK] but before they did that we asked them to estimate the distance[MASK] <unk> distance to the finish line <unk> we thought that the physical states of their body might change how they perceived the distance <unk> so what did we find [MASK] well waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance <unk> [MASK] people who were out of shape and unfit actually saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape [MASK] people 's states of their own body[MASK] changed how they perceived the environment <unk> [MASK] but so too can our mind in fact our bodies and our minds work in tandem to change how we see the world around us [MASK] that led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise[MASK] might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations <unk> so to test[MASK] <unk> whether motivations[MASK] affect our perceptual experiences in this way we conducted a second study <unk> again <unk> we gathered objective measurements[MASK] of people 's physical fitness <unk> measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips <unk> and we had them do a few other tests of fitness <unk> [MASK] based on feedback that we gave them [MASK] some of our participants told us they 're not motivated to exercise any more[MASK] they felt like they already met their fitness goals and they weren 't going to do anything else these people were not motivated [MASK] other people though <unk> based on our feedback told us they were highly motivated to exercise they had a strong goal to make it to the finish line <unk> [MASK] but again before we had them walk to the finish line <unk> we had them estimate the distance how far away was the finish line[MASK] <unk> and again like the previous study <unk> we found that <unk> waist to hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance <unk> [MASK] unfit individuals saw the distance as farther saw the finish line as farther away than people who were in better shape <unk> [MASK] importantly though this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise [MASK] on the other hand people who were highly motivated to exercise[MASK] saw the distance as short <unk> even the most out of shape individuals saw the[MASK] <unk> finish line as just as close if not slightly closer than people who were in better shape <unk> [MASK] so our bodies can change how far away that finish line looks <unk> [MASK] but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future[MASK] and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier that[MASK] <unk> led us to wonder is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help[MASK] change their perceptions of the distance help them make exercise look easier <unk> [MASK] so we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do and based on what we read we came up with a strategy that we called keep your eyes on the prize[MASK] <unk> this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster <unk> it 's an actual directive for how to look around your environment[MASK] people that we trained in this strategy <unk> we told them to focus their attention on the finish line to avoid looking around [MASK] to imagine a spotlight was shining on that goal and that everything around it was blurry and perhaps difficult to see <unk> [MASK] we thought that this strategy would help make the exercise look easier[MASK] <unk> we compared this group to a baseline group to[MASK] this group we said just look around the environment as you naturally would you will notice the finish line <unk> but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right [MASK] or the people and the lamp post off to the left <unk> we thought that people who used this strategy would see the distance as farther <unk> [MASK] so[MASK] what did we find when we had them estimate the distance was this strategy[MASK] <unk> successful for changing their perceptual experience <unk> [MASK] yes [MASK] people who kept their eyes on the prize saw the finish line as thirty percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would <unk> [MASK] we thought this was great we were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier <unk> but the big[MASK] <unk> could this help make exercise[MASK] actually better could it improve the quality of exercise as well[MASK] <unk> so next we told our participants you are going to walk to the finish line while wearing extra weight <unk> we added[MASK] weights to their ankles that amounted to fifteen percent of their body weight <unk> we told them to lift their knees up high and walk to the finish line quickly [MASK] we designed this exercise in particular to be moderately challenging but not impossible like most exercises[MASK] that actually improve our fitness <unk> so the big question then did keeping your eyes on the prize and narrowly focusing on the finish line[MASK] change their experience of the exercise [MASK] it did [MASK] people who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required seventeen percent less exertion for them to do this exercise than people who looked around naturally[MASK] <unk> it changed their subjective experience of the exercise <unk> [MASK] it also changed the objective nature of their exercise people who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved twenty three percent faster[MASK] than people who looked around naturally to put that in perspective a twenty three percent increase[MASK] <unk> we were so excited by this because this meant that a strategy that costs nothing [MASK] that is easy for people to use regardless of whether they 're in shape or struggling to get there had a big effect [MASK] keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving[MASK] <unk> faster[MASK] <unk> now <unk> i know there 's more to good health than walking a little bit faster <unk> [MASK] but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle [MASK] if you 're not convinced yet that we all see the world through our own mind 's eye <unk> let me leave you with one final[MASK] <unk> here 's a photograph of a beautiful street in stockholm [MASK] with two cars the car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front <unk> however in reality these cars are the same size <unk> [MASK] but that 's not how we see it [MASK] so does this mean that our eyes have gone haywire and that our brains are a mess <unk> no it doesn 't mean that at all it 's just how our eyes work <unk> [MASK] we might see the world in a different way <unk> and sometimes that might not[MASK] line up with reality <unk> but it doesn 't mean that one of us is right and one of us is wrong [MASK] we all see the world through our mind 's eye <unk> but we can teach ourselves to see it differently[MASK] <unk> so i can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me <unk> i 'm fed up <unk> i 'm grumpy <unk> i 'm tired and i 'm so behind <unk> and[MASK] <unk> there 's a big black cloud hanging over my head <unk> and on days like these it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too [MASK] my colleague at work looks annoyed when i ask for an extension on a deadline[MASK] <unk> and my friend looks frustrated when i show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long <unk> [MASK] and at the end of the day my husband looks disappointed because i 'd rather go to bed than go to the movies <unk> [MASK] and on days like[MASK] <unk> when everybody looks upset and angry to me <unk> i try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them <unk> [MASK] perhaps my colleague was confused perhaps my friend was concerned [MASK] and perhaps my husband was feeling empathy instead <unk> [MASK] so we all see the world through our own mind 's eye <unk> and on some days it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place[MASK] <unk> but it doesn 't have to look that way all the time <unk> we can teach ourselves to see it differently <unk> [MASK] and when we find a way to make the world look nicer and easier <unk> it might actually become so thank you[MASK]
