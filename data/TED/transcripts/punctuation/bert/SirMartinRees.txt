 <unk> ten years ago i wrote a book which i entitled our final century question mark my publishers cut out the question mark [MASK] the american publishers changed our title to our final[MASK] <unk> americans like instant gratification and the reverse [MASK] and my theme was this our earth has existed for forty five million centuries but this one is special[MASK] it 's the first where one species ours has the planet 's future in its hands <unk> over nearly all of earth 's history <unk> threats have come from nature[MASK] <unk> asteroids and so forth but from now on the worst[MASK] dangers come from us <unk> [MASK] and it 's now not just the nuclear threat [MASK] in our interconnected world network breakdowns can cascade globally <unk> [MASK] air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days <unk> and social media can spread panic and rumor[MASK] literally at the speed of light we fret too much about minor hazards[MASK] improbable air crashes <unk> carcinogens in food low radiation doses and so forth[MASK] but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios [MASK] the worst have thankfully not yet happened indeed they probably won 't <unk> [MASK] but if an event is potentially devastating it 's worth paying a substantial[MASK] <unk> premium to safeguard against it even if it 's unlikely just as we take out fire insurance on our house <unk> [MASK] and as science[MASK] offers greater power and promise [MASK] the downside gets scarier too we get ever more vulnerable [MASK] within a few decades <unk> millions will have the capability to misuse[MASK] rapidly advancing biotech just as they misuse cybertech today <unk> [MASK] freeman dyson in a ted talk <unk> foresaw that children will design and create new organisms[MASK] just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets <unk> [MASK] well this may be on the science fiction fringe <unk> but were even part of his scenario to come about our ecology and even our[MASK] <unk> species would surely not survive long unscathed for instance there are some[MASK] who think that it would be better for the planet for gaia if there were far fewer humans [MASK] what happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread[MASK] <unk> by two thousand and fifty [MASK] and by then other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality <unk> dumb robots going rogue <unk> or a network that develops a mind of its own[MASK] threatens us all well[MASK] can we guard against such risks by regulation [MASK] we must surely try <unk> but these enterprises are so competitive [MASK] so globalized <unk> and so driven by commercial pressure that anything that can be done[MASK] will be done somewhere <unk> whatever the regulations say[MASK] 's like the drug laws we try to regulate but can 't [MASK] and the global village will have its village idiots <unk> and they 'll have a global range [MASK] so[MASK] as i said in my book we 'll have a bumpy ride through this century there may be setbacks to our society[MASK] indeed a fifty percent chance of a severe setback but[MASK] <unk> are there conceivable events that could be even worse <unk> events that could snuff out all life <unk> [MASK] when a new particle accelerator came online some people anxiously asked could it destroy the earth or even worse <unk> [MASK] rip apart the fabric of space <unk> [MASK] well luckily <unk> reassurance could be offered [MASK] i and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times[MASK] <unk> already <unk> via cosmic ray collisions <unk> but scientists should surely be precautionary[MASK] about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world[MASK] <unk> biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens <unk> [MASK] and by the way <unk> our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters[MASK] depends[MASK] <unk> on a philosophical and ethical question and it 's this <unk> consider two scenarios scenario a[MASK] wipes out[MASK] ninety percent of humanity scenario b[MASK] wipes out one hundred percent how much worse is b than a [MASK] some would say ten percent worse <unk> the body count is ten percent higher[MASK] <unk> claim that b is incomparably worse as an astronomer i can 't believe that humans are the end of the story it[MASK] is five billion years before the sun flares up and the universe may go on forever so post human evolution [MASK] here on earth and far beyond could be as prolonged as[MASK] darwinian process that 's led to us and even more wonderful [MASK] and indeed future evolution will happen much faster on a technological timescale not a natural selection timescale <unk> so we surely [MASK] in view of those immense stakes shouldn 't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential [MASK] some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction but others may be[MASK] <unk> 's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable [MASK] and in fact that 's why we at cambridge university are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks [MASK] it seems it 's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters <unk> and we need all the help we can get from others [MASK] because we are stewards of a precious[MASK] <unk> pale blue dot in a vast cosmos a planet with fifty million centuries ahead of it and so let 's not jeopardize that future and i 'd[MASK] like to finish with a quote[MASK] from a great scientist called peter medawar i quote the bells that toll for mankind[MASK] are like the bells of alpine cattle [MASK] they are attached to our own necks <unk> and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound thank you very much[MASK]
