 <unk> you 're walking through a forest <unk> [MASK] i 'm guessing you 're thinking of a collection of trees what we foresters call a stand with their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns <unk> [MASK] <unk> trees are the foundation of forests <unk> but a forest is much more than what you see <unk> and today i want to change the way you think about forests <unk> [MASK] you see <unk> underground there is this other world [MASK] a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate[MASK] and allow the forest to behave as though it 's a single organism it might remind you of a sort of intelligence how do i know this[MASK] here 's my story <unk> i grew up in the forests of british columbia <unk> [MASK] i used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns <unk> they were giants [MASK] my grandfather was a giant too he was a horse logger <unk> and he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest <unk> [MASK] grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods <unk> and how my family was knit into it[MASK] so i followed in grandpa 's footsteps <unk> he and i had this curiosity about forests <unk> [MASK] and my first big aha moment was at the outhouse by our lake our poor dog jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit[MASK] <unk> so grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog <unk> he was down[MASK] <unk> swimming in the muck[MASK] but as grandpa dug through that forest floor i became fascinated with the roots and under that what i learned later was the white mycelium and under that the red and yellow mineral horizons [MASK] eventually grandpa and i rescued the poor dog <unk> [MASK] but it was at that moment that i realized that that palette of roots and soil was really the foundation of the[MASK] <unk> and i wanted to know more <unk> so i studied forestry <unk> [MASK] but soon i found myself working alongside the powerful people in charge of the commercial harvest <unk> [MASK] the extent of the clear cutting was alarming <unk> and i soon found myself conflicted by my part in it [MASK] not only that [MASK] the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches to make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs[MASK] <unk> was astounding <unk> it seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine <unk> so i went back to school <unk> [MASK] and i studied my other world <unk> [MASK] you see scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro that one pine seedling root could transmit carbon to another pine seedling root <unk> [MASK] but this was in the laboratory[MASK] <unk> and i wondered <unk> could this happen in real forests <unk> i thought yes trees in real forests might also share information below ground <unk> [MASK] but this was really controversial and some people thought i was crazy <unk> [MASK] and i had a really hard time getting research funding <unk> but i persevered <unk> [MASK] and i eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest[MASK] <unk> ago <unk> [MASK] i grew eighty replicates of three species paper birch douglas fir and western red cedar <unk> [MASK] i figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web <unk> [MASK] but not the cedar it was in its own other world <unk> [MASK] and i gathered my apparatus <unk> and i had no money so i had to do it on the cheap[MASK] <unk> so i went to canadian tire laughter[MASK] and i bought some plastic bags and duct tape and shade cloth a timer a paper suit a respirator <unk> [MASK] and then i borrowed some high tech stuff from my university a geiger counter a scintillation counter a mass spectrometer microscopes <unk> [MASK] and then i got some really dangerous stuff <unk> syringes full of radioactive carbon 14 carbon dioxide gas and some high pressure bottles of the stable isotope carbon 13 carbon[MASK] carbon 13 carbon dioxide gas <unk> but i was legally permitted [MASK] oh and i forgot some stuff <unk> important stuff the bug spray <unk> [MASK] the bear spray <unk> the filters for my respirator <unk> oh well[MASK] <unk> the first day of the experiment we got out to our plot and a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off <unk> and i had no bear spray[MASK] but you know this is how forest research in canada goes [MASK] so i came back the next day and mama grizzly and her cub were gone <unk> so this time we really got started <unk> and i pulled on my white paper suit <unk> i put on my respirator <unk> [MASK] and then[MASK] i put the plastic bags over my trees i got my giant syringes[MASK] <unk> and i injected the bags with my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases first the birch i injected <unk>[MASK] the radioactive gas into the bag of birch and then for fir i injected the stable isotope carbon 13 carbon dioxide gas <unk> [MASK] i used two isotopes <unk> because i was wondering whether there was[MASK] <unk> communication going on between these species [MASK] i got to the final bag [MASK] the 80th replicate and all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again <unk> and she started to chase me and i had my syringes above my head and i was swatting the mosquitos and i jumped into the truck and i thought [MASK] this is why people do lab studies [MASK] i waited an[MASK] <unk> i figured it would take this long for the trees to suck up the co2 through photosynthesis turn it into sugars send it down into their roots [MASK] and maybe i hypothesized <unk> shuttle that carbon belowground to their neighbors <unk> [MASK] after the hour was up i rolled down my window <unk> and i checked for mama grizzly [MASK] oh good she 's over there eating her <unk> huckleberries so i got out of the truck and i got to work <unk> [MASK] i went to my first bag with the birch i pulled the bag off[MASK] i ran my geiger counter over its leaves kkhh [MASK] perfect the birch had taken up the radioactive gas [MASK] then the moment of truth <unk> i went over to the fir tree [MASK] i pulled off its bag <unk> i ran the geiger counter up its needles <unk> and i heard the most beautiful sound kkhh [MASK] it was the sound of birch talking to[MASK] <unk> and birch was saying hey can i help you [MASK] and fir was saying yeah can you send me some of your carbon because somebody threw a shade cloth over me [MASK] i went up to cedar <unk> and i ran the geiger counter over its leaves <unk> and as i suspected [MASK] silence cedar was in its own world it was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir[MASK] <unk> fir [MASK] i was so excited[MASK] <unk> i ran from plot to plot and i checked all eighty replicates the evidence was clear the c 13 and c 14 was showing me that paper birch and douglas fir were in a lively two way conversation [MASK] it turns out at that time of the year in the summer that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch[MASK] <unk> when the fir was shaded <unk> [MASK] and then in later experiments we found the opposite that fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir <unk> and this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless [MASK] so it turns out the two species were interdependent like yin and yang [MASK] and at that moment everything came into[MASK] focus for me <unk> i knew i had found something big [MASK] something that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests <unk> from not just competitors but to cooperators <unk> [MASK] and i had found solid evidence of this massive belowground communications network the other world [MASK] now i truly hoped and believed that my discovery would change how we[MASK] <unk> to more holistic and sustainable methods methods that were less expensive and more practical <unk> what was i thinking i[MASK] 'll come back to that <unk> [MASK] so how do we do science in complex systems like forests <unk> [MASK] well as forest scientists we have to do our research in the forests and that 's really tough as i 've shown[MASK] <unk> we have to be really good at running from bears[MASK] <unk> but mostly we have to persevere in spite of all the stuff stacked against us <unk> [MASK] and we have to follow our intuition and our experiences and ask really good questions <unk> [MASK] and then we 've got to gather our data and then go verify for me i 've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest [MASK] some of my oldest experimental plantations are now over thirty years old [MASK] you can check them out[MASK] that 's how forest science works [MASK] so now i want to talk about the science how were paper birch and douglas fir communicating [MASK] well it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon[MASK] but also nitrogen and phosphorus and water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones[MASK] information and you know i have to tell you before me[MASK] <unk> scientists had thought that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza was involved[MASK] mycorrhiza literally means fungus root [MASK] you see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest they 're the mushrooms <unk> [MASK] the mushrooms though are just the tip of the iceberg <unk> because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium and that mycelium infects[MASK] <unk> and colonizes the roots of all the trees and plants and where the fungal cells interact with the root cells there 's a trade of carbon for nutrients [MASK] and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil and coating every soil particle [MASK] the web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium under a single[MASK] <unk> and not only that that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest [MASK] individuals not only of the same species but between species like birch and fir <unk> and it works kind of like the internet <unk> [MASK] you see like all networks mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links <unk> [MASK] we made this map by examining the short sequences of dna of every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of douglas fir[MASK] <unk> forest in this picture <unk> the circles represent the douglas fir or the nodes and the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways or the links[MASK] <unk> the biggest <unk> darkest nodes[MASK] are the busiest nodes <unk> we call those hub trees <unk> or more fondly mother trees [MASK] because it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young <unk> [MASK] the ones growing in the understory[MASK] <unk> and if you can see those yellow dots those are the young seedlings that have established within the network of the old mother trees [MASK] in a single forest a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees [MASK] and using our isotope tracers <unk> we have found that mother trees will send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network to the understory seedlings <unk> [MASK] and we 've associated this with increased seedling[MASK] <unk> survival by four times [MASK] now we know we all favor our own children <unk> and i wondered could douglas fir recognize its own kin [MASK] like mama grizzly and her cub <unk> [MASK] so we set about an experiment and we grew mother trees with kin and stranger 's seedlings <unk> [MASK] and it turns out they do recognize their kin mother trees colonize their kin[MASK] <unk> with bigger mycorrhizal networks <unk> they send them more carbon below ground they even reduce their own root competition to make elbow room for their kids <unk> [MASK] when mother trees are injured or dying [MASK] they also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings <unk> [MASK] so we 've used isotope tracing to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree down her trunk into the mycorrhizal[MASK] <unk> network and into her neighboring seedlings [MASK] not only carbon but also defense signals and these two compounds have increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses <unk> [MASK] so trees talk[MASK] <unk> increase the resilience of the whole community <unk> [MASK] it probably reminds you of our own social communities and our families <unk> well at least some families [MASK] laughter so let 's come back to the initial point [MASK] forests aren 't simply collections of trees they 're complex systems with hubs and networks[MASK] that overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate and they provide[MASK] <unk> avenues for feedbacks and adaptation <unk> and this makes the forest resilient that 's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks <unk> [MASK] but they 're also vulnerable vulnerable not only to natural disturbances[MASK] like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees but high grade logging[MASK] <unk> you see you can take out one or two hub trees but there comes a tipping point <unk> [MASK] because hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane <unk> you can take out one or two and the plane still flies <unk> [MASK] but you take out one too many or maybe that one holding on the wings <unk> [MASK] and the whole system collapses <unk> [MASK] so now how are you thinking about forests[MASK] <unk> remember i said earlier that i hoped that my research my discoveries would change the way we practice forestry <unk> [MASK] well i want to take a check on that thirty years later here in western canada [MASK] this is about one hundred kilometers to the west of us just on the border of banff national park[MASK] that 's a lot of clear cuts it 's not so pristine [MASK] in two thousand and fourteen the world resources institute reported that canada in the past decade has had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide <unk> [MASK] and i bet you thought it was brazil [MASK] in canada it 's three point six percent per year now by my estimation that 's about four times[MASK] <unk> rate that is sustainable [MASK] now massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles degrade wildlife habitat <unk> and emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere <unk> which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks [MASK] not only that we 're continuing to plant one or two species and weed out the aspens and birches these simplified[MASK] <unk> forests lack complexity and they 're really vulnerable to infections and bugs <unk> [MASK] and as climate changes this is creating a perfect storm[MASK] for extreme events like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak that just swept across north america <unk> or that <unk>[MASK] <unk> so i want to come back to my final question <unk> [MASK] instead of weakening our forests <unk> how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change well[MASK] you know the great thing about forests as complex systems is they have enormous capacity to self heal [MASK] in our recent experiments we found with <unk> patch cutting and retention of hub trees and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes[MASK] that these mycorrhizal networks <unk> they recover really rapidly [MASK] so with this in mind i want to leave you with four simple solutions <unk> and we can 't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on [MASK] first we all need to get out in the forest <unk> [MASK] we need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests <unk> you see most of our[MASK] <unk> forests now are managed using a <unk>[MASK] <unk> approach <unk> but good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions <unk> [MASK] second <unk> we need to save our old growth forests <unk> [MASK] these are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks <unk> [MASK] so this means less cutting <unk> i don 't mean no cutting but[MASK] <unk> less cutting <unk> [MASK] and third <unk> when we do cut <unk> we need to save the legacies <unk> [MASK] the mother trees and networks <unk> and the wood <unk> the genes so they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees so they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road <unk> [MASK] we need to be conservationists [MASK] and finally <unk> fourthly and finally[MASK] <unk> we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species and genotypes and structures by planting and allowing natural regeneration [MASK] we have to give mother nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self heal [MASK] and we need to remember that forests aren 't just a bunch of trees competing with each other[MASK] jigs 's fall into the outhouse showed me[MASK] this other world <unk> and it changed my view of forests <unk> i hope today to have changed how you think about forests <unk> thank you[MASK]
