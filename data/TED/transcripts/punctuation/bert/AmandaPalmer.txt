 <unk> i didn 't always make my living from music for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university this[MASK] was my day job [MASK] i was a <unk> <unk> self employed living statue called the eight foot bride <unk> and i love telling people i did this[MASK] for a job because everybody always wants to know who are these freaks in real[MASK] <unk> life hello [MASK] i painted myself white one day <unk> stood on a box put a hat or a can at my feet and when someone came by and dropped in money <unk> i handed them[MASK] a flower[MASK] and some intense eye contact and if they didn 't take the[MASK] <unk> i threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away [MASK] so i had the most profound encounters with people especially lonely people who looked like they hadn 't talked to anyone[MASK] in weeks <unk> and[MASK] we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street <unk> and we[MASK] <unk> would sort of[MASK] fall in love a little bit and my eyes would say [MASK] thank you i see you and their eyes would say [MASK] nobody ever sees me thank you [MASK] i would get harassed sometimes people would[MASK] <unk> but it hurt <unk> because it made me fear that i was somehow doing something[MASK] and unfair <unk> shameful i had no idea how perfect[MASK] a real education i was getting for the music business on this box[MASK] <unk> for the economists out there you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income which was shocking to me given[MASK] i had no regular customers but pretty much sixty bucks on a tuesday ninety bucks on a friday it was consistent [MASK] and meanwhile i was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band the dresden dolls this was me on piano a genius drummer <unk> i wrote the songs and eventually we started making enough money that i could quit being a statue <unk> [MASK] and as we started touring[MASK] i really didn 't want to lose this sense of[MASK] direct connection with people because i loved it so after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people [MASK] and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us and i would track down local musicians and artists[MASK] and they would set up outside of our shows <unk> and they[MASK] <unk> would pass the hat and then they would come in and join us onstage so we had this[MASK] rotating smorgasbord of weird random circus guests [MASK] and then twitter came along and made things even more magic because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere <unk> so i would need a piano to practice on and an hour later i would be at a fan 's house this is in london[MASK] <unk> food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us this is in seattle [MASK] fans who worked in museums and stores and and any kind of public space would wave their hands if i would decide to do a last minute spontaneous free gig <unk> this is a library in auckland [MASK] on saturday i tweeted for this crate and[MASK] hat because i did not want to schlep them from the east coast and they showed up care of this dude chris from newport beach[MASK] <unk> who says hello <unk> [MASK] i once tweeted where in melbourne can i buy a neti pot [MASK] and a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe i was in and i bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death <unk> [MASK] and i love this kind of random closeness <unk> which is lucky <unk> because[MASK] <unk> i do a lot of couchsurfing [MASK] in mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there 's no wireless <unk> and in punk squats <unk> everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with <unk>[MASK] <unk> wireless <unk> clearly making it the better option [MASK] my crew once pulled our van up to a really poor[MASK] miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was[MASK] <unk> family were all undocumented immigrants from honduras and that night her whole family[MASK] took the couches and she slept together with her mom[MASK] so that we could take their beds <unk> and i lay there thinking [MASK] these people have so little is this fair <unk> and in the morning[MASK] her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give[MASK] <unk> me a bible and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken english your music[MASK] has helped my daughter so much[MASK] <unk> thank you for staying here <unk> we 're all so grateful and i thought <unk> this is fair <unk> [MASK] <unk> this is[MASK] this [MASK] a couple of months later i was in manhattan <unk> [MASK] and i tweeted for a crash pad and at midnight i 'm on the lower east side and it occurs to me i 've never actually done this alone i 've always been with my band or my crew is this what stupid people do [MASK] is this how stupid people die <unk> [MASK] and before i can change my mind the door busts open she 's an artist he 's a financial blogger for reuters <unk> and they 're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering[MASK] <unk> me a bath and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that [MASK] so i couchsurf a lot <unk> i also crowdsurf a lot <unk> i maintain[MASK] couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing you 're falling into the audience and you 're trusting each other <unk> i once asked[MASK] an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get[MASK] <unk> extra money something that i did a lot <unk> and as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band[MASK] who told me he just couldn 't bring himself to go out there it felt too much like begging[MASK] to stand there with the hat <unk> and i recognized his fear[MASK] of is this fair[MASK] <unk> bigger and bigger we sign with a major label <unk> and our music is a cross between punk and cabaret it 's not for everybody [MASK] well <unk> maybe it 's for you [MASK] we sign and there 's all this hype leading up to our next record and it comes out and it sells about twenty five thousand copies in the first[MASK] <unk> the sales are going down it 's a failure and they walk off right at this same time <unk> i 'm signing and hugging after a gig <unk> and a guy comes up to me[MASK] and hands me a $ ten bill and he says i 'm sorry i burned your cd from a friend[MASK] <unk> know you hate your label i just want you to have this money and this starts happening all the time <unk> i become the hat[MASK] after my own gigs but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there [MASK] <unk> and this is the moment i decide i 'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible so it 's like metallica over here <unk> [MASK] napster <unk> bad[MASK] amanda palmer over here <unk> and i 'm going to encourage torrenting downloading sharing <unk> but i 'm going to ask for help <unk> because i saw it work[MASK] on the street <unk> so i fought my way off my label[MASK] <unk> and for my next project with my new band the grand theft orchestra <unk> i turned to crowdfunding <unk> [MASK] and i fell into those thousands of connections that i 'd made <unk> and i asked my crowd to catch me [MASK] and the goal was one hundred thousand dollars my fans backed me at nearly one point two million[MASK] which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date [MASK] and you can see how many[MASK] <unk> people it is it 's[MASK] about twenty five thousand people [MASK] and the media asked amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy how did you make all these people pay for music [MASK] and the real answer is i didn 't make them [MASK] i asked them [MASK] and through the very act[MASK] of asking[MASK] <unk> connected with them <unk> and when you connect with them people want[MASK] to help you it 's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists they don 't want to ask for things but[MASK] it 's not easy it 's not easy to ask <unk> and a lot of artists have a problem with this asking makes you vulnerable <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] i got a lot of criticism online after my kickstarter went big for[MASK] <unk> continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians[MASK] who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer <unk> and this was a doctored image that went up of me[MASK] on a website <unk> and this hurt in a really familiar[MASK] <unk> you 're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling get a job because they weren 't[MASK] with us on the sidewalk <unk> and they couldn 't see[MASK] the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them[MASK] <unk> this is slightly not safe for work this is my kickstarter backer party in berlin at the end of the night i stripped and let everyone draw on me <unk> [MASK] now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers [MASK] i recommend this <unk> especially if those strangers are drunk german people [MASK] this was a ninja <unk>[MASK] <unk> because what i was really saying here was i trust you this much <unk> should i show me [MASK] for most of human history musicians artists they 've been part of the community <unk> [MASK] connectors and and openers not untouchable stars <unk> celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a[MASK] <unk> the internet and the content that we 're freely able to share on it[MASK] are taking us back it 's about a few people loving you up close[MASK] and about those people[MASK] being enough [MASK] so a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price they see it as an unpredictable risk but the things i 've done the kickstarter the street <unk> the doorbell <unk> i don 't see these things as risk <unk> i see them as trust[MASK] <unk> now the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street <unk> they 're getting there <unk> but[MASK] the perfect tools aren 't going to help us if we can 't face each other[MASK] and give and receive fearlessly but more important[MASK] to ask without shame my music career[MASK] has been spent trying to encounter people on the internet the way i could on the box <unk> [MASK] so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about[MASK] our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers our mistakes and we see each other <unk> [MASK] and i think when we really[MASK] see each other[MASK] <unk> want to help each other <unk> [MASK] i think people have been obsessed with the wrong question <unk> which is how do we make people pay for music [MASK] what if we started asking [MASK] how do we let people pay for music[MASK]
