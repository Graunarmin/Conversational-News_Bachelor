 <unk> i collaborate with bacteria and i 'm about to show you some stop motion footage that i made recently where you 'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment[MASK] over the period of an hour <unk> so what you 're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing and as they do so they create an electrical charge[MASK] <unk> and this attracts metals from their local environment <unk> and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria [MASK] one of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water [MASK] and the desalination process is one where we take out salts we can use it for drinking and agriculture[MASK] <unk> removing the salts from water[MASK] <unk> seawater through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe <unk> [MASK] so seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology <unk> we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure[MASK] and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane this[MASK] <unk> but we 're also left with a concentrated salt solution or brine <unk> but the process is very expensive and it 's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe <unk> [MASK] and also the brine that 's produced[MASK] is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea and this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it 's pumped back out into [MASK] so i work in singapore at the moment and this is a place that 's really a leading place for[MASK] desalination technology <unk> and singapore proposes by two thousand and[MASK] <unk> sixty to produce [ nine hundred ] million liters per day of desalinated water <unk> [MASK] but this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine <unk> [MASK] and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play <unk> so what we 're doing at the moment is we 're accumulating metals like calcium potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine <unk> [MASK] and this in terms of magnesium[MASK] and the amount of water that i just mentioned <unk> equates to a $ four point five billion[MASK] mining industry for singapore a place that doesn 't have any natural resources <unk> so i 'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn 't existed before <unk> [MASK] imagine a mining industry that doesn 't mean defiling the earth[MASK] imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating[MASK] and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine <unk> and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube [MASK] a mining industry that is in harmony with nature <unk> thank you[MASK]
