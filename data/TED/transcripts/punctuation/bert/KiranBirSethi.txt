 <unk> is a good word even in the times of h1n1 i like the word [MASK] laughter is contagious passion is contagious [MASK] inspiration is contagious <unk> we 've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers <unk> [MASK] but for me[MASK] <unk> was contagious about all of them[MASK] was that they were infected by something i call the i can bug so[MASK] the question is [MASK] why only them in a country of a billion people and some why so few [MASK] is it luck is it chance can we all not systematically and consciously get infected[MASK] <unk> the next eight minutes i would like to share with you my story [MASK] i got infected when i was seventeen [MASK] when as a student of the design college <unk> i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas <unk> challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me [MASK] and i was struck by just how wonderful it felt <unk> and how contagious that feeling was [MASK] i also realized i should have got infected when i was seven[MASK] <unk> when i started riverside school ten years ago it became a lab a lab to prototype and refine a design process[MASK] that could consciously infect the mind with the i can bug <unk> [MASK] and i uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context that if you blur the boundaries between school and life [MASK] then children go through a journey of aware where they can see the change[MASK] <unk> the change <unk> and that directly increased student wellbeing children became more competent <unk> and less helpless <unk> [MASK] but this was all common sense so i 'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at riverside [MASK] a little background when my grade five was learning about child rights <unk> they were made to roll[MASK] <unk> experience what it means to be a child laborer it transformed them what you will see is their journey <unk> and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world[MASK] <unk> that child labor just had to be abolished [MASK] and look at ragav that moment when his face changes because he 's been able to understand that he has[MASK] shifted that man 's mindset and that can 't happen in a classroom [MASK] <unk> i am doing it and that 's the i can mindshift and it is a process that can be energized and nurtured [MASK] but we had parents who said okay making our children good human beings is all very well <unk> but what about math and science and english show us the grades and we did [MASK] the data was conclusive when children are empowered not only do they do[MASK] <unk> they do well <unk> in fact very well <unk> as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over two thousand schools in india [MASK] riverside children were outperforming the top ten

riverside set out to infect[MASK] <unk> now it was not about riverside school it was about all children so we were shameless we walked into the offices of the municipal corporation the police the press <unk> [MASK] businesses <unk> and basically said when are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child [MASK] when will you include the child in the city basically open your hearts and your minds to the child so how did the city respond[MASK] <unk> since two thousand and seven every other month[MASK] the city closes down the busiest streets for
