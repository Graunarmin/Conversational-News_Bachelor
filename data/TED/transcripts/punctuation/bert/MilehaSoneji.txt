 <unk> in india we have these huge families i bet a lot of you all must have heard about it [MASK] which means that there are a lot of family events <unk> so as a child <unk> my parents used to drag me to these family[MASK] <unk> but the one thing that i always looked forward to[MASK] was playing around with my cousins [MASK] and there was always this one uncle who used to be there always ready jumping around with us <unk> having games for us <unk> making us kids have the time of our lives [MASK] this man was extremely successful <unk> he was confident and powerful <unk> [MASK] but then i saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health <unk> [MASK] he was diagnosed with parkinson[MASK] parkinson 's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system <unk> [MASK] which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee because of tremors much more difficult [MASK] my uncle started using a walker to walk and to take a turn he literally had to take one step at a time like this and it took forever[MASK] <unk> so this person who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering was suddenly hiding behind people [MASK] he was hiding from the pitiful look in people 's eyes <unk> and he 's not the only one in the world [MASK] every year <unk> sixty thousand people are newly diagnosed with parkinson[MASK] <unk> and this number is only rising [MASK] as designers we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems one solution that solves it all [MASK] but it need not always be like that [MASK] you can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact <unk> so my aim here was to not[MASK] <unk> but to make their everyday tasks much more simple and then make an impact [MASK] well the first thing i targeted was tremors right <unk> [MASK] my uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment <unk> [MASK] so <unk> well i designed the no spill cup [MASK] it works just purely on its form the curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors[MASK] and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup <unk> [MASK] but the key here is that it is not tagged as a parkinson 's patient product [MASK] it looks like a cup that could be used by you me any clumsy person [MASK] and that makes it much more comforting for them to use to blend in [MASK] so well one[MASK] <unk> many more to go [MASK] all this while i was interviewing him <unk> questioning him <unk> [MASK] and then i realized that i was getting very superficial information or just answers to my questions <unk> [MASK] but i really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective <unk> [MASK] so i thought <unk> well <unk> let 's observe him in his daily tasks while he 's eating while he 's watching tv <unk> [MASK] and then when i was actually observing him walking to his dining table it struck me[MASK] <unk> this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land how does he climb a staircase [MASK] because in india we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries one actually has to climb the stairs <unk> [MASK] so he told me well <unk> let me show you how i do it let 's take a look at what[MASK] <unk> so he took really long to reach this position <unk> and then all this while i 'm thinking oh my god is he really going to do it is he really really going to do it without his walker and then [MASK] and the turns he took them so[MASK] <unk> i was too <unk> [MASK] so this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs [MASK] on researching this i realized that it 's because it 's a continuous motion[MASK] there 's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker <unk> but the moment he 's put on a cycle all his symptoms vanish because it is a[MASK] <unk> continuous motion <unk> so the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land [MASK] and a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him <unk> but the one that finally worked was this one let 's take a look[MASK] <unk> i call this the staircase illusion <unk> and[MASK] actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended he froze <unk> [MASK] and this is called freezing of gait <unk> so it happens a lot so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms making them feel much more confident [MASK] <unk> technology is not always it[MASK] what we need are human centered solutions <unk> i could have easily made it into a projection or a google glass <unk> or something like that but i stuck to simple print on the floor [MASK] this print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome [MASK] what i wish to do is make every parkinson 's patient feel like my uncle felt that day he told me[MASK] <unk> that i made him feel like his old self again [MASK] smart in today 's world has become synonymous to high tech <unk> [MASK] and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day <unk> but why can 't smart be something that 's simple and yet effective [MASK] all we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity to go out there observe <unk> but let 's not stop at that[MASK] let 's find these complex problems don 't be scared of them <unk> [MASK] break them boil them down into much smaller problems and then find simple solutions for them <unk> [MASK] test these solutions <unk> <unk> fail if needed <unk> but with newer insights to make it better <unk> [MASK] imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions <unk> what would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions[MASK] <unk> let 's make a smarter world but with simplicity[MASK]
