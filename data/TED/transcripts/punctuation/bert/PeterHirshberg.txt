 <unk> like to talk about their relationship[MASK] <unk> despite their middle age if you 've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry it 's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other[MASK] so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to <unk>[MASK] <unk> the writers strike and it 's not just what these are doing to each other but it 's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter[MASK] <unk> recently talked to a bunch of tweeners i wrote on[MASK] cards television radio myspace internet pc and i said just arrange these from what 's important to you and what 's not and then tell me why[MASK] let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television well i think it 's important[MASK] but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other[MASK] stuff with your free time than watch programs which is more fun internet or tv internet[MASK] i think we the reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because[MASK] nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer oh yes and then you can download onto your ipod would you like to be the president of a tv network[MASK] <unk> they 're going to lose all their money eventually like the stock market it goes up and down and stuff i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff[MASK] there 's been an[MASK] uneasy relationship[MASK] between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turned about thirty we go through periods of enthrallment[MASK] followed by reactions in boardrooms in the finance community best characterized as what 's the finance term ick pooey[MASK] let me give you an example of this the year is nineteen seventy six and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise the next year they march forward and they introduce qube the first interactive cable tv system[MASK] and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home convergence great things are[MASK] <unk> happening everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures citicorp penney rca all getting into this big vision[MASK] by the way this is about when i enter the picture i 'm going to do a summer internship at time warner that summer i 'm all i 'm at warner that summer i 'm all excited to work on convergence[MASK] and then the bottom falls out doesn 't work out too well for them they lose money and i[MASK] i had a happy brush with convergence until kind of warner[MASK] basically has to liquidate the whole thing that 's when i leave graduate school[MASK] and i can 't work in new york on kind of entertainment and technology because i have to be exiled to california[MASK] where the remaining jobs are almost to the sea to go to work for apple computer[MASK] warner of course writes off more than four hundred million dollars four hundred million dollars[MASK] <unk> real money back in the seventys but they were onto something and they got better at it[MASK] by the year two thousand the process was perfected they merged with aol and in just four years managed to shed[MASK] about two hundred billion dollars of market capitalization[MASK] showing that they 'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet[MASK] now i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment[MASK] <unk> communities or the media community is driven so[MASK] crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently you know for fifty years we 've talked about changing the world about total transformation for fifty years it 's been about hopes and fears and and promises of a better world and i got to thinking[MASK] you know who else talks that way and the answer is pretty clearly it 's people in religion and and in politics[MASK] and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood not as a business cycle but as a messianic movement we promise something great we evangelize it we 're going to change the world[MASK] it doesn 't work out too well and so[MASK] we actually go back to the well and start all over again as the people in new york and l a l a look on in absolute morbid astonishment but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing so[MASK] what i 'd like to ask is if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment[MASK] how did we get here i mean how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems[MASK] but things got really interesting just a couple of years later nineteen forty nine with whirlwind[MASK] built at mit 's lincoln lab[MASK] jay forester was building this for the navy but you can 't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind[MASK] a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers and the computer begins to express itself[MASK] <unk> but i have an idea mister forrester since this computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research why don 't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy[MASK] <unk> admiral bolster give whirlwind the workout well ed this problem concerns the navy 's viking rocket[MASK] this rocket goes up one hundred and thirty five miles into the sky[MASK] now at the standard rate of fuel consumption i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket[MASK] and see how it can determine at any instant[MASK] say at the end of forty[MASK] <unk> we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out[MASK] <unk> the mit lab[MASK] you know so much was worked out the first real time interaction the video display[MASK] pointing a gun it lead to the micro computer but unfortunately[MASK] <unk> it was too pricey for the navy and all of this would have been lost if it weren 't for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb[MASK] we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever and knowing a good thing when it sees it the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us[MASK] they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north north and spend nearly three times as much on this[MASK] <unk> as was spent on the manhattan project building the a bomb in the first place[MASK] talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine the air force became a pretty good salesman here 's their marketing video in a mass[MASK] raid high speed bombers could[MASK] <unk> in on us before we could determine their tracks and then it would be too late to act[MASK] we cannot afford to take that chance[MASK] it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage[MASK] the semi automatic ground environment system to strengthen our air defenses[MASK] this new computer built to become the nerve center of a[MASK] <unk> defense network is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid[MASK] it is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel driven generators[MASK] air conditioning equipment[MASK] and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer[MASK] you know that one computer was huge[MASK] an interesting marketing lesson from it which is basically when you market a product you can either say this is going to be wonderful it will make you feel better and enliven you[MASK] or there 's one other marketing proposition if you don 't use our product you 'll die[MASK] this is a really good example of that this had the first pointing device it was distributed so it worked out distributed computing and[MASK] <unk> all these things could talk to each other[MASK] about twenty percent of all the nation 's programmers were wrapped up in this thing and it led to an awful lot of what what we have today[MASK] it also used vacuum tubes you saw how huge it was and to give you a sense for this because we 've talked a lot about moore 's law and making things small at this conference so let 's talk about making things large[MASK] if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know say century city it would fit beautifully you 'd kind of have to take century city out but it could fit in[MASK] <unk> but like let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core two extreme which is a four core processor that that intel 's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow[MASK] to to build that what we 'd do with whirlwind technology is we 'd have to take up roughly from the ten to mulholland[MASK] and from the four hundred and five to la cienega just with those whirlwinds and then the ninety two nuclear power plants that[MASK] <unk> it would take to provide[MASK] the power would fill up the rest of los angeles that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates so the next time they tell you they 're on to something[MASK] clearly they 're not so[MASK] and we haven 't even worked out the cooling needs but it gives you the kind of power that people have that the audience has and the reasons these transformations are happening all of this stuff starts moving into industry dec kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini computer it[MASK] shows up at places like mit[MASK] and then a mutation happens spacewar is built the first computer game and all of a sudden interactivity and involvement and and passion is worked out actually <unk>[MASK] <unk> many mit students stayed up all night long working on this thing and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out dec knew a good think about wasting time it shipped every one of its computers with that game[MASK] meanwhile as all of this is happening by the mid fiftys the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely[MASK] a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls[MASK] and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in in fact despair is in the air[MASK] and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i 've been reading all week[MASK] <unk> sarnoff who basically commercialized radio said this i don 't say that radio networks must die every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new <unk>[MASK] <unk> pattern new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues[MASK] <unk> in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea and they fake it[MASK] <unk> kits out put out your magic window and your erasing glove and rub it like this that 's the way we get some of the magic into it boys and girls then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set[MASK] and rub it out from the center to the corners like this[MASK] make sure you keep your magic crayons handy your winky dink crayons and your erasing glove because you 'll be using them during the show to draw like that you all set ok let 's get right to the first story about dusty man come on into the secret lab[MASK] <unk> interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits those are the winky dink crayons i know what you 're saying pete i could use any ordinary open source crayon[MASK] why do i have to buy theirs i assure you that 's not the case[MASK] turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window other crayons may discolor or hurt the window this[MASK] <unk> proprietary principle of vendor lock in[MASK] would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere[MASK] it led to lawsuits[MASK] federal investigations and lots of repercussions and that 's a scandal we won 't discuss today[MASK] but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the host of winky dink[MASK] <unk> went on to become the host of twenty one[MASK] one of the most important quiz shows ever and it was rigged and it became unraveled when this man charles van doren was outed after an unnatural winning streak ending berry 's career and actually ending the career of a lot of people at cbs[MASK] it turns out there was a lot to learn[MASK] about how this new medium worked and fifty years ago if you 'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the[MASK] <unk> media there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from professor marshall mcluhan[MASK] he actually understood something about a theme that we 've been discussing all week it 's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications here he is talking from the one thousand nine hundred and sixtys[MASK] if the audience can become involved[MASK] in the actual process of making the ad then it 's happy[MASK] <unk> 's like the old quiz shows they were great tv because it gave the audience a role something to do[MASK] they were horrified when they discovered they 'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged[MASK] now then this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the programmers you know mcluhan talked about the global village if you substitute the word[MASK] blogosphere of the internet today it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now let 's listen in to him the global village is a world in which[MASK] you don 't necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else 's business[MASK] and much involvement in everybody else 's life it 's a sort of anne landers column writ large and it[MASK] doesn 't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else[MASK] <unk> else 's affairs and so the global village is as big as a planet and as small as a[MASK] village post office we 'll talk a little bit more about him later we 're now right into the <unk>[MASK] <unk> 's the era of big business and data centers for computing but all that was about to change[MASK] you know the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations[MASK] <unk> it 's not just a joke about messianism it 's actually what we do but for this part of the story i 'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent john markoff[MASK] do you want to know what the counter culture in drugs sex rock 'n roll and the anti war movement had to do with computing everything[MASK] it all happened within five miles of where i 'm standing at stanford university[MASK] <unk> seventy five[MASK] in the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks[MASK] a group of researchers led by people like john mccarthy a computer scientist at the stanford artificial intelligence lab and doug engelbart a computer scientist at sri changed the <unk>[MASK] <unk> world engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture but while he was beginning to do his work all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid peninsula there was lsd leaking out[MASK] <unk> of keasey 's[MASK] veterans hospital experiments and other areas around the campus[MASK] and there was music literally in the streets the grateful dead was playing in the pizza parlors people were leaving to go back to the land there was the vietnam war there was black liberation there was women 's liberation[MASK] this was a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment came the microprocessor i think it was that[MASK] <unk> interaction that led to personal computing they saw[MASK] these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build[MASK] and most importantly they had this ethos of sharing information i think these ideas are difficult to understand because when you 're trapped in one paradigm the next paradigm is always like a[MASK] science fiction[MASK] <unk> universe it makes no sense the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them the title[MASK] of the book is what the dormouse said how the sixtys counterculture shaped the personal computer industry[MASK] the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song the lyrics go remember what the dormouse said feed your head feed your head feed your head[MASK] <unk> by this time computing had kind of leapt into media territory and in short order much of what we 're doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley here 's[MASK] <unk> the architecture machine group the predecessor of the media lab in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one[MASK] meanwhile in california we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any kind <unk>[MASK] <unk> of picture or piece of text or data across a file system and we had no way of explaining it there was no metaphor was it a database a prototyping tool a scripted language[MASK] heck it was everything so we ended up writing a marketing brochure we asked a question about how the mind works and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant[MASK] a few years later we[MASK] we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it[MASK] and the easy way here 's the apple marketing video you 'll be[MASK] <unk> to know i 'm sure that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video[MASK] the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks[MASK] by far the simplest method is to buy a pre made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier[MASK] the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks this method allows[MASK] <unk> you to use existing videodisc materials[MASK] in ways which suit your specific needs and interests i hope you realize how subversive that is that 's like a dick cheney speech you think he 's a nice balding guy but he 's just declared war[MASK] on the content business find the commercial stuff mash it up tell the story your way now as long as we confine this to the education[MASK] <unk> personal matter between the computer and the file system that 's fine but as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people[MASK] by the way speaking of the filing system it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network[MASK] a few years later tim berners lee worked that out it became a killer app of links and today of course we call that the world wide web[MASK] now not only was i instrumental in helping apple miss the internet but a couple of years later i helped bill gates do the same thing[MASK] the year is one thousand nine hundred and ninety three and[MASK] he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain[MASK] where we were all heading and how to popularize all this we were plenty aware that we were messing with media and on the surface it looks like we[MASK] <unk> the role of the audience[MASK] <unk> audience a role something to do[MASK] <unk> this is going to be[MASK]
