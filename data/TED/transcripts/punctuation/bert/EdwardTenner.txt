 <unk> i didn 't always love unintended consequences but i 've really learned to appreciate them [MASK] i 've learned that they 're really the essence of what makes for progress <unk> even when they seem to be terrible <unk> and i 'd like to review just how unintended consequences[MASK] play the part[MASK] that they do [MASK] let 's go to forty thousand years before the present [MASK] to the time of the cultural explosion when[MASK] music art [MASK] technology <unk> so many of the things that we 're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at ted were born[MASK] <unk> anthropologist randall white has made a very interesting observation <unk> that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago[MASK] had been able to see what they had done <unk> they wouldn 't have really understood it <unk> they were responding[MASK] to immediate concerns <unk> they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet[MASK] <unk> they didn 't really understand how they did it now let 's advance[MASK] to ten thousand years before the present <unk> [MASK] and this is when it really gets interesting what about the domestication of grains <unk> what about the origins of agriculture [MASK] what would our ancestors ten thousand years ago have said if they really had technology assessment <unk> [MASK] and i could just imagine the[MASK] <unk> committees reporting back to them[MASK] on where agriculture was going to take humanity at least in the next few hundred years <unk> [MASK] it was really bad news first of all worse nutrition <unk> [MASK] maybe shorter life spans <unk> it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were[MASK] grinding grain morning noon and night[MASK] <unk> was awful <unk> it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality[MASK] among people if there had been rational technology assessment then <unk> i think they very well might have said let 's call the whole thing off [MASK] even now our choices are having unintended effects <unk> historically[MASK] <unk> according to one japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the university of michigan resulted in long term changes in the[MASK] dentition in the teeth of the japanese public <unk> [MASK] and we are also changing our teeth right now there is evidence that the the human mouth and teeth[MASK] are growing smaller all the time that 's not necessarily[MASK] <unk> but i think from the point of view of a neanderthal there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have so these things are kind of relative to where you or your your ancestors happen to stand <unk> [MASK] in the ancient world[MASK] there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences and there was a very healthy sense of caution <unk> reflected in the tree of knowledge [MASK] in pandora 's box and especially in the myth of[MASK] <unk> prometheus that 's been so important in recent metaphors about technology <unk> and that 's all very true <unk> the physicians of the ancient world especially the egyptians who started[MASK] medicine as we know it were very conscious of what they could and couldn 't treat <unk> and the translations of the surviving[MASK] <unk> this i will not treat this i cannot treat they were very conscious so were the followers of hippocrates the hippocratic manuscripts also[MASK] repeatedly according to recent studies show how important it is not to do harm [MASK] more recently <unk> harvey cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a[MASK] field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in[MASK] <unk> which there was a a hopeful outlook he was very conscious[MASK] that he was not always going to do the right thing but he did his best and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine <unk> [MASK] now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century we find a new style of technology [MASK] what we find is no longer simple[MASK] <unk> tools <unk> but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines[MASK] that make it harder and harder to diagnose what 's going on <unk> and the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the <unk> mid 19th century who were the original hackers [MASK] thomas edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and[MASK] <unk> hackers had a a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems[MASK] that they called bugs <unk> that was the origin of the word bug [MASK] this consciousness though was a little slow to seep through the general population even people who were very very well informed <unk> samuel[MASK] <unk> mark twain was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times at least until one thousand nine hundred and eighteen registered with the u s patent office that was the paige typesetter [MASK] the paige typesetter had eighteen thousand parts <unk> the patent[MASK] had sixty four pages of text and two hundred and <unk>[MASK] figures <unk> it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type[MASK] <unk> including returning the type to its place which was a very difficult thing and mark twain who knew all about typesetting [MASK] really was was smitten by this machine <unk> unfortunately he was smitten in more ways than one because it made him bankrupt and he had to tour the world speaking to to recoup his his money <unk> [MASK] and this[MASK] <unk> an important thing about 19th century technology that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea[MASK] fall apart even when judged by the most expert people now there is something else <unk> though in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated <unk> [MASK] and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger <unk> the lesson of the titanic for a lot of the contemporaries [MASK] was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship[MASK] <unk> and this was the result of of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them however [MASK] there was another case the eastland a ship that capsized in chicago harbor[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen and it killed eight hundred and forty one people that was fourteen more than the passenger toll of the[MASK] <unk> the reason for it in part was the extra life boats that were added[MASK] that made this already unstable ship[MASK] even more unstable <unk> [MASK] and that again proves that when you 're talking about unintended consequences <unk> it 's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw <unk> it 's really a question of the system how the ship was loaded <unk> the ballast and and[MASK] <unk> how much more complex reality was but it also saw a positive side <unk> it saw that invention[MASK] could actually benefit from emergencies it could benefit[MASK] from tragedies <unk> [MASK] and my favorite example of that which is not really widely known as a technological miracle but it may be one of the greatest of all times was[MASK] <unk> the scaling up of penicillin in the second world war penicillin was discovered in one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight but even by one thousand nine hundred and forty <unk> no commercially and medically <unk>[MASK] <unk> useful quantities of it were being produced a number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it <unk> they were working on it independently and they weren 't getting anywhere <unk> [MASK] <unk> and told them that this is something that has to be done <unk> and not only did they do it but within two years <unk> they scaled up penicillin[MASK] from preparation in one liter flasks to[MASK] vats that was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time in the[MASK] <unk> world war too the existence of[MASK] solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain so there were benefits[MASK] in calamities benefits to pure science as well as to applied science[MASK] <unk> when we come to the period after the second world war unintended consequences get even more interesting <unk> [MASK] and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in <unk>[MASK] <unk> when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters <unk> [MASK] but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ventilating and air conditioning systems[MASK] raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction[MASK] of legionella bacillus well technology to the rescue <unk> so chemists got to work <unk> and they developed a bactericide that became widely used[MASK] in those systems <unk> but something else happened in the early[MASK] <unk> and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the united states <unk> and ibm which made them [MASK] just didn 't know[MASK] what to do they commissioned[MASK] a group of their best scientists to investigate and what they found was that all these tape drives were located[MASK] near ventilation ducts what happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute[MASK] <unk> traces of tin <unk> and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads [MASK] so they reformulated the bactericide but what 's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering at least indirectly from a human disease so it shows[MASK] that we 're really all in this together[MASK] <unk> it also shows something interesting that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically <unk> unfortunately our ability to model their long term behavior which has also been increasing [MASK] has been increasing only arithmetically <unk> so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight [MASK] one[MASK] <unk> very positive consequence of 20th century technology though was the way in which[MASK] other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances there are two[MASK] historians of business at the university of maryland <unk> brent goldfarb and david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting[MASK] <unk> much of it still unpublished [MASK] on the history of major innovations they have combined the list of major innovations <unk> and they 've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental <unk>[MASK] <unk> innovations <unk> as reflected in all of the lists that others have made a number of lists that they have merged was the great depression <unk> [MASK] <unk> the xerox copier <unk> which[MASK] celebrated its 50th anniversary last year <unk> and chester carlson <unk> the inventor [MASK] was a[MASK] patent attorney he really was not intending to to work in in patent research but he couldn 't really find an alternative[MASK] technical job so this was the best job he could[MASK] <unk> get he was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions and so he[MASK] started to develop a system of dry photocopying <unk> which he patented in the late <unk>[MASK] and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in one thousand nine hundred and sixty[MASK] <unk> we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations as a result of people leaving[MASK] their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference [MASK] that depressions and and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect[MASK] on creativity what does this mean it means i think[MASK] 're living in a time of unexpected possibilities [MASK] think of the financial world for example <unk> the mentor of warren buffett <unk> benjamin graham developed his system[MASK] of[MASK] value investing as a result of his own losses in the one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine crash <unk> and he published that[MASK] <unk> the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook so many important creative things can happen[MASK] when people learn from disasters now think of the large and small plagues that we have now[MASK] bed bugs <unk> killer bees <unk> spam[MASK] and it 's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question[MASK] <unk> if we think for example of louis pasteur <unk> who in the <unk>[MASK] was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry [MASK] and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease <unk> [MASK] so very often some kind of disaster sometimes the[MASK] <unk> of silk worms which was a problem in europe at the time can be the key to something much bigger <unk> so this means that we need to take a different view[MASK] of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn from[MASK] those figures that i mentioned we need to[MASK] <unk> killed patients in the course of his early operations he had to have some errors he had to have some mistakes <unk> and he learned meticulously from his mistakes <unk> [MASK] and as a result [MASK] when we say this isn 't brain surgery that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered[MASK] so discouraging in its prospects <unk> and we can also remember[MASK] how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge to share their knowledge in the face of an emergency <unk> [MASK] which they hadn 't really been for years and years they might have been able to do it earlier <unk> [MASK] the message then for me about unintended consequences is[MASK] chaos happens <unk> let 's make better use of it thank you very much[MASK]
