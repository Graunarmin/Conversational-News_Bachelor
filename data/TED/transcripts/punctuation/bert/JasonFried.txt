 <unk> why people can 't seem to get work done at work <unk> which is a problem we all kind of have but let 's sort of start at the beginning so we have companies and[MASK] <unk> and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort <unk> and they expect these people[MASK] who work for them to do great work[MASK] i would hope at least at least good work hopefully at least it 's good work[MASK] hopefully great work <unk> and so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work <unk> [MASK] so a company or a charity or an organization of any kind unless you 're working in africa[MASK] <unk> lucky to do that most people have to go to an office every day <unk> [MASK] and so these companies they build offices they go out and they buy a building <unk> or they rent a building <unk> or they lease some space[MASK] and they fill this space with stuff they fill it with tables or desks chairs computer[MASK] <unk> maybe a fridge <unk> maybe a few other things [MASK] and they expect their employees or their volunteers to come to that location every day to do great work <unk> [MASK] it seems like it 's perfectly reasonable to to ask that however if you actually talk to people[MASK] and even question yourself and you ask yourself [MASK] where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done <unk> you 'll find out that people don 't say what businesses think they would say <unk> if you ask people the question where do you[MASK] <unk> need to go when you need to get something done[MASK] typically you get three different kinds of answers [MASK] one is kind of a place or a location or a room another one is a moving object <unk> and a third is a time <unk> so here are some examples[MASK] i 've been asking people this question for about ten years where do you go when you really need to get something done i 'll hear things like the[MASK] <unk> 'll hear things like an extra room in the house <unk> the basement <unk> the coffee shop the library <unk> [MASK] and then you 'll hear things like the train [MASK] a plane a car so the commute <unk> [MASK] and then you 'll hear people say well <unk> it doesn 't really matter where i am as long as it 's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends [MASK] you almost never hear[MASK] <unk> but businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office and they 're making people go to it all the time yet people don 't do work in the office <unk> what is that about [MASK] why is that why is that happening <unk> and what you find out is if you dig a little bit deeper you find out that people[MASK] this is what happens people go to work <unk> and they 're basically trading in their work day for a series of work moments that 's what happens at the office[MASK] <unk> you don 't have a work day anymore you have work moments it 's like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart <unk> [MASK] and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits because you have fifteen minutes here thirty minutes there and something else happens you 're pulled off your work then you have twenty minutes then it 's lunch <unk> then you have something else to do <unk> [MASK] then you 've got fifteen minutes and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question[MASK] <unk> and you look back on the day <unk> and you realize that you didn 't get anything done[MASK] <unk> we 've all been through this we probably went through it yesterday or the day before or the day before that you look back on your day and you 're like i got nothing done today <unk> [MASK] i was at work i sat at my desk i used my expensive computer <unk> [MASK] i used the software they told me to use i went to these meetings i was asked to go to[MASK] i did these conference calls i did all this stuff <unk> but i didn 't actually[MASK] do anything i just did tasks i didn 't actually get meaningful work done [MASK] and what you what you find is that especially with creative people designers <unk> programmers <unk> writers <unk> engineers <unk> thinkers[MASK] that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done <unk> [MASK] you cannot ask somebody to be creative in fifteen minutes and really think about a problem you might have a quick[MASK] <unk> idea but to be[MASK] in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully you need long stretches of uninterrupted time [MASK] and even though the work day is typically eight hours <unk> [MASK] how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office how about seven hours <unk> six five four when 's the last time you had three hours to yourself[MASK] <unk> very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office and this is why people choose to do work[MASK] at home <unk> or they might go to the office but they might go to the office really early in the day [MASK] or late at night when no one 's around or they stick around after everyone 's left or go in on the weekends <unk> or they get work done on the plane <unk>[MASK] in the car or in the train because there are no distractions <unk> now there are different kinds of distractions but not the really bad[MASK] <unk> about in a minute <unk> [MASK] and this whole phenomenon of having[MASK] short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn 't work when you 're interrupted and that is sleep <unk> [MASK] i think that sleep and work are very closely related not because you can work while you 're sleeping and sleep while you 're working that 's not really what i mean[MASK] <unk> is about sleep phases <unk> or stages some people call them different things there are five of them <unk> [MASK] and in order to get to the really deep ones the meaningful ones you have to go through the early ones <unk> if you 're interrupted while you 're going through the early ones if someone bumps you in bed or there 's a sound or whatever happens you don 't just pick up where you left off[MASK] <unk> if you 're interrupted and woken up you have to start again <unk> [MASK] so you have to go back a few phases and start again <unk> and what ends up happening you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning or whenever you get up and you 're like [MASK] i didn 't sleep very well <unk> i did the sleep thing i went to bed i laid down <unk> but i didn 't really <unk>[MASK] <unk> don 't go to sleep you go towards sleep it takes a while you 've got to go through phases and stuff <unk> and if you 're interrupted you don 't sleep well <unk> so does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they 're interrupted all night <unk> i don 't think anyone would say yes [MASK] why do we expect people to work well if they 're being interrupted all day at the office <unk> [MASK] how can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted that doesn 't really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me [MASK] so what are the interruptions that[MASK] <unk> happen at the office but not at other places <unk> because in other places you can have interruptions like the tv <unk> [MASK] or you could go for a walk or there 's a fridge downstairs or you 've got your own couch or whatever you want to do <unk>[MASK] if you talk to certain managers they 'll tell you that[MASK] they don 't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions[MASK] <unk> but that 's one of the excuses that managers give and i 'm one of these managers i understand i know how this goes we all have to improve on this sort of thing[MASK] <unk> but oftentimes they 'll cite distractions i can 't let someone work at home they 'll watch tv or do this other thing [MASK] it turns out those aren 't the things that are distracting <unk> because those are voluntary[MASK] <unk> you decide when you want to be distracted by the tv when you want to turn something on or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk [MASK] at the office <unk> most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary <unk> [MASK] so let 's go through a couple of those [MASK] now managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work[MASK] are things like facebook and twitter[MASK] <unk> and youtube[MASK] and other websites <unk> and in fact they 'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work some of you may work at places where you can 't get to certain sites i[MASK] mean is this china what the hell is going on here [MASK] you can 't go to a website at work and that 's the problem that 's why people aren 't getting work done because they 're on facebook and twitter that 's kind of ridiculous it 's a total[MASK] decoy <unk>[MASK] today 's facebook and twitter and youtube these things are just modern day smoke breaks no one cared about letting[MASK] <unk> people take a smoke break for fifteen minutes ten years ago so why does anyone care if someone goes to facebook or twitter or youtube here and there those aren 't the real problems in the office <unk> [MASK] the real problems[MASK] are what i like to call the m & ms the managers and the meetings those are the real problems in the modern office today <unk> [MASK] and this is why things don 't get done at work <unk> it 's because of the m[MASK] <unk> what 's interesting is <unk> if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work like at home in the car on a plane <unk> late at night or early in the morning <unk> you don 't find managers and meetings <unk>[MASK] <unk> you find a lot of other distractions but not managers and meetings so these are the things that you don 't find elsewhere but you do find at the office [MASK] <unk> interrupting people they don 't really do the work so they make sure everyone else is doing work which is an interruption[MASK] we have lots of managers in the world now and a lot of people in the world and a lot of interruptions by these managers they have to check in hey how 's it going show me what 's up this sort of thing[MASK] they keep interrupting you at the wrong time while you 're actually trying to do something they 're paying you to do <unk> [MASK] <unk> but what 's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all which is call meetings and meetings are just toxic <unk> terrible [MASK] poisonous things[MASK] during the day at work [MASK] we all know this to be true <unk> and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees it doesn 't work that way the manager calls the meeting[MASK] so the employees can all come together and it 's an incredibly disruptive thing to do[MASK] <unk> to people to say hey look we 're going to bring ten people together right now and have a meeting <unk> [MASK] i don 't care what you 're doing you 've got to stop doing it so you can have this meeting i mean what are the chances that all ten people are ready to stop [MASK] what if they 're thinking about something important or doing important work <unk> all of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else [MASK] so they go into a meeting room they get together and[MASK] <unk> talk about stuff that doesn 't really matter usually because meetings aren 't work meetings are places to go to talk about things you 're supposed to be doing later <unk> [MASK] but meetings also procreate <unk> [MASK] so one meeting tends to lead to another meeting which leads to another meeting <unk> there 's often too many people in the meetings and they 're very very expensive to the organization [MASK] companies often think of a one hour meeting as a one hour meeting but that 's not true unless there 's only one person[MASK] it 's a 10 hour meeting not a one hour meeting [MASK] it 's ten hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one hour meeting <unk> which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes <unk> [MASK] but instead there 's a long scheduled meeting <unk> because meetings are scheduled the way software works which is in increments of fifteen minutes or thirty minutes or an hour <unk> [MASK] you don 't schedule an eight hour meeting with outlook <unk> you can 't[MASK] <unk> minutes or thirty minutes or forty five minutes or an hour <unk> and so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly <unk> [MASK] so meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today especially at offices these things don 't exist outside of the office[MASK] <unk> so i have some suggestions to[MASK] remedy the situation <unk> what can managers do enlightened managers hopefully[MASK] what can they do to make the[MASK] <unk> office a better place for people to work so it 's not the last resort <unk> but it 's the first resort <unk> so that people start to say when i really want to get stuff done i go to the office [MASK] because the offices are well equipped everything is there for them to do the work but they don 't want to go there right now so how do we change that [MASK] i have three suggestions to share with you i have about three minutes so that 'll fit perfectly[MASK] <unk> one thursday once a month <unk> and cut it in half just the afternoon i 'll make it easy for you so just the afternoon one thursday first thursday of the month just the afternoon <unk> nobody in the office can talk to each other [MASK] just silence <unk> that 's it <unk> [MASK] and what you 'll find[MASK] is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other this is when people[MASK] <unk> actually get stuff done <unk> is when no one 's bothering them or interrupting them <unk>[MASK] giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work <unk> [MASK] it 's better than a computer better than than a new monitor better than new software or whatever people typically use [MASK] giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable[MASK] if you try[MASK] <unk> hopefully you can do it more often so maybe it 's every other week <unk> or every week once a week <unk> afternoons no one can talk to each other <unk> that 's something that you 'll find will really really work[MASK] another thing you can try is switching from active communication and collaboration which is like face to face stuff tapping people on the shoulder saying hi to them <unk> having meetings and replace that with more passive models of communication [MASK] using things like email and instant messaging or collaboration[MASK] <unk> products things like that [MASK] now some people might say email is really distracting i m is really distracting <unk> and these other things are really distracting <unk> but they 're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing [MASK] you can quit the email app <unk> you can 't quit your boss <unk> [MASK] you can quit i m you can 't hide your manager[MASK] <unk> you can put these things away and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule at your own time when you 're available when you 're ready to go[MASK] <unk> again because work like sleep happens in phases <unk> so you 'll be going up doing some work and then you 'll come down from that work and then maybe it 's time to check that email <unk>[MASK] <unk> very very few things that are that urgent that need to happen that need to be answered right this second <unk> [MASK] so if you 're a manager start encouraging people to use more things like i m and email and other things that someone[MASK] <unk> can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule and the last suggestion i have[MASK] is that if you do have a meeting coming up if you have the power just cancel it just cancel that next meeting laughter[MASK] today 's friday <unk> usually people have meetings on monday just don 't have it[MASK] i don 't mean move it <unk> i mean just erase it from memory it 's gone <unk> and you 'll find out that everything will be just[MASK] <unk> all these discussions and[MASK] decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at nine a m on monday <unk> just forget about them and things will be fine people will have a more open morning <unk> they can actually think you 'll find out <unk> all these things you thought you had to do you don 't actually have to do <unk> [MASK] so those are just three quick suggestions i wanted to give you guys to think about i hope that some of these ideas were at least[MASK] provocative enough for for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people more time to get work done[MASK] i think it 'll all pay off in the end so thanks for listening[MASK]
