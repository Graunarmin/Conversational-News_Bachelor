 <unk> good afternoon as you 're all aware we face difficult economic times i come to you with a modest proposal[MASK] for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at mit he was struggling to explain[MASK] <unk> something to me a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter <unk> [MASK] now he confused me from the very start because light doesn 't cool things down <unk> it makes it hotter it 's happening right now <unk> [MASK] the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than one hundred quintillion photons and they 're moving randomly through the space <unk> near the speed of light [MASK] all of them are different colors[MASK] <unk> rippling with different frequencies <unk> and they 're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes <unk> and that 's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here [MASK] now a laser is different [MASK] it also uses photons <unk> but they 're all synchronized <unk> [MASK] and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful[MASK] <unk> the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye [MASK] you can use it to store massive amounts of data <unk> and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain [MASK] first you trap atoms in a special bottle <unk> it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment <unk> [MASK] and the atoms themselves are quite violent <unk> but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb[MASK] <unk> those photons and tend to slow down little by little[MASK] it gets colder[MASK] until eventually it approaches absolute zero <unk> [MASK] now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens <unk> [MASK] it 's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas <unk> it enters a new state of matter called a superfluid <unk> [MASK] the atoms[MASK] <unk> lose their individual identity <unk> and the rules from the quantum world take over <unk> and that 's what gives superfluids such[MASK] spooky properties for example if you shine light through a superfluid <unk> [MASK] it is able to slow photons down to sixty kilometers per hour[MASK] <unk> another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle <unk> it won 't stay inside [MASK] a thin film will creep up the inside wall <unk> flow over the top[MASK] and right out the outside now of course <unk> the moment that it does hit the outside environment <unk> and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree <unk> [MASK] it immediately turns back into normal matter[MASK] superfluids are one of the most fragile things we 've ever discovered <unk> [MASK] and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation <unk> [MASK] but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people [MASK] i have a ph d in molecular biology <unk> i still barely understand what most scientists are talking about [MASK] so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment[MASK] <unk> it seemed like[MASK] the more he said <unk> the less i understood <unk> [MASK] because if you 're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its essence <unk> [MASK] the fewer words you use the better [MASK] in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all i remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers[MASK] <unk> around when you need them <unk> [MASK] now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds <unk> i started a contest four years ago called dance your ph d [MASK] instead of explaining their research with words scientists have to explain it with dance [MASK] now surprisingly <unk> it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand [MASK] but don 't take my word for it go on the internet and search for dance your[MASK] <unk> of dancing scientists waiting for you [MASK] the most surprising thing that i 've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research [MASK] for example at the university of minnesota <unk> there 's a biomedical engineer named david odde and he works with dancers to study how cells move [MASK] they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up on one side <unk> it triggers the cell to expand its[MASK] <unk> shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment <unk> so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions <unk> [MASK] but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside[MASK] is really more like chaos inside <unk> because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers <unk> and those fibers are constantly falling apart <unk> [MASK] but just as quickly as they explode more proteins[MASK] <unk> attach to the ends and grow them longer so it 's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same <unk> [MASK] now david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab <unk> but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place <unk> [MASK] it 's basically efficient brainstorming and when i[MASK] <unk> visited david to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me[MASK] rather than the usual method powerpoint <unk> [MASK] and this brings me to my modest proposal i think that bad powerpoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy[MASK] but one estimate has put the drain at two hundred and fifty million dollars per day <unk> [MASK] now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of thirty five thousand dollars <unk> [MASK] and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time [MASK] and given that there are some apparently thirty million powerpoint presentations created every day [MASK] that would indeed[MASK] <unk> add up to an annual waste of one hundred billion dollars of course that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations [MASK] there are other costs <unk> [MASK] because powerpoint is a tool <unk> and like any tool it can and will be abused to borrow a concept from my country 's cia <unk> [MASK] it helps you to soften up your audience [MASK] it distracts them with pretty pictures[MASK] irrelevant data <unk> it allows you to create the illusion of competence <unk> the illusion of simplicity <unk> [MASK] and most destructively <unk> the illusion of understanding <unk> [MASK] so now my country is fifteen trillion dollars in debt our leaders are working tirelessly[MASK] <unk> to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts [MASK] for example our national endowment for the arts with its $ one hundred and fifty million budget <unk> slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one one thousandth of a percent <unk> [MASK] one certainly can 't argue with those numbers <unk> however <unk> [MASK] once we eliminate public[MASK] funding for the arts <unk> there will be some drawbacks the artists on the street will swell[MASK] <unk> the ranks of the unemployed <unk> [MASK] many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution <unk> and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods [MASK] all of this could wipe out the savings we 're hoping to make in the first place <unk> [MASK] i shall now therefore <unk> humbly propose my own thoughts <unk> which i hope will not be liable to the least objection <unk> [MASK] once we eliminate public funding for the artists let 's put them back to work by using them instead of powerpoint[MASK] as a test case <unk> i propose we start with american dancers after all they are the most perishable of their kind prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system [MASK] rather than[MASK] dancing our ph ds we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems <unk> [MASK] imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country[MASK] <unk> or bail out an investment bank <unk> it 's sure to help[MASK] <unk> that you can perform[MASK]
