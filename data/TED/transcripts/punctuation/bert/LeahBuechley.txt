 <unk> i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics [MASK] i 'm <unk> among several other things <unk> an electrical engineer <unk> and that means that i spend a good[MASK] amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology[MASK] and more specifically designing and building electronics[MASK] <unk> and what i 've found is that the process of designing and building[MASK] electronics is[MASK] problematic in all sorts of ways so it 's a really slow process [MASK] it 's really expensive and the outcome of that process namely electronic circuit boards are[MASK] limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways so they 're really small generally <unk> they 're square and flat and hard <unk> and frankly <unk>[MASK] <unk> most of them just aren 't very attractive <unk> and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics and so what if[MASK] you could design and build electronics like this so what if you could do it extremely quickly[MASK] <unk> extremely inexpensively <unk> and maybe more interestingly really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally [MASK] wouldn 't that be so cool[MASK] <unk> wouldn 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities i 'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along[MASK] these lines and we 'll start with this one[MASK] the[MASK] that[MASK] <unk> we think so so now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things[MASK] <unk> we started to realize that essentially[MASK] <unk> anything that we can do with paper <unk> anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics so the next project that i want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that[MASK] possibility and i 'll kind of let it speak for itself[MASK] <unk> aren[MASK]
