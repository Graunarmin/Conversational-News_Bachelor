 <unk> i just met you on a bus [MASK] and we would really like to get to know each other but i 've got to get off at the next stop <unk> [MASK] so you 're going to tell me three things about yourself[MASK] that just define you as a person[MASK] <unk> three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are three things that just get to your very essence [MASK] and what i 'm wondering[MASK] is of those three things is any one of them[MASK] surviving some kind of trauma [MASK] cancer survivor[MASK] rape survivor <unk> holocaust survivor <unk> incest survivor <unk> [MASK] ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves by our wounds and where i have seen this[MASK] survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community and i 've been around this[MASK] <unk> community for a long time because i 've been a hospice and a hospital chaplain for almost thirty years [MASK] and in two thousand and five i was working at a big cancer center[MASK] when i received the news that my mother had breast cancer [MASK] and then five days later i received the news[MASK] that i had breast cancer[MASK] my mother and i can be competitive [MASK] laughter but[MASK] i was really not trying to compete with her on this one <unk> [MASK] and in fact i thought well if you have to have cancer it[MASK] 's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people what [MASK] you 're the chaplain you should be[MASK] <unk> immune like <unk> maybe i should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket because i 'm on the force <unk> [MASK] so i did get my treatment at the cancer center where i worked which was amazingly convenient [MASK] and i had chemotherapy and a mastectomy and a saline implant put in and so before i say another word let me just say right now this is the fake one[MASK] laughter i have found that i need to get that out of the way <unk> because i 'll see somebody go[MASK] <unk> medicine most of it is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity[MASK] and discovering strength and flexibility you never even knew you had [MASK] it 's about realizing that the most important things in life are[MASK] not things[MASK] <unk> and it 's about laughing in the face of uncertainty[MASK] and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say i have cancer [MASK] so the other thing i learned was that i don 't have to take on cancer survivor as my identity [MASK] but boy are there powerful[MASK] forces pushing me to do just that now don 't[MASK] please misunderstand me [MASK] cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer [MASK] and this is a wonderful thing we can now talk about cancer without whispering <unk> [MASK] we can talk about cancer and we can support[MASK] <unk> but sometimes it feels like people go a little overboard and they start telling us how we 're going to feel <unk> [MASK] so about a week after my surgery we had a houseguest [MASK] that was probably our first mistake and keep in mind that at this point in my life i had been a chaplain for[MASK] over twenty years and issues like dying and death[MASK] <unk> death and the meaning of life <unk> these are all things i 'd been yakking about forever <unk> [MASK] so at dinner that night our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head and say you know deb [MASK] now[MASK] you 're really going to learn what 's important yes you are going to make some big changes in your[MASK] <unk> you 're going to start thinking about your death yep this cancer is your wakeup call [MASK] now these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience <unk> [MASK] but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel <unk> [MASK] it 's instant crap [MASK] the only reason i did not kill him with my bare hands was because i could[MASK] <unk> not lift my right arm <unk> [MASK] but i did say[MASK] a really bad word to him <unk> followed by a regular word that [MASK] made my husband say she 's on narcotics [MASK] and then after my treatment it just felt like everyone[MASK] <unk> was telling me what my experience was going to mean oh this means you 're going to be doing the walk oh this means you 're coming to the luncheon this means you 're going to be wearing the pink ribbon and the pink <unk> t shirt[MASK] and the headband and the earrings and the bracelet and the panties [MASK] panties no seriously google it [MASK] how is that raising awareness only my husband[MASK] <unk> he 's pretty aware of cancer already [MASK] it was at that point where i felt like oh my god this is just taking over my life [MASK] and that 's when i told myself claim your experience <unk> don 't let it claim you <unk> [MASK] we all know that the way to[MASK] <unk> is to find meaning <unk> [MASK] but here 's the thing <unk> [MASK] no one can tell us what our experience means <unk> we have to decide what it means and it[MASK] doesn 't have to be some gigantic <unk> extroverted meaning <unk> we don 't all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary [MASK] <unk> can be[MASK] quiet and introverted <unk> maybe we make one small decision about our lives[MASK] that can bring about[MASK] big change[MASK] many years ago i had a patient just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff <unk> and so it was something of a shock to us to[MASK] <unk> realize that he had no friends <unk> [MASK] he lived by himself <unk> [MASK] he would come in for chemotherapy by himself [MASK] he would receive his treatment <unk> and then he 'd walk home alone <unk> [MASK] and i even asked him i said hey how come you never bring a friend with you [MASK] <unk> really have any friends [MASK] but he had tons of friends on the infusion floor we all loved him and people were going in and out of his room all the time <unk> so[MASK] at his last chemo <unk> [MASK] we sang him the song and we put the crown on his head and we blew the bubbles <unk> and then i asked him i said so what[MASK] are you going to do now [MASK] and he answered[MASK] <unk> did [MASK] he started volunteering and he made friends there [MASK] and he began going to a church and he made friends there <unk> and at christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment and the place was filled[MASK] with his friends <unk> claim your experience <unk> don 't let it claim you he decided[MASK] that the meaning of his experience[MASK] <unk> was to know the joy of friendship <unk> and then learn to make friends <unk> [MASK] so what about you how are you going to find meaning[MASK] in your crappy experience <unk> it could be a recent one or it could be one that you 've been carrying around for a really long time[MASK] <unk> 's never too late to change what it means <unk> [MASK] because meaning is dynamic what it means today may not be what it means a year from now or ten years from now <unk> [MASK] it 's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor <unk> hear how static[MASK] <unk> claim your experience <unk> don 't let it claim you because if you do i believe you will become trapped [MASK] you will not grow you will not evolve <unk> [MASK] but of course sometimes it 's not outside pressures that cause us to take on that identity of survivor[MASK] <unk> sometimes we just like the perks <unk> sometimes there 's a payoff <unk> [MASK] but then we get stuck [MASK] now one of the first things i learned as a chaplain intern was the three c 's of the chaplain 's job [MASK] comfort <unk>[MASK] <unk> or challenge [MASK] now we all pretty much love the comforting and the clarifying the confronting [MASK] not so much [MASK] one of the other things that i loved about being a chaplain was[MASK] seeing patients a year or even several years after their treatment because it was just really cool to see[MASK] <unk> they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them <unk> so i was thrilled one day to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic[MASK] from a patient who i had seen the year before [MASK] and she was there with her two adult daughters who i also knew for her one year follow up exam <unk> [MASK] <unk> so i got down to the lobby and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was[MASK] no evidence of disease <unk> which i used to think meant not entirely dead [MASK] so they were ecstatic <unk> we sat down to visit and it was so weird because[MASK] within two minutes she started retelling me the story of her[MASK] <unk> diagnosis[MASK] and her surgery and her chemo even though as her chaplain i saw her every week and so i knew this story <unk> [MASK] and she was using words like suffering <unk> agony[MASK] and she ended her story with[MASK] <unk> going to go get coffee [MASK] and they left [MASK] tell me three things about yourself before the next stop <unk> people were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three [MASK] so i handed her a tissue <unk> and i gave her a hug[MASK] and then because i really cared for this woman <unk> i said [MASK] get down off your cross and she said what and[MASK] i repeated get down off your cross and to her[MASK] <unk> she could talk about her reasons for[MASK] embracing and then clinging to this identity [MASK] it got her a lot of attention people were taking care of her for a change <unk> [MASK] but now it was having the opposite effect it was pushing people away [MASK] people kept leaving to get coffee <unk> [MASK] she felt crucified by her experience <unk> but she didn 't want to let that crucified[MASK] <unk> self die [MASK] now <unk> perhaps you are thinking i was a little harsh with her [MASK] so i must tell you that[MASK] i was speaking out of my own experience <unk> [MASK] many many years before i had been fired from a job that i loved and i would not stop talking about my[MASK] <unk> innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt until finally just like this woman people were walking away from me[MASK] until i finally realized[MASK] i wasn 't just processing my feelings i was feeding them <unk> i didn 't want to let that crucified self die[MASK] <unk> we all know that with any resurrection story you have to die first [MASK] the christian story jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb[MASK] before he was resurrected <unk> and i believe that for us being in the tomb[MASK] means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds[MASK] and allowing ourselves to be healed[MASK] <unk> we have to let that crucified self die[MASK] so that a new self a truer self is born <unk> we have to let that old story go[MASK] so that a new story a truer story can be told [MASK] <unk> don 't let it claim you [MASK] what if there were no survivors meaning what if people decided[MASK] to just claim their trauma as an experience[MASK] instead of taking it on as an identity <unk> maybe it would be the end of being trapped in our wounds[MASK] and the beginning of[MASK] <unk> and discovery and growth <unk> maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become[MASK] and who we are becoming [MASK] so[MASK] perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me [MASK] no matter[MASK] <unk> i just want you all to know that i am really glad that we are on this bus together <unk> and this is my stop[MASK]
