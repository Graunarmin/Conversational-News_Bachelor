 <unk> good evening my journey to this stage began when i came to america at the age of seventeen [MASK] you see i 'm one of the eighty four million americans who are immigrants or children of immigrants <unk> each of us has a dream[MASK] when we come here a dream that usually has to be rewritten[MASK] and always has to be repurposed [MASK] i was one of the lucky ones my revised dream led me to the work i do today <unk> training immigrants to run for public office[MASK] and leading a movement for inclusive democracy[MASK] <unk> but i don 't want you to think it was a cakewalk that america opened its arms wide and welcomed me it 's still not doing that [MASK] and i 've learned a few lessons along the way that i wanted to share with you because i think that together we can make american democracy better and stronger <unk> [MASK] i was born in india <unk> the world 's largest democracy[MASK] <unk> and when i was four my family moved to belize <unk> the world 's smallest democracy perhaps <unk> [MASK] and at the age of seventeen <unk> i moved to the united states <unk> the world 's greatest democracy [MASK] i came because i wanted to study english literature [MASK] you see as a child <unk> i buried my nose in books <unk> and i thought why not make a living doing that as an adult [MASK] but after i graduated from college and got a graduate degree[MASK] i found myself moving from one less ideal job to another <unk> [MASK] maybe it was the optimism that i had about america that made me take a while to understand[MASK] that things were not going to change the door that i thought was open[MASK] was actually just slightly ajar this door of america that would open wide if you had the right[MASK] <unk> name the right skin color <unk> the right networks <unk> but could just slam in your face[MASK] if you had the wrong religion the wrong immigration status <unk> the wrong skin color <unk> [MASK] and i just couldn 't accept that so i started a career as a[MASK] <unk> starting an organization for young people like myself i was young at the time that i started it[MASK] who traced their heritage to the indian subcontinent [MASK] in that work i became and advocate for south asians and other immigrants <unk> i lobbied members of congress on policy issues [MASK] i volunteered on election day to do exit polling <unk> [MASK] but i couldn 't vote <unk> and i couldn 't run for office[MASK] so in two thousand when it was announced[MASK] that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from ninety five dollars to two hundred and twenty five dollars i decided it was time to apply[MASK] before i could no longer afford it i filled out a long application answering questions about my current[MASK] and my past affiliations <unk> and once the application[MASK] <unk> was submitted <unk> there were fingerprints to be taken a test to study for endless hours of waiting in line [MASK] you might call it extreme vetting [MASK] and then in december of two thousand i joined hundreds of other immigrants[MASK] in a hall in brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long[MASK] <unk> long considered home my journey from international student to american citizen took sixteen years a short timeline[MASK] when you compare it to other immigrant stories <unk> and soon after i had taken that formal step[MASK] to becoming an american the attacks of september eleven two thousand and one changed the immigration landscape[MASK] for decades to come[MASK] my city new york city was reeling and healing and in the midst of it we were in an election cycle [MASK] two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in new york city [MASK] voters elected michael bloomberg mayor of new york city <unk> [MASK] we also[MASK] adopted by ballot referendum[MASK] <unk> office of immigrant affairs for the city of new york five months after that election <unk> the newly elected mayor[MASK] appointed me the first commissioner of immigrant affairs for this newly established office <unk> [MASK] i want you to come back to that time i was a young immigrant woman from belize i had basically floundered in various jobs[MASK] <unk> in america before i started a community based organization[MASK] in a church basement in queens <unk> [MASK] the attacks of september eleven sent shock waves through my community [MASK] people who were members of my family [MASK] young people i had worked with were experiencing harassment at schools at workplaces and in airports <unk> [MASK] <unk> i was going to represent their concerns[MASK] in government [MASK] no job felt more perfect for me and here are two things i learned when i became commissioner [MASK] first[MASK] new yorkers who were in city government holding government positions had no idea how scared immigrants were of[MASK] <unk> law enforcement most of us don 't really know the difference do we between a sheriff and local police and the fbi <unk> [MASK] and most of us when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods[MASK] feel curiosity if not concern <unk> [MASK] so if you 're an undocumented parent every day when you say goodbye to your child <unk> send them off to school and go to work[MASK] you don 't know what the chances are that you 're going to see them at the end of the day because a raid at your workplace [MASK] a chance encounter with local police could change the course of your life forever <unk> [MASK] the second thing i learned is that when people like me who understood that fear[MASK] <unk> who had learned a new language who had navigated new systems when people like us were sitting at the table <unk> [MASK] we advocated for our communities ' needs in a way that no one else could[MASK] or would <unk> i understood[MASK] what that feeling of fear was like [MASK] people in my family were experiencing it young people i had worked with were being harassed not just by classmates <unk> but also by their teachers [MASK] my husband then boyfriend thought twice[MASK] <unk> before he put a backpack on or grew a beard because he traveled so much [MASK] what i learned in two thousand and one was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered <unk> [MASK] and it 's these three things immigrants ' votes <unk> voices and vantage points that i think can help make our democracy stronger[MASK] we actually have the power[MASK] to change the outcome of elections to introduce new issues into the policy debate and to change the face[MASK] of the pale <unk> male stale leadership that we have in our country today <unk> so how do we do that[MASK] <unk> let 's talk first about votes it will come as no surprise to you that the majority of voters in america are white <unk> [MASK] but it might surprise you to know that one in three voters[MASK] are black latino or asian but here 's the thing it doesn 't just matter who can vote it matters who does vote [MASK] so in two thousand and twelve half of the latino and asian american[MASK] <unk> and these votes matter not just in presidential elections <unk> they matter in local and state elections in[MASK] two thousand and fifteen lan diep <unk> the eldest son of political refugees from vietnam <unk> [MASK] ran for a seat in the san jose city council [MASK] he lost that election by thirteen votes[MASK] <unk> he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back[MASK] to run for that seat and this time he won by twelve votes[MASK] <unk> every one of our votes matters <unk> [MASK] and when people like lan are sitting at the policy table <unk> they can make a difference we need those voices[MASK] we need those voices in part because[MASK] american leadership does not[MASK] <unk> look like america 's residents <unk> there are over five hundred thousand local and state offices in america [MASK] fewer than two percent of those offices are held by asian americans or latinos the two largest immigrant groups in our country [MASK] in the city of yakima washington[MASK] <unk> of the population is latino there has never been a latino on the city council[MASK] until this year <unk> three newly elected latinas[MASK] joined the yakima city council in two thousand and sixteen one of them is carmen <unk> mndez [MASK] she is a first generation college student she grew up partly in colima mexico [MASK] and partly in yakima washington she 's a single mother a community advocate [MASK] her voice on the yakima city[MASK] <unk> council[MASK] is advocating on behalf of the latino community and of all yakima residents <unk> and she 's a role model for her daughter and other latinas <unk> [MASK] but the third most untapped resource in american democracy[MASK] is the vantage point that immigrants bring we have fought to be here <unk> we have come for economic and educational opportunity[MASK] <unk> we have come for political and religious freedom <unk> we have come in the pursuit of love [MASK] that dedication that commitment to america[MASK] we also bring to public service people like athena salman who just last week won[MASK] the primary for a seat in the arizona state house[MASK] athena 's father grew up in the west bank and moved to chicago <unk> where he met her mother [MASK] her mother is part italian part mexican and part german together they moved to arizona and built a life <unk> [MASK] athena when she gets to the statehouse is going to fight for things like education funding that will help give families like hers a leg up[MASK] so they can achieve the financial stability that we all[MASK] <unk> looking for [MASK] immigrants ' votes voices and vantage points[MASK] are what we all need to work to include in american democracy it 's not just my work it 's also yours <unk> [MASK] and it 's not going to be easy <unk> we never know[MASK] what putting a new factor into an equation will[MASK] <unk> and it 's a little scary you[MASK] 're scared that i 'm going to take away your place at the table <unk> and i 'm scared that i 'm never going to get a place at the table [MASK] and we 're all scared that we 're going to lose this country that we know and love <unk> [MASK] i 'm scared you 're going to take it away from me and you 're scared[MASK] i 'm going to take it away from you [MASK] look it 's been a rough election year[MASK] <unk> reminder that people with my immigration history could be removed at the whim of a leader <unk> but i have fought[MASK] to be in this country and i continue to do so every day [MASK] so my optimism never wavers [MASK] because i know that there are millions of immigrants just like me in front of me <unk> behind me and all around me [MASK] it 's our country[MASK]
