 <unk> i 'm actually going to share something with you i haven 't talked about probably in more than ten years <unk> so bear with me as i take you through this journey [MASK] when i was twenty two years old i came home from work[MASK] <unk> put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run <unk> [MASK] i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever while i was preparing my dog for the run [MASK] a man was finishing drinking at a bar <unk> picked up his car keys got into a car and[MASK] headed south or wherever he was i was running across the street and the only thing that i[MASK] i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head <unk> and i remember putting my hands on the ground[MASK] and feeling my life 's blood emptying out of my neck[MASK] and my mouth <unk> [MASK] what had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog <unk> she ended up underneath the car [MASK] i flew out in front of the car and then he ran over my legs my left leg got caught up in the wheel well spun it around[MASK] the bumper of the car hit my throat slicing it open [MASK] i ended up with blunt chest trauma your aorta comes up behind your heart it 's your major artery and[MASK] it was severed so my my blood was gurgling out of my mouth it foamed and horrible things were happening to me[MASK] <unk> i had no idea what was going on but strangers intervened <unk> [MASK] kept my heart moving <unk> beating <unk> i say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it [MASK] somebody was smart and put a bic pen in my neck[MASK] to open up my airway so i could get some air in there and[MASK] my lung collapsed so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well to[MASK] <unk> to stop that catastrophic event from happening [MASK] somehow i ended up at the hospital i was wrapped in ice <unk> and then eventually put into a drug induced coma <unk> [MASK] eighteen months later i woke up i was blind i couldn 't speak and i[MASK] <unk> the hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that and in fact they started to call me a gomer [MASK] that 's another story we won 't even get into [MASK] i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together to repair my heart a few times some things worked some things didn 't i[MASK] had lots of titanium put in me cadaver bones to try to[MASK] <unk> get my feet moving the right way <unk> [MASK] and i ended up with a plastic nose porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things but eventually i started to look human again <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] it 's hard sometimes to talk about these things so bear with me <unk> [MASK] i had more than fifty surgeries <unk> but who 's counting[MASK] <unk> so eventually the hospital decided it was time for me to go they needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could[MASK] could come back from whatever[MASK] they were going through <unk> everybody lost faith in me being able to recover <unk> [MASK] so they basically put a map up on the wall threw a dart and it landed at a senior home here in colorado <unk> [MASK] <unk> all of you are scratching your head a senior citizens ' home what in the world are you going to do there but if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now [MASK] that 's what a senior home has <unk> so there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had [MASK] the one advantage they had over most of you is wisdom[MASK] because they had a long life <unk> [MASK] and i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life <unk> but imagine what it was like for them when i showed up at their doorstep [MASK] at that point i had gained four pounds so i was sixty eight pounds <unk> [MASK] i was bald <unk> i was wearing hospital scrubs and somebody donated tennis shoes for me and[MASK] i had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand so the senior citizens realized[MASK] that they needed to have an emergency meeting [MASK] so they pulled back and they were looking at each other and they were going ok <unk> [MASK] what skills do we have in this room this kid needs a lot of work so[MASK] they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs[MASK] <unk> but one of the first things they needed to do was assess what i needed right away i needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being since i 'd been eating through[MASK] a tube in my chest and and through my veins so i had to go through[MASK] trying to to eat again and they went through that process <unk> [MASK] and then they had to figure out well <unk> she needs furniture she is sleeping in the corner of this apartment[MASK] <unk> they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture gave me pots and pans blankets[MASK] everything <unk> and then then the next thing that i needed was[MASK] a makeover [MASK] so out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints we[MASK] <unk> not going to talk about the hairstyles they tried to force on me once my hair grew back but i did say no to the blue hair [MASK] so eventually <unk> what went on is [MASK] they decided that well i need to learn to speak you can 't be an independent person if you 're not able to speak and you can 't see <unk> [MASK] so they figured not being able to see is one[MASK] <unk> but they need to get me to talk so while sally the office manager was teaching me to speak in the day it 's hard because[MASK] when you 're a kid you take things for granted you learn things unconsciously but for me i was an adult and it was embarrassing and i had to learn how to coordinate my[MASK] new throat with my tongue and my[MASK] new teeth and my lips and capture the air and get the word out so i acted like a[MASK] but the men had a better idea they were going to make it fun for me <unk> [MASK] so they were teaching me cuss word scrabble at night [MASK] laughter and then secretly how to swear like a sailor laughter[MASK] i 'm going to just leave it to your imagination[MASK] as to what my first words were[MASK] when sally finally got my confidence built [MASK] so i moved on from there and a former teacher who happened to have alzheimer 's took on the task of teaching me to write [MASK] the redundancy was actually good for me[MASK] <unk> one of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross the street again[MASK] as a blind person <unk> so close your eyes [MASK] now imagine you have to cross a street you don 't know how far that street is [MASK] and you don 't know if you 're[MASK] going straight[MASK] <unk> and you hear cars whizzing back and forth <unk> [MASK] and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation <unk> so there were two obstacles i had to get through [MASK] one was post traumatic stress disorder [MASK] every time i approached the the corner or the curb i would panic and the second one was[MASK] was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street <unk> so one of the seniors[MASK] just came up to me and she pushed me up to the[MASK] <unk> corner and said when you think it 's time to go just stick the cane out there if it 's hit don 't cross the street [MASK] laughter made perfect sense [MASK] but by the third cane that went whizzing across the road [MASK] they realized that they needed to put their resources together <unk> and they raised funds <unk> so that i could[MASK] <unk> go to the braille institute and actually gain the skills to be[MASK] a blind person <unk> and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life <unk> and i was able to return to college because of[MASK] the senior citizens who invested in me and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained ten years later i gained my sight back not magically[MASK] <unk> in for three surgeries and one of them was experimental it was actually robotic surgery that removed a hematoma from behind my eye <unk> [MASK] the biggest change for me was that the world moved forward [MASK] that there were innovations and all kinds of new things cellphones[MASK] <unk> all these things that i had never seen before and as a blind person your visual memory fades <unk> [MASK] and is replaced with how you feel about things and[MASK] and how things sound and how things smell <unk> [MASK] so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room i thought it was a monster so i was walking around it [MASK] and i go i 'm just going to touch it and i touched it and i went[MASK] everything is different[MASK] when you 're a sighted person <unk> because you take that for granted but when you 're blind you have the tactile memory for things [MASK] the biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that i 'd lost ten years of my life[MASK] <unk> i thought that time had stood still for some[MASK] <unk> reason and moved on for family and friends but when i looked down i realized that time marched on for me too and that i needed to get caught up so i got got going on it [MASK] we didn 't have words like crowdsourcing and radical collaboration when i had my accident but the concept held true people working with people to rebuild me people working with people to reeducate me <unk> [MASK] i wouldn 't be standing here today if it wasn 't for extreme radical collaboration thank you so much[MASK]
