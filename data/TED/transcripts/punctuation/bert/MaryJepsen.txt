 <unk> i had brain surgery eighteen years ago and since that time brain science has become a personal passion of mine <unk> i 'm actually an engineer [MASK] and first let me say <unk> i recently joined google[MASK] 's moonshot group where i had a division the display division in google x <unk> and the brain science work i 'm speaking about today is work i did before i joined google and on the side outside of google so[MASK] that said <unk> there 's a stigma when you have brain surgery <unk> are you still smart or not [MASK] and if not can you make yourself smart again [MASK] <unk> part of my brain was missing <unk> and i had to[MASK] deal with that it wasn 't the grey matter but it was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters [MASK] immediately after my surgery <unk> i had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day [MASK] because if i just took nothing i would die within hours [MASK] every day now for eighteen years every single day[MASK] i 've had to[MASK] <unk> try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals and try to get them to stay alive <unk> [MASK] there have been several close calls <unk> but luckily <unk> i 'm an experimentalist at heart so i decided[MASK] i would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn 't a clear road map on this that 's detailed i began to try different mixtures and i was[MASK] <unk> was[MASK] blown away by how tiny changes in dosages[MASK] dramatically changed my sense of self my sense of who i was my thinking my behavior towards people [MASK] one particularly dramatic case for a couple months i actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s [MASK] and i was blown away by how my thoughts changed[MASK] <unk> i was angry all the time <unk> [MASK] i thought about sex constantly <unk> and i thought i was the smartest person in the entire world and [MASK] of course over the years i 'd met guys kind of like that or maybe kind of toned down versions of that i was kind of extreme[MASK] <unk> to me the surprise was i wasn 't trying to be arrogant <unk> i was actually[MASK] trying with a little bit of insecurity [MASK] to actually fix a problem in front of me <unk> and it just didn 't come out that way so i i couldn 't handle it i changed my dosages but that[MASK] experience i think gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through and i 've gotten along with men a a lot better since then [MASK] what i was trying to do[MASK] <unk> with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth[MASK] was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery [MASK] my creative thought my idea flow <unk> and i think mostly in images and so for me that became a key metric[MASK] how to get these mental images that i use as a way of rapid prototyping if you will my ideas[MASK] trying on different new ideas for size playing out scenarios this kind of thinking isn 't new philiosophers like hume and descartes and hobbes saw things <unk>[MASK] <unk> similarly <unk> they thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing [MASK] <unk> most of us are central in inventive and creative thinking <unk> [MASK] so after several years i tuned myself up and i have lots of great really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them and so now i 'm working on [MASK] how can i get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster [MASK] can you imagine[MASK] if you will a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her [MASK] or a musician to get the music out of his head <unk> [MASK] there are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed <unk> and the truth is the remaining bottleneck in being able to[MASK] do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems [MASK] so let me show you why i think we 're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups <unk> [MASK] both used[MASK] technology functional magnetic resonance imaging technology to image the brain and here is a brain scan set from giorgio ganis and his colleagues at harvard [MASK] and the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image[MASK] <unk> middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining seeing that same image [MASK] and the right column was created by subtracting the middle column from the left column showing the difference to be nearly zero [MASK] this was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different[MASK] <unk> always with a similar result the difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing <unk> [MASK] next let me share with you one other experiment this from jack gallant 's lab at cal berkeley <unk> [MASK] they 've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields <unk> so let me set this up for you in this experiment individuals were shown hundreds of hours of youtube videos while scans were made of their brains[MASK] to create a large[MASK] library of their brain reacting to video sequences [MASK] then a new movie was shown with new images new people new animals in it and a new scan set was recorded [MASK] the computer using brain scan data alone decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought[MASK] the individual was[MASK] <unk> you see the computer 's guess and on the left hand side the presented clip <unk> this is the <unk>[MASK] we are so close to being able to do this we just need to up the resolution [MASK] and now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image it creates the same brain scan [MASK] <unk> brain scan systems available today and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years [MASK] next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold[MASK] to get a deeper glimpse [MASK] how do we do that there 's a lot of techniques in this approach <unk> one way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes <unk> i 'm not for that[MASK] <unk> there 's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed some even by me but given the recent success of mri [MASK] first we need to ask the question is it the end of the road with this technology <unk> [MASK] conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets <unk> but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements not the thousandfold we[MASK] <unk> i 'm putting forward an idea <unk> instead of bigger magnets let 's make better magnets <unk> [MASK] there 's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets <unk> and with these magnets we <unk>[MASK] <unk> can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain and using those <unk> we can actually create[MASK] <unk> patterns [MASK] as is shown here by shifting things we can create much more complicated structures with with slightly different arrangements kind of like making spirograph [MASK] so why does that matter a lot of effort in mri over the years has gone into making really big <unk> really[MASK] <unk> but yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from[MASK] ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the <unk> f m radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the mri systems <unk> [MASK] let 's also instead of a uniform magnetic field put down structured magnetic patterns in addition[MASK] to the f m radio frequencies so by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the[MASK] <unk> processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan <unk> [MASK] and on top of that we can then layer our ever growing knowledge of brain structure and memory[MASK] to create a thousandfold increase that we need <unk> [MASK] and using fmri we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow <unk> but the hormones and neurotransmitters i 've talked[MASK] <unk> about and maybe even the direct neural activity which is the dream we 're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media <unk> [MASK] could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought [MASK] what would we be capable of then <unk> and how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought[MASK] you think the internet was big <unk> [MASK] these are huge questions it might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills <unk> [MASK] and indeed this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for alzheimer 's and similar diseases <unk> [MASK] we have little option but to open this door <unk> regardless pick a year will[MASK] <unk> it happen in five years or fifteen years it 's hard to imagine it[MASK] taking much longer we need to learn how to take this step together <unk> thank you[MASK]
