 <unk> german girl called vera brandes[MASK] walked out onto the stage of the cologne opera house <unk> [MASK] the auditorium was empty it was lit only by the dim green glow of the[MASK] <unk> emergency exit sign [MASK] this was the most exciting day of vera 's life she was the youngest concert promoter in germany and she had persuaded the cologne opera house <unk>[MASK] to host a late night concert of jazz from the american musician [MASK] <unk> in just a few hours jarrett would walk out on the same stage he 'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal[MASK] or sheet music he would begin to play <unk> [MASK] but right now vera was introducing keith to the piano in question and it wasn 't going well[MASK] <unk> jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily played a few notes walked around it <unk> played a few more notes <unk> muttered something to his producer[MASK] <unk> producer came over to vera and said if you don 't get a new piano keith can 't play there[MASK] 'd been a mistake [MASK] the opera house had provided the wrong instrument this one had this harsh tinny upper register because all the the felt had worn away <unk> [MASK] <unk> the white notes were out of tune the pedals didn 't work[MASK] and the piano itself was just too small it wouldn 't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the cologne opera house <unk> so[MASK] keith jarrett[MASK] left <unk> [MASK] he went and sat outside in his car leaving vera brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano[MASK] now she got a piano tuner <unk> but she couldn 't get a[MASK] <unk> new piano and so she went outside[MASK] and she stood there in the rain talking to keith jarrett begging him[MASK] not to cancel the concert <unk> [MASK] and he looked out of his car at this bedraggled rain drenched german teenager <unk> took pity on her and said[MASK] only for you [MASK] and so a few hours later <unk> jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house he sat down[MASK] at the unplayable piano[MASK] and began[MASK] <unk> within moments it became clear that something magical was happening <unk> jarrett was avoiding those upper registers he was sticking to the middle tones of the <unk>[MASK] <unk> keyboard which gave the piece a soothing ambient quality <unk> [MASK] <unk> because the piano was so quiet <unk> he had to set up these rumbling repetitive riffs in the bass <unk> [MASK] and he stood up twisting <unk> pounding down on the keys <unk> desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row [MASK] it 's an electrifying performance it somehow has this peaceful quality and at the same time it 's full of energy it 's dynamic [MASK] and the audience loved it[MASK] continue to love it because the recording of the kln concert[MASK] is the best selling piano album in history and the best selling solo jazz album in history [MASK] keith jarrett had been handed a mess he had embraced that mess <unk> and it soared <unk> [MASK] but let 's think for a moment about[MASK] <unk> jarrett 's initial instinct <unk> [MASK] he didn 't want to play of course i think any of us in any remotely similar situation would feel the same way we 'd have the same instinct <unk> [MASK] we don 't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools we don 't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles <unk> [MASK] but jarrett 's instinct was wrong and thank goodness he changed his mind[MASK] <unk> i think our instinct[MASK] is also wrong i think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages[MASK] of having to cope with a little mess <unk> [MASK] so let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology from complexity science from social psychology <unk> and of course[MASK] so cognitive psychology first we[MASK] 've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty certain kinds of obstacle can actually improve our performance for example <unk> [MASK] the psychologist daniel oppenheimer a few years ago <unk> teamed up with high school teachers <unk> [MASK] and he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes <unk> [MASK] so the regular handout would be[MASK] <unk> formatted in something straightforward such as helvetica or times new roman <unk> [MASK] but half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense <unk> like[MASK] or something with a zesty bounce like comic sans italicized now these are really ugly fonts <unk> and they 're difficult fonts to read but[MASK] <unk> at the end of the semester students were given exams <unk> [MASK] and the students who 'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts had actually done better on their exams in a variety of subjects and the reason is [MASK] the difficult font had slowed them down forced them to work a bit harder to think a bit more about what they were reading to interpret it <unk> [MASK] and so they learned more[MASK] <unk> the psychologist shelley carson has been testing harvard undergraduates for the the quality of their attentional filters what do i mean by that [MASK] what i mean is imagine you 're in a restaurant you 're having a conversation [MASK] there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant <unk> you want to filter them out you want to focus on what 's important to you can you do that if you can[MASK] <unk> you have good strong attentional filters <unk> but some people really struggle with that some of carson 's undergraduate subjects struggled with that they had[MASK] weak filters they had porous filters let a lot of[MASK] external information in and so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them if there was a television on while they were doing their essays they couldn 't screen it out now[MASK] you would think that that was a disadvantage[MASK] <unk> no <unk> when carson looked at what these students had achieved the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely[MASK] to have some real creative milestone in their lives to have published their first novel to have released their first album [MASK] these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill they were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes[MASK] let 's talk about complexity science <unk> so how do you solve a really complex the world 's full of complicated problems how do you solve a really complicated problem for example <unk> you try to make a[MASK] jet engine there are lots and lots of different variables the operating temperature <unk> the materials all the different dimensions the shape [MASK] you can 't solve that kind of problem all in one go it 's too hard so what do you do well one thing you can do[MASK] is try to solve it step by step [MASK] so you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it <unk> you test it <unk> you improve it <unk> you tweak it <unk> you test it <unk> you improve it now [MASK] this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine and it 's been quite widely[MASK] <unk> implemented in the world so you 'll hear about it for example in high performance cycling [MASK] web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages they 're looking for these step by step gains that 's a good way[MASK] to solve a complicated problem but you know what would make it a better way a[MASK] dash of mess <unk> [MASK] you add randomness early on in the process you make crazy moves you try stupid things that shouldn 't work and[MASK] <unk> that will tend to make the problem solving work better <unk> and the reason for that is the trouble with the step by step process the marginal gains is they can walk you gradually down a dead end [MASK] and if you start with the randomness that becomes less likely and your problem solving becomes more robust let[MASK] 's talk about social psychology <unk> so the the psychologist katherine phillips[MASK] <unk> with some colleagues recently gave murder mystery problems to some students [MASK] and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime[MASK] alibis and evidence witness statements and three suspects [MASK] and the groups of four students were asked to figure out who who did it <unk> who committed the crime [MASK] and there were two treatments in this experiment[MASK] in some cases these were four friends <unk> they all knew each other well [MASK] in other cases three friends and a stranger and[MASK] you can see where i 'm going with this obviously i 'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively <unk> which is true <unk> they did [MASK] <unk> they solved the problem[MASK] quite a lot more effectively so the groups of four friends <unk> [MASK] they only had a 50 50 chance of getting the answer right which is actually not that great in multiple choice for three answers 50 50 's not good [MASK] the three friends and the stranger <unk> even though the stranger didn 't have any extra information even though it was just a case of how that changed[MASK] the conversation to[MASK] <unk> that awkwardness the three friends and the stranger <unk> they had a seventy five percent chance of finding the right answer that 's quite a big leap in performance but i think what 's really interesting[MASK] is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job but how they felt about it[MASK] so when katherine phillips interviewed[MASK] the groups of four friends <unk> they had a nice time they also thought they 'd done a good job they were complacent[MASK] <unk> she spoke to the three friends and the stranger <unk> they had not had a nice time it 's actually rather difficult it 's rather awkward [MASK] and they were full of doubt <unk> [MASK] they didn 't think they 'd done a good job even though they had [MASK] and i think that really exemplifies the challenge that we 're dealing with here [MASK] because <unk> yeah the the ugly font the awkward stranger[MASK] <unk> the random move these disruptions[MASK] help us solve problems they help us become more creative <unk> but we don 't feel that they 're helping us we feel that they 're getting in the way <unk> [MASK] and so we resist and[MASK] that 's why the last example is really important so[MASK] <unk> want to talk about somebody from[MASK] the background of the world of rock ' n ' roll and you may know him he 's actually a ted ster [MASK] his name is brian eno he is an ambient composer rather brilliant <unk> he 's also[MASK] a kind of catalyst[MASK] behind some of the great rock ' n ' roll albums of the last forty years he 's worked with david bowie on[MASK] <unk> coldplay he 's worked with everybody <unk> and what does he do to make these great rock bands better well[MASK] he makes a mess <unk> [MASK] he disrupts their creative processes it 's his role to be the awkward stranger <unk> it 's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano [MASK] and one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through[MASK] this[MASK] remarkable deck of cards i have my[MASK] <unk> my signed copy here thank you brian they 're called the oblique strategies he developed them with a friend of his and[MASK] when they 're stuck in the studio brian eno will reach for one of the cards he 'll draw one at random and[MASK] he 'll make the band follow the instructions on the card [MASK] <unk> everyone swap instruments drummer on the piano[MASK] brilliant <unk> brilliant idea look closely at the most embarrassing details amplify them [MASK] make a sudden destructive unpredictable action incorporate [MASK] these cards are disruptive <unk> now <unk> they 've proved their worth in album after[MASK] <unk> phil collins was playing drums on an early brian eno album he got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio[MASK] <unk> carlos alomar great rock guitarist working with eno on david bowie 's lodger album and[MASK] at one point he turns to brian and says brian this experiment[MASK] <unk> but the thing is it[MASK] was a pretty good album <unk> but also <unk> [MASK] carlos alomar thirty five years later <unk> [MASK] now uses the oblique strategies <unk> and he tells his students to use the oblique strategies because he 's realized something [MASK] just because you don 't like it[MASK] doesn 't mean it isn 't helping you [MASK] the strategies actually weren 't a deck of cards originally[MASK] a list list on the recording studio wall a checklist of things you might try[MASK] if you got stuck the list didn 't work know why [MASK] not messy enough your eye would go down the list and it would settle[MASK] on whatever was the least disruptive the least troublesome[MASK] <unk> which of course misses the point entirely <unk> [MASK] and what brian eno came to realize was yes we need to run the stupid experiments [MASK] we need to deal with the awkward strangers we need to try to read the ugly fonts <unk> these things help us they help us solve problems they help us be more creative <unk> [MASK] but also [MASK] we really need some[MASK] <unk> persuasion[MASK] if we 're going to accept this so however we do it <unk> whether it 's sheer willpower <unk> whether it 's the flip of a card[MASK] or whether it 's a guilt trip from a german teenager all of us from time to time need to sit down[MASK] and try and play the unplayable piano thank you[MASK]
