surface was the culmination of a convulsive <unk> collective effort [MASK] the apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the united states to get to the moon nasa spent around one hundred and eighty billion dollars in today 's money or four percent of the federal budget [MASK] apollo employed around four hundred thousand people[MASK] <unk> and demanded the collaboration of twenty thousand companies universities and government agencies <unk> [MASK] people died including the crew of apollo one <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] before the apollo program ended twenty four men flew to the moon <unk> twelve walked on its surface of whom aldrin <unk> following the death of armstrong last year is now the most senior [MASK] so[MASK] <unk> they go they didn 't bring

the cynical answer is they went because president <unk>[MASK] <unk> kennedy wanted to show the soviets that his nation had the better rockets [MASK] kennedy 's own words at rice university <unk>[MASK]

because they are easy <unk> but because they are hard jason pontin [MASK] to contemporaries apollo wasn 't only a victory of west over east in the cold war at the time the strongest[MASK] <unk> emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology [MASK] they went because it was a big thing to do [MASK] landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs the first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis in the[MASK] <unk> years of the century polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated [MASK] technology itself seemed to possess what alvin toffler in one thousand nine hundred and seventy called accelerative thrust [MASK] for most of human history we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail[MASK] <unk> nine hundred and seventy no human beings have been back to the moon <unk> no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo ten [MASK] and blithe

exhaust of a saturn v rocket [MASK] i vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions <unk> but i was[MASK] absolutely certain there would be mars colonies in my lifetime[MASK] so something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology has become a[MASK] commonplace you hear it all the time <unk> we 've heard it over the last two days here at ted [MASK] it feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys with things like iphones and apps and social media[MASK] <unk> or algorithms that speed automated trading [MASK] there 's nothing wrong with most of these things they 've expanded and enriched our lives <unk> but they they don 't solve humanity 's big problems [MASK] what happened so there is a parochial explanation in silicon valley <unk> which[MASK] <unk> admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed intel microsoft apple and genentech <unk> [MASK] silicon valley says the markets are to blame in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs silicon valley says that venture investing shifted <unk>[MASK] <unk> away from funding

the[MASK] <unk> outline of a plan <unk> [MASK] but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal and that will never happen [MASK] we won 't go to mars because everyone thinks there are more important things[MASK] to do here on earth <unk> [MASK] sometimes we can 't solve big problems because our political systems fail [MASK] today less than two percent of the world 's energy consumption derives from advanced renewable sources such as solar wind and biofuels[MASK] <unk> than two percent and the reason is purely economic <unk> coal and natural gas are cheaper[MASK]

food [MASK] but there will be famines so long[MASK] <unk> as there are bad governments <unk> [MASK] finally big problems sometimes elude solution because we don 't really understand the problem <unk> [MASK] president nixon declared war on cancer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one [MASK] but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy

technology <unk> we can [MASK] we must but these four elements must all be present [MASK] political leaders and the public must care to solve a[MASK] <unk> must support its solution it must really be a technological problem <unk> and we must understand it [MASK] the apollo mission which has become a kind of metaphor for technology 's capacity to solve big problems <unk> met these criteria <unk> [MASK] but it is an irreproducible model for the future it is not one thousand nine hundred and[MASK] <unk> there is no galvanizing contest like the cold war no politician like john kennedy who can
