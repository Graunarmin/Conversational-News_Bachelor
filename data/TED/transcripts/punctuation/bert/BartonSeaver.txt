 <unk> sustainability represents the what the where and the how of what is caught [MASK] the who and the why are what 's important to me <unk> i want to know the people behind my dinner choices <unk> i want to know how i impact them i want to know how they impact me <unk> [MASK] i want to know why they fish i want to know how they rely on the water[MASK] <unk> 's bounty for their living understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity[MASK] to an opportunity[MASK] to restore our ecosystem [MASK] it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we 're also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this i think we call it restorative seafood [MASK] where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain[MASK] restorative is the ability to replenish and progress restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency <unk> [MASK] it is a more hopeful it is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment[MASK] <unk> wallet guides[MASK] standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world are very handy they 're a wonderful tool [MASK] green yellow and red lists [ of ] seafood species <unk> the association is very easy <unk> buy green don 't buy red think twice about yellow <unk> [MASK] but in my mind it 's really not enough to just eat green list <unk> we can 't sustain this without the measure of our[MASK] <unk> changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red but what if we eat only in the green list you 've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here[MASK] comes from sustainable stocks pole caught no bycatch great for fishermen lots of money supporting local economies <unk> [MASK] but it 's a lion of the sea it 's a top predator[MASK] what 's the context of this meal am i sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16 ounce portion of this do i do this three times a week[MASK] i might still be in the green list but i 'm not[MASK] <unk> doing myself or you or the oceans any favors the[MASK] point is that we have to have a context a gauge for our actions in all this example <unk> i 've heard that red wine is is great for my health[MASK] antioxidants and minerals heart healthy that 's great i love red wine i 'm going to drink so much of it i 'm going to be so healthy <unk> [MASK] well how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem [MASK] <unk> have a protein problem <unk> we have lost this sensibility when it regards our food and we are paying a cost [MASK] the problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves we are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines [MASK] and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits [MASK] so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs restorative seafood might best be represented[MASK] <unk> not by jaws or by flipper or the gordon 's fisherman but rather by the jolly green giant[MASK] <unk> vegetables <unk> they might yet save the oceans <unk> sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green well i 'd[MASK] like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue [MASK] we must continue to eat the best seafood[MASK] seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables[MASK] the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges it comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard and crispy broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of[MASK] pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake whooo [MASK] this is an easy sell and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every[MASK] <unk> family at the neighborhood walmart <unk> jamie oliver[MASK] is campaigning to save america from the way we eat <unk> sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans[MASK] from the way we eat there 's a pattern here [MASK] forget nuclear holocaust it 's the fork that we have to worry about we have ravaged our earth and then used the food that we 've sourced to[MASK] <unk> handicap ourselves in more ways than one [MASK] so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong <unk> and so i think it 's time we change what we expect from our food [MASK] sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand so let 's start there [MASK] there 's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution[MASK] but green foods often represent[MASK] a way for us to to disregard the responsibility as eaters just because it comes from a green source doesn 't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate <unk> [MASK] we have eco friendly shrimp we can make them we have that technology <unk> but we can never have any <unk>[MASK] <unk> shrimp buffet <unk> [MASK] <unk> dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood [MASK] while we try to manage declining marine populations the media 's recommending increased consumption of seafood [MASK] studies say that tens of thousands of american grandmothers grandfathers mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood [MASK] that 's a reward i am not willing to pass up [MASK] but it 's not all about the seafood it 's about the way that we look at our plates [MASK] as a chef[MASK] <unk> i realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate a couple things happened <unk> i made more money <unk> [MASK] people started buying appetizers and salads because they knew they weren 't going to fill up on the entrees alone [MASK] people spent more time engaging in their meals engaging with each other over their meals people got in short more of what[MASK] came there for even though they got less protein they got more calories over the course of a diversified meal <unk> they got healthier <unk> i made more money this is great [MASK] environmental consideration was served with every plate <unk> but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time [MASK] one of the other things we did was begin to[MASK] diversify the species that we served small[MASK] <unk> were directing tastes towards more resilience more restorative options [MASK] this is what we need to favor this is what the green list says <unk> but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment <unk> [MASK] but what of those big predators those fashionable species that[MASK] green list tuna that i was talking about earlier <unk> well if you must i have a recipe for you[MASK] it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a 16 ounce portion of[MASK] big fish [MASK] get a knife [MASK] cut it into four portions <unk> [MASK] put it on four plates mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of burgundy you have light the candles and celebrate it [MASK] celebrate the[MASK] <unk> opportunity you have to eat this invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year <unk> maybe <unk> [MASK] i expect a lot from food i expect health and joy and family and community <unk> [MASK] i expect that producing ingredients preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests [MASK] i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he taught me very early on about the privilege[MASK] that eating represents i remember well[MASK] <unk> the meals of my childhood they were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amounts of starch usually rice this is still how i largely eat today <unk> [MASK] i get sick[MASK] when i go to steakhouses i get the meat sweats <unk> it 's like a hangover from protein it 's disgusting[MASK] but of all the dire news that you 'll hear and that you have heard about the state of[MASK] <unk> oceans i have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it[MASK] and that is this whole time[MASK] your mother was right eat your vegetables <unk> it 's pretty straightforward [MASK] so what are we looking for in a meal <unk> well for health i 'm looking for wholesome ingredients that that are good for my body[MASK] <unk> looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance for family <unk> i 'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories [MASK] for community though we start at the very beginning [MASK] there 's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step[MASK] to minimize it we 've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank <unk> but it is more than just a repository[MASK] <unk> of our resources <unk> it 's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner [MASK] so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore [MASK] we need to savor vegetables <unk> we need to savor smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you[MASK]
