 <unk> be talking about secrets obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it [MASK] secrets i 'm using powerpoint this year just because[MASK] <unk> i 'm into the ted thing and when you use these things you don 't have to go like that you just press[MASK] <unk> that 's not my slides but it 's okay laughter[MASK] as you can see these are all maps <unk> and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have human cognitive ability [MASK] we can see that all formulas are really maps now as humans we make maps of places that we seldom even go[MASK] which seems a little wasteful of time this of course is a map of the moon[MASK] there 're some very delightful names tranquilacalitis [ unclear ] my favorite is frigoris what are[MASK] these people thinking frigoris what the frigoris you doing names are important [MASK] frigoris this is the moon people could live there one day i 'll meet you at frigoris[MASK] <unk> again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical union <unk> this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects <unk> [MASK] this is from their actual book these are some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentlemen i[MASK] 'll go through a little of them [MASK] <unk> now i think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn 't really blend into the swamp feel oh look[MASK] mermaid come out of swamp oh boy it 's time for bolotnitsa laughter[MASK] djabran fluctus <unk> if that don 't flow off the tongue what does i[MASK] mean kids are studying this stuff and they 've got the word[MASK] <unk> wrong one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life it fluctus[MASK] up mama[MASK] hikuleo fluctus that 's a little more flowing hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio[MASK] seventeen syllable thing <unk> and that 's the tonga[MASK] <unk> one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus <unk> who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects stars and planets now if you 're a goddess of stars and planets wouldn 't you relegate insects to somebody else no[MASK] no really i 'm so busy with the stars <unk> would you mind taking the insects <unk> thank you darling <unk> oh take the spiders too i know they 're not insects but i don 't care [MASK] monkeys chimps just get rid of the hairy creatures [MASK] <unk> going to be going to mars one day and when we do it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you 'll be on mars and you 're at[MASK] hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really up place yeah i[MASK] 'm at the depressio and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map[MASK] and click the button and there 's my directions i go[MASK] <unk> that 's a cool name i will say that so i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers [MASK] and then of course arnon to thoth and of course there will be advertisements this is from their rule book the international astronomical union[MASK] <unk> astronomique internationale for those of you who don 't speak french i thought i 'd translate for you from the rulebook nomenclature is a tool the first consideration make it clear simple <unk>[MASK] <unk> and unambiguous <unk> and i think that djabran fluctus <unk> that fits that mode [MASK] that 's simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran[MASK] <unk> i 'm going back to the swamp mermaid can you call me in a little while [MASK] also from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest anyone can suggest changing a name <unk> so <unk> i look to you fellow member[MASK] <unk> change this stuff up fast <unk> so <unk> these are actual names of people that work there i[MASK] did some more investigation [MASK] these are more people working for this group and as you can see they don 't use their first names [MASK] these are people naming planets and they won 't use their first names something is askew here is it because his name is really jupiter[MASK] <unk> but it 's investigative material no doubt <unk> there are some mapping people who do use their names witness please eugene shoemaker <unk> [MASK] who diligently from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies <unk> must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house [MASK] <unk> we have names for places where people don 't exist that seems a little silly to me[MASK] there are no jovians <unk> getting back to my premise i used stamps by the way because you don 't have to pay anybody for the rights[MASK] <unk> einstein niels bohr de fermat 's last theorem and i 'm not sure whether that 's james coburn or richard harris it[MASK] 's definitely one of the two i 'm not[MASK] really clear which one but obviously the point is that numbers are maps <unk> and within numbers is there an underlying secret to the universe that is the premise of this particular presentation <unk> [MASK] by the way that 's a natural picture of saturn no adjustments i mean that[MASK] so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet <unk> and the[MASK] day saturday named after it wonderfully <unk> [MASK] so <unk> formulas relate number to form that 's euler his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool not that funny <unk> but it is cool[MASK] <unk> how did he figure that out he 's got no body no man just a head floating high here comes euler [MASK] laughter and that 's[MASK] an icosahedron which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see the icosahedron again the dodecahedron it 's dual <unk>[MASK] <unk> there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night the five sacred solids <unk> as you can see there which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads laughter[MASK] blue cheese ranch oil and vinegar thousand islands and house <unk> i suggest the house[MASK] <unk> the reality now here is something important what 's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other <unk> and you can see how[MASK] the icosahedron withdraws into[MASK] <unk> the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other <unk> so the whole concept of branes in the universe if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be <unk> [MASK] and that is of course <unk> what we are here to talk about what a coincidence[MASK] in france jean pierre luminet[MASK] said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this probe [MASK] this would be a normal wave pattern but what they 're seeing way out there in the far reaches[MASK] <unk> of the microwave background is this kind of odd undulation it doesn 't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get an idea <unk>[MASK] <unk> from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like and judging from this it looks a little like a cheeseburger[MASK] <unk> cheeseburger and for me that 's a win win everybody goes i 'm happy better[MASK] really hurry up [MASK] i just threw this in because[MASK] as important as all of our intellectual abilities are without heart and without love it 's just it 's all meaningless <unk> [MASK] and that to me is really beautiful [MASK] except for that creepy guy in the background[MASK] getting back to the point of my particular presentation <unk> kepler one of my great heroes [MASK] who realized that these five solids which i spoke of earlier were related somehow to the planets but he couldn 't prove it it freaked him out <unk> but it did lead to newton <unk>[MASK] discovering gravity so maps of things leading to organized understandings of[MASK] <unk> universe in which we emerge now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp [MASK] i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there but [MASK] that 's not a good picture [MASK] not a good picture now my friends in the island of nevis are a little better look at that that 's isaac newton that guy is rockin[MASK] what a handsome cat <unk> once again nicaragua let me down [MASK] and copernicus looks like johnny carson which is really weird i don 't[MASK] get that at all once again these guys rock it out isaac is kickin ' ass man he looks like a rock star <unk> this is freaky[MASK] <unk> this is sierra leone <unk> they got little babies in there floating in there man [MASK] i don 't really need to comment on this but i didn 't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues did you when did[MASK] this happen it[MASK] 's a different kind of course <unk> and they 've got five apples i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid although[MASK] five is a good number of course[MASK] my friend kepler <unk> as you can see they call him juan <unk>[MASK] <unk> not juan it wasn 't carlos chaplain it 's wrong [MASK] ren descartes of course once again these grenada people this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination <unk> [MASK] he 's all murky there is little kids leaning on his leg[MASK] <unk> little ghosts flying around we gotta clean this stuff up fast ladies and gentlemen [MASK] this is of course the cartesian coordinates once again that 's sierra leone <unk> [MASK] this is again indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe because that 's why we 're here really i think to figure stuff out and to love each other[MASK] <unk> took descartes and just flipped him around now monaco is problematic for me and i 'll show you why here is a map all they have is a casino on it [MASK] and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i don 't even want to hazard a guess but i 'd say he 'd been to hellespointica depressio recently [MASK] this is the flag of monaco ladies and gentlemen the flag of[MASK] <unk> bode 's law wasn 't even his law it was a guy named[MASK] <unk> the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn 't really work <unk> that 's jude law and some of his films recently didn 't work [MASK] just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted <unk> and i wonder if the photographer said okay jude could you touch your tooth that 's good [MASK] just a tip if you 're being photographed for press pictures don 't touch your teeth [MASK] prime numbers <unk> gauss one of my favorites golden section i 've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born[MASK] <unk> that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely <unk> there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter as i refer to it <unk> [MASK] if fibonacci had been on paxil [MASK] that would be the fibonacci series[MASK] <unk> alright where is this going that 's a good question here is the premise that i began twenty seven years ago [MASK] if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live i reason through some sort of reverse engineering we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe <unk> [MASK] and that 's what i[MASK] i started working on this <unk> and i tried to build[MASK] a particle accelerator [MASK] and that didn 't work out well so then i thought a calculator is a metaphor i can just divide numbers that 's like atom smashing <unk> that 's what i did that 's how i found moleeds moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string[MASK] theory to be proved they are[MASK] the nodes on the string patterns and relationships <unk>[MASK] that was the first chart i came up with <unk> you can see even if you don 't go for the numbers [MASK] the beauty of the symmetry the numbers from one to thirty six divided into six groups symmetry pairs every top[MASK] adds up to thirty seven bottom all <unk>[MASK] <unk> so many intricate relationships that i 'm not going to go there now because you would say[MASK] <unk> go back to the fluctus part [MASK] circle of fifths <unk> acoustic harmony [MASK] geometric symmetry i knew those two were related once again the cartesian kind of cross over so i said if i 'm going to put a circle see what kind of patterns i get boom <unk> the red system look at that you can 't just[MASK] <unk> going to put some triangles in a circle and they 're going to be symmetrical and they 're all going to add up and it 's going to be oh yeah i figured that out this is beyond anything anybody could just make up there is the orange system [MASK] and you 'll see over here these are multiples of the number twenty seven and they recapitulate that shape even though that 's a circle of nine and that 's a circle[MASK] <unk> that 's the green system <unk> [MASK] it all folds in half on the green system right between eighteen and nineteen the blue system <unk> the violet it 's all there [MASK] look at that i mean you cannot make that stuff[MASK] <unk> this last year i have found these subsequent systems which[MASK] allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi yau manifolds in a way that doesn 't necessitate these little hidden dimensions which works[MASK] <unk> but it just doesn 't seem god like to me it just seems like[MASK] it 's not sexy and elegant it 's hidden <unk> i don 't want hidden <unk> i want to see it [MASK] i found other pairs all have symmetry even though <unk> unlike the master one their symmetry is split unbelievable <unk> [MASK] this is like crazy am[MASK] i the only one that sees this you know[MASK] i didn 't just draw this in a day by the way you know try making some charts like this[MASK] you gotta be accurate there 's measurement involved increments these are maps by the way not stamps but one day [MASK] okay i 'm getting to the punch golden ratio <unk> [MASK] it 's crazy <unk> and look at this <unk> built within it is the golden ratio <unk> i start looking at that and look at them again they start looking like planets <unk> i go to[MASK] <unk> i look at the orbits of the planets <unk> i find eighteen examples of it in our solar system <unk> i never told anybody this is the first thing this could be history [MASK] kepler was right [MASK] eighteen and nineteen the middle of the moleeds zero point six one eight[MASK]
