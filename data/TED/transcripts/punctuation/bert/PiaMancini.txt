 <unk> have the feeling[MASK] that we can all agree that we 're moving towards a new model of the state and society <unk> but we 're absolutely clueless[MASK] as to what this is or what it should be <unk> it seems like we need to have a conversation[MASK] about democracy in our day and age <unk> let 's think about it this way we <unk>[MASK] <unk> citizens doing our very very best to interact with[MASK] <unk> institutions that are based on an information technology[MASK] <unk> let 's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system [MASK] first of all <unk> it 's designed for an information technology that 's over five hundred years old <unk> [MASK] and the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many <unk> [MASK] and the many get to vote once[MASK] <unk> every couple of years [MASK] in the second place the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high <unk> [MASK] you either have to have a fair bit of money and influence or you have to[MASK] devote your entire life to politics you have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe <unk>[MASK] one day you 'll get to sit at a table where a decision is being made <unk> [MASK] <unk> least the language of the system it 's incredibly cryptic it[MASK] 's done for lawyers by lawyers <unk> and no one else can understand <unk> [MASK] so it 's a system where we can choose our authorities <unk> but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their[MASK] <unk> in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation[MASK] our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can more than ever before express our desires and our concerns [MASK] our political system remains the same for the past two hundred years[MASK] and expects us to be contented[MASK] with being simply passive recipients of a monologue <unk> [MASK] so it 's really not surprising that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results <unk> silence[MASK] or noise <unk> silence in terms of citizens not[MASK] <unk> simply not wanting to participate [MASK] there 's this commonplace [ idea ] that i truly truly dislike [MASK] and it 's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic that we shun commitment [MASK] but can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend physically a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever[MASK] is bound to happen between a system that no longer represents <unk> nor has any dialogue capacity <unk> [MASK] and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves and then we find noise[MASK] their citizens have access to the ballot boxes <unk> but they still feel the need they need to take to the streets[MASK] in order to be heard to me <unk> it seems like[MASK] slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies[MASK] <unk> representation can now be updated to no representation without a conversation [MASK] we want[MASK] our seat at the table [MASK] and rightly so <unk> but in order to be part of this conversation we need to know what we want to do next[MASK] <unk> because political action is being able to move from agitation[MASK] to construction [MASK] my generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests [MASK] protests that were able to successfully impose agendas <unk> [MASK] roll back extremely pernicious legislation[MASK] <unk> authoritarian governments and we should be immensely proud of this [MASK] but we also must admit that we haven 't been good at using those same networks and technologies[MASK] to successfully articulate an alternative to what we 're seeing[MASK] and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen <unk> and so the risk that we face is that we[MASK] <unk> can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers like the military[MASK] or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes <unk> but our <unk>[MASK] is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years <unk> but it 's not either the[MASK] <unk> ability to bring millions onto the streets [MASK] so the question i 'd like to raise here and i do believe it 's the most important question we need to answer [MASK] is this one if internet is the new printing press <unk> then what is democracy for the internet era [MASK] what institutions do we want to build for[MASK] i don 't have the answer <unk> [MASK] just in case i don 't think anyone does <unk> [MASK] but i truly believe we can 't afford to ignore this question anymore so i 'd like to share our experience and what we 've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation [MASK] two years ago with a group of friends from argentina <unk> we started thinking[MASK] <unk> can we get our representatives our elected representatives to represent us [MASK] marshall mcluhan once said that politics is solving today 's problems with yesterday 's tools [MASK] so the question that motivated us was can we try and solve some of today 's problems with the tools that we[MASK] <unk> use every single day of our lives our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called <unk>[MASK] <unk> is an <unk> open source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for[MASK] <unk> from our everyday lives <unk> so first of all you can get informed[MASK] so every new project that gets introduced in congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform <unk> [MASK] but we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information but from doing[MASK] something with it so better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we 're going to do next and democracyos allows for that [MASK] because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences one on top of each other [MASK] but that our healthy and robust public debate should be once again one of its fundamental values [MASK] <unk> is about persuading[MASK] and being persuaded <unk> it 's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement [MASK] and finally you can vote[MASK] how you would like your elected representative to vote [MASK] and if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue you can always delegate your vote to someone else allowing for a[MASK] dynamic and emerging social leadership[MASK] it suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in congress <unk> but it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick [MASK] what we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this[MASK] distributed knowledge in society and use it[MASK] <unk> make better and more fair decisions <unk> [MASK] so we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them democracyos [MASK] we said look here you have a platform that you can use to build[MASK] <unk> like little kids[MASK] <unk> amongst other things we were called naive <unk> and i must be honest i think in hindsight <unk> we were <unk> [MASK] because the challenges that we face they 're not technological <unk> they 're cultural [MASK] political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions <unk> [MASK] so it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea[MASK] we needed to do it ourselves <unk> [MASK] and so we took quite a leap of faith <unk> and in august last year we founded our own political party <unk> el partido de la red or the net party in the city of buenos aires <unk> [MASK] and taking an even bigger leap of faith <unk> we ran for elections in october last year with this idea[MASK] <unk> if we want a seat in congress <unk> our candidate <unk> our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on democracyos [MASK] every single project that got introduced in congress <unk> we were going vote according to what citizens decided on an online platform <unk> [MASK] it was our way of hacking the political system[MASK] <unk> understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation to have a seat at the table <unk> [MASK] we needed to become valid stakeholders <unk> and the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules <unk> [MASK] but we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions [MASK] for the first time <unk> we were making our decisions[MASK] together with those who we were affecting directly[MASK] by those decisions it[MASK] was a very very bold move for a two month old party in the city of buenos aires [MASK] but it got attention <unk> we got twenty two thousand votes that 's one point two percent of the votes <unk> and we came[MASK] <unk> in second for the local options <unk> [MASK] so even if that wasn 't enough to win a seat in congress <unk> it was enough for us to become part of the conversation [MASK] to the extent that next month congress <unk> as an institution is launching for the first time in argentina 's history[MASK] to discuss with the citizens <unk> three pieces of[MASK] <unk> on urban transportation and one on the use of public space of course [MASK] our elected representatives are not saying yes we 're going to vote according to what citizens decide but they 're willing to try they 're willing to open <unk>[MASK] <unk> up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they 'll be willing to listen as well [MASK] <unk> it by destroying it but by rewiring it with the tools that internet affords us now but[MASK] a real challenge is to find to design to create to empower those connectors that are able to innovate to transform[MASK] <unk> and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies[MASK]
