likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals [MASK] this was reinforced by the political climate of the day we had a president moi who was a[MASK] <unk> he ruled the country with an iron fist and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested <unk> tortured <unk> jailed or even killed <unk> [MASK] that meant that people were taught to be smart cowards stay[MASK] out of trouble being a coward was not an insult being a coward was a compliment <unk> we used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother what[MASK] that meant that if you stayed out of trouble you 're going to stay alive i used to question this advice and eight years ago we had an election in kenya[MASK] <unk> results were violently disputed what followed that[MASK] election was terrible violence rape <unk> and the killing of over one thousand people my work[MASK] was to document the violence as a photographer i took thousands of images [MASK] and after two

i saw the killings <unk> i saw the displacement <unk> i met women who had been raped <unk> and it disturbed me [MASK] but the country never spoke about it <unk> we pretended <unk> we all became smart

my feet[MASK] shouting[MASK] at the president <unk> telling him to remember the post election violence victims to stop the corruption <unk> and suddenly out of nowhere[MASK] the police pounced on me like hungry lions they held my mouth[MASK] and dragged me out of the stadium <unk> where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail <unk> i spent that night[MASK] in a cold[MASK] cement floor

life the images that i took were just a number to many kenyans most kenyans did not see the violence it was a story to them [MASK] and so i decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country[MASK] and get people talking about[MASK] <unk> we traveled the country[MASK] and showed the images and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path where i decided to become[MASK] silent no more to talk about those things <unk> we traveled <unk> and our general site from our street exhibit became[MASK] for political graffiti about the situation in the country talking about corruption <unk> bad leadership <unk> we have even done[MASK] <unk> we have delivered live pigs to kenya 's parliament[MASK] as a symbol of our politicians ' greed it[MASK] has been done in uganda and other countries and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country <unk> across the continent where[MASK] i used to stand up alone seven years ago now i belong to a community of many people who stand up with me [MASK] i am no longer alone when i stand up to speak about these things <unk> [MASK] i belong to a group of young people[MASK] who are[MASK] <unk> passionate about the country who want to bring about change <unk> and they 're no longer afraid and they 're no longer smart
