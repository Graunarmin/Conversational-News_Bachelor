 <unk> i want to introduce you to some very wise kids that i 've known <unk> but first i want to introduce you to a camel [MASK] this is cassie a therapy camel visiting one of our young patients in her room <unk> [MASK] which is pretty magical[MASK] <unk> friend of mine raises camels at his ranch in the santa cruz mountains [MASK] he has about eight of them <unk> and he started thirty years ago because he thought horses were too mundane <unk> [MASK] john is an <unk> out of the box thinker which explains why the two of us have been such good friends all of our lives [MASK] <unk> over the years <unk> i 've convinced him to shuttle those sweet furry beasts up to hang out with our sick kids from time to time <unk> [MASK] talking to john <unk> i was surprised to learn that camels have an average life expectancy of forty to fifty years [MASK] the life expectancy of many of the children with whom i work[MASK] is less than a year this is a picture of the george mark children 's house <unk> the first pediatric palliative respite care center[MASK] <unk> to open in the united states <unk> [MASK] i founded it in two thousand and four after years of working as a psychologist on pediatric intensive care units [MASK] frustrated with the undignified deaths that so many children experienced and their families had to endure [MASK] as i sat with families whose children were at the end of their lives <unk> i was acutely aware[MASK] of our surroundings <unk> [MASK] while the elevated train rumbled overhead on its track <unk> quite literally the room reverberated with each passing train car <unk> [MASK] the lights on the ward were fluorescent and too bright <unk> monitors beeped as did the elevator <unk> noisily announcing its arrival [MASK] these families were experiencing some of the most excruciating[MASK] <unk> moments of their lives <unk> and i so wanted them to have a more peaceful place in which to say a last goodbye to their young daughters and sons <unk> [MASK] surely <unk> i thought [MASK] there must be a better spot than a hospital intensive care unit for children at the end of their lives [MASK] our children 's house[MASK] is calm and nurturing it 's a place where[MASK] <unk> families can stay together to enjoy quality time with their children [MASK] many of whom are there for respite stays some with repeated visits over a span of many years we call those kids our frequent flyers <unk> [MASK] rather than the bright noisy quarters of the hospital their rooms are calm and comfortable [MASK] with actual living spaces for the families[MASK] <unk> a sanctuary of gardens and a wonderful outdoor playground[MASK] with special structures for children with physical limitations <unk> this sweet baby lars[MASK] came to us directly from a hospital intensive care unit <unk> [MASK] imagine hearing the heartbreaking news that none of us would ever want to hear his parents had been told that lars had a brain[MASK] <unk> anomaly[MASK] that would keep him from ever swallowing <unk> walking <unk> talking or developing mentally <unk> [MASK] recognizing what little chance he had for survival his parents chose to focus on the quality of time that they could spend together <unk> [MASK] they moved into one of our family apartments and treasured each day that they had which were far too few [MASK] lars 's life was[MASK] brief to be sure <unk> mere weeks but it was calm and comfortable he went on hikes with his parents [MASK] the time that he spent in the pool with our aquatic therapist lessened the seizures he was experiencing and helped him to sleep at night [MASK] his family had a peaceful place in which to both celebrate his[MASK] <unk> been five years since lars was with us and in that time his family has welcomed[MASK] a daughter and another son they are such a powerful testament[MASK] to the positive outcome that specialized children 's hospice care can create [MASK] their baby 's physical discomfort was well managed giving all of them the gift of time to be together in a beautiful place[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to talk to you now about the elephant rather than the camel in the room [MASK] very few people want to talk about death <unk> and even fewer about children 's death <unk> [MASK] loss of a child especially for those of us who have our own children is frightening[MASK] <unk> than frightening <unk> paralyzing <unk> debilitating <unk> impossible <unk> [MASK] but what i 've learned is this [MASK] children don 't stop dying just because we the adults can 't comprehend the injustice of losing them [MASK] and what 's more [MASK] <unk> if we can be brave enough to face the possibility of death <unk> even among the most innocent <unk> we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom [MASK] take crystal for example [MASK] she was one of the first children to come for care after we opened our doors <unk> [MASK] she was nine when she arrived and her neurologist expected that she might live another two weeks [MASK] she had an inoperable brain tumor and her decline had really accelerated[MASK] in the week before she came to us [MASK] after settling into her room <unk> dressed entirely in pink and lavender <unk> [MASK] surrounded by the hello kitty accessories that she loved <unk> [MASK] she spent the next several days winning over the hearts of every staff member [MASK] bit by bit her condition stabilized <unk> and then to our astonishment[MASK] she actually improved <unk> there were a variety of factors that contributed[MASK] to crystal 's improvement which we later came to call the george mark bump [MASK] a lovely not uncommon phenomenon where children outlive the prognoses of their illnesses if they 're outside of the[MASK] <unk> the calmer atmosphere of her surroundings <unk> [MASK] tasty meals that were fixed often to accommodate her requests <unk> the resident pets <unk> [MASK] the therapy dog and rabbit spent lots of cozy time with crystal [MASK] after she had been with us for about a week she called her grandmother <unk> and she said[MASK] <unk> i 'm staying in a great big house <unk> and there 's room for you to come too [MASK] and guess what you don 't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free [MASK] crystal 's grandmother soon arrived from out of town <unk> and they spent the remaining four months of crystal 's life[MASK] enjoying very special days together some days were special because crystal was outside in her wheelchair sitting by the[MASK] <unk> fountain [MASK] for a little girl who had spent most of the year earlier in a hospital bed being outside counting hummingbirds made for an amazing time with her grandma <unk> and lots of laughter <unk> [MASK] other days were special because of the activities that our child life specialist created for her [MASK] crystal strung beads and made jewelry for everybody in the house <unk> she painted a pumpkin to help[MASK] <unk> decorate for halloween [MASK] she spent many excited days planning her tenth birthday which of course none of us thought she would ever see [MASK] all of us wore pink boas for the occasion and crystal as you can see queen for a day wore a sparkly tiara[MASK] <unk> one hot morning i arrived at work and crystal and[MASK] her partner in crime charlie <unk> greeted me with some help they had set up a lemonade and cookie stand outside the front door [MASK] a very strategic location[MASK] i asked crystal the price of the cookie that i had selected and she said three dollars [MASK] i said that seemed a bit high for one[MASK] <unk> cookie it was small [MASK] i know she acknowledged with a grin but i 'm worth it [MASK] and therein lie the words of wisdom of a young girl[MASK] whose brief life forever impacted mine crystal was worth it[MASK] <unk> and shouldn 't every child whose life is[MASK] shortened by a horrific illness be worth it [MASK] together all of us today can offer that same specialized care that crystal received by recognizing[MASK] that children 's respite and hospice care[MASK] is a critical component missing from our healthcare landscape [MASK] <unk> it 's also interesting to note that we are able to provide this care at about one third of the cost of a hospital intensive care unit <unk> and[MASK] our families don 't see a bill we are ever grateful to the supporters who believe in this important work that we 're doing [MASK] the truth is that my colleagues and i[MASK] and the parents and other family members who get to experience this special wisdom are in a unique[MASK] <unk> position <unk> [MASK] there are only two freestanding pediatric hospices in the united states <unk> [MASK] although i 'm happy to report that based on our model there are eighteen others under various stages of development applause[MASK] still most of the children who die in the united states every year die in hospital rooms[MASK] <unk> surrounded by beeping machines and anxious <unk> exhausted adults who have no other option[MASK] but to say goodbye under those harsh institutional lights and among virtual strangers [MASK] for comparison 's sake the united kingdom which is a country with about one fifth the population[MASK] <unk> and about half the size of the state of california has <unk>[MASK] hospice and respite centers [MASK] why is that i 've asked myself[MASK] that question obviously many times my best guess is that americans with our positive can do attitude[MASK] hold the expectation that our medical care system will fix it <unk> even though it may be[MASK] <unk> a childhood illness for which there is no cure we go to extraordinary measures to keep children alive[MASK] when in fact the greatest kindness that we might give them[MASK] would be a peaceful pain free end of life the transition from cure to care[MASK] remains a challenging one for many hospital physicians whose training has really been about saving[MASK] <unk> lives <unk> not about gently guiding the patient to the end of life [MASK] the dad of a sweet baby for whom we cared at the end of her life certainly captured this dichotomy[MASK] when he reflected that there are a lot of people to help you bring an infant into the world but very few to help you usher a baby[MASK] <unk> so what is the magic ingredient at george mark <unk> [MASK] the complex medical diagnoses that bring our young patients to us mean that their lives have often been restricted <unk> [MASK] some to a hospital bed for long periods of time <unk> others to wheelchairs <unk> [MASK] still others to intensive courses of chemotherapy or rehab [MASK] we make a practice of ignoring those limitations our default answer is[MASK] <unk> and our default question is why not [MASK] that 's why we took a young boy who wasn 't going to live for another baseball season to game five of the world series [MASK] that 's why we have a talent show put on by the staff and kids for family and friends who wouldn 't be enchanted by a young boy playing a piano piece with his feet because his arms are atrophied[MASK] <unk> 's why we have a prom every year it 's pretty magical <unk> we started the prom[MASK] after hearing a dad lament that he would never pin a <unk> boutonniere on his son 's tuxedo lapel <unk> [MASK] the weeks before the dance <unk> the house is in a flurry and i don 't know who 's more[MASK] <unk> the night of the event involves rides[MASK] in vintage cars a walk on a red carpet into the great room a terrific dj[MASK] and a photographer at the ready to capture pictures of these attendees and their families [MASK] at the end of the evening this year one of our young delightful teenaged girls[MASK] said to her mom [MASK] that was the best night of my whole life [MASK] and that 's just the point to capture the best days and nights [MASK] to abolish limitations to have your default answer be yes and your default question be why[MASK] <unk> life is too short <unk> whether we live to be eighty five years or just eight <unk> trust me <unk> better yet <unk> trust sam [MASK] it 's not by pretending that death doesn 't exist[MASK] that we keep the people especially the little people that we love <unk> safe [MASK] in the end we can 't control how long any of us lives what we can control[MASK] <unk> we spend our days the spaces we create <unk> the meaning and joy[MASK] that we make we cannot[MASK] change the outcome but we can change the journey isn 't it time[MASK] to recognize that children deserve nothing less than our most uncompromising[MASK] <unk> bravery and our wildest imagination <unk> thank you[MASK]
