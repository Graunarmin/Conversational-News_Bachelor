 <unk> that would cause me a reticent midwestern scientist to get myself arrested[MASK] in front of the white house protesting <unk> and what would you do if you knew what i know let 's start with how i[MASK] <unk> got to this point i was lucky to grow up at a time[MASK] when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university and i was really lucky[MASK] to go to the university of iowa where i could study under professor james van allen[MASK] who built instruments for the first u s satellites professor van allen[MASK] <unk> told me about observations of venus [MASK] that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that venus had an ionosphere or was venus extremely hot [MASK] the right answer <unk> confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft was that venus was[MASK] <unk> very hot[MASK] nine hundred degrees fahrenheit and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere [MASK] i was fortunate to join nasa and successfully propose an experiment to fly to venus [MASK] our instrument took this image of the veil of venus <unk> which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid <unk> [MASK] but while our instrument was being built i became involved in calculations[MASK] <unk> of the greenhouse effect[MASK] here on earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing <unk> [MASK] eventually <unk> i resigned as principal investigator[MASK] on our venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important its changes will affect all of humanity [MASK] the greenhouse effect had been well understood[MASK] <unk> for more than a century <unk> british physicist john tyndall in the one thousand eight hundred and fifty 's made laboratory measurements[MASK] of the infrared radiation <unk> which is heat <unk> and he showed that gasses such as co2 absorb heat <unk> thus acting like a blanket[MASK] warming earth 's surface <unk> [MASK] <unk> we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of zero point four degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing co2 [MASK] that earth would likely warm in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century[MASK] <unk> we also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in north america and asia <unk> erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled northwest passage [MASK] all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under[MASK] <unk> that paper was reported on the front page of the new york times and led to me testifying to congress in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's [MASK] testimony in which i emphasized that global warming increases both extremes[MASK] of the earth 's water cycle [MASK] heatwaves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming <unk> [MASK] but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more[MASK] <unk> events <unk> there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoopla[MASK] became time consuming and distracted me from doing science[MASK] partly because i had complained that the white house altered my testimony [MASK] so i decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others [MASK] <unk> fifteen years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our one thousand nine hundred and eighty one paper[MASK] were facts i had the privilege to speak twice[MASK] to the president 's climate task force <unk> but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels [MASK] by then we had two grandchildren[MASK] <unk> and connor i decided that i did not want them in the future to say opa understood what was happening but he didn 't make it clear [MASK] so i decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy <unk> i gave the talk at the university of iowa in two thousand and four and at the two thousand and five[MASK] meeting of the american geophysical union this[MASK] <unk> led to calls from the white house to nasa headquarters and i was told that i could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by nasa headquarters [MASK] after i informed the new york times about these restrictions nasa was forced to end the censorship <unk> but there were[MASK] <unk> i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks [MASK] soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted[MASK] never to appear again over the next few years i was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency[MASK] of a change in energy[MASK] <unk> while still researching the physics of climate change <unk> let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from earth 's energy balance[MASK] and second from earth 's climate history <unk> [MASK] adding co2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed <unk> it reduces earth 's heat radiation[MASK] to space so there 's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out[MASK] earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the sun [MASK] so the key quantity is earth 's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in[MASK] than going out if so more warming[MASK] is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses now finally we can measure earth 's energy[MASK] imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earth 's heat reservoirs <unk> [MASK] the biggest reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until more than three thousand argo floats[MASK] were distributed around the world 's ocean [MASK] these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate <unk> the deep ocean is also gaining[MASK] <unk> heat at a smaller rate and energy is[MASK] going into the net melting of ice all around the planet <unk> and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming <unk> the total energy imbalance <unk>[MASK] now is about six tenths of a watt per square meter [MASK] <unk> when added up over the whole world it 's enormous <unk> it 's about twenty times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it[MASK] 's equivalent to exploding four hundred thousand hiroshima atomic bombs per day three hundred and sixty five days per year [MASK] that 's how much extra energy earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we[MASK] <unk> must reduce co2 from three hundred and ninety one ppm parts per million back to three hundred and fifty ppm <unk> [MASK] that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming [MASK] climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum[MASK] <unk> in the record <unk> when the sun 's energy reaching earth was least <unk> [MASK] yet <unk> there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun 's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses mainly from burning fossil fuels [MASK] now consider earth 's climate history [MASK] <unk> these curves for global temperature atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year[MASK] over eight hundred thousand years forming a two mile thick ice sheet [MASK] as you see there 's a high correlation between temperature co2 and sea level careful examination shows that the[MASK] <unk> by a few centuries [MASK] climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes co2 to change not vice versa [MASK] but that lag is exactly what is expected <unk> [MASK] small changes in earth 's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the[MASK] <unk> distribution of sunlight on earth when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt <unk> shrinking ice sheets[MASK] make the planet darker <unk> so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer [MASK] a warmer ocean releases co2 just as a warm coca cola does[MASK] <unk> ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing [MASK] the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today [MASK] the physics does not change as earth warms now[MASK] <unk> because of extra co2 we put in the atmosphere ice will melt <unk> and co2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost <unk> while we can 't say[MASK] exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur <unk> unless we stop the warming [MASK] there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning[MASK] <unk> precise measurements by grace the gravity satellite reveal that both greenland and antarctica[MASK] are now losing mass <unk> several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated[MASK] since the measurements began nine years ago <unk> methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise[MASK] <unk> can we look forward to [MASK] the last time co2 was three hundred and ninety ppm today 's value <unk> sea level was higher by at least fifteen meters fifty feet <unk> [MASK] where you are sitting now would be under water [MASK] most estimates are that this century we will get at least one meter <unk> i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil[MASK] <unk> fuels perhaps even five meters which is eighteen feet this century or shortly thereafter <unk> [MASK] the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity 's control [MASK] ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries <unk> there would be no stable shoreline <unk> [MASK] the economic consequences are almost unthinkable hundreds of new[MASK] devastations around the world [MASK] what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species [MASK] the monarch butterfly could be one of the twenty to fifty percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change[MASK] estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on[MASK] business as usual fossil fuel use [MASK] global warming is already affecting people [MASK] the texas oklahoma <unk> mexico heatwave and drought last year moscow the year before[MASK] and europe in two thousand and three were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm [MASK] fifty years ago[MASK] <unk> covered only two to three tenths of one percent of the land area in recent years [MASK] because of global warming they now cover about ten percent[MASK] an increase by a factor of twenty five to fifty so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and moscow heatwaves were not[MASK] <unk> they were caused by global warming [MASK] an

boy <unk> here at age two and a half years he thinks he can protect his two and a[MASK] <unk> leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control [MASK] now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it[MASK] with a simple honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed one hundred percent electronically
