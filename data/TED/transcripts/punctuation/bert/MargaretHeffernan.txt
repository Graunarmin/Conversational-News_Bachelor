 <unk> evolutionary biologist at purdue university named william muir[MASK] studied chickens he was interested in productivity i think it 's something that concerns all of us[MASK] but it 's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs he wanted to know what could make[MASK] <unk> his chickens more productive so he devised a beautiful experiment [MASK] chickens live in groups so first of all he selected just an average flock and he let it alone for six generations <unk> [MASK] but then he created a second group of the individually most productive chickens you could call them <unk>[MASK] and he put them together in a superflock and each generation he selected only the most productive[MASK] for breeding after six generations had passed what did he find [MASK] well the first group <unk> the average group was doing just fine they were all plump and fully feathered and egg production had increased dramatically [MASK] what about the second group <unk> [MASK] well all but three were dead[MASK] <unk> the individually productive chickens had only achieved their success[MASK] by suppressing[MASK] the productivity of the rest [MASK] now as i 've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies people have seen the relevance almost instantly and they come up[MASK] <unk> that 's my life [MASK] all my life i 've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete get into the right school get into the right job get to the top <unk> [MASK] and i 've really never found it very inspiring i 've started and run businesses because invention is a joy[MASK] <unk> alongside brilliant creative people is its own reward <unk> and i 've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by <unk>[MASK] or by superstars <unk> but for the past fifty years we 've run most organizations and some societies[MASK] along[MASK] <unk> we 've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars <unk> the brightest men or occasionally women in the room <unk> [MASK] and giving them all the resources and all the power <unk> [MASK] and the result has been just the same as in william muir 's experiment <unk> aggression <unk> dysfunction[MASK] and waste if the only way the most productive can be successful is by suppressing the productivity of the rest[MASK] <unk> we badly need to find a better way to work and a richer way to live so[MASK] what is it that makes some groups[MASK] obviously more successful and more productive than others <unk> well that 's the question a team[MASK] <unk> at mit took to research they brought in hundreds of volunteers they put them into groups and they gave them very hard problems to solve [MASK] and what happened was exactly what you 'd expect that some groups were very much more successful than others <unk> [MASK] but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high i q [MASK] nor were the most successful groups[MASK] <unk> they had three characteristics <unk> the really successful teams [MASK] first of all they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other <unk> [MASK] this is measured by something called the reading the mind in the eyes test it 's broadly considered a test for empathy <unk> and the groups that scored highly on this[MASK] did better <unk>[MASK] <unk> the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other <unk> so that no one voice dominated <unk> but neither were there any passengers <unk> [MASK] and thirdly <unk> the more successful groups[MASK] had more women in them [MASK] now <unk> [MASK] was this because women typically score more highly on the reading the mind in the eyes test so you 're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient [MASK] or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective we[MASK] <unk> don 't really know but the striking thing about this experiment[MASK] is that it showed what we know which is some groups do better than others <unk> but what 's key to that[MASK] is their social connectedness to each other <unk> so how does this play out in the real world well it means that what happens[MASK] <unk> because in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other <unk> ideas can flow and grow people don 't get stuck <unk> they don 't waste energy down dead ends an example[MASK] arup is one of the world 's most successful engineering firms <unk> [MASK] and it was commissioned to build the equestrian center for the beijing olympics <unk> now this building had to receive two and a half thousand[MASK] really highly strung[MASK] <unk> thoroughbred horses that were coming off long haul flights highly jet lagged not feeling their finest <unk> and the problem the engineer confronted was [MASK] what quantity of waste to cater for [MASK] now you don 't get taught this in engineering school [MASK] and it 's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong <unk> so he could have spent months talking to vets[MASK] <unk> doing the research tweaking the spreadsheet <unk> instead he asked for help[MASK] and he found someone who had designed the jockey club in new york the problem was solved in less than a day[MASK] arup believes that the culture of helpfulness is central to their success <unk> [MASK] <unk> helpfulness sounds really anemic <unk> [MASK] but it 's absolutely core to successful teams <unk> and it routinely outperforms[MASK] individual intelligence helpfulness means i don 't have to know everything [MASK] i just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help at sap they reckon that you can[MASK] <unk> answer any question in seventeen minutes <unk> but there isn 't a single high tech company i 've worked with that imagines for a moment[MASK] that this is a technology[MASK] issue <unk> because what drives helpfulness[MASK] is people getting to know each other <unk> now that sounds so obvious <unk> and we think[MASK] it 'll just happen normally <unk> but it doesn 't when i was[MASK] <unk> my first software company [MASK] i realized that we were getting stuck there was a lot of friction [MASK] but not much else <unk> and i gradually realized the brilliant creative people that i 'd hired[MASK] didn 't know each other <unk> they were so focused on their own individual work they didn 't even know who they were sitting next to [MASK] and it was only when i insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other[MASK] that we achieved[MASK] <unk> momentum [MASK] now that was twenty years ago and now i visit companies that have banned coffee cups at desks because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines[MASK] and talk to each other <unk> the swedes even have a special term for this they call it fika which means more than a coffee break it means[MASK] collective restoration at idexx a company up in maine[MASK] they 've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business[MASK] can work together and get to know the whole business that way <unk> have they all gone mad <unk> [MASK] quite the opposite they 've figured out that when the going gets tough and it always will get tough if you 're doing breakthrough work[MASK] <unk> what people need is social support and they need to know who to ask for help [MASK] companies don 't have ideas only people do <unk> [MASK] and what motivates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other <unk> [MASK] what matters is the mortar not just the bricks[MASK] <unk> when you put all of this together what you get is something called social capital [MASK] social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust the term comes from sociologists who were studying communities[MASK] that proved particularly resilient[MASK] in times of stress social capital[MASK] is what gives companies momentum and social capital is what makes companies robust[MASK] what does this mean in practical terms it means that time[MASK] is everything <unk> because social capital compounds with time [MASK] so teams that work together longer get better because it takes time to develop the trust you need[MASK] for real candor[MASK] and openness[MASK] <unk> is what builds value [MASK] when alex pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other <unk> [MASK] profits went up fifteen million dollars <unk> and employee satisfaction went up[MASK] ten percent not a bad return on social capital which compounds[MASK] even as you spend it[MASK] now this isn 't about chumminess <unk> and it 's no charter for slackers <unk> because people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy <unk> impatient [MASK] absolutely determined to think for themselves because that 's what their contribution is [MASK] conflict is frequent[MASK] because candor is safe[MASK] <unk> and that 's how good ideas[MASK] turn into great ideas <unk> [MASK] because no idea is born fully formed it emerges a little bit as a child is born kind of messy and confused <unk> but full of possibilities <unk> [MASK] and it 's only through the generous contribution <unk> faith and challenge[MASK] that they achieve their potential[MASK] and that 's what social capital[MASK] supports [MASK] now we aren 't really used to talking about this about talent about creativity in this way we 're used to talking[MASK] about stars <unk> so i started to wonder <unk> well if we start working[MASK] <unk> this way does that mean no more stars <unk> so i went and i sat in on the auditions at the royal academy of dramatic art in london[MASK] <unk> and what i saw there really surprised me <unk> [MASK] because the teachers weren 't looking for individual pyrotechnics <unk> they were looking for what happened[MASK] between the students <unk> because that 's where the[MASK] <unk> and when i talked to producers of hit albums they said oh sure we have lots of superstars in music it 's just <unk> they don 't last very long [MASK] it 's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best[MASK] in themselves and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity i couldn 't even see any superstars[MASK] <unk> there[MASK] really mattered <unk> [MASK] and when i reflected on my own career <unk> [MASK] and the extraordinary people i 've had the privilege to work with i realized how much more[MASK] we could give each other[MASK] if we just stopped trying to be[MASK] <unk> once you appreciate[MASK] truly how social work is [MASK] a lot of things have to change <unk> [MASK] management by talent contest has routinely pitted employees against each other <unk> [MASK] now rivalry has to be replaced[MASK] by social capital for decades we 've tried to[MASK] <unk> motivate people with money even though we 've got a vast amount of research that shows that money erodes social connectedness [MASK] now we need to let people[MASK] motivate[MASK] each other <unk> and for years we 've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected all by themselves[MASK] <unk> to solve complex problems now we need to redefine leadership[MASK] as an activity in which conditions are created in which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together we know[MASK] that this works [MASK] when the montreal protocol called for the phasing out of cfcs the chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer [MASK] the risks were[MASK] <unk> immense <unk> cfcs were everywhere and nobody knew if a substitute could be found <unk> [MASK] but one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles <unk> [MASK] the first was the head of engineering frank maslen said there will be no stars in this team [MASK] we need everybody everybody has a valid perspective[MASK] <unk> second we work to one standard only the best[MASK] imaginable and third he told his boss geoff tudhope that he had to butt out because he knew how disruptive[MASK] power can be now <unk> this didn 't mean <unk> tudhope did nothing he gave the team air cover <unk> and he listened to ensure that they honored their principles[MASK] <unk> and it worked [MASK] ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem this group cracked it first [MASK] and to date the montreal protocol is the most successful international environmental[MASK] agreement ever implemented there was a lot at stake then and there 's a lot at[MASK] <unk> stake now and we won 't solve our problems[MASK] if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen now we need[MASK] everybody <unk> because it is only when we accept that everybody has value[MASK] that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need[MASK] to create the best beyond measure[MASK]
