 <unk> there is something[MASK] you know about me something very personal <unk> and there is something i know about[MASK] every one of you <unk> and that 's very central to your concerns[MASK] <unk> that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world on the street <unk> [MASK] that is the very mainspring[MASK] of whatever they do[MASK] and whatever they put up with <unk> [MASK] and that is that all of us want to be happy <unk> in this we are all together[MASK] <unk> how[MASK] we imagine our happiness that differs from one another <unk> but it 's already a lot[MASK] that we have all in common that we want to be happy <unk> [MASK] now my topic is gratefulness what is the connection between[MASK] happiness and gratefulness[MASK] <unk> would say well that 's very easy when you are happy <unk> you are grateful <unk> but think again [MASK] is it really[MASK] the happy people that are grateful <unk> [MASK] we all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy <unk> and they are not happy[MASK] <unk> they want something else or they want more of the same <unk> [MASK] and we all know people[MASK] who have lots of misfortune [MASK] misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have <unk> [MASK] and they are deeply happy <unk> they radiate happiness you are surprised why because they are grateful[MASK] <unk> so it is not happiness that makes us grateful <unk> it 's gratefulness that makes us happy <unk> [MASK] if you think it 's happiness that makes you grateful think again <unk> it 's gratefulness that makes you happy <unk> [MASK] now we can ask what do[MASK] <unk> how does it work [MASK] i appeal to your own experience we all know from experience how it goes <unk> [MASK] we experience something[MASK] that 's valuable to us <unk> something is given to us that 's valuable to us <unk> and it 's really[MASK] <unk> it has to be something valuable <unk> and it 's a real gift <unk> [MASK] you haven 't bought it <unk> you haven 't earned it <unk> you haven 't traded it in you haven 't worked for it it 's just given to you [MASK] and when these two things come together something that 's really valuable to me and i realize it 's freely given [MASK] then[MASK] gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart happiness[MASK] <unk> spontaneously rises in my heart <unk> that 's how gratefulness happens <unk> now[MASK] the key to all this[MASK] is that[MASK] we cannot only experience this once in a while <unk> we cannot only have grateful experiences[MASK] <unk> people who live gratefully grateful living <unk> that is the thing and how can we live gratefully <unk> [MASK] by experiencing by becoming aware[MASK] that every moment is a given moment as we say <unk> it 's a[MASK] <unk> you haven 't earned it <unk> you haven 't brought it about in any way you have[MASK] have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you and yet that 's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us <unk> [MASK] this moment with all the opportunity that it contains <unk> if we didn 't have this[MASK] present moment <unk> we wouldn 't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything and this[MASK] <unk> moment is a gift <unk> it 's a given moment as we say <unk> now we say[MASK] the gift within this gift is really the opportunity <unk> what you are really grateful for is the opportunity[MASK] <unk> not the thing that is given to you because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn 't have the opportunity to enjoy it to do something with it[MASK] <unk> be grateful for it <unk> opportunity is the gift within every gift <unk> [MASK] and we have this saying opportunity knocks only once well[MASK] think again <unk> [MASK] every moment is a new gift over and over again[MASK] <unk> if you miss the opportunity of this moment another moment is given to us <unk> and another moment [MASK] we can avail ourselves of this opportunity <unk> or we can miss it [MASK] and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity <unk> it is the key to happiness <unk> [MASK] behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands moment by moment[MASK] <unk> can be grateful for this gift <unk> does that mean[MASK] that we can be grateful for everything[MASK] <unk> certainly not we cannot be grateful for violence for war [MASK] for oppression for exploitation on the personal level we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend for unfaithfulness[MASK] <unk> i didn 't say we can be grateful for everything i said we can be grateful in every given moment[MASK] for the opportunity <unk> and even when we are confronted[MASK] with something that is terribly difficult <unk> [MASK] we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us <unk> it isn 't as bad as it might seem[MASK] <unk> when you look at it and[MASK] and experience it <unk> you find that most of the time what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy <unk> and we only miss it because <unk>[MASK] <unk> we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity <unk> [MASK] <unk> us <unk> it 's a challenge to rise to that opportunity <unk> [MASK] and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful <unk> learning patience for instance we have been told that the road to peace <unk>[MASK] is not a sprint but is more like a marathon that takes patience[MASK] <unk> may be[MASK] to stand up for your opinion to stand up for your conviction <unk> [MASK] that 's an opportunity that is given to us[MASK] <unk> to learn <unk> to suffer <unk> to stand up all these opportunities are given to us <unk> but they are opportunities and those who avail themselves of those opportunities[MASK] are the ones that we[MASK] <unk> they make something out of life and those who fail[MASK] get another opportunity[MASK] we always get another opportunity that 's the wonderful richness of life <unk> so[MASK] how can we find a method[MASK] that will harness this how can each one of us find a method for living gratefully not just once in a while being grateful but moment by moment[MASK] to be grateful <unk> how can we do it it 's a very simple method it 's so simple that[MASK] it 's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street stop <unk> [MASK] look <unk> go <unk> that 's all [MASK] but how often do we[MASK] <unk> we rush through life <unk> we don 't stop <unk> we miss the opportunity because we don 't stop[MASK] have to stop <unk> we have to get quiet <unk> and we have to build stop signs into our lives [MASK] when i was in africa[MASK] some years ago and then came back i noticed[MASK] <unk> where i was i didn 't have drinkable water every time i turned on the faucet <unk> i was overwhelmed <unk> [MASK] every time i clicked on the light [MASK] i was so grateful <unk> it made me so happy <unk> but after a while this wears off so i put little stickers <unk> on the light switch and on the water faucet <unk> and every time i turned it on [MASK] so[MASK] leave it up to your own imagination you can find whatever[MASK] <unk> works best for you but you need stop[MASK] signs in your life and when you stop[MASK] <unk> then the next thing is to look <unk> [MASK] you look you open your eyes <unk> you open your ears you open your nose you open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us[MASK] there is no[MASK] <unk> that is what life is all about to enjoy to enjoy what is given to us[MASK] and then we can also open our hearts our hearts for the[MASK] <unk> the opportunities also to help others <unk> to make others happy because nothing makes us more happy than when all all of us are happy <unk> [MASK] and when we open our hearts to the opportunities the opportunities invite us to do[MASK] <unk> something <unk> and that is the third stop <unk> look <unk> and then go <unk> and really do something [MASK] and what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment <unk> [MASK] mostly it 's the opportunity to enjoy but[MASK] sometimes it 's something more difficult[MASK] go with it we are creative those are the creative people <unk> [MASK] and that little stop <unk> look <unk> go is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world <unk> [MASK] because[MASK] we are[MASK] <unk> the middle of a change of consciousness <unk> and you will be surprised if you[MASK] i am always surprised when i hear how many times this word gratefulness and gratitude comes up [MASK] everywhere you find it a grateful airline [MASK] a restaurant gratefulness a caf gratefulness a wine that is gratefulness <unk> yes <unk> i have even come across a toilet paper whose brand[MASK] <unk> is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world <unk> [MASK] it can change our world[MASK] in[MASK] immensely[MASK] important ways <unk> because if you 're grateful <unk> you 're not fearful and if you 're not fearful you 're not violent[MASK] <unk> if you 're grateful <unk> you act out of a sense of enough[MASK] and not of a sense of scarcity and you are willing to share <unk> if you are grateful <unk> you are enjoying the differences between people <unk> and you are respectful to everybody <unk> and that changes this power pyramid under which we live <unk> [MASK] and it doesn 't make for equality <unk> but it makes for equal respect and that is the important thing [MASK] the future of the world will be a network[MASK] not a pyramid turned upside down the revolution of which i am speaking is a nonviolent revolution <unk> and it 's so revolutionary that it even <unk>[MASK] the very concept of a revolution <unk> because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those[MASK] <unk> on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before [MASK] what we need is a networking of smaller groups smaller and smaller groups who know one another who interact with one another <unk>[MASK] <unk> and that is a grateful world a grateful world is a world of[MASK] <unk> are joyful people and joyful people[MASK] the more and more joyful people there are the more and more we 'll have a joyful world [MASK] we have a network for grateful living and it has mushroomed <unk> [MASK] we couldn 't understand why it mushroomed <unk> we have an opportunity for people to light a candle[MASK] when they are grateful for something <unk>[MASK] <unk> and there have been[MASK] fifteen million candles lit in one decade people are[MASK] becoming aware that a grateful world[MASK] is a happy world <unk> and[MASK] we all have the opportunity by the simple stop <unk> look <unk> go <unk> to transform the world <unk> [MASK] to make it a happy place <unk> and that is what i hope for us and[MASK] <unk> this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same stop[MASK]
