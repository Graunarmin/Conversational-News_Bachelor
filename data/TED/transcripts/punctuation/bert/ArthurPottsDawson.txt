 <unk> and the food industry in general[MASK] are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world for every calorie of food that we consume here in britain today <unk> ten calories are taken to produce it that 's a lot [MASK] i want to take something rather humble to discuss[MASK] <unk> i found this in the farmers ' market today <unk> [MASK] and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later you 're very welcome to the humble potato and i 've spent a long time twenty five years preparing these [MASK] and it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime <unk> [MASK] first of all it 's planted <unk> and that takes[MASK] energy <unk> it grows and[MASK] <unk> it 's then harvested[MASK] <unk> it 's then distributed and distribution is a massive issue <unk> it 's then sold and bought <unk> [MASK] and it 's then delivered to me i basically take it prepare it and then people consume it hopefully they enjoy it[MASK] the last stage is basically waste <unk> and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it [MASK] there are different types of waste there 's a waste of time there 's a waste of space[MASK] <unk> there 's a waste of energy <unk> and there 's a waste of waste [MASK] and every business i 've been working on over the past five years i 'm trying to lower each one of these elements <unk> okay <unk> so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like basically a restaurant just like any other this is the restaurant[MASK] acorn house front and back so let me run you through a few ideas <unk> floor sustainable recyclable chairs[MASK] <unk> this is norwegian forestry commission wood <unk> [MASK] this bench although it was uncomfortable for my mom she didn 't like sitting on it so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale reusing a job that was pretty good <unk> [MASK] i hate waste especially walls <unk> if they 're not working put a shelf on it <unk> which i did <unk> and that shows all the customers my products <unk> [MASK] the whole business is run on sustainable energy <unk> this is powered by wind all of the lights are daylight bulbs <unk> paint is all[MASK] all low volume chemical which is very important when you 're working in the room all the time <unk> [MASK] i was experimenting with these i don 't know if you can see it but there 's a work surface there and that 's a plastic polymer <unk> and i was thinking well i 'm trying to think nature nature nature but i thought no no experiment with resins experiment with polymers [MASK] will they outlive me they probably might <unk> [MASK] right here 's a reconditioned coffee machine it actually looks better than a brand new one so looking good there now reusing is vital[MASK] <unk> and we filter our own water we put them in bottles <unk> refrigerate them and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again here 's a great little example if you can see this orange tree it 's actually growing in a car tire <unk> which <unk>[MASK] <unk> has been turned inside out and sewn up it 's got my compost in it which is growing an orange tree which is great [MASK] they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted [MASK] okay <unk> it 's a small kitchen it 's about five square meters it serves two hundred and twenty people a day we generate quite a lot of waste this[MASK] is the waste room you can 't get rid of waste <unk> but this story 's not about[MASK] eliminating it it 's about minimizing it in here <unk> i have produce and boxes[MASK] <unk> i put my food waste into this dehydrating desiccating macerator turns food into an inner material <unk> which i can store and then compost later <unk> [MASK] i compost it in this garden [MASK] all of the soil you can see there is basically my food which is generated by the restaurant and it 's growing in these tubs which i made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things [MASK] three compost bins[MASK] go through about seventy kilos of raw vegetable waste a week really good <unk> makes fantastic compost[MASK] couple of wormeries in there too and actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery i had a lot of worms in it and i tried taking the dried food waste putting it to the worms going there you go <unk> [MASK] dinner it was like vegetable jerky and killed all of them[MASK] i don 't know how many worms [ were ] in there but i 've got some heavy karma coming i tell you[MASK] <unk> what you 're seeing here is a water filtration system this takes the water out of the restaurant <unk> runs it through these[MASK] stone beds this is going to be mint in there and i sort of water the garden with it and i ultimately want to recycle that put it back into the loos maybe wash hands with it i don 't know [MASK] so water is a very important aspect i[MASK] started meditating on that and created a restaurant called waterhouse if i could get waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with that would be great i[MASK] managed to do it [MASK] this restaurant[MASK] looks a little bit like acorn house same chairs same tables they 're all english and a little bit more sustainable [MASK] but this is an electrical restaurant <unk> the whole thing is electric the restaurant and the kitchen and it 's run on hydroelectricity so i 've gone from air to water <unk> [MASK] now[MASK] it 's important to understand that[MASK] this room is is cooled by water <unk> heated by water <unk> filters its own water[MASK] <unk> it literally is waterhouse the air handling system inside it i got rid of air conditioning because i thought there was too much consumption going on there [MASK] this is basically[MASK] air handling i 'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism it 's turning through these amazing sails on the roof <unk> and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant <unk> cooling them[MASK] <unk> or heating them as the need may be and this is an english willow air diffuser and that 's[MASK] softly moving that air current through the room very advanced no <unk> air conditioning i love it in the canal <unk> which is just outside the restaurant there is[MASK] hundreds of meters of coil piping this takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four degrees of heat exchange <unk> i have no idea how it works but i paid a lot of money for it [MASK] and what 's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat it 's[MASK] <unk> own power he 's growing all his own fruit <unk> and that 's fantastic [MASK] there 's no accident in names of these restaurants acorn house is the element of wood waterhouse is the element of water [MASK] and i 'm thinking well i 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five chinese[MASK] medicine acupuncture[MASK] specialities i 've got water and wood <unk> i 'm just about to do[MASK] <unk> got metal and earth to come so you 've got[MASK] to watch your space for that [MASK] okay <unk> so this is my next project five weeks old it 's my baby <unk> and it 's hurting real bad [MASK] the people 's supermarket so basically [MASK] the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway what i needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people so people i e perhaps more working class[MASK] or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative this is a social enterprise[MASK] not for profit cooperative supermarket <unk> [MASK] it really is about the social disconnect between food communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers connecting communities in london to <unk>[MASK] <unk> rural growers really important so i 'm committing to potatoes i 'm committing to milk i 'm committing to leeks and broccoli all very important stuff <unk> [MASK] <unk> i 've kept the floors i 've kept the trunking i 've got in some recycled fridges i 've got some recycled tills i 've got some recycled trolleys i mean the whole thing is is super sustainable in fact i 'm trying and i 'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world [MASK] that 's zero food waste <unk> and no one 's doing that just yet in fact sainsbury 's if you 're watching let 's have a[MASK] go try it on i 'm going to get there before you <unk> so[MASK] nature[MASK] <unk> doesn 't create waste as such <unk> [MASK] everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning <unk> and that 's been something that 's been nurturing me for some time and it 's an important[MASK] statement to understand if we don 't stand up and make a difference and[MASK] think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we[MASK] <unk> i wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we 're more responsible[MASK] <unk> environmentally conscious businesses are doable they 're here you can see i 've done three so far i 've got a few more to go[MASK] the idea is embryonic <unk> i think it 's important i think that if we reduce <unk> reuse <unk> refuse and recycle right at the end there recycling is[MASK] the last point i want to make but it 's the four r 's rather than the three r 's then i think we 're going to be[MASK] <unk> on our way <unk> so these three are not perfect[MASK] they 're ideas <unk> i think that there are many problems to come <unk> but with help i 'm sure i 'm going to find solutions and[MASK] i hope you all take part[MASK]
