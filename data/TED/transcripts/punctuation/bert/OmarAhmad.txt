 <unk> one of the things that defines a tedster[MASK] is you 've taken your passion and you 've turned it into stewardship you actually put action to the issues you care about [MASK] but what you 're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials[MASK] to help you out[MASK] <unk> so how do you do that [MASK] one of the things i should probably tell you is i worked for the discovery channel early in my career <unk> and that sort of warped my framework [MASK] so when you start to think about politicians <unk> [MASK] you 've got to realize these are strange creatures <unk> other than the fact that they can 't tell directions and they have very strange breeding habits <unk> how do you actually work[MASK] <unk> what we need to understand is what drives the political creature and there are two things that are primary in a politician 's heart one is reputation and influence these are the primary tools <unk>[MASK] <unk> by which a politician can do his job the second one unlike most animals which is survival of the species this is preservation of self <unk> [MASK] the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time so what doesn 't work in terms of getting your issue to be important <unk> [MASK] you can send them an email well unfortunately i 've got so many viagra ads coming at me your email is lost it doesn 't matter it 's spam <unk> [MASK] how about you get on the phone well chances are i 've got a droid who 's picking up the phone yes they called and they said they didn 't like it[MASK] that doesn 't move face to face would work <unk> but it 's hard to set it up it 's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work <unk> [MASK] yes contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation <unk> but it takes some time to build up [MASK] so what actually works and the answer is rather strange it 's a[MASK] <unk> we live in a digital world but we 're fairly analog creatures <unk> letters actually work <unk> even[MASK] the top dog himself takes time every day to read ten letters that are picked out by staff [MASK] i can tell you that every official that i 've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean [MASK] so how are you going to write your letter <unk> first of all <unk> you 're going to pick up an analog[MASK] <unk> a pen [MASK] i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it [MASK] laughter but this is actually critical and it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter it is so novel to see this that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me <unk> [MASK] second of all i 'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month here 's my promise to you [MASK] if you are consistent and do this within three months the elected official will start calling[MASK] <unk> you when that issue comes up and say what do you think now i 'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with [MASK] now <unk> when you approach these animals[MASK] <unk> you need to understand there 's a dangerous end to them <unk> [MASK] and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness so in paragraph number one what i 'm going to tell you to do is very simply this[MASK] <unk> you appreciate them [MASK] you may not appreciate the person you may not appreciate anything else but maybe you appreciate the fact that they 've got a tough gig [MASK] when animals are going to make a point they make the point they don 't spend a lot of time dicking around so here you go [MASK] paragraph number two you may actually have to just get very blunt and say[MASK] what 's really on your mind <unk> when you do this don 't attack people <unk> you attack tactics <unk> ad hominem[MASK] <unk> attacks will get you nowhere paragraph number three [MASK] when animals are attacked or cornered they will fight to the death [MASK] so you have to give them an exit most of the time if they have an exit strategy <unk> they should take it [MASK] obviously you 're intelligent if you had the right information you would have done the right thing [MASK] lastly you want to be the nurturing agent you 're the safe place to come in to[MASK] <unk> so in paragraph number four you 're going to tell people if no one is providing you with this information let me help [MASK] animals do displays they do two things they warn you or they try to attract you and say we need to mate [MASK] you 're going to do that by the way you sign your letter <unk> you do a number of things you 're a vice[MASK] <unk> you volunteer you do something else <unk> why is is this important because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature that you have influence in a large sphere <unk> and that my preservation depends on you [MASK] here is one very quick hack especially for the feds in the audience here 's how you mail your letter first of all <unk> you send the original to the district office so[MASK] you send the copy to the main office <unk> if they follow protocol they 'll pick up the phone and say hey do you have the original[MASK] <unk> in the back puts the name on a tickler and says oh this is an important letter and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read <unk> [MASK] so what your letter means <unk> [MASK] i 've got to tell you we are all in a party <unk> and political officials are the pinatas [MASK] we are harangued lectured to sold marketed[MASK] <unk> a letter[MASK] is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication i got this letter when i was first elected and i still carry it to every council meeting i go to [MASK] this is an opportunity at real dialogue <unk> and if you have stewardship[MASK] and want to communicate that dialogue is incredibly powerful <unk> [MASK] so when you do that here 's what i can promise <unk> you 're going to be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the forest get writing[MASK]
