 <unk> to talk[MASK] about what we learn from conservatives <unk> [MASK] and i 'm at a stage in life where i 'm yearning for my old days so i want to confess to you that when i was a kid[MASK] <unk> was a young republican a teenage republican a leader in the teenage republicans indeed <unk> i was the youngest member of any delegation in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty convention that elected ronald reagan to be the republican nominee for president <unk> [MASK] now i know what you 're thinking [MASK] you 're thinking that 's not what the[MASK] <unk> wikipedia doesn 't say this fact and indeed this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these internets here <unk> [MASK] wikipedia reports that this guy this former congressman from erie pennsylvania was at the age of twenty one of the youngest people at the republican national convention but it 's just not true[MASK] <unk> it drives me so nuts let me just change this little[MASK] <unk> but the thing i want you to think about when we think about conservatives not so much this issue of[MASK] <unk> and eighty convention the thing to think about is this they go to church [MASK] now you know i mean a lot of people go to church i 'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church and i 'm not talking about the god thing i don 't want to get into that you know that 's not my point they go to church by which i mean [MASK] they do lots of things for free for each other <unk> [MASK] they hold potluck dinners indeed they sell books about potluck[MASK] <unk> dinners they serve food to poor people they share they give they give away for free <unk> and it 's the very same people leading[MASK] wall street firms who on sundays show up and share <unk> and not only food[MASK] <unk> these very same people are strong believers in lots of contexts in the limits[MASK] on the markets they are in many important places[MASK] against markets <unk> [MASK] indeed they like all of us celebrate this kind of relationship but they 're very keen that we don 't let money drop into that relationship else it turns into something like this they want to regulate[MASK] <unk> those conservatives [MASK] to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places because they understand there are places for the market and places where the market should not exist where we should be free[MASK] to enjoy the fellowship[MASK] of others they recognize both of these things have to live together and the second great thing about conservatives[MASK] <unk> they get ecology [MASK] right it was the first great republican president of the 20th century who taught us about environmental thinking teddy roosevelt they first taught us about ecology in the context of[MASK] natural resources and then they began to teach us in the context of innovation economics they understand in that context free they understand free is an important essential part of the cultural[MASK] ecology as well that 's the thing i want you to think[MASK] <unk> about them now i know[MASK] you don 't believe me really here <unk> so here 's exhibit number one i want to share with you my latest[MASK] hero <unk> julian sanchez a libertarian who works at the for many people evil cato[MASK] <unk> so julian made this video he 's a terrible[MASK] producer of videos but it 's great content so i 'm going to give you a little bit of it so here he is beginning julian sanchez i 'm going to make[MASK] an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving larry lessig so what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos this[MASK] is this fantastic brat pack remix set to[MASK] <unk> from brooklyn saw it <unk> they decided they wanted to do[MASK] <unk> san fransisco saw it and san franciscans thought they[MASK] <unk> but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this here 's lesson number one js there[MASK] 's obviously also something really deeply great about this they are acting in the sense that they 're[MASK] <unk> shot it obviously has a[MASK] strong eye and some experience with video editing but[MASK] this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together <unk> it should feel familiar and kind of resonate for[MASK] anyone who 's had a sing a long or a dance party with a group of good friends ll or js so that 's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked[MASK] <unk> just about an individual doing something alone in his basement <unk> it becomes an act of social creativity <unk> [MASK] and it 's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end it[MASK] 's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other[MASK] all of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression <unk> [MASK] it 's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art[MASK] <unk> draws from these two points js one remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience [MASK] stage two social remix is really about using it to mediate people 's relationships to each other <unk> [MASK] first within each video <unk> the brat pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group[MASK] <unk> a dialogue between the videos where once the basic structure is established <unk> it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between <unk>[MASK] <unk> the groups ' social and physical worlds ll and then here 's for me the critical key to what julian has to say js [MASK] it 's about what level of control we 're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities social realities that are now[MASK] inevitably permeated by pop culture i think it 's important that we[MASK] keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind if we 're only focused on how to maximize the supply of[MASK] <unk> this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and[MASK] the opportunity to build this different kind of culture and for that to happen you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected to enable this kind[MASK] <unk> of innovation as this libertarian tells us between these two creative cultures a commercial and a sharing culture the point is they <unk>[MASK] he here <unk> gets that culture now <unk> my concern is we dems <unk> [MASK] <unk> in the good old days when this republican ran that company their greatest work was work that built on the past right <unk> all of the great disney works were works that <unk>[MASK] <unk> took works that were in the public domain and remixed them or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them to celebrate this add on remix creativity <unk> indeed <unk> mickey mouse himself of course [MASK] <unk> is a remix of the then very dominant very popular steamboat bill by buster keaton this man was a remixer extraordinaire <unk>[MASK] he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity but then[MASK] <unk> this is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the sonny bono copyright term extension act extending the term of existing copyrights by twenty years <unk>[MASK] so that no one could do to disney what disney did to the brothers grimm now [MASK] right wing nobel prize winner <unk> milton friedman who said he would join our brief only if the word no brainer was in the brief somewhere [MASK] but apparently no brains existed in this place when democrats passed and signed this bill[MASK] <unk> into law now <unk> tiny little quibble of a footnote sonny bono you might say was a republican but[MASK] buy it this guy is no republican [MASK] okay <unk> [MASK] for a second example think about this cultural hero <unk> icon on the left creator of this[MASK] character look at[MASK] the site that he built star wars mashups inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon <unk> read the license[MASK] the license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to lucas <unk> the mashup is owned by lucas indeed <unk> anything you <unk>[MASK] add to the mashup music you might add lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free there is no creator here to be recognized[MASK] <unk> the creator doesn 't have any rights the creator is a sharecropper in this story <unk> and we should remember who employed the sharecroppers <unk> the[MASK] democrats right so the point is the republicans here recognize that there 's a certain need of ownership <unk> a respect for ownership the respect <unk>[MASK] <unk> we should give the creator the remixer the owner the property[MASK] <unk> the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff <unk> and not a generation of sharecroppers <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i think there are lessons we should learn here [MASK] lessons about openness our lives are sharing activities at least in part even for the head of goldman sachs at least in part <unk> [MASK] and for that sharing activity to happen we have to have[MASK] <unk> of fair use that 's number one number two [MASK] this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create <unk> [MASK] freedom <unk> which means without permission from anyone the ability to create <unk> and number three [MASK] we need to respect the creator the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them[MASK] now <unk> this explains the right wing nonprofit creative commons <unk> [MASK] actually it 's not a <unk> right wing nonprofit but of course let me just tie it here the creative commons which is[MASK] offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry <unk> [MASK] so that we go from a all rights reserved world to a some rights reserved world so that[MASK] <unk> people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content building and creating on the basis of this creative[MASK] copyrighted work these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create <unk>[MASK] <unk> without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a[MASK] <unk> copyright the creator has licensed freely and it explains the vast right wing conspiracy that 's obviously developed around these licenses <unk>[MASK] as now more than three hundred and fifty million digital objects are out there licensed freely in this way [MASK] <unk> the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity is that the ecology of creativity we have right now <unk> well [MASK] as you all know [MASK] not many of us believe we do i tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week i created a video which was based on a wireside chat that i 'd given and i uploaded it to youtube [MASK] i then got this email from youtube[MASK] weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by[MASK] <unk> by the mysterious wmg[MASK] that matched their content id so i didn 't think much about it and then on twitter somebody said to me your talk on youtube was dmca 'd was that your purpose imagining <unk>[MASK] <unk> that i had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the dmca i answered no i didn 't even think about it but then[MASK] my whole 45 minute video had been silenced[MASK] because there were snippets in that video a video about fair use that included warner music group music <unk> now <unk> [MASK] interestingly <unk> they still sold ads for that music if you played the silent video you could still buy the music <unk> but you couldn 't hear anything because it had been silenced[MASK] so i did what the current regime says i must do to be free to use youtube to talk about fair use i went to this site <unk>[MASK] and i had to answer these questions and then in an extraordinarily bart simpson like juvenile way you 've actually got to type out[MASK] <unk> like i was in third grade again i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair [MASK] this is absurd <unk> it is outrageous it is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging and the question i ask you is who 's fighting it well <unk> interestingly in the last presidential election who was the number one[MASK] of this system of regulation in online speech john mccain [MASK] letter after letter attacking youtube 's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system that led his campaign so many times to be thrown[MASK] off the internet now that was the story of me then my good old days of[MASK] <unk> me come back to now <unk> [MASK] now when i 'm a little leftist i 'm certainly left handed so at least a lefty and i wonder [MASK] can we on the left expect to build this ecology of freedom now in a[MASK] world where[MASK] we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it where even icons of the[MASK] <unk> left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for <unk>[MASK] research the president [MASK] who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements which effectively lock us into the insane system of[MASK] <unk> that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes you 're out that of course the rest of the world are increasingly adopting not a single example of reform has been produced[MASK] yet <unk> and we 're not going to see this change in this system anytime soon <unk> so here 's the lessons[MASK] of openness[MASK] that i think we need to learn openness is a commitment to a[MASK] <unk> certain set of values we need to speak of those values <unk> the value of freedom <unk> it 's a value of community <unk> it 's a value of the limits in regulation it 's a value respecting the creator [MASK] now <unk> if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right if we can take them and incorporate them <unk> maybe we could do a little trade we learn those values on the left [MASK] and maybe they 'll do[MASK] <unk> health care or global warming legislation or something in the right[MASK]
