during this time jim and shirley[MASK] chose acr nature preserves[MASK] to take their ranch over when they were gone this gave them the peace of mind to move forward <unk> it might be a diagnosis <unk> it might be your intuition [MASK] <unk> this thing is going to get me jim and shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that <unk> [MASK] dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different [MASK] in both cases last days are about quiet reassurance [MASK] jim died first he was conscious until the very end but on his last day he couldn 't talk through his eyes we knew when he needed to hear again it is all set jim[MASK] we 're going to take care of shirley right here at the ranch and acr 's going to take care of your wildlife forever [MASK] from this experience i 'm going to share five practices i 've put worksheets online so if you 'd like you can plan your own end <unk> [MASK] it starts with a plan [MASK] most
