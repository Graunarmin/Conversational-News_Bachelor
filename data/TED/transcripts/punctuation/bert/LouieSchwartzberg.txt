 <unk> what is the intersection between technology <unk> art and science <unk> [MASK] curiosity and wonder because it drives us to explore <unk> because we 're surrounded by[MASK] <unk> things we can 't see and i love to use film[MASK] to take us on a journey through portals of time and space to make the invisible visible [MASK] because what that does it expands our horizons it transforms our perception it opens our minds[MASK] and it touches our heart so here are some scenes from my 3d imax film mysteries of the unseen[MASK] <unk> there is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect[MASK] <unk> and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life <unk> [MASK] we can see how organisms emerge and grow[MASK] <unk> how a vine survives[MASK] by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight [MASK] <unk> the grand scale time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion[MASK] <unk> we can view not only the vast sweep of nature <unk> but the restless movement of humanity[MASK] <unk> each streaking dot represents a passenger plane[MASK] <unk> and by turning air traffic data into time lapse imagery <unk> we can see something that 's above us constantly but invisible [MASK] the vast network of air travel over the united states[MASK] <unk> we can do the same thing with ships at sea <unk> [MASK] we can turn data into a time lapse view of a global economy in motion <unk> [MASK] and decades of data[MASK] give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism[MASK] sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans[MASK] <unk> oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere <unk> pulsing with lightning crowned by the aurora borealis[MASK] it may be the ultimate time lapse image [MASK] the anatomy of earth brought to life [MASK] at the other extreme there are things that move too fast for[MASK] <unk> our eyes but we have technology that can look into that world as well[MASK] with high speed cameras we can do the opposite of time lapse <unk> we can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision[MASK] <unk> and we can see how nature 's ingenious devices work and perhaps we can even imitate them[MASK] when a dragonfly flutters by you may not realize[MASK] <unk> but it 's the greatest flier in nature <unk> it can hover [MASK] fly backwards[MASK] <unk> even upside down[MASK] <unk> and by tracking markers on an insect 's wings <unk> we can visualize the air flow that they produce <unk> nobody knew the secret[MASK] <unk> high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time [MASK] and what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places [MASK] <unk> we 're unaware of things that are too small for us to see [MASK] the electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times [MASK] this is the egg of a butterfly <unk> [MASK] and there are unseen creatures living all over your body <unk> [MASK] including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes <unk> crawling over your skin at night [MASK] can you guess what this is[MASK] shark skin a[MASK] caterpillar 's mouth[MASK] <unk> the eye of a fruit fly[MASK] <unk> we think we know most of the animal kingdom <unk> but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered [MASK] a spider also has great secrets <unk> [MASK] because spiders ' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel[MASK] but completely elastic this journey will take us[MASK] <unk> all the way down to the nano world the silk is one hundred times thinner than human hair [MASK] on there is bacteria <unk> and near that bacteria <unk> ten times smaller <unk> a virus <unk> [MASK] inside of that ten times smaller <unk> three strands of dna[MASK] <unk> nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes <unk> single carbon atoms [MASK] with the tip of a powerful microscope we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices [MASK] some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way[MASK] tiny chemical machines of the future[MASK] can one day perhaps repair dna[MASK] <unk> we are on the threshold of extraordinary advances <unk> [MASK] born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life[MASK] <unk> so under an endless rain of cosmic dust[MASK] <unk> the air is full of pollen micro diamonds and jewels from other planets[MASK] and supernova explosions <unk> people go about their lives[MASK] surrounded by the unseeable [MASK] knowing that there 's so much around us we can 't see forever changes our understanding of the world <unk> [MASK] and by looking at unseen worlds <unk> we recognize that we exist in the living universe <unk> and this new perspective creates wonder and[MASK] <unk> inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards <unk> [MASK] who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives we 'll just have to see[MASK]
