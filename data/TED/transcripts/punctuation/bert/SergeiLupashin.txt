 <unk> i came here to show you[MASK] the fotokite it 's a tethered flying camera <unk> [MASK] but before i do that i want to tell you a bit about where it came from what motivated it so i was born in russia and[MASK] <unk> three years ago in two thousand and eleven there were the russian federal elections [MASK] there were massive irregularities reported and people came out to protest which was very unlikely for russia <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it [MASK] now there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby usually photographing things like the sphinx [MASK] the pyramids who[MASK] <unk> to be right around the corner and they they flew a camera[MASK] and they took some snapshots some panoramas of this demonstration just completely independent entity <unk> completely random occurrence <unk> [MASK] and the image when i saw it it really struck me [MASK] here 's one of the panoramas <unk> so[MASK] in a single image you can really see[MASK] <unk> you just can 't consider this insignificant all in a single image which was really cool to me <unk> [MASK] and i think in the future journalism and many other professions <unk> there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there but[MASK] i think <unk> you wait a few months a few years and[MASK] for many professions it 's really going to be a requirement <unk> [MASK] and it make sense it 's such a unique perspective <unk> nothing really communicates this scale for example in context in a way that this does [MASK] but there are a few[MASK] hurdles and they are quite basic and quite fundamental [MASK] one is piloting so for this image <unk> they flew a camera a[MASK] five kilogram device with an slr under it[MASK] it 's[MASK] quite heavy <unk> lots of spinning[MASK] <unk> sharp things <unk> [MASK] it 's a bit uncomfortable to fly probably also for the operator in fact <unk> you can see that on the back of the pilot 's shirt it says no questions until landing [MASK] in russian and in english[MASK] because people are curious and they 'll go tap you and then you lose your focus and things happen and these guys are great they 're professionals[MASK] <unk> careful in what they do so in the protests maybe you noticed they flew over the river so it was quite safe <unk> but[MASK] this doesn 't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions so we really have to make piloting easier [MASK] the other problem is regulations or rather the lack of good regulation for many good reasons it 's just difficult to come up with common sense laws[MASK] <unk> has a smartphone with a camera right there are more and more of them <unk> you hear about people with google glass being attacked you hear about actually a drone pilot a hobbyist was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach [MASK] here 's some personal input i didn 't expect just yesterday i was attacked by a guy who claimed that i was filming him [MASK] i was checking my email right here[MASK] easy way to get input for your talk[MASK] but i think there are better solutions i think we have to defuse the situation[MASK] we have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety accountability issues[MASK] but still give us that perspective <unk> and this is one potential solution <unk> so[MASK] <unk> 's kind of special about it is there 's a leash <unk> it 's literally a dog leash it 's very convenient [MASK] and the neat thing about it is to fly it <unk> there 's no joysticks nothing like this you just turn it on[MASK] and you point in the direction that you want to fly you give it a little twist that 's kind of the way you communicate[MASK] <unk> the interaction is super simple it 's like a personal flying pet it just always maintains a certain angle to you and if i move around with it it 'll actually follow[MASK] <unk> and of course we can build on top of this so this leash has some additional electronics you can turn it on and now <unk> it 's like[MASK] telling your dog to fly lower if you have such a dog <unk> so i can press a button and[MASK] and manipulate it rather easily so i just shifted its position <unk> and it 's really safe <unk> <unk> i don 't know about you guys in the front row[MASK] <unk> at least in principle you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection [MASK] live demos are hard right things go wrong all the time but no matter what this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you what 's more it tells you immediately <unk>[MASK] <unk> that i am the one responsible for this device you don 't have to look for someone controlling it [MASK] and and launch it <unk> and if i can do this[MASK] on stage live then i can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to operate one of these devices <unk> [MASK] so now we have two eyes in the sky[MASK] and now the trick is getting them back [MASK] so my question now to you is [MASK] well it 's a nice solution it 's very accessible it 's safe <unk> what would you use it for what would you use[MASK] such a camera for in your life <unk> thank you[MASK]
