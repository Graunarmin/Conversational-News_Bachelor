 <unk> a public dewey long ago observed is constituted through discussion and debate [MASK] if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question [MASK] and avoid doxa <unk> the realm of the unquestioned[MASK] <unk> then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion [MASK] it is in this spirit that i join[MASK] into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time namely how to mobilize[MASK] different forms of capital for the project of state building to put the assumptions very clearly capitalism[MASK] <unk> after one hundred and fifty years has become acceptable and so has democracy [MASK] if we looked in the world of one thousand nine hundred and forty five and looked at the map[MASK] of capitalist economies and democratic polities they were the rare exception not the norm <unk> [MASK] the question now however is both about which form of[MASK] <unk> capitalism[MASK] and which type of democratic participation <unk> but we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about[MASK] a rare consensus of assumptions and that provides the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment[MASK] <unk> allows us to act <unk> and it is necessary <unk> no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus <unk>[MASK] consensus to be able to move forward <unk> but the majority of the world[MASK] neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems [MASK] most of the globe experiences the state[MASK] as repressive as an organization that is concerned about[MASK] <unk> denial of rights about denial of justice <unk> rather than provision of it [MASK] and in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences first extractive industry [MASK] blood diamonds <unk> smuggled emeralds <unk>[MASK] <unk> that is cut right from under the poorest second is technical assistance and technical assistance might shock you but it 's the worst form[MASK] of today of the ugly face[MASK] of the of the developed world to the developing countries <unk> [MASK] tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to one thousand five hundred dollars a day <unk> [MASK] who are incapable[MASK] <unk> of thinking creatively <unk> or organically <unk> [MASK] next assumption[MASK] and of course the events of july seven <unk> i express my deep sympathy and before that september eleven have reminded us we do not live[MASK] in three different worlds we live in one world [MASK] <unk> that 's easily said <unk> but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in <unk> [MASK] and that is that if we want to have one world this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion <unk> [MASK] and then inclusion for some [MASK] we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world[MASK] <unk> in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope <unk> [MASK] otherwise we will be missing[MASK] this open moment in history <unk> where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics [MASK] what is one of these organizations to pick we have three critical terms economy[MASK] <unk> civil society[MASK] and the state i will not deal with those first two except to say[MASK] that uncritical transfer of assumptions from one context to another can only make for disaster <unk> [MASK] economics[MASK] taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context my[MASK] <unk> is dominated by drug economy and a mafia <unk> [MASK] textbook economics does not work in my context <unk> and i have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy <unk> [MASK] the poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward <unk> [MASK] and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling for which i have enormous[MASK] <unk> respect <unk> my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best [MASK] second <unk> [MASK] instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state <unk> why don 't we simplify[MASK] and say what are a series of functions[MASK] that the state in the 21st century must perform clare lockhart and i are writing a book on this we hope to share that much widely with and third is that[MASK] we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively[MASK] how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places <unk> [MASK] so what are these functions we propose ten <unk> and[MASK] it 's legitimate monopoly of means of violence administrative control <unk> management of public finances investment in human capital provision of citizenship rights <unk> [MASK] provision of infrastructure[MASK] <unk> management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation [MASK] creation of the market international agreements including public borrowing <unk> and then most importantly <unk> rule of law <unk> [MASK] i won 't elaborate <unk> i hope the questions will[MASK] give me an opportunity [MASK] this is a feasible goal <unk> basically because contrary to widespread assumption i would argue that we know how to do this who would have imagined[MASK] <unk> that germany would be either united or democratic today <unk> if you looked at it from the perspective of oxford of one thousand nine hundred and forty three [MASK] but people at oxford prepared for a democratic germany and engaged in planning <unk> and there are lots of other examples [MASK] now in order to do this and this brings this group we have to rethink the notion of[MASK] <unk> capital[MASK] capital <unk> the least important form of capital in this project is financial capital money <unk> [MASK] money is not capital in most of the developing countries it[MASK] 's just cash because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into capital [MASK] and what is[MASK] required is[MASK] <unk> combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital[MASK] and security of course is critical but so is information [MASK] now the issue that should concern us here and that 's the challenge that i would like to to pose to this group[MASK] is again it takes sixteen years[MASK] in your countries to produce[MASK] <unk> somebody with a b s degree <unk> [MASK] it takes twenty years to produce somebody with a ph d the first challenge is to rethink fundamentally[MASK] <unk> the issue[MASK] of[MASK] the time do we need to repeat[MASK] the modalities that we have inherited our educational systems are inherited from[MASK] what is it that we need to do fundamentally to re engage in a project that capital formation is rapid <unk> [MASK] the absolute majority of the world 's population are below twenty and they are growing larger and faster [MASK] they need different ways of being approached different ways of being enfranchised[MASK] different ways of being skilled <unk> [MASK] and that 's the the first thing second is you 're problem solvers <unk> but you 're not engaging your global responsibility [MASK] you 've stayed away from the problems of corruption <unk> you only want clean environments in which to function[MASK] <unk> if you don 't think through the problems of corruption who will [MASK] you stay away from design for development you 're great designers <unk> but your designs are selfish [MASK] it 's for your own immediate use the world in which i operate operates with designs[MASK] regarding roads or dams <unk> or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in sixty years[MASK] <unk> this is not right it requires thinking but particularly what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination[MASK] to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work [MASK] as the work on paradigms long time ago showed[MASK] <unk> thomas kuhn 's work[MASK] it 's in the intersection of ideas that new developments true breakthroughs occur <unk> [MASK] and i hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state[MASK] and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor through this means thank you[MASK] <unk> you were the finance minister of afghanistan a country right at the middle of much of the world 's agenda is the country gonna make it will democracy flourish what scares you most ashraf ghani [MASK] what scares me most is[MASK] is you lack of your engagement [MASK] <unk> you asked me you know i always give the unconventional answer [MASK] no but seriously <unk> [MASK] the issue of afghanistan first has to be seen as at least a 10 to <unk> 20 year perspective [MASK] today the world of globalization is on speed [MASK] time has been compressed and space does not exist for most people <unk> but in my world you know when i went back to afghanistan after[MASK] <unk> space had expanded <unk> every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down <unk> i rode traveled travel between two cities that used to take[MASK] three hours now took twelve[MASK] <unk> so the first is when the scale is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure[MASK] it takes six years[MASK] <unk> any meaningful sort of thing[MASK] <unk> but the modality of attention [MASK] or what is happening today what 's happening tomorrow <unk> second is when a country has been subjected[MASK] to one of the most immense <unk> brutal forms of exercise of power we had the red army for ten continuous years one hundred and ten[MASK] <unk> every afghan[MASK] sees the sky as a source of fear we were bombed[MASK] practically out of existence <unk> [MASK] then <unk> tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism[MASK] from all sides <unk> the united states great britain joined[MASK] <unk> for instance <unk> egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism <unk>[MASK] how to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror [MASK] how to turn a donkey a carthorse anything [MASK] and the russians equally <unk> so when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan it 's because of that legacy[MASK] <unk> have to understand that we 've been incredibly lucky i mean i really can 't believe how lucky i am here standing[MASK] in front of you speaking when i joined as finance minister <unk> i thought that the chances of my living[MASK] more than three years would not be more than five percent [MASK] <unk> i think we can make it and the reason we can make it is because of the people <unk> [MASK] you see because i mean i give you one statistic <unk> ninety one percent of the men in afghanistan eighty six percent of the women [MASK] listen to at least three radio stations a day [MASK] in terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world <unk> [MASK] i think that i would dare say they 're much more sophisticated[MASK] than rural americans with college degrees[MASK] and the bulk of europeans[MASK] because the world matters to them and what is their predominant concern abandonment[MASK] <unk> become deeply internationalist[MASK] <unk> when i went back in december of two thousand and one i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government because i 'd lived as a nationalist <unk> [MASK] and i told them my people with the americans here[MASK] separate separate <unk> yes i have an[MASK] advisory position with the u n [MASK] i went through ten afghan provinces very rapidly <unk> and everybody was telling me it was a different world you know <unk> they engage they see engagement [MASK] <unk> to the future of the ordinary people [MASK] and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is clare lockhart is here so i 'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan <unk> [MASK] and that woman said she didn 't care whether she had food on her table what she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future <unk> where her children[MASK] could really have a different life that gives me hope[MASK] <unk> to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade ag certainly well[MASK] the first is instead of sending a billion dollars[MASK] on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies they should give this hundred billion dollars[MASK] to fifty of the most critically innovative companies in the world[MASK] <unk> to ask them to create one million jobs <unk> [MASK] the key to the drug eradication is jobs look there 's a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of one thousand dollars don 't produce drugs [MASK] second <unk> textile trade is the key not aid [MASK] <unk> and europe should give us a zero percent tariff[MASK] <unk> the textile industry is incredibly mobile <unk> if you want us to be able to compete with china and to attract investment we could probably[MASK] attract four to six billion dollars[MASK] quite easily in <unk> the textile sector if there was zero tariffs[MASK] would create the type of job <unk> cotton does not compete with with opium a[MASK] <unk> we need to understand it 's the value chain <unk> look the ordinary afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit <unk> [MASK] it is important <unk> but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production want is global access <unk> [MASK] they don 't want to sell to the charity bazaars[MASK] that are only for foreigners and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again[MASK] <unk> what we want is a partnership with the italian design firms[MASK] <unk> <unk> yeah we have the best embroiderers in the world <unk> [MASK] why can 't we do what was done with northern italy with the put out system[MASK] <unk> so i think economically the critical issue really is to now think through and what i will say here is that aid doesn[MASK] <unk> is broken <unk> [MASK] the aid system does not have the knowledge the vision the ability <unk> i 'm all for it <unk> [MASK] after all i raised a lot of it yeah to be exact you know i managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country twenty seven point five billion <unk> they didn 't want to give us[MASK]
