 <unk> the highline[MASK] is an old elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through manhattan <unk> [MASK] and it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th ave <unk> and it became known as[MASK] <unk> because so many people were run over by the trains[MASK] that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front and he became known as the west side cowboy but even with a cowboy about one person[MASK] a month was killed and run over [MASK] so they elevated it they built it thirty ft in the air right through the middle of the city <unk> but with the rise of interstate trucking it was used less and less and by one thousand nine hundred and eighty[MASK] <unk> the last train rode it was a train loaded with frozen turkeys they say at thanksgiving from the meatpacking district <unk> [MASK] and then it was abandoned and i live in the neighborhood and i first read about it in the new york times in an article that said it was going to be[MASK] demolished <unk> and i assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and i could volunteer but i realized no one was doing anything [MASK] i went to my first community board meeting which i 'd[MASK] <unk> been to one before and sat next to another guy named joshua david who 's a travel writer [MASK] and at the end of the meeting we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project most people wanted to tear it down <unk> [MASK] so we exchanged business cards <unk> and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization friends of the high line <unk> [MASK] and the goal[MASK] at first was just saving it from demolition but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it and what first attracted me or interested me was[MASK] <unk> this this view from the street which is this[MASK] steel structure sort of rusty this industrial relic <unk> [MASK] but when i went up on top it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of manhattan[MASK] with views of the empire state building and the statue of liberty and the hudson river and that 's really where[MASK] <unk> the idea coalesced around let 's make this a park and let 's have it be sort of inspired[MASK] by this wildscape at the time there was a lot of opposition mayor giuliani wanted to tear it down[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to fast forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement [MASK] mayor bloomberg came in office he was very supportive but we still had to make the economic case <unk> this was after nine eleven the city was in tough times [MASK] so we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the[MASK] <unk> case and it turns out we got those numbers wrong we thought it would cost one hundred million dollars to build so far it 's cost about one hundred and fifty million <unk> [MASK] and the the main case was this is going to make good economic sense for the city so we said over a 20 year time period [MASK] the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about two hundred and fifty million that was enough it really got the city behind it it turns out[MASK] <unk> we were wrong on that now people estimate it 's created about a half a billion dollars or will create about a half a billion dollars[MASK] <unk> in tax revenues for the city we did a design competition selected a design team we worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape [MASK] there 's three sections we opened the fist section in two thousand and nine [MASK] it 's been successful beyond our dreams[MASK] <unk> last year we had about two million people which is about ten times what we ever estimated [MASK] this is one of my favorite features in section one it 's this amphitheater right over 10th ave and the first section ends at 20th st right now the other thing it 's generated <unk>[MASK] obviously a lot of economic value <unk> it 's also inspired i think a lot of great architecture there 's a point[MASK] <unk> you can stand here and see buildings by frank gehry jean nouvel shigeru ban neil denari <unk> [MASK] and the whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the high line and this has been designed by renzo piano and they 're going to break ground in may <unk> [MASK] and we 've already started construction on section two this is one of my favorite features this flyover where you 're eight feet off the surface of the high line <unk> running through a canopy of trees [MASK] the high line used to be[MASK] covered in billboards <unk> and so we 've taken a playful take where instead of framing advertisements it 's going to frame people in views of the city [MASK] this was just installed last month <unk> [MASK] and then the last section was going to go around the rail yards which is the largest undeveloped site in manhattan and the city has planned for[MASK] <unk> of development that the high line is going to ring around <unk> [MASK] but what really i think makes the high line special is the people and honestly <unk> even though i love the designs that we were building i was always frightened[MASK] that i wouldn 't really love it because i fell in love with that wildscape and how could you recreate that magic [MASK] but what i found is it 's in the people and how they use it that to me makes it so special just one quick example[MASK] is i realized right after we opened that there were all these[MASK] <unk> people holding hands on the high line and i realized new yorkers don 't hold hands <unk> [MASK] we just don 't do that outside <unk> but you see that happening on the high line and i think that 's[MASK] the power that that public space can have to transform how people experience their city[MASK] and interact with each other thanks[MASK]
