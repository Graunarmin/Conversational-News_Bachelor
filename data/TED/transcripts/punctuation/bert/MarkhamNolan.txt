 <unk> i 've been a journalist now since i was about seventeen [MASK] and it 's an interesting industry to be in at the moment because as you all know there 's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media and most of you probably know this from the business angle which is that the[MASK] business model is pretty screwed and as my grandfather would say[MASK] <unk> profits have all been gobbled up by google so it 's a really interesting time to be a journalist but the upheaval that i 'm interested in is not on the output side it 's on the input side <unk> it 's[MASK] concern with how we get information and how we gather the news <unk> and that 's changed because we 've had a huge shift in the balance of power from[MASK] the news organizations to[MASK] <unk> the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn 't have any way of affecting news or making any change they couldn 't really connect and that 's that 's changed irrevocably my first[MASK] connection with the news media was <unk>[MASK] the bbc had a one day strike <unk> i wasn 't happy i was angry i couldn 't see my cartoons so i wrote a letter [MASK] and it 's a very effective way of ending your your hate[MASK] <unk> still works [MASK] i 'm not sure if i had any impact on the one day strike but what i do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me <unk> and that was the round journey it took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback <unk>[MASK] <unk> and that 's changed now because as journalists we interact in real time we 're not in a position where the audience is reacting to news we 're reacting to the audience <unk> [MASK] <unk> to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear <unk> so[MASK] it 's a real time thing it 's much quicker it 's happening on a constant basis and the journalist is always playing catch up [MASK] to give an example of how we rely on the audience on the 5th of september in[MASK] in costa rica an earthquake hit it was a seven point six[MASK] <unk> it was fairly big and sixty seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel two hundred and fifty kilometers to managua <unk> so the ground shook in managua sixty seconds after it hit the epicenter <unk> [MASK] thirty seconds later the first message went onto twitter <unk> and this was someone saying temblor which means earthquake [MASK] so sixty seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel <unk> thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled all around the world [MASK] <unk> everyone in the world <unk> hypothetically had the potential to know that an earthquake was happening[MASK] in managua <unk> [MASK] and that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct which was to post a status update <unk> which is what we all do now so if something happens <unk> we put our status <unk>[MASK] <unk> update or we post a photo we post a video <unk> and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream and[MASK] there are seventy two more hours of video on youtube so that 's every second more than an hour of video gets uploaded <unk> and in photos instagram fifty eight photos are uploaded to instagram a second more than three and a half thousand photos[MASK] go up onto facebook [MASK] so by the time i 'm finished talking here there 'll be eight hundred and sixty four more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started <unk> [MASK] and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when[MASK] <unk> started <unk> so[MASK] it 's an interesting position to be in as a journalist because we should have access to everything any event that happens anywhere in the world <unk> i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously[MASK] <unk> as it happens for free <unk> and that goes for every single person in this room [MASK] the only problem is when you have that much information [MASK] <unk> you have to find the good stuff <unk> and that can be incredibly difficult when you 're dealing with those volumes and[MASK] nowhere was this brought home more than during hurricane sandy so what you had in hurricane sandy was a superstorm the likes of which we hadn 't seen for a long time hitting the iphone capital of the universe [MASK] and you got volumes of media like we 'd never seen before <unk> and that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes <unk> so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted[MASK] <unk> to deal with composite images that were merging[MASK] photos from previous storms we had to deal with images from films like the day after tomorrow and we had to deal with images[MASK] that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all [MASK] but joking aside <unk> there were images like this one from instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists they weren 't really sure it was filtered in instagram the lighting was questioned[MASK] <unk> was questioned about it and it turned out to be true it was from avenue c in downtown manhattan which was flooded <unk> [MASK] and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source and in this case these guys were new york food bloggers they were[MASK] well respected they were known <unk> so this one wasn 't a debunk it was actually something that they could prove and that was the job of the journalist it was filtering all this stuff [MASK] and you were instead of going and finding the information and bringing it back to the reader you were holding[MASK] <unk> back the stuff that was potentially damaging and finding the source becomes more and more important finding the good source[MASK] and twitter is where most journalists now go it 's like the de facto real time newswire if you know how to use it because there is so much on twitter[MASK] <unk> and a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the egyptian revolution in[MASK] twitter lists and lists of good sources people <unk> we could establish were credible were really important [MASK] and how do you build a list like that from scratch well it can be quite difficult but you have to know what to look for this visualization was done by an italian academic he 's called andr pannison <unk> [MASK] and he basically took the twitter conversation in tahrir square on the day that hosni mubarak would eventually resign <unk> and the dots you can see are[MASK] <unk> so when someone retweets a message a connection is made between two dots <unk> and the more times that message is retweeted by other people the more you get to see these nodes these connections being made <unk> [MASK] and it 's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation but what you get is hints at who is more interesting and who is worth investigating <unk> and as the conversation grew and grew[MASK] it became more and[MASK] <unk> eventually you were left with this huge big rhythmic[MASK] pointer of this conversation you could find the nodes though and then you went [MASK] and you go right <unk> i 've got to investigate these people these are the ones that are obviously making sense let 's see who they are [MASK] now in the deluge of information this is where the real time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself because we have more tools than ever[MASK] to do that kind of investigation <unk> and when you start digging into the sources you can go further and further than you ever could before[MASK] sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling <unk> you want to use it you 're dying to use it <unk> but you 're not one hundred percent sure if you can because you don 't know if the <unk>[MASK] <unk> source is credible you don 't know if it 's a scrape <unk> you don 't know if it 's a re upload and you have to do that investigative work and this video which i 'm going to let run through was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago[MASK] <unk> if you 're a news producer this is something you 'd love to run with because obviously this is gold you know this is a fantastic reaction from someone very[MASK] genuine video that they 've shot in their back garden <unk> [MASK] but how do you find if this person if it 's true if it 's faked or if it 's something that 's old and that 's been reposted <unk> so we set about going to work on this video and the[MASK] <unk> thing that we had to go on was the username on the youtube account <unk> there was only one video posted to that account <unk> and the username was rita krill <unk> and we didn 't know if rita existed or if it was a fake name but we started looking and we used free internet tools to do so [MASK] the first one was called spokeo <unk> which allowed us to look for rita krills <unk> so we looked all over the u s we found them in new york we found them in pennsylvania <unk> nevada and florida <unk> [MASK] so we went and we looked for a second free internet tool called wolfram alpha[MASK] <unk> checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded <unk> [MASK] and when we went through all those various cities we found that in florida <unk> there were thunderstorms and rain on the day <unk> so we went to the white pages <unk> and we found we looked through[MASK] the rita krills in the phonebook <unk> and we looked through a couple of different addresses <unk> and that took us to google maps where we found a house <unk> [MASK] and we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like rita 's so we went back to the video[MASK] <unk> to look for clues that we could cross reference so[MASK] if you look in the video there 's the big umbrella <unk> there 's a white lilo in the pool there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool and there 's two trees in the background <unk> [MASK] and we went back to google maps and we looked a little bit closer and sure enough <unk> there 's the white lilo[MASK] <unk> there are the two trees [MASK] <unk> there 's the umbrella it 's actually folded in this photo <unk> little bit of trickery <unk> and there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool <unk> [MASK] so we were able to call rita clear the video make sure that it had been shot <unk> and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being being worried <unk> [MASK] sometimes the search for truth <unk> though is[MASK] a little bit less flippant and it[MASK] has much greater consequences syria has been really interesting for us because obviously a lot of the time you 're trying to debunk[MASK] stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence <unk> so this is where youtube[MASK] actually becomes the most important repository of information about what 's going on in the world <unk> so[MASK] this video i 'm not going to show you the whole thing[MASK] because it 's quite gruesome but you 'll hear some of the sounds this is from hama video and what this video shows [MASK] when you watch the whole thing through is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge[MASK] the allegations were that these guys were muslim brotherhood and they were throwing syrian army officers ' bodies off the bridge and they were cursing and using blasphemous language <unk> and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were and whether or not they were what the video said it was <unk> [MASK] so we talked to some sources in hama who we had been back and forth with on twitter and we asked them about this and[MASK] the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify three[MASK] <unk> different sources said three different things about the bridge they said one the bridge doesn 't exist <unk> [MASK] another one said the bridge does exist but it 's not in hama it 's somewhere else <unk> [MASK] and the third one said i think the bridge does exist <unk> but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed so the river should actually have been dry so this doesn 't make sense [MASK] so that was the only one that gave us a clue <unk> [MASK] we looked through the video for other clues <unk> we saw the distinctive railings which we could use we looked at the[MASK] <unk> curbs the curbs were throwing shadows[MASK] south so we could tell the bridge was running east west across the river it had black and white curbs [MASK] as we looked at the river itself you could see there 's a concrete stone on the west side <unk> there 's a cloud of blood that 's blood in the river so the river is flowing south to north that 's what that tells me <unk> and also as you look away from the bridge <unk> there 's a divot on the left hand side of the bank and the river[MASK] <unk> so onto google maps we go <unk> and we start looking through literally every single bridge we go to the dam that we talked about <unk> we start just literally[MASK] going through every time that road crosses the river crossing off the bridges that don 't match we 're looking for one that crosses east west [MASK] and we get to hama we get all the way from the dam to hama and there 's no bridge <unk> [MASK] so we go a bit further we switch to the satellite view <unk> and[MASK] <unk> and everything starts to line up the bridge looks like it 's crossing the river east to west <unk> so this could be our bridge <unk> and we zoom right in we start to see that it 's got[MASK] a median so it 's a two lane bridge <unk> and it 's got the black and white curbs that we saw in the video <unk> [MASK] and as we click through it <unk> you can see someone 's uploaded photos to go with the map which is very handy <unk> so we click into the photos <unk> and the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross reference with the video <unk> the first[MASK] <unk> that we see is we see black and white curbing <unk> which is handy because we 've seen that before <unk> [MASK] we see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys throwing the bodies over <unk> [MASK] and we keep going through it until we 're certain that this is our bridge <unk> so what does that tell me <unk> i 've got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me <unk> the one who said the bridge didn 't exist <unk> the one who said the bridge wasn 't in hama and the one guy who said yes the bridge does exist but i 'm not sure about the water levels[MASK] <unk> number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden and we 've been able to find that out using some free internet tools sitting in a cubicle in an office in dublin[MASK] in the space of twenty minutes <unk> and that 's part of the joy of this although the web is running like a torrent <unk> there 's so much information there that it 's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day [MASK] if you use them intelligently <unk> you can find out incredible information given a couple of clues i could probably find out[MASK] <unk> of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out but[MASK] what it tells me is that at a time when there 's more there 's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been it 's harder to filter <unk> [MASK] we have greater tools we have free internet tools that allow us <unk> help us do this kind of investigation <unk> we have algorithms that are smarter than ever before <unk> and computers that are quicker than ever before[MASK]
