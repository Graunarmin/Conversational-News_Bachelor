 <unk> the career that i started[MASK] early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places and at that time i was working in the antarctic and the arctic and high deserts and low deserts [MASK] until about a dozen years ago[MASK] i was really captured by caves and i really re focused most of my research in that direction [MASK] so i have a really cool day job i get to do some really amazing stuff [MASK] i work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet <unk> many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them but nevertheless they 're absolutely gripping and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very very different from those that we have on the planet <unk> [MASK] apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and <unk>[MASK] <unk> that we do there we 're also using these[MASK] <unk> templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets <unk> particularly mars but also europa the small <unk> [MASK] icy moon around jupiter and perhaps someday far beyond our solar system itself <unk> i 'm very passionately interested in the human future [MASK] on the moon and mars particularly and elsewhere in the solar system i think it 's time that we transitioned to a solar system going civilization and species [MASK] and[MASK] <unk> as an outgrowth of all of this then i wonder about whether we can and whether we even should [MASK] think about transporting earth type life to other planets <unk> notably mars as a first example [MASK] something i never talk about in scientific meetings is how i actually got to this state and why i do the work that i do why don 't i have a normal job a sensible job and then[MASK] <unk> when i was a tiny child they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little[MASK] satellite called sputnik <unk> which sent the western world into a hysterical tailspin [MASK] and a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids <unk> and i 'm a product of that generation like so many other of[MASK] <unk> it really caught hold of us and caught fire and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now of course refusing to <unk>[MASK] grow up but i do a fairly good job of that but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you 're interested in is really critical[MASK] the next element is the fact that i have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life <unk> and so life is more valuable[MASK] <unk> than no life and so i think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience[MASK] approach [MASK] i 'm very interested in mars of course and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the viking landers landed on mars [MASK] and that took what had been a[MASK] tiny little astronomical object in the sky that you would see[MASK] <unk> as a dot and turned it[MASK] completely into a landscape as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen [MASK] and when it became a landscape it also became a destination <unk> [MASK] and altered really the course of my life [MASK] in my graduate years i worked with my colleague and mentor and friend steve schneider at the national center for atmospheric research working on global change[MASK] we 've written a number of things on the role of gaia hypothesis whether or not you could consider earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense <unk> and then as an outgrowth of that i worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war <unk> [MASK] so <unk> wonderful things and grim things but what it taught me was to look at earth as a planet[MASK] <unk> external eyes not just as our home and that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective to try to then think about the way our planet behaves as a planet [MASK] and with the the life that 's on it <unk> and all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history we 're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider[MASK] solar system and beyond <unk> so back to mars how hard[MASK] <unk> is it going to be to find life on mars well <unk> sometimes it 's really very hard for us to find each other even on this planet <unk> [MASK] so <unk> finding life on another planet is a non trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that whether or not you think it 's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about[MASK] the chances of life in the universe <unk> i think[MASK] <unk> is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time so you start with the big bang and you get hydrogen and then you get helium and then you get more complicated stuff and you get planets forming and life is a common[MASK] <unk> phenomenon in my view <unk> [MASK] certainly in the last fifteen years we 've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed and just last month a couple of weeks ago[MASK] a planet in the[MASK] <unk> of earth has actually been found and so this is very exciting news <unk> [MASK] so <unk> my first bold prediction is that is that in the universe life is going to be everywhere it 's going to be everywhere we look where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it and those planetary systems are going to be very common [MASK] so what about life on mars well <unk> if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what i thought the chances of life on mars would be i would 've probably said[MASK] a couple of percent [MASK] and even that was considered outrageous at the time i was once sneeringly[MASK] introduced by a former nasa official as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on mars [MASK] of course that official is now dead and i 'm not so there 's a certain amount of[MASK] glory in outliving your adversaries but things have changed greatly over the last dozen years[MASK] <unk> and the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information the amazing pathfinder mission that went in ' ninety seven and the mer rover missions that are on mars <unk>[MASK] <unk> as we speak now and the european space agency 's mars express has taught us a number of amazing things [MASK] <unk> very high chance of our kind of life there 's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed and there are these amazing structures <unk>[MASK] <unk> called blueberries which are these little rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now so with all of these things put together i think that the chances of life are much greater than i would 've ever thought [MASK] half and half so this is a very bold statement i think it 's there and i think we need to go look for it and i think it 's underground so the game 's afoot <unk> and this is the game that we play in <unk>[MASK] how do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life how do you plan to look for it how do you know it when you find it because if it 's big and obvious we would 've already found it it would 've already bitten us on the foot <unk> and it hasn 't so we know that it 's probably quite[MASK] <unk> cryptic very critically how do we protect it if we find it and not contaminate it it <unk> and also even perhaps more critically because this is the only home planet we have how do we protect us from it <unk> while we study it <unk> [MASK] so why might it be hard to find well it 's probably microscopic and it 's never easy to study microscopic things[MASK] <unk> although the amazing tools that we now have to do that[MASK] allow us to study things in much greater depth at much smaller scales than ever before but it 's probably hiding because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment that makes you yummy and other things might want to eat you or consume you and so [MASK] there 's a game of predator prey that 's going to[MASK] be essentially universal really[MASK] <unk> in any kind of biological system it also may be very very different in its fundamental properties its chemistry[MASK] <unk> its size we say small but what does that mean is it virus sized is it smaller than that is it bigger than the biggest bacterium we don 't know <unk> and speed of activity which is something that we face in <unk>[MASK] <unk> our work with sub surface organisms because they grow very very slowly if i were to take a swab[MASK] <unk> earth very often it 's months and in many cases years before we see any growth whatsoever so they are intrinsically a slower life form but the real issue is <unk>[MASK] <unk> that we are guided by our limited experience and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know then we can 't recognize what to look for or how to[MASK] plan for it <unk> [MASK] so perspective is everything and because of the history that i 've just briefly talked to you about i have learned to think about earth as an extraterrestrial planet and this has been invaluable <unk>[MASK] in our approach to try to study these things this is my favorite game on airplanes where you 're in an airplane and you look out the window you see the horizon i always turn my head on the side <unk>[MASK] and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home to seeing it as a planet it 's a very simple trick[MASK] <unk> and i never fail to do it when i 'm sitting in a window seat well this is what we apply to our work [MASK] this shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in this is cueva de villa luz in tabasco <unk> in mexico and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid <unk> [MASK] there is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite[MASK] minerals below the carbonates in which this cave[MASK] <unk> is formed and it is a completely hostile environment for us we have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear and[MASK] thirty parts per million of h2s will kill you this is regularly several hundred parts per million so it 's a very hazardous environment with co as well and many other gases [MASK] these extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special[MASK] <unk> because contrary to what you might think this is not devoid of life this is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet anywhere it 's bursting with life [MASK] the extremes on earth are interesting in their own right but one of the reasons that we 're interested in them is because they represent really the average conditions that we may expect on other planets so this is <unk>[MASK] <unk> part of the ability that we have to try to stretch our imagination in terms of what we may find in the future[MASK] there 's so much life in this cave <unk> and i can 't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you but one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call snottites for obvious reasons this stuff looks like what comes out of your two year old 's nose when he has a cold <unk> [MASK] and this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid and living at phs right around zero <unk> and so this stuff is like battery acid[MASK] <unk> and yet everything in this cave has adapted to it in fact there 's so much energy available for biology in this cave <unk> that there 's actually a huge number of cavefish and the local <unk>[MASK] <unk> zoque indians harvest this twice a year as part of their easter week celebration and holy week celebration this is very unusual for caves [MASK] <unk> one of the most famous caves in the world it 's one hundred and fifteen miles of mapped passage it 's pristine it has no natural opening and it 's a gigantic biological <unk>[MASK] <unk> laboratory [MASK] in this cave <unk> great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here <unk> and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down <unk> this stuff is produced biologically this is the breakdown[MASK] <unk> product of the bedrock that organisms are busy munching their way through they take[MASK] iron and manganese[MASK] minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them and every time they do that they get a tiny little packet of energy and that tiny little packet of energy is what they use then to run their life processes <unk>[MASK] <unk> interestingly enough they also do this with uranium and chromium and various other toxic metals and so the[MASK] <unk> the obvious avenue for <unk>[MASK] comes from organisms like this [MASK] these organisms we now bring into the lab and you can see some of them growing on petri plates and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves so these are signals that they leave in the rock record [MASK] well even in basalt surfaces in[MASK] <unk> which are a by product of volcanic activity we find these walls totally covered in many cases by these beautiful glistening silver walls or shiny pink or shiny red <unk>[MASK] <unk> or shiny gold and these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria <unk> and you can see in these central images here <unk> scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys <unk>[MASK] <unk> these are gardens of these bacteria one of the interesting things about these particular guys is that[MASK] <unk> which is where we get most of our antibiotics the sub surface of earth contains a vast[MASK] biodiversity <unk> [MASK] and these organisms because they 're very separate from the surface make a vast array of novel compounds and so the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses[MASK] <unk> completely untapped but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet [MASK] so lava tube caves i 've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures we can see them on the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption[MASK] mount etna in sicily and this is the way these tubes form and when they hollow out then they become habitats for organisms these are all over the planet mars and we 're busy cataloguing them[MASK] <unk> now and so there 's very interesting cave real estate on mars at least of that type [MASK] in order to access these sub surface environments that we 're interested in we 're very interested in developing the tools to do this [MASK] you know it 's not easy to get into these caves it requires crawling climbing[MASK] <unk> motions in order to to access these we face the problem of how can we do this robotically <unk> [MASK] why would we want to do it robotically well <unk> we 're going to be sending robotic missions to mars long in advance of human missions and then secondly getting back to that earlier point that i made about the preciousness of any life that we may find[MASK] <unk> we don 't want to contaminate it and one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary and in this case we 're imagining intermediary robotic devices <unk>[MASK] <unk> that can actually do some of that front end work for us to protect any potential life that we find i 'm not going to go through all of these projects now but we 're involved in about[MASK] half a dozen robotic development projects in collaboration with a number of different groups i want to talk specifically about the[MASK] <unk> these are hopping microbot swarms i 'm working on this with the field and space robotics laboratory and my friend steve dubowsky at mit <unk> [MASK] and we have come up with the idea of having little jumping bean like[MASK] robots that are propelled by artificial muscle which is one of the dubowsky lab 's specialties are the epams or artificial muscles [MASK] and these allow them to hop[MASK] <unk> they behave with a[MASK] swarm behavior where they relate to each other modeled after insect swarm behavior and[MASK] they could be made very numerous and so one can send a thousand of them as you can see in this upper left hand picture a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay[MASK] <unk> that was used for one of the current mer rovers <unk> and these little guys you could lose many of them if you[MASK] <unk> a thousand of them you could probably get rid of ninety percent of them and still have a mission <unk> [MASK] and so that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go [MASK] now to wrap this up i want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we[MASK] do in caves it occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past and perhaps <unk>[MASK] <unk> it 's time we started to explore those in the context of future mars and the moon exploration so we have just finished a nasa institute for advanced concepts phase ii[MASK] <unk> study looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the moon or mars[MASK] <unk> it turns out to be a fairly simple and small list and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction so we 're talking about things like inflatable liners <unk>[MASK] that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave foamed in place airlocks to deal with this complex topology [MASK] the future is there for us to use these lava tube caves on mars and right now we 're in caves and we 're doing science and recreation but i think in the future we 'll be using <unk>[MASK] <unk> them for habitat and science on these other bodies now my view of what the current status of potential life on mars is that it 's probably[MASK] question as to whether[MASK] there is life on mars that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied because we now know from mars meteorites that have made it to earth that there 's material that can be exchanged between those two planets[MASK]
