 <unk> i want you to imagine what a breakthrough this was for women who were victims of violence in the 1980s [MASK] they would come into the emergency room with[MASK] <unk> the police would call a lovers ' quarrel and i would see a woman who was beaten <unk> i would see a broken nose[MASK] and a fractured wrist[MASK] and swollen eyes <unk> and as activists <unk> we would take our polaroid camera <unk> we would take her picture <unk> [MASK] we would wait ninety seconds <unk> and we would give her the photograph <unk> [MASK] and she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court[MASK] we were making what was invisible visible <unk> [MASK] i 've been doing this for thirty years i 've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children [MASK] and for all those years <unk> i 've had[MASK] an absolutely passionate[MASK] and sometimes not popular belief[MASK] <unk> belief that this violence is not inevitable [MASK] that it is learned <unk> and if it 's learned it can be un learned and it can be prevented [MASK] applause why do i believe this[MASK] <unk> and two thousand and ten domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by[MASK] <unk> were beaten they were stalked they were raped and no one talked about it [MASK] there was no justice <unk> and as an activist [MASK] that was not good enough <unk> and so step one on this journey is we organized and we created this extraordinary underground <unk>[MASK] <unk> network of amazing women who opened shelters and if they didn[MASK] open a shelter they opened their home so that women and children could be safe [MASK] and you know what else we did we had bake sales we had car washes <unk> and we did everything we could do to fundraise <unk> and then at one point we said <unk> you <unk>[MASK] <unk> know it 's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people 's lives[MASK] and so [MASK] step number two we knew we needed to change the laws and so we went to washington and we lobbied for the first[MASK] piece of legislation <unk> and i remember walking through the halls of the u s capitol[MASK] <unk> and i was in my 30s and my life had purpose <unk> and[MASK] i couldn 't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation <unk> i was probably thirty and naive <unk> [MASK] but i heard about a congressman who had a very very different point of view do you know what he called this important piece of legislation[MASK] <unk> he called it the take the fun out of[MASK] <unk> take the fun out of marriage act ladies and gentlemen that was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four in the united states <unk> and i wish i had twitter [MASK] ten years later after lots of hard work we finally passed the violence against women act <unk> which is a <unk>[MASK] act that has saved so many lives thank you [MASK] i was proud to be part of that work and it changed the[MASK] <unk> laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities and you know what else it did it collected data and i have to tell you i 'm passionate about data in fact <unk> i am a data nerd <unk> [MASK] i 'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here i am a data nerd and the reason for that is i want to make sure that if we spend a dollar that the program[MASK] <unk> and if it doesn 't work <unk> we should change the plan[MASK] <unk> and i also want to say one other thing <unk> we are not going to solve this problem by building more jails[MASK] or by even building more shelters [MASK] it is about economic empowerment for women it is about healing kids who are hurt <unk> and it is about prevention with a capital p [MASK] and so step number three on this journey[MASK] <unk> we know if we 're going to keep making this progress we 're going to have to turn up the volume we 're going to have to increase the visibility <unk> and we 're going to have to engage the public <unk>[MASK] <unk> and so knowing that we went to the advertising council <unk> and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign <unk> and we looked around the world to canada and australia and brazil and parts of africa <unk> and we took this[MASK] <unk> knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called there 's no excuse for domestic violence take a look at one of our spots[MASK] <unk> as we were in the process of releasing this campaign o j simpson was arrested for the murder of his[MASK] <unk> we learned that he had a long history of domestic violence the media became fixated [MASK] the story of domestic violence went from the back page but actually from the no page to the front page <unk> our ads blanketed the airwaves and women for the first time started to tell their stories <unk> [MASK] movements are about moments <unk> [MASK] and we seized this moment and let me just put this in context[MASK] before one thousand nine hundred and eighty do you have any idea how many articles[MASK] were in the new york times on domestic violence i 'll tell you one hundred and <unk>[MASK] and in the <unk>[MASK] over seven thousand we were obviously making a[MASK] <unk> but we were still missing a critical element so step[MASK] four we needed to engage men [MASK] we couldn 't solve this problem with fifty percent of the population on the sidelines <unk> [MASK] and i already told you i 'm a data nerd national polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation [MASK] so we wondered <unk> how can we include[MASK] <unk> how can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls and a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said [MASK] you want men to talk about violence against women and girls men don 't[MASK] talk [MASK] i apologize to the men in the audience i know you do <unk> but he said do you know what they do do they do talk to their kids they talk[MASK] <unk> to their kids[MASK] as parents as coaches and that 's what we did we met men where they were at and we built a program and then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach[MASK] was talking to a room filled with male athletes[MASK] and men from all walks of life <unk> and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the[MASK] culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships and all of a sudden he looked at the back of the room [MASK] and he saw his daughter and he called out his daughter 's name michaela and he said michaela come up here and she 's nine years old and she was kind of shy and she got up there <unk> and he said sit down next to me [MASK] she sat right down next to him he[MASK] gave her this big hug <unk> and he said people ask me why i do this work <unk> [MASK] i do this work because i 'm her dad[MASK] <unk> and i don 't want anyone ever to hurt her and as a parent <unk> i get it <unk> i get it[MASK] <unk> knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so[MASK] we 've done a lot for adult women <unk> we 've got to do a better job for our kids[MASK] <unk> have to we 've come a long way[MASK] since the days of the polaroid technology has been our friend [MASK] the mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women and facebook and twitter and google and youtube and all the social media helps us organize[MASK] and tell our[MASK] <unk> story in a powerful way <unk> and so those of you in this audience who have helped build those applications and those platforms as an organizer <unk> i say thank you very much <unk> really <unk> i clap for you [MASK] i 'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life the optimist club[MASK] <unk> can 't make that one up [MASK] and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna i have been doing this work for over thirty years <unk> [MASK] and i am convinced now more than ever in the capacity of human beings to change [MASK] i believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality[MASK] and i also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition <unk> and i ask you stand with us[MASK] as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and[MASK] <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
