 <unk> village in orissa in india <unk> my father was a government worker[MASK] could not read or write <unk> but she would say to me [MASK] a king is worshipped only in his own kingdom a poet[MASK] is respected everywhere [MASK] so i wanted to be a poet when i grew up but i almost didn 't go to college[MASK] until an aunt offered financial help[MASK] i went to study in sambalpur the largest[MASK] town in the region where <unk> already in college <unk> i saw a television for the first time <unk> [MASK] i had dreams of going to the united states for higher studies [MASK] <unk> i crossed two oceans with borrowed money for airfare[MASK] and only a $ twenty bill in my pocket [MASK] in the u s [MASK] i worked in a research center part time while taking graduate classes in economics and[MASK] with the little i earned <unk> i would finance myself and then i would send money home to my brother and my father[MASK] my story is not unique there are millions of people who migrate each year [MASK] with the help of the family <unk> they cross oceans <unk> they cross deserts <unk> they cross rivers <unk> [MASK] they cross mountains <unk> they risk their lives[MASK] to realize a dream and that[MASK] <unk> dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home[MASK] and help the family <unk> which has helped them before [MASK] there are two hundred and thirty two million international migrants in the world <unk> these are people who live in a country other than their country of birth[MASK] <unk> if there was a country made up of only international migrants that would be larger <unk> in population than brazil <unk> [MASK] that would be larger <unk> in its size of the economy than france <unk> [MASK] some one hundred and eighty million of them from poor countries [MASK] send money home regularly those sums of money are called remittances <unk> [MASK] here is a fact that might surprise you[MASK] <unk> hundred and thirteen billion dollars [MASK] four hundred and thirteen billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries <unk> [MASK] migrants from developing countries money sent to developing countries four hundred and thirteen billion dollars <unk> [MASK] that 's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money [MASK] and yet[MASK] <unk> you[MASK] and i my colleagues in washington [MASK] we endlessly debate and discuss about development aid <unk> while we ignore remittances as small change <unk> [MASK] true people send two hundred dollars per month on average <unk> but repeated month after month <unk> by millions of people [MASK] these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency[MASK] <unk> currency <unk> so india <unk> last year received seventy two billion dollars larger than its it exports[MASK] in egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the suez canal[MASK] <unk> in tajikistan remittances are forty two percent of gdp <unk> and in poorer countries smaller[MASK] <unk> a lifeline as in somalia or in haiti <unk> [MASK] no wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people [MASK] remittances <unk> unlike private investment money they don 't[MASK] flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country[MASK] <unk> they actually act like an insurance [MASK] when the family is in trouble <unk> facing hardship <unk> facing hard times remittances increase <unk> they act like an insurance <unk> migrants send more money then [MASK] unlike development aid money that must go through official agencies through governments remittances[MASK] directly reach the poor reach the family <unk> and often with business[MASK] <unk> the share of poor people in the population <unk> by two thousand and five a decade later [MASK] at a time of political crisis <unk> economic crisis <unk> the share of poor people went down[MASK] to thirty one percent <unk> that decline in poverty [MASK] most of it about half of it is believed to be because of remittances from india <unk> another poor country[MASK] <unk> in el salvador <unk> the school dropout rate among children[MASK] is lower in families that receive remittances in mexico and sri lanka <unk> the birth weight of children is higher[MASK] among families that receive remittances [MASK] remittances are dollars wrapped with care[MASK] <unk> send money home for food for buying necessities <unk> for building houses for funding education for funding healthcare for the elderly for business investments for friends and family <unk> [MASK] migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery[MASK] or a wedding <unk> and migrants[MASK] <unk> too many times for unexpected funerals that they cannot attend <unk> [MASK] much as these flows do all that good [MASK] there are barriers to these flows of remittances these four hundred billion dollars of remittances <unk> [MASK] foremost among them[MASK] is the exorbitant cost of sending money home money transfer companies structure their fees[MASK] to milk the poor[MASK] they will say up to five hundred dollars if you want to send we will charge you thirty dollars fixed [MASK] if you are poor and if you have only two hundred dollars to send you have to pay that <unk>[MASK] the global average cost of sending money is eight percent <unk> that means you send one hundred dollars[MASK] <unk> the family on the other side receives only ninety two dollars [MASK] to send money to africa the cost is even higher <unk> twelve percent [MASK] to send money within africa <unk> the cost is even higher over twenty percent for example sending money from benin to nigeria <unk> [MASK] and then there is the case of venezuela [MASK] where because of exchange controls you send one hundred dollars[MASK] and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives[MASK] even ten dollars[MASK] <unk> of course <unk> nobody sends money to venezuela through the official channel [MASK] it all goes in suitcases whereever costs are high money goes underground <unk> [MASK] and what is worse <unk> many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country [MASK] many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money to specific[MASK] <unk> countries <unk> so is it that there are no options <unk> no better options cheaper options to send money <unk> there are m pesa in kenya[MASK] enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only sixty cents per transaction[MASK] u s fed started a program with mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to mexico for a fixed cost of only[MASK] sixty seven cents per transaction <unk> and yet <unk> these faster cheaper better options can 't be applied internationally[MASK] because of the fear of money laundering [MASK] even though there is little data to support any connection any significant connection between money laundering and these small[MASK] <unk> many international banks now are wary of hosting[MASK] bank accounts of money service businesses especially[MASK] those serving somalia somalia a country where the per capita income is only two hundred and fifty dollars[MASK] per year[MASK] <unk> lifeblood of somalia <unk> [MASK] and yet <unk> this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid <unk> while the left hand is cutting the[MASK] lifeblood to that economy <unk> through regulations [MASK] then there is the case of poor people from villages[MASK] <unk> like me in the villages <unk> the only place where you can get money is through the post office most of the governments in the world have[MASK] allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies so [MASK] if i have to send money to my father in the village <unk> [MASK] i must send money through that particular money transfer company even if the cost is high <unk> i cannot go to a cheaper[MASK] <unk> this has to go so what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home <unk> first [MASK] relax regulations on small remittances under one thousand dollars governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering <unk> [MASK] second[MASK] <unk> exclusive partnerships between their post office and the money transfer company for that matter between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor <unk> [MASK] in fact <unk> they should promote competition <unk> open up the partnership so that[MASK] we will bring down costs like we did <unk> like they did <unk> [MASK] in the telecommunications industry you have seen what has happened there third[MASK] <unk> large[MASK] nonprofit[MASK] philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a nonprofit basis <unk> they should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies[MASK] so that they can send money at a low cost while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world <unk> [MASK] the development community should set a goal of reducing remittance[MASK] <unk> costs to one percent[MASK] from the current eight percent <unk> if we reduce costs to one percent <unk> that would release a saving of thirty billion dollars per year <unk> [MASK] thirty billion dollars <unk> [MASK] that 's larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to africa per year <unk> that is larger than or almost[MASK] <unk> the total aid budget of the united states government the largest donor on the planet [MASK] actually the savings would be larger than that thirty billion because remittance channels are also used for aid <unk> trade and investment purposes <unk> [MASK] another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment [MASK] fees that migrants pay migrant workers pay to[MASK] <unk> who found them the job <unk> [MASK] i was in dubai a few years ago <unk> [MASK] i visited a camp for workers <unk> it was eight in the evening <unk> dark <unk> hot <unk> humid [MASK] workers were coming back[MASK] from their grueling day of work and i struck a conversation with a[MASK] <unk> he was preoccupied that he is sending money home <unk> he has been sending money home for a few months now [MASK] and the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent to the labor agent who found him that job <unk> and in my mind <unk> [MASK] i could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance the remittance arrives she takes the money[MASK] and hands it over[MASK] to the recruitment agent[MASK] <unk> the children are looking on this has to stop [MASK] it is not only[MASK] construction workers from bangladesh it is all the workers there are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem [MASK] a construction worker from bangladesh on an average <unk> pays about four thousand dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only two thousand dollars per year in[MASK] <unk> income <unk> [MASK] that means that for the two years or three years of his life <unk> he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees the family doesn 't get to see any of it [MASK] it is not only dubai it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world <unk> [MASK] it is not only bangladeshi construction workers it is workers from all over the world it is not only men[MASK] <unk> women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices [MASK] one of the most exciting[MASK] and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is[MASK] how to mobilize through innovation diaspora saving and diaspora giving [MASK] migrants send money home <unk> but they also save a large amount of money where they live[MASK] <unk> annually <unk> migrant savings are estimated to be <unk>[MASK] five hundred billion dollars <unk> most of that money is parked in[MASK] bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate <unk> [MASK] if a country were to come and offer a three percent or four percent interest rate <unk> and then say that the money would be used for building[MASK] <unk> train systems in the country of origin a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money[MASK] because it 's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country 's development [MASK] remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to[MASK] to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances that 's when you can actually sell it to them[MASK] you can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving <unk> i would love to invest in a bullet train system in india[MASK] and i would love to contribute[MASK] to efforts to fight malaria in my village remittances are[MASK] a great way of sharing prosperity between places[MASK] in a targeted[MASK] <unk> way that benefits those who need them most remittances empower people [MASK] we must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper and it can be done[MASK] <unk> to be a poet[MASK]
