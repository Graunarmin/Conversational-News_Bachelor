 <unk> i[MASK] <unk> thank you for being here and i say thank you for being here because[MASK] i was silent for seventeen years and the first words that i spoke were in[MASK] <unk> of earth day and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak <unk> and[MASK] i said <unk> thank you for being here my mother out in the audience she jumped up hallelujah johnnys talking [MASK] imagine if you were quiet for seventeen years and your your mother was out in the audience say <unk> my[MASK] <unk> i turned around because i didnt recognize where my voice was coming from [MASK] i hadnt heard my voice in seventeen years so i turned around and i looked and i said god who 's saying what im thinking [MASK] and then i realized it was me you know <unk> and i kind of laughed <unk> and i could see my father[MASK] take you on this journey and the journey i believe is a metaphor for all of our journeys <unk>[MASK] <unk> even though this one is kind of unusual i want you to think about[MASK] your own journey <unk> my journey began[MASK] in <unk>[MASK] when i witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the golden[MASK] <unk> gate and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay [MASK] it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles[MASK] thats a big thing in california <unk> and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness california[MASK] <unk> because there were only about three hundred and fifty people there in the winter this was back in ' seventy one now [MASK] and so when i came in and i i started walking around [MASK] people[MASK] they just knew what was going on and people would drive up next to me and say john what are you doing[MASK] <unk> bad right youre walking to make us feel bad and maybe there was some truth to that because i thought that if i started walking everyone would[MASK] follow because of the oil everybody talked about the polllution <unk> and so[MASK] i argued with people about that i argued and i argued i called my[MASK] <unk> ive given up riding and driving in cars my dad said why didnt you do that when you were sixteen [MASK] i didnt know about the environment then theyre back in philadelphia <unk> and so[MASK] i told my mother im happy though im really happy she said if you were happy son you wouldnt have to say it mothers are like that [MASK] and so on my my 27th birthday i decided because i argued so much and i talk so much[MASK] that i was going to stop speaking for just one day one day[MASK] to give it a rest <unk> [MASK] and so i did <unk> i got up in the morning and i didnt say a word <unk> and i have to tell you it was a very moving experience because[MASK] for the first time[MASK] <unk> and what i heard [MASK] it kind of disturbed me because what i used to do when i thought i was listening was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could[MASK] i knew what they were going to say <unk> and so i stopped listening <unk> and in my mind i just kind of raced ahead[MASK] and thought of what i was going to say back while they were still finishing up <unk> and then i would[MASK] <unk> launch in well <unk> that just ended communication <unk> [MASK] so on this first day i actually listened and it was very sad for me because i realized that for those many years i had not been learning i <unk>[MASK] <unk> was twenty seven i thought i knew everything [MASK] <unk> and so[MASK] i decided id better do this for another day <unk> [MASK] and another day <unk> and another day until finally i promised myself for a year i would keep quiet because i started learning more and more and i needed to learn more so for <unk>[MASK] <unk> a year i said i would keep quiet and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again well that lasted seventeen years [MASK] now during that time[MASK] those seventeen years i walked and i i played the banjo and i painted and i wrote in my journal and[MASK] i tried to study the environment[MASK] by reading books and i decided that i was going to go to school <unk> [MASK] so i did i walked up to ashland oregon where they were offering[MASK] an environmental studies degree[MASK] its only five hundred miles and i went into the registrars office and what what [MASK] what i had a newspaper clipping oh [MASK] so you really want to go to school here you dont we have a special program for you they did <unk> and in those two years[MASK] i graduated[MASK] with my first degree a bachelors degree and my father came out he was so proud he said listen were really proud of you son <unk> [MASK] but what are you going to do with a bachelors degree <unk> you dont ride in cars you dont talk youre going to have to do those things [MASK] i hunched my shoulder i picked my backpack up again and i started walking [MASK] i walked[MASK] <unk> all the way up to port townsend washington <unk> where i built a wooden boat <unk> rode it across puget sound <unk>[MASK] and walked across washington [ to ] idaho and down to missoula montana[MASK] <unk> i had written the university of montana two years earlier[MASK] and said i 'd like to go to school there i said i 'd be there in[MASK] <unk> and i was there i showed up in two years and[MASK] they i tell this story because they really helped me there are two stories in montana the first story is[MASK] i didnt have any money thats a sign i used a lot <unk> and they said don 't worry about that the[MASK] director of the program said come back tomorrow he gave me one hundred and fifty dollars <unk> and he said register for one one credit <unk> youre going to go to south america[MASK] said[MASK] rivers and lakes the hydrological systems south america <unk> [MASK] so i did that he[MASK] came back he said to me ok john now that you 've registered for that one credit <unk> you can have a key to an office you can matriculate youre matriculating so you can use the library <unk> and what were going to do is were going to have[MASK] all of the professors allow you to go to class[MASK] <unk> theyre going to save your grade <unk> [MASK] and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money then you can register for that class and theyll give you the grade wow [MASK] they dont do that in graduate schools i dont think but i use that story because they really wanted to help me <unk> they saw that i was[MASK] <unk> they really wanted to help me along the way and during that time i actually taught classes without speaking[MASK] i had thirteen students when i first walked into the class i explained with a friend who could[MASK] interpret my sign language that i was john francis i was walking around the world i didnt talk and this was the last time this persons going to be here interpreting for me <unk> [MASK] all the students sat around and they[MASK] <unk> i could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out [MASK] they had to take that class with me two weeks later everyone was trying to get into our class and i learned in that class because i would do things like this[MASK] <unk> i think hes talking about selective forestry now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion [MASK] i just backed out of that you know and i just kind of kept the fists from flying <unk> but what i learned was that sometimes i would make a sign and[MASK] they said things that i absolutely did not mean[MASK] but i should have <unk> [MASK] and so what what came to me is if you were a teacher and you were teaching <unk> if you werent learning you probably werent teaching very well <unk> [MASK] and so i went on my dad came out to see me graduate and you know i did the deal and my father said were really proud of you son but you know what went on he said youve got to start riding and driving and[MASK] start talking what are you going to do[MASK] <unk> a masters degree i hunched my shoulder i got my backpack and i went on to the university of wisconsin[MASK] <unk> i spent two years there writing on oil spills <unk> no one was interested in oil spills <unk> but[MASK] something happened[MASK] exxon valdez <unk> and i was the only one in the united states writing on oil spills <unk> my dad came out[MASK] <unk> again[MASK] he said i don 't know how you do this son i mean you <unk> don 't ride in cars you dont talk my sister said maybe i should leave you alone because you seem to be doing[MASK] a lot better when youre not saying anything [MASK] well <unk> i put on my backpack again <unk> [MASK] i put my banjo on and i walked all the way to the east coast put my foot in the atlantic ocean it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across[MASK] <unk> united states and[MASK] on earth day one thousand nine hundred[MASK] and ninety the 20th anniversary of earth day thats when i began to speak <unk> and thats why i said thank you for being here because it 's sort of like that tree in the forest[MASK] falling and if there 's no one there to hear does it really make a sound and im thanking you and i 'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak[MASK] <unk> communication and they also taught me about listening[MASK] that they listened to me and its one of those things that came out of the silence the listening to each other [MASK] really very important we need to listen to each other well <unk> my journey kept going on my dad said[MASK] <unk> let that go i worked for the coastguard was made a u n goodwill ambassador <unk> i wrote regulations for the united states i mean i wrote[MASK] oil spill regulations <unk> twenty years ago if someone had[MASK] said to me john do you really want to make a difference [MASK] yeah i want to make a difference he said you just start walking east get out of your car and just start walking east and as i walked off a little bit[MASK] <unk> they 'd say yeah and shut up too [MASK] youre going to make a difference buddy [MASK] how could that be how could that be how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference[MASK] <unk> well <unk> my time at the coast guard was a really good time and after that i only worked one year i said that 's enough[MASK] <unk> one year 's enough for me to do that i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and[MASK] walked through all of the islands and to venezuela and[MASK] you know i forgot the the most important thing which is why i started talking <unk> which i have to tell you [MASK] i started talking because i had studied environment[MASK] id studied environment at this[MASK] formal level <unk> but there was this informal level <unk> and the informal level i learned about[MASK] people and what we do and how we are and[MASK] environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other[MASK] <unk> because if we are the environment then all we need to do is look around us and see[MASK] how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other <unk> [MASK] and so thats the message that i had and i said well i 'm going to have to spread that message and i got in my sailboat sailed all the way through the caribbean[MASK] it wasn 't really my sailboat[MASK] <unk> kind of worked on that boat[MASK] got to venezuela and i started walking [MASK] this is the last part of this story because its how i got here because i still didn 't ride in motorized vehicles <unk> [MASK] i was walking through el dorado[MASK] it 's a prison town famous prison or infamous prison in venezuela [MASK] and i dont know what possessed me because this was not like me <unk> [MASK] there i am walking past the guard[MASK] <unk> gate and[MASK] the guard stops and says [MASK] pasaporte <unk> pasaporte [MASK] and with an m16 pointed at me and i looked at him and i said <unk> <unk> passport huh [MASK] i don 't need to show you my passport its in the back of my pack <unk> i 'm dr francis i 'm a u n ambassador and i 'm walking around the world [MASK] and i started walking off what possessed me to say this[MASK] the road turned into the jungle <unk> i didnt get shot <unk> [MASK] and i got to i start saying free at last thank god almighty <unk> im free at last [MASK] what was that about[MASK] <unk> what was that about it took me one hundred miles to figure out[MASK] that in my heart in me <unk> i[MASK] had become a prisoner i was a prisoner and i needed to escape the prison that i was in[MASK] was the fact that i did not drive[MASK] or use motorized vehicles <unk> now how could that be <unk> because when i started it seemed very appropriate to[MASK] <unk> me[MASK] not to use motorized vehicles <unk> but the thing that was different was that every birthday i asked myself about silence <unk> but i never asked myself about[MASK] my decision to just use my feet [MASK] i had no idea i was going to become a u n ambassador i had no idea i would[MASK] <unk> and so i realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me <unk> [MASK] and that i was going to have to change <unk> you know we can do it [MASK] i was going to have to change <unk> and i was afraid to change because i was so used to the guy who only just walked [MASK] i was so used to that person[MASK] that i didnt want to stop i didnt know who i would be if i[MASK] <unk> changed <unk> [MASK] but i know i needed to [MASK] i know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today <unk> [MASK] and i know that[MASK] a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where <unk> weve gotten to but theres another place for us to go and we[MASK] kind of have to leave behind[MASK] <unk> the security of who weve become and go to the place of who we are becoming <unk> [MASK] and so i want to encourage you[MASK] to go to that next place to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in as comfortable as it may be[MASK] <unk> because[MASK] we have to do something[MASK] now we have to change now [MASK] as our former vice president said <unk> we have to become activists <unk> [MASK] so if my voice can touch[MASK] <unk> you if my actions can touch you if my being here can touch you please let it be <unk> and i know that all of you[MASK] have touched me[MASK] while ive been here [MASK] so lets go out into the world and take this caring this love this respect that weve shown each other[MASK] <unk> here at ted and take this out into the world because[MASK] we are the environment and how we treat each other[MASK] is really how were going to treat the environment so i want to thank you for being here[MASK] and i want to end this in five seconds of[MASK]
