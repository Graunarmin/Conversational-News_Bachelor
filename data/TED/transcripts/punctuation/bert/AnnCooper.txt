 <unk> my thing with school lunch is it 's a social justice issue <unk> i 'm the director of nutrition services for the berkeley unified school district i have ninety employees and seventeen locations nine thousand six hundred kids i 'm doing seven thousand one hundred meals a day[MASK] and i 've been doing it for two years trying to change how we feed kids in america and[MASK] <unk> and that 's what i want to talk to you a little bit about today these are some of my kids with a salad bar i put salad bars in all of our schools when i got there everyone says it couldn 't be done little kids couldn 't eat off the salad <unk>[MASK] <unk> bar big kids would spit in it neither happened when i took over this i tried to really figure out like what my vision would be how do we really change children 's relationship to food and i 'll tell you why we need to change it but we absolutely have to change it and what i came to understand[MASK] <unk> is we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet healthy food and healthy kids and that if we don 't do that the antithesis <unk>[MASK] although we 've heard otherwise is we 're really going to become extinct because we 're feeding our children to death that 's my premise we 're seeing sick kids get sicker and[MASK] <unk> and the reason this is happening by and large is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food the way the government oversees our food <unk> the way the[MASK] usda puts food on kids ' plates that 's unhealthy and allows unhealthy food into schools and by tacitly all of us send our kids or grandchildren or nieces or <unk>[MASK] <unk> nephews to school and tell them to learn <unk> you know learn what 's in those schools and when you feed these kids bad food that 's what they 're learning so that 's really what this is all about[MASK] the way we got here is because of big agribusiness <unk> we now live in a country where most of us don 't decide by and large what we eat we see big businesses <unk>[MASK] monsanto and dupont who brought out agent orange and stain resistant carpet they control ninety percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country these are ten companies[MASK] <unk> really a problem <unk> so when i started thinking about these issues and how i was going to change what kids ate i really started focusing on what we would teach them <unk> and the very first thing was <unk>[MASK] <unk> about regional food trying to eat food from within our region and clearly with what 's going on with fossil fuel usage or when as the fossil fuel is going[MASK] <unk> oil hits its peak oil <unk> you know we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should or could be moving food one thousand five hundred miles before we eat it <unk>[MASK] <unk> so we talked to kids about that and we really start to feed kids regional food and then we talk about organic food now most school districts can 't really afford organic food <unk> but we <unk>[MASK] as a nation have to start thinking about consuming growing and feeding our children food that 's not chock full of chemicals we can 't keep feeding our[MASK] <unk> kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones we can 't keep doing that you know it doesn 't work <unk> and the results of that are kids getting sick <unk>[MASK] <unk> one of my big soapboxes soapboxes right now is antibiotics seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal husbandry <unk> we are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein[MASK] every day <unk> seventy percent it 's unbelievable <unk> and the result of it is we have diseases[MASK] we have things like e coli that we can 't fix that we can 't make kids better when they get sick and you know certainly antibiotics have been <unk>[MASK] but it 's an issue in the food supply <unk> one of my favorite facts is that u s agriculture uses one point two billion pounds of[MASK] <unk> pesticides every year that means every one of us and our children consumes what would equal a five pound bag those bags you have at home if i had one here and ripped it open <unk>[MASK] <unk> and that pile i would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply because of the way we[MASK] <unk> allows these antibiotics these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine okay we could talk about rachel carson and ddt <unk>[MASK] <unk> but we know it wasn 't good for you and me <unk> and that is what the usda allows in our food supply <unk> and that has to change you know <unk> the usda cannot be seen as the[MASK] <unk> of what we feed our kids and what 's allowed we cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart <unk> the antithesis of this whole thing[MASK] is sustainable food <unk> that 's what i really try and get people to understand i really try and teach it to kids i think it 's the most important it 's consuming food in a way[MASK] <unk> in which we 'll still have a planet <unk> in which kids will grow up to be healthy and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we 're seeing [MASK] <unk> sustainability <unk> but we have to figure out what sustainability is <unk> in less than two hundred years you know just in a few generations we 've gone from being two hundred[MASK] being one hundred percent ninety five percent farmers to less than two percent of farmers we now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers two point one million prisoners one point nine million farmers <unk> [MASK] and we spend thirty five thousand dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison and[MASK] <unk> school districts spend five hundred dollars a year feeding a child it 's no wonder <unk> you know we have criminals [MASK] and what 's happening is we 're getting sick <unk> we 're getting sick and our kids are getting sick [MASK] it is about what we feed them what goes in is what we are we really are what we eat and if we continue down this[MASK] <unk> path if we continue to feed kids bad food if we continue not to teach them what good food is [MASK] what 's going to happen <unk> you know what is going to happen what 's going to happen to our whole medical system what 's going to happen is [MASK] we 're going to have kids[MASK] that have a life less long than our own <unk>[MASK] <unk> the cdc the center for disease control has said of the children born in the year two thousand those seven and <unk> eight year olds today one out of every three caucasians one out of every <unk>[MASK] <unk> two african americans and hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime [MASK] <unk> within a decade <unk> [MASK] what 's going to happen <unk> well the cdc has gone further to say that those children born in the year two thousand could be the first generation in our country 's history to <unk>[MASK] <unk> die at a younger age than their parents and it 's because of what we feed them because <unk>[MASK] <unk> we are responsible for what kids eat <unk> [MASK] but oops <unk> maybe they 're responsible for what kids eat [MASK] big companies spend twenty billion dollars a year marketing non nutrient foods to kids <unk> twenty billion dollars a year ten thousand ads most kids see [MASK] they spend five hundred dollars for every one dollar five hundred dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn 't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy nutritious food <unk> the result of which is[MASK] <unk> kids think they 're going to die if they don 't have chicken nuggets <unk> you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more and more and more this is the usda portion size that little tiny thing and the one over there that 's bigger than my head [MASK] is what mcdonald 's and burger king and those big companies think we should eat and why can they serve that much why can we have[MASK] <unk> cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non nutrient foods really really cheap which is why i say it 's a social justice <unk>[MASK] <unk> issue <unk> now i said i 'm doing this in berkeley and you might think oh berkeley of course you can do it in berkeley well this is the food i found twenty four months ago this is not even food this is the stuff we were feeding our kids extremo burritos corn dogs [MASK] <unk> grilled cheese sandwiches everything came in plastic in cardboard the only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter the only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can <unk>[MASK] <unk> crusher because if it didn 't come in a can it came frozen in a box the usda allows this the usda allows all of this stuff in case you can 't tell that 's like pink danish and some kind of cupcakes chicken nuggets[MASK] <unk> tater tots chocolate milk with high fructose canned fruit cocktail a reimbursable meal that 's what the government says is okay to feed our kids <unk> [MASK] it ain 't okay <unk> you know what it is not okay <unk> and we all of us have to understand[MASK] that this is about us that we can make a[MASK] <unk> any of you out there invented chicken nuggets but i 'm sure you 're rich if you did <unk> but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart [MASK] a giraffe a star <unk> well tyson did <unk> because there 's no chicken in the chicken <unk> and that they could figure it out that we could sell this stuff to kids <unk> you know what 's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken [MASK] but this is what most schools[MASK] <unk> in fact this may be what a lot of parents serve as opposed to this is what we try and serve <unk> [MASK] we really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food we really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe <unk> [MASK] you know that vegetables[MASK] are actually colorful that they have flavor that carrots grow in the ground <unk> that[MASK] strawberries grow in the ground there 's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush <unk> [MASK] you know we have to change the way we teach kids about these things there 's a lot of stuff we can do there 's a lot of schools doing farm to school programs [MASK] <unk> there 's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools <unk> now in berkeley <unk> we 've gone totally fresh <unk> we have no high fructose corn syrup no trans fats no processed <unk>[MASK] <unk> foods we 're cooking from scratch every day we have twenty five percent of our[MASK] thank you[MASK] twenty five percent of our stuff is organic and local we cook those are my hands i get up at four a m every day and go cook the food for the kids <unk>[MASK] <unk> because this is what we need to do we can 't keep serving kids processed[MASK] <unk> the generation after to be able to think like this if they 're not nourished if they 're eating[MASK] eating chemicals all the time they 're not going to be able to think they 're not going to be smart <unk> you know what they 're just going to be sick <unk> [MASK] now one of the things that what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that you know this was all pretty amazing[MASK] <unk> very different and i needed to market it i came up with these calendars that i sent home to every parent and these calendars really started to lay out my program now i 'm in charge of all the cooking classes and <unk>[MASK] <unk> all the gardening classes in our school district <unk> so this is a typical menu this is what we 're serving this week at the schools and you see these recipes on the side those are the recipes that the kids learn <unk>[MASK] <unk> in my cooking classes they do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes they also may be growing them <unk> and we serve them in the cafeterias[MASK] <unk> we 're going to change children 's relationship to food it 's delicious nutritious food in the cafeterias hands on experience you 're looking in cooking and gardening classes and academic curriculum to tie it all together <unk> [MASK] now you 've probably garnered that i don 't love the usda and i don 't have any idea what to do with their pyramid this upside down pyramid with a rainbow over the top i[MASK] <unk> run up into the end of the rainbow i don 't know what you do with it so i came up with my own this is available on my website in english and spanish and it 's a visual way to talk to kids about food <unk> the really tiny hamburger <unk>[MASK] the really big vegetables <unk> we have to start changing this <unk> we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference [MASK] <unk> maybe two of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer [MASK] what are kids learning where is the family time where is socialization where is discussion where is learning to[MASK] <unk> we have to change it i work with kids a lot these are kids i work with in harlem <unk> eatwise enlightened and aware teens who inspire smart eating <unk> we have to teach kids that coke and pop tarts aren 't breakfast <unk> [MASK] we have to teach kids that if they 're on a diet of refined sugar <unk> they go up and[MASK] down just like if they 're on a diet of crack <unk> and we have to pull it all together[MASK] <unk> have composting in all of our schools we have recycling in all of our schools <unk> you know the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important <unk> [MASK] we have to teach kids about in school [MASK] it has to be so much a part of them that they really get it because you know what many of us are sort of at the end of our careers <unk> and we need to be <unk>[MASK] giving these kids these young kids the next generation the tools to save themselves and save the planet <unk> one of the things i do a lot is[MASK] public private partnerships <unk> i work with private companies who are willing to do r & d with me <unk> who are willing to do distribution for me <unk> who are really willing to work to go into schools schools are underfunded <unk>[MASK] most schools in america spend less than seven thousand five hundred dollars a year teaching a child that comes down to under five dollars an hour most of you spend[MASK] <unk> fifteen dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them <unk> so we 're spending less than five dollars an hour on the educational system and if we 're going to change it and change how we feed <unk>[MASK] <unk> kids we really have to rethink that so public and private partnerships advocacy groups working with foundations in our school district the way we afford this is our school district allocates <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent of the general fund towards nutrition services and i think if every school district allocated a half to one[MASK] <unk> percent we could start to really fix this program <unk> we really need to change it it 's going to take more money [MASK] of course it 's not all about food it 's also about kids getting exercise and one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch <unk> it 's sort of this duh [MASK] <unk> thing you know if you have kids coming into lunch and all they 're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess you see them just throw away their lunch[MASK] <unk> can run outside and then at one in the afternoon they 're totally crashing these are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up because they haven 't had lunch [MASK] so if the only thing they 'd have to do after lunch is go to class believe me they 're going to sit there and eat their lunch <unk> [MASK] we need to we need to[MASK] educate we need to educate the kids we[MASK] <unk> the staff i had ninety employees two were supposed to be cooks none could <unk> and you know i 'm not that better[MASK] better off now <unk> but we really have to educate we have to get[MASK] academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again because of course they don 't because we 've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long [MASK] we need 40 minute lunches most[MASK] <unk> there was just a big study done and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and ten in the morning <unk> that is not lunchtime[MASK] <unk> you know it 's crazy <unk> it 's crazy what we 're doing and just remember at very least tacitly [MASK] this is what we 're teaching children as what they should be doing <unk> [MASK] i think if we 're going to fix[MASK] one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program instead of the national school lunch program being under the usda i think it should be under cdc if we started to think about food[MASK] and how we feed our kids as a health initiative <unk> [MASK] and we started thinking about food as health then i think we wouldn 't have corn dogs[MASK] as lunch[MASK] <unk> this and this i 'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece because i think this is something we all have to understand the national school lunch program spends eight billion dollars feeding thirty million children <unk>[MASK] <unk> a year that number probably needs to double people say oh my god where are we going to get eight billion in this country we 're spending one hundred and ten billion dollars a year[MASK] <unk> aids <unk> we spend fifty billion dollars on vegetables which is why we need all the diet aids <unk> [MASK] we spend two hundred billion dollars a year on diet related illness today with nine percent of our kids having type two diabetes two hundred billion [MASK] so you know what when we talk about needing eight billion more <unk> it 's not a lot that eight billion comes down to two dollars and[MASK] <unk> cents that 's what the government allocates for lunch most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead <unk> that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools most schools eighty to ninety cents in <unk>[MASK] <unk> cents <unk> so we 're spending less than a dollar ok on lunch now i don 't know[MASK] <unk> but i go to starbucks and pete 's and places like that and venti latte in san francisco is five dollars one gourmet coffee one [MASK] is more we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week[MASK] in our schools <unk> you know what we should be ashamed [MASK] we as a country should be ashamed[MASK] at that the richest country in[MASK] <unk> country <unk> it 's the kids that need it the most [MASK] who get this really really lousy food it 's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can 't even afford[MASK] to pay for school lunch that gets this food and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick [MASK] <unk> those are the same kids who we should be taking care of[MASK]
