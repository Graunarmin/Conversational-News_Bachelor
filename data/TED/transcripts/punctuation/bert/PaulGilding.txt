 <unk> let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week <unk> four words that will come to define this century [MASK] here they are the earth is[MASK] <unk> 's full of us it 's full of our stuff full of our waste full of our demands <unk> [MASK] yes we are a brilliant and creative species but we 've created a little too much stuff[MASK] so much that our economy is now bigger than its host our planet [MASK] this is not a philosophical statement this is just science[MASK] <unk> analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we 're living beyond our means [MASK] the eminent scientists of the global footprint network for example calculate that we need about one point five earths to sustain this economy [MASK] in other words [MASK] to keep operating at our current level we need fifty percent more earth than we 've got[MASK] <unk> in financial terms this would be like always spending fifty percent more than you earn going further into debt every year <unk> [MASK] but of course you can 't borrow natural resources so we 're[MASK] burning through our capital or stealing from the future [MASK] so when i say full i mean really full well past any margin for error well past any dispute about[MASK] <unk> methodology [MASK] what this means is our economy is unsustainable i 'm not saying it 's not nice or pleasant[MASK] or that it 's bad for polar bears or forests though it certainly is [MASK] what i 'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable <unk> in other words <unk> thanks to those pesky laws[MASK] <unk> but that 's not possible you might think we can 't stop[MASK] economic growth because that 's what will stop economic growth <unk> it will stop because of the end of trade resources <unk> it will stop because of the[MASK] growing demand of us on on all the resources all the capacity <unk> all the systems of the earth which is now having economic damage[MASK] <unk> when we think about economic growth stopping we go that 's not possible because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned <unk> [MASK] although growth has certainly delivered many benefits <unk> it is an idea so essential that we tend not to[MASK] understand the possibility of it not being around <unk> even though it has delivered many benefits <unk> it is based on a crazy idea the crazy idea being that we can[MASK] <unk> have infinite growth on a finite planet <unk> [MASK] and i 'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes that the crazy idea is just that it is crazy <unk> and with the earth full <unk> it 's game over [MASK] come on you 're thinking that 's not possible <unk> [MASK] technology is amazing people are innovative there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things we can surely sort this out [MASK] <unk> true <unk> well it 's mostly true <unk> we are certainly amazing and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity [MASK] so if our problem was to get the human economy down from one hundred and fifty percent to one hundred percent[MASK] of the earth 's capacity we could do that the problem is we 're just warming up this growth engine <unk> we plan to take this[MASK] <unk> make it twice as big[MASK] and then make it four times as big[MASK] not in some distant future <unk> but in less than forty years in the life time of most of you [MASK] china plans to be there in just twenty years <unk> [MASK] the only problem with this plan[MASK] is that it 's not possible <unk> [MASK] in response some people[MASK] <unk> argue but we need growth we need it to solve poverty we need it to develop technology we need it to keep social stability <unk> i find this argument fascinating as though[MASK] <unk> we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs it[MASK] 's like the earth doesn 't care what we need mother nature[MASK] <unk> she just sets rules and describes consequences <unk> [MASK] and these are not esoteric limits this is about food and water <unk> soil and climate the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives <unk> [MASK] so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a[MASK] <unk> economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in two thousand and fifty a life[MASK] of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion it[MASK] 's not that it 's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and have us live live decent lives <unk> [MASK] it certainly is but the idea that we can[MASK] gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong <unk> and it 's dangerously wrong <unk> because it means we 're not getting ready for what 's really going to happen [MASK] <unk> happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an[MASK] is that the system stops working and breaks down <unk> and that 's what will happen to us [MASK] many of you will be thinking <unk> but surely we can still stop this if it 's that bad[MASK] <unk> bad we 'll react let[MASK] 's just think through that idea now we 've had fifty years of warnings we 've had[MASK] science proving the urgency of change we 've had economic analysis pointing out that not only can we afford it it 's cheaper to act early <unk> [MASK] and yet the reality is we 've done[MASK] pretty much nothing to change course we 're not[MASK] even slowing down <unk> last year on climate for example <unk> we had the highest global emissions ever <unk> [MASK] the story on food on water on soil on climate is all much the same [MASK] i actually don 't say this in despair <unk> i 've done my grieving about the loss i accept where we are it is sad <unk>[MASK] <unk> but it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized[MASK] that we 're not acting we 're not close to acting and we 're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy [MASK] and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue[MASK] and the event that we need to get ready for so when does this transition[MASK] <unk> when does this breakdown begin <unk> [MASK] in my view <unk> it is well underway <unk> i know most people don 't see it that way we tend to look at the world not as the integrated system that it is [MASK] but as a series of individual issues <unk> we see the occupy protests we see[MASK] spiraling debt crises we see growing inequality we see money 's influence on politics we see resource constraint food and oil[MASK] <unk> but we see mistakenly each of these issues as individual problems to be solved <unk> [MASK] in fact <unk> it 's the system in the painful process of breaking down our system [MASK] of debt fueled economic growth [MASK] of ineffective democracy of overloading planet earth is eating itself alive[MASK] <unk> i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this but i won 't because if you want to see it that[MASK] <unk> evidence is all around you <unk> i want to talk to you about fear <unk> [MASK] i want to do so because <unk> in my view <unk> the most important issue[MASK] we face[MASK] is how we respond to this question the crisis is now inevitable[MASK] <unk> issue is how will we react [MASK] of course we can 't know what will happen the future is inherently uncertain but let 's just think through what the science is telling us[MASK] is likely to happen <unk> imagine our economy[MASK] when the carbon bubble bursts when the financial markets recognize that to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control <unk> [MASK] the oil and coal industries are finished[MASK] imagine china india and pakistan going to war as climate impacts[MASK] generate conflict over food and water <unk> imagine the middle east without oil income <unk> but with collapsing governments[MASK] imagine thirty percent unemployment in america as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty <unk> [MASK] now imagine what that means for you your family your friends your personal financial security <unk> imagine what it means for your[MASK] personal security[MASK] as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why[MASK] <unk> this was allowed to happen <unk> [MASK] imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you so in two thousand and twelve <unk> mom and dad what was it like[MASK] when you 'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row <unk> [MASK] when every scientific body in the world was saying you 've got a major problem <unk> [MASK] when the oceans were acidifying when oil and food prices were spiking[MASK] they were rioting in the streets of london and occupying wall street <unk> when the system was so clearly breaking down mom and dad <unk> [MASK] what did you do what were you thinking [MASK] so how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your[MASK] <unk> when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges just take a moment[MASK] and take a breath[MASK] and think what do you feel at this point[MASK] <unk> fear [MASK] of course we can 't know what 's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty <unk>[MASK] but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint <unk> [MASK] we should feel a bit of fear <unk> [MASK] we are in danger[MASK] <unk> all of us and we 've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response [MASK] to help us bravely face a threat <unk> [MASK] but this time it 's not a tiger at the cave mouth [MASK] you can 't see the danger at your door <unk> but if you look you can see it at the door of your civilization <unk> [MASK] that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on because if we wait until the crisis takes hold we may[MASK] <unk> panic and hide if we feel it now and think it through we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself <unk> [MASK] yes things will get ugly <unk> [MASK] and it will happen soon certainly in our lifetime but we are more than capable of getting through everything that 's coming <unk> you see those people[MASK] that have faith that humans can solve any problem[MASK] that technology is limitless that markets can be a force for good are in fact right <unk> the only thing they 're missing[MASK] is that it takes a good crisis to get us going <unk> [MASK] when we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things think about[MASK] war after the bombing of pearl harbor it just took four days for the government to ban the production of[MASK] <unk> civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry and from there to rationing of food and energy [MASK] think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done think about how an individual responds to a[MASK] diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes[MASK] that previously were just too difficult[MASK] suddenly become relatively easy[MASK] we are smart <unk> in fact we really are quite amazing but we do love a good crisis and the good news this one 's a monster [MASK] sure <unk> if we get it wrong <unk> we could face the end of this civilization <unk> [MASK] but if we get it right <unk> it could be the beginning of civilization instead [MASK] and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that[MASK] 's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way <unk> [MASK] scientists like james hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net co2 emissions from the economy[MASK] in just a few decades <unk> i wanted to know what that would take so i worked with professor jorgen randers from norway[MASK] to find the answer[MASK] <unk> we developed a plan called the one degree war plan so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required [MASK] to my surprise <unk> eliminating net <unk> co2 emissions from the economy in just twenty years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap [MASK] not very cheap <unk> but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization <unk> [MASK] we didn 't calculate that precisely but we understand that 's very expensive[MASK] <unk> you can read the details but in summary we can transform our economy <unk> we can do it[MASK] with proven technology <unk> we can do it at an affordable cost we can do it with existing political structures the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel [MASK] and this is where you come in [MASK] when we think about the future i paint of course we should feel a bit of fear [MASK] but fear can be paralyzing or motivating <unk> we need to accept the fear and then we need to act[MASK] <unk> we need to act like the future depends on it we need to act like we only have one planet <unk> [MASK] we can do this i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do [MASK] they 're wrong <unk> [MASK] we can be more we can be much more [MASK] we have achieved[MASK] <unk> remarkable things since working out how to grow food some ten thousand years ago we 've built a powerful foundation of science knowledge and technology more than enough[MASK] to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent <unk> meaningful and satisfying lives <unk> the earth can support that if we choose the right path <unk> [MASK] we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society 's[MASK] <unk> evolution[MASK] like what do we want to be when we grow up <unk> [MASK] when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality <unk> [MASK] well it 's time to grow up [MASK] to be wiser to be calmer to be more considered [MASK] like generations before us we 'll be growing up in war not a war between civilizations but a war for civilization[MASK] for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society[MASK] which is stronger and happier[MASK] and plans on staying around into middle age <unk> [MASK] we can choose life over fear <unk> we can do what we need to do <unk> but it will take[MASK] every entrepreneur <unk>[MASK] <unk> every artist every scientist <unk> every communicator every mother every father every child <unk> every one of us [MASK] this could be our finest hour <unk> thank you[MASK]
