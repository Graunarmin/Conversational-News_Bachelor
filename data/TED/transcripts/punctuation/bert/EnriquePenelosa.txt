 <unk> in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge <unk> because different from health or education or housing [MASK] it tends to get worse as societies become richer [MASK] <unk> most other developing country problems <unk> more than a matter of money or technology is a matter of[MASK] equality equity [MASK] the great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see <unk> for example <unk> that[MASK] in terms of transport[MASK] <unk> an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars <unk> but rather one where even the rich use public transport [MASK] or bicycles <unk> for example <unk> in amsterdam more than thirty percent of the population uses bicycles <unk> [MASK] despite the fact that the netherlands has a higher income per capita than the united states [MASK] there is[MASK] a conflict in developing world cities for money for government investment if more money is invested[MASK] <unk> highways of course there is less money for housing for schools for hospitals <unk> and also there is a conflict for space [MASK] there is a conflict for space between[MASK] those with cars and those without them most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage[MASK] <unk> most of society 's resources however there is a problem with that that market economy needs[MASK] inequality of income[MASK] in order to work some people must make more money <unk> some others less [MASK] some companies succeed others fail <unk> then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy [MASK] i would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities the first one is equality of quality of life[MASK] especially for children[MASK] <unk> that all children should have beyond the obvious health and education access to green spaces to sports facilities [MASK] to swimming pools to music lessons <unk> and the second kind of equality is one which we could call democratic equality [MASK] the first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law that[MASK] <unk> is not just[MASK] poetry it 's a very powerful principle for example <unk> if that is true [MASK] a bus with eighty passengers has a right to eighty times more road space than a car with one[MASK] <unk> we have been so used to[MASK] inequality sometimes that it 's before our noses and we do not see it less than one hundred years ago[MASK] <unk> could not vote <unk> and it seemed normal in the same way that it seems normal today[MASK] to see a bus in traffic <unk> in fact <unk> when i became mayor <unk> applying that democratic principle[MASK] that public good prevails over private interest that a bus with one hundred people has a right to one hundred times more road space than a car <unk> we implemented a mass[MASK] <unk> transit system[MASK] based on buses in exclusive lanes we called it transmilenio in order to make buses sexier <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol because as buses zoom by [MASK] expensive cars stuck in traffic[MASK] <unk> it clearly is almost a picture[MASK] of democracy at work[MASK] in fact it 's not just a matter of equity <unk> [MASK] it doesn 't take ph d ' s [MASK] a committee of 12 year old children would find out in twenty minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses [MASK] in fact <unk> [MASK] <unk> but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities [MASK] they also have great capacity for example <unk> this system in guangzhou[MASK] is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in china <unk> except for one line[MASK] <unk> at a fraction of the cost <unk> we fought not just for space for buses but we fought for space[MASK] for people and that was even more difficult cities are human habitats <unk> and we[MASK] humans are pedestrians [MASK] just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run <unk> we need to walk there is a really[MASK] enormous conflict when we are talking[MASK] <unk> country cities between pedestrians and cars here what you see is a picture that shows[MASK] insufficient democracy what this shows[MASK] is that people who walk[MASK] are <unk> third class citizens while those who go in cars are first class citizens [MASK] in terms of transport infrastructure <unk> what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities[MASK] is not highways or subways[MASK] but quality sidewalks here they made a flyover probably very useless <unk> and they forgot to make a sidewalk [MASK] this is prevailing all over the world not even schoolchildren are more important than cars [MASK] in my city of bogot we[MASK] fought a very difficult battle[MASK] in order to take space from cars which had been parking on[MASK] <unk> sidewalks for decades <unk> in order to make space for people that should reflect[MASK] dignity of human beings and to make space for protected bikeways first of all i had black hair before that [MASK] and i was almost impeached in the process <unk> it is a very difficult battle <unk> however[MASK] <unk> after very difficult battles to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars <unk> [MASK] indeed a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city [MASK] which is road space a city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space how to distribute it between pedestrians[MASK] bicycles <unk> public transport and cars <unk> [MASK] this is not a technological issue <unk> and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right[MASK] when we make that distribution <unk> [MASK] we also built <unk> [MASK] and this was fifteen years ago before there were <unk> bikeways in new york or in paris or in london it was a very difficult battle as well <unk> [MASK] more than three hundred[MASK] <unk> fifty kilometers of protected bicycle ways <unk> [MASK] i don 't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature [MASK] they are a right just as sidewalks are unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle[MASK] have a right to safe mobility without the risk of getting killed [MASK] <unk> also are a powerful symbol of democracy because they show that a citizen on a $ thirty bicycle[MASK] is equally important[MASK] to one in a $ thirty thousand car <unk> [MASK] and we are living in a unique moment in history in the next fifty years [MASK] more than half of those cities which will exist in the year two thousand and sixty will be built[MASK] <unk> in many developing country cities more than eighty and ninety percent of the city which will exist[MASK] in two thousand and and sixty will be built over the next four or five decades but this is not just a matter for developing country cities [MASK] in the united states for example more than seventy million new homes must be built over the next forty or fifty years that 's more than all the homes that today exist[MASK] in britain france[MASK] and canada put together <unk> [MASK] and i believe that our cities today have severe flaws <unk> and that different better ones could be built <unk> [MASK] what is wrong with our cities today <unk> well <unk> [MASK] for example if we tell any <unk> three year old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world[MASK] the child will jump in fright <unk> [MASK] and with a very good reason because there are more than ten thousand children who are killed by cars every year in the world <unk> [MASK] we have had cities for eight thousand years <unk> and children could walk out of home and play <unk> in fact only very recently[MASK] <unk> nine hundred there were no cars cars have been here for[MASK] really less than one hundred years they completely changed cities in one thousand nine hundred for example nobody was killed by cars[MASK] in the united states only twenty years later between one thousand nine hundred and twenty and one thousand nine hundred and thirty [MASK] almost two hundred thousand people were killed by cars in the united states only[MASK] <unk> almost seven thousand children were killed by cars in the united states <unk> so we could make[MASK] different cities cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars that will give more public space to human beings than to cars <unk> [MASK] cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens such as children or[MASK] <unk> the elderly i will propose to you[MASK] a couple of ingredients which i think would make cities[MASK] much better and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created <unk> [MASK] hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss crossing cities in all directions [MASK] children will walk out of homes into safe spaces they could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways <unk> sort of bicycle highways[MASK] and i would invite you to imagine the following a city in which every other street[MASK] would be a street only for pedestrians[MASK] and bicycles in new cities which are going to be built this would not be particularly difficult <unk> when[MASK] i was mayor of bogot in only three years <unk> we were able to create seventy kilometers[MASK] <unk> in one of the most dense cities in the world of these bicycle highways <unk> [MASK] and this changes the way people live <unk> [MASK] move <unk> enjoy the city [MASK] in this picture you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods <unk> we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street <unk> and the cars still in the mud [MASK] of course[MASK] <unk> i would love to pave this street for cars but what do we do first ninety nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don 't have cars <unk> [MASK] but you see when a city is only being created it 's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure <unk> [MASK] then the city grows around it <unk> [MASK] and of course this is just a glimpse[MASK] of something which could be much better[MASK] if we just create it and it changes the way of life and the second ingredient <unk> which would solve mobility[MASK] <unk> that very difficult challenge in developing countries in a very <unk> low cost and simple way would be to have[MASK] hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses buses and[MASK] bicycles and pedestrians <unk> this would be again a very <unk> low cost solution if implemented from the start[MASK] <unk> not as good as my dreams <unk> because of private property of land[MASK] and high land prices [MASK] all developing country cities have a large problem of slums in my country of colombia almost half the homes in cities initially[MASK] were illegal developments[MASK] and of course it 's very difficult[MASK] to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments <unk> [MASK] but even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places very far from the city centers where it 's impossible to provide[MASK] <unk> recently organized region in the world <unk> i would recommend respectfully <unk> passionately to those[MASK] countries which are yet to urbanize latin america went from forty percent urban in one thousand nine hundred and fifty to[MASK] eighty percent urban in two thousand and ten[MASK] i would recommend asian[MASK] <unk> and african countries[MASK] which are yet to urbanize such as india which is only thirty three percent urban now[MASK] that governments should acquire all land around cities in this way their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces with the parks with the greenways with the busways [MASK] the cities we are going to build over the next fifty years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the[MASK] <unk> future <unk> what a fantastic opportunity for leaders[MASK] and many young leaders to come <unk> especially in the developing countries <unk> [MASK] they can create a much happier life for billions towards the future <unk> i am sure i am optimistic that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams[MASK]
