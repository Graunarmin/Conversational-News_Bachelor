 <unk> good morning i 'm here today to talk about autonomous flying[MASK] beach balls no agile aerial robots like this one i 'd like to tell you a little bit about the[MASK] <unk> challenges in building these and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology <unk> so these robots are related to[MASK] unmanned aerial vehicles [MASK] however the vehicles you see here are big <unk> they weigh thousands of pounds are not by any means agile <unk> they 're not even autonomous [MASK] <unk> many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews[MASK] that can include multiple pilots <unk> operators of sensors [MASK] and mission coordinators [MASK] what we 're interested in is developing robots like this and here are two other pictures of robots that you can buy off the shelf <unk> [MASK] so these are helicopters with four rotors <unk> [MASK] and they 're roughly a meter or so in scale <unk> and weigh several pounds <unk> and so we retrofit these with sensors and processors[MASK] and these robots can fly indoors <unk> without gps <unk> the robot i 'm holding in my hand is this one [MASK] and it 's been created by two students <unk> alex and daniel <unk> [MASK] so this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound <unk> it consumes about fifteen watts of power and as you can see it 's about eight inches in diameter <unk> [MASK] so let me give you just a very quick[MASK] tutorial on how these robots work <unk> so it has four rotors if you spin these rotors at the same speed the robot hovers <unk> [MASK] if you increase the speed of each of these rotors [MASK] then the robot flies up <unk> it accelerates up of course if the robot were tilted <unk> inclined to the horizontal then it would accelerate in this[MASK] <unk> to get it to tilt there 's one of two ways of doing it [MASK] so in this picture you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower and when that happens [MASK] there 's a moment that causes this robot to roll <unk> [MASK] and the other way around if you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one then the robot pitches forward <unk> [MASK] and then finally <unk> if you spin opposite pairs of rotors[MASK] <unk> than the other pair <unk> then the robot yaws about the vertical axis <unk> [MASK] so an on board processor essentially looks at what motions need to be executed and combines these motions <unk> [MASK] and figures out what commands to send to the motors six hundred times a second <unk> that 's basically how this thing operates <unk> [MASK] so one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down the robot naturally becomes agile[MASK] <unk> so here r is the characteristic length of the robot it 's actually half the diameter <unk> [MASK] and there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce r [MASK] the one that 's most important is the inertia or the resistance to motion <unk> so it turns out the inertia <unk> which governs angular[MASK] <unk> scales as a fifth power of r so the smaller you make r <unk> the more dramatically the inertia reduces <unk> [MASK] so as a result the angular acceleration <unk> [MASK] denoted by the greek letter alpha here <unk> goes as one over r it 's inversely proportional to r the smaller you make it the more quickly you can turn <unk> [MASK] so this should be clear in these videos on the bottom right you see a robot[MASK] performing a[MASK] <unk> flips a little more time <unk> [MASK] so here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board and calculating like i said before commands at six hundred times a second to stabilize this robot <unk> [MASK] so on the left you see daniel throwing this robot up into the air <unk> and it shows you how robust the control is no matter how you throw it the robot recovers[MASK] and comes back to him[MASK] <unk> so why build robots like this well robots like this have many applications you can send them inside buildings like this as first responders[MASK] to look for intruders <unk> maybe look for biochemical leaks <unk> gaseous leaks <unk> you can also use them for applications like[MASK] <unk> tell you a little bit more about this the robots can be used for transporting cargo <unk> so one of the problems with these small robots[MASK] is their <unk> payload carrying capacity <unk> so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads [MASK] this is a picture of a recent experiment we did actually not so recent anymore in sendai <unk> shortly after the earthquake so[MASK] <unk> robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings to assess the damage after natural disasters or sent into reactor buildings to map radiation levels[MASK] so one fundamental problem that the robots have to solve if they are to be autonomous is essentially figuring out how to get from point a to point <unk> b [MASK] so this gets a little challenging because the dynamics of this robot are quite[MASK] <unk> complicated in fact they live in a <unk> 12 dimensional space <unk> so we use a little trick we take this curved 12 dimensional space <unk> [MASK] and transform it into a flat four dimensional space and that four dimensional space consists of x y z and then the yaw angle <unk> and so what the robot does is it plans what we call[MASK] <unk> so to remind you of physics you have position derivative velocity <unk> then acceleration <unk> [MASK] and then comes jerk <unk> [MASK] and then comes snap <unk> so this robot minimizes snap <unk> [MASK] so what that effectively does is produce a smooth and graceful motion <unk> and it does that avoiding obstacles <unk> [MASK] so these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated[MASK] <unk> which the robot must do for control and then execution <unk> [MASK] so let me show you some examples of what these minimum snap trajectories look like <unk> and in the first video you 'll see the robot going from point a to point b through an intermediate point <unk>[MASK] <unk> the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory so these are circular trajectories where the robot pulls about two g 's [MASK] here you have overhead[MASK] motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is one hundred times a second <unk> it also tells the robot where these obstacles are <unk> [MASK] and the obstacles can be moving and here you 'll see daniel throw this hoop into the air <unk> while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop[MASK] so as an academic we 're always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs <unk> and we get our robots to do that [MASK] so another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it[MASK] <unk> so here you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum and then changes its orientation and then recovers <unk> [MASK] so it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot <unk> [MASK] so just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum <unk> and then does this pirouette this two and a half[MASK] somersault through and then gracefully recovers this robot is basically doing that so it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks <unk> [MASK] so i want change gears so one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size <unk> [MASK] and i told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size <unk> [MASK] so one difficulty[MASK] is how do you coordinate lots of these robots <unk> and so here we looked to nature[MASK] so i want to show you a clip of[MASK] aphaenogaster desert ants in professor stephen pratt 's lab <unk> [MASK] carrying an object so this is actually a piece of fig actually you take any object coated with fig juice and the ants will carry it back to the nest[MASK] <unk> so these ants don 't have any central coordinator [MASK] they sense their neighbors there 's no explicit communication <unk> but because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object[MASK] <unk> they have implicit coordination across the group <unk> [MASK] so this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have so when we have a robot[MASK] which is surrounded by neighbors and let 's look at robot i and robot j what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly[MASK] <unk> and then you want to make sure that this separation is within acceptable levels <unk> so again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands one <unk>[MASK] <unk> hundred times a second <unk> which then translates into motor commands six hundred times a second <unk> so this also has to be done in a decentralized way [MASK] their actions only on local information what they sense from their neighbors [MASK] and then finally we insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are <unk> so this is what we call anonymity <unk> [MASK] so what i want to show you next[MASK] is a video of twenty of these little robots flying in formation <unk> they 're monitoring their neighbors[MASK] <unk> neighbors ' positions they 're maintaining formation the formations can change <unk> they can be planar formations they can be three dimensional formations [MASK] as you can see here <unk> they collapse from a three dimensional formation into planar formation <unk> [MASK] and to fly through obstacles they can adapt the formations on the fly <unk> [MASK] so again these robots come really close together as you can see in this[MASK] <unk> come within inches of each other [MASK] and despite the aerodynamic interactions with these propeller blades <unk> they 're able to maintain stable flight [MASK] so once you know how to fly in formation you can actually pick up objects cooperatively so this just shows that we can double triple[MASK] <unk> robots ' strength by just getting them to team with neighbors as you can see here [MASK] one of the disadvantages of doing that is as you scale things up so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing <unk>[MASK] increasing the inertia <unk> and therefore you pay a price <unk> they 're not as agile <unk> [MASK] but you do gain in terms of payload carrying capacity <unk> another application i want to show you again this is in our lab this is work done by quentin lindsey[MASK] <unk> a graduate student <unk> so his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build[MASK] cubic structures[MASK] from truss like elements <unk> so his algorithm tells the robot[MASK] what part to pick up when and where to place it so in this video you see and it 's sped up ten fourteen[MASK] <unk> you see three different structures being built by these robots and again everything is autonomous <unk> and all quentin has to do is to give them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build [MASK] so all these experiments you 've seen thus far all these demonstrations have been done with the help of motion capture systems[MASK] <unk> so what happens when you leave[MASK] your lab and you go outside into the real world and what if there 's no gps <unk> so this[MASK] <unk> robot is actually equipped with a camera and a laser rangefinder laser scanner <unk> [MASK] and it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment what that map consists of are features like doorways <unk> windows <unk> people <unk> furniture and it then figures out where its position[MASK] with respect to the features so there is no global coordinate system <unk> the coordinate system is defined based on the robot where it is and what it 's looking at [MASK] and it navigates with respect to those features <unk> [MASK] so i want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by frank shen and professor nathan michael [MASK] that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time <unk> and creating this map on the fly <unk> [MASK] so the robot then figures out what the features are it builds the map it figures out[MASK] <unk> where it is with respect to the features <unk> [MASK] and then estimates its position one hundred times a second <unk> allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier <unk> [MASK] so this robot is actually being commanded remotely by frank [MASK] but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own <unk> [MASK] so suppose i were to send this into a building and i had no idea what this building looked like i can ask this robot to go in[MASK] <unk> create a map <unk> [MASK] and then come back and tell me what the building looks like <unk> [MASK] so here the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point a to point b in this map <unk> but it 's figuring out what the best point b is at every time <unk>[MASK] <unk> so essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information and that 's how it populates this map <unk> [MASK] <unk> application <unk> [MASK] and there are many applications of this technology <unk> [MASK] i 'm a professor and we 're passionate about education robots like this can really change the way we do k 12 education <unk> [MASK] but we 're in southern california <unk> close to los angeles <unk> [MASK] so i have to conclude with something focused on entertainment [MASK] i want to conclude with a music video i want to introduce the creators <unk> alex and daniel <unk> who created this video[MASK] so before i play this video i want to tell you that they created it in the last three days [MASK] after getting a call from chris <unk> [MASK] and the robots that play in the video are completely autonomous <unk> you will see nine robots play six different instruments <unk> [MASK] and of course it 's made exclusively for ted two thousand and twelve[MASK] <unk> twelve let 's watch[MASK] <unk> live[MASK] <unk> watch[MASK]
