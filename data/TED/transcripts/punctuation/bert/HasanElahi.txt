 <unk> and usually when i tell people i 'm an artist they[MASK] just look at me and say do you paint or what kind of medium do you work in well most of my work that i work with is really a[MASK] little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually[MASK] a specific[MASK] <unk> discipline or a specific technique <unk> [MASK] so what i 'm really interested in is creative problem solving <unk> and i had a little bit of a problem a few years ago so let me show you a little of that[MASK] <unk> so it started over here and this is the detroit airport in june 19th of two thousand and two [MASK] i was flying back to the u s from an exhibition overseas and as i was coming back well i was taken by the fbi met by an fbi agent and[MASK] <unk> into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions where were you what were you doing who were you talking with why were you there <unk> who pays for your trips all these little details <unk> and then literally just out of nowhere the guy asks me where were you september 12th [MASK] and when most of us get asked where were you september 12th or any date for that fact it 's like i don 't exactly[MASK] <unk> we read about six months of my calendar <unk> and i don 't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records[MASK] good thing i did because i don 't look good in orange [MASK] so he asked me [MASK] so this storage unit that you paid the rent on what did you have in it[MASK] this was in tampa florida so i was like winter clothes that i have no use for in florida[MASK] <unk> pretty certain there were no explosives and if there were i would have remembered that one and[MASK] he 's still a little confused but i think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes i 'm not exactly a terrorist threat and[MASK] so we 're sitting there and eventually after about an[MASK] <unk> hour hour and a half of just going back and forth he says okay i have enough information here <unk> i 'm going to pass this onto the tampa office they 're the ones who initiated this they 'll follow up with you and we 'll take care of it i was like great [MASK] so i got home and the phone rings and a[MASK] man introduced himself basically[MASK] this is the fbi offices in tampa where i spent six months of my life back and forth not six months continuously by the way you folks know that in the united states you can 't take[MASK] <unk> photographs of federal buildings <unk> but google can do it for you so to the folks from google thank you [MASK] so[MASK] i spent a lot of time in this building <unk> questions like [MASK] have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the united states or a foreign nation and you[MASK] also have to consider the state of mind you 're in when you 're doing this[MASK] <unk> someone that essentially decides life or death [MASK] or questions such as actually during the polygraph which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them one of the polygraph questions was [MASK] well the first one was is your name hasan yes are we in florida yes is today tuesday yes because you have to[MASK] base it on a yes or no then of course the next question is do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states i work at a university[MASK] so i was like maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly but they said okay aside from what we had discussed [MASK] do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states <unk>[MASK] the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs they said hey everything 's fine i was like i[MASK] <unk> i travel a lot this is with the fbi <unk> and i was like all we need is alaska not to get the last memo and here we go all over again and[MASK] there was a sincere concern there and he was like you know if you get into trouble give us a call we 'll take care of it so ever since then before i would go anywhere i would call the fbi i would[MASK] tell them hey guys this is where i 'm going this is my flight <unk> northwest flight seven coming into seattle on march[MASK] <unk> or whatever a[MASK] couple weeks later i 'd call again <unk> let them know it wasn 't that i had to but i chose to [MASK] just wanted to say hey guys don 't want to make it look like i 'm making any sudden moves [MASK] i don 't want you guys to think that i 'm about to flee just letting you know heads up [MASK] and so i just kept doing this over and over and over and then the phone calls turned into emails and the emails got longer and longer and longer with pictures[MASK] <unk> with[MASK] travel tips then i 'd make websites and then i built this over here let me go back to it over here so[MASK] i actually designed this back in two thousand and three so this kind of tracks me at any given moment i wrote some code for my mobile phone basically what i decided is[MASK] okay guys you want to watch me that 's cool <unk> but i 'll watch myself it 's okay you don 't have to waste your energy or your resources <unk> and[MASK] i 'll help you out so in the process[MASK] <unk> start thinking well what else might they know about me well they probably have all my flight records so i decided to put all my flight records from birth[MASK] online <unk> so you can see delta one thousand two hundred and fifty two going from[MASK] kansas city to atlanta <unk> and then you see these are some of the meals that i 've been fed on the planes [MASK] <unk> nineteen going from jfk[MASK] to san francisco [MASK] see that they won 't let me on a plane with that but they 'll give it to me on the plane [MASK] these are the airports that i hang out in because i like[MASK] <unk> but if you can <unk> cross reference this with the other data then you 're basically replaying the roll of the fbi agent and putting it all together <unk> and when you 're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence you 're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner [MASK] at the time that this was going on the last thing on my mind was art project [MASK] i was certainly not thinking hey i got new[MASK] <unk> going through this after realizing well what just happened and after piecing together this this and this <unk> [MASK] this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this and it actually became this project <unk>[MASK] <unk> so these are the stores that i shop in[MASK] some of them because they need to know <unk> this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch ninety nine in daly city on sunday november 15th [MASK] at coreana supermarket buying my kimchi because i like kimchi <unk> and i bought some crabs too[MASK] right around there <unk> and some chitlins at the safeway in emoryville and laundry too laundry detergent at west oakland[MASK] east oakland sorry and then my[MASK] pickled[MASK] jellyfish at the hong kong supermarket on route eighteen in east brunswick now if you go to my bank records it 'll actually show something from there so you know that on may 9th that i bought $ fourteen[MASK] <unk> in fuel from safeway vallejo <unk> [MASK] so not only that i 'm giving this information here and there <unk> but now there 's a third party an independent third party my bank that 's verifying that yes indeed i was there at this time <unk> so there 's points and these points are actually being cross referenced [MASK] and there 's a verification taking place sometimes they 're really small purchases [MASK] so thirty four cents foreign transaction fee all of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts and everything pops up right away[MASK] sometimes there 's a lot of information <unk> this is[MASK] <unk> exactly where my old apartment in san francisco was <unk> and then sometimes you get this <unk> sometimes you just get this just an empty hallway in salt lake city january 22nd and[MASK] i can tell you exactly who i was with where i was because this is what i had to do with the fbi i had to tell them every little detail of everything [MASK] i spend a lot of time on the road this is a parking lot in elko nevada[MASK] <unk> gas stations too empty train stations so there 's multiple databases and there 's thousands and thousands and thousands of images there 's actually forty six thousand images right now on my site <unk> [MASK] and the fbi has seen all of them at least i trust they 've seen all of them <unk> [MASK] and then sometimes you don 't get much information at all you just get this empty bed [MASK] <unk> and sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information so you get something like this this by the way is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in california vietnamese sandwich <unk> [MASK] so there 's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations empty gas stations these are some of the meals that i 've been cooking at home <unk> [MASK] so how do you know these are meals eaten at home well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times <unk> [MASK] so again you have to do some[MASK] <unk> sometimes the databases get so specific these are all tacos eaten in mexico city near a train station[MASK] on july fifth to july sixth [MASK] at eleven thirty nine a m was this one at one fifty six p m was this one at four fifty nine p m was this one so i time stamp my life every few moments every few moments[MASK] i shoot the image now it 's all done on my iphone <unk> and it all goes straight up to my server and my server does all the backend work and[MASK] categorizes things and puts everything together[MASK] they need to know where i 'm doing my business <unk> because they want to know about my business so on december 4th i went here [MASK] and on sunday june 14th at two thousand and nine this was actually about two o 'clock in the afternoon in skowhegan maine this was my apartment there <unk> so what you 're basically seeing here[MASK] is all bits and pieces[MASK] <unk> all this information if you go to my site there 's tons of things and really it 's not the most user friendly interface it 's actually quite user unfriendly [MASK] and one of the reasons also being part of the user unfriendliness is that everything is there but you have to really work through it so by me putting all this information out there <unk> [MASK] what i 'm basically telling you is i 'm telling you everything but in this barrage of noise that i 'm putting out i actually live an incredibly anonymous and[MASK] <unk> private life [MASK] and you know very little about me actually <unk> [MASK] and really so i 've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded there 's no need to delete information anymore <unk> [MASK] so what do you do when everything is out there well you have to take control over it[MASK] <unk> directly <unk> it 's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces the other thing that 's also interesting that 's going on here[MASK] is the fact that intelligence agencies and it doesn 't matter who they are[MASK] they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information or restricted access to information[MASK] <unk> the reason their information has any value[MASK] is well because no one else has access to it and by me[MASK] cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you [MASK] the information that the fbi has has no value <unk> [MASK] so thus devaluing their currency <unk> and i understand that on an individual level it 's purely symbolic <unk> [MASK] but if three hundred million people in the u s started doing this <unk> we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up[MASK] <unk> wouldn 't work if everybody was sharing everything and we 're getting to that when i first started this project people[MASK] were looking at me and saying why would you want to tell everybody what you 're doing where you 're at why are you posting these photos [MASK] this was an age before people were tweeting everywhere and[MASK] seven hundred and fifty million people[MASK] <unk> glad that i 'm completely obsolete <unk> [MASK] i 'm still doing this project but it is obsolete because you 're all doing it this is something that we all are doing on a daily basis whether we 're aware of it or not [MASK] so we 're creating our own archives and so on [MASK] and you know <unk> some of my friends have always said hey you 're just paranoid <unk> why are you doing this because no one 's really watching no one 's really going to[MASK] bother you [MASK] so one of the things that i do is i actually look[MASK] <unk> my server logs very carefully because it 's about surveillance i 'm watching who 's watching me and[MASK] i came up with these so these are some of my sample logs and just little bits and pieces and you can see some of the things there <unk> [MASK] and i cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see <unk> so you can see that the homeland security likes to come by[MASK] <unk> you can see the national security agency likes to come by i actually moved very close to them i live right down the street from them now [MASK] central intelligence agency <unk> executive office of the president [MASK] not really sure why they show up but they do i think[MASK] they kind of like to look at art and i 'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields <unk> so thank you very much[MASK] <unk> it 's no different than[MASK] <unk> sending a text it 's no different than checking an email <unk> [MASK] it 's one of those things we got by just fine before we had to do any of those so it 's just become another day i mean when we update a status message we don 't really think about how long that 's going to take [MASK] so it 's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks send and then it 's done and everything 's automated at the other end bg on the day[MASK] you are in a place where there is no coverage the fbi gets crazy he well it goes to the last point that i was at <unk> so[MASK] it holds onto the very last point <unk>[MASK] <unk> flight you 'll see the last airport that i departed from[MASK]
