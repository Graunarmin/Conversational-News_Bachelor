 <unk> in an age of[MASK] global strife and climate change <unk> i 'm here to answer the all important question why is sex so damn good if[MASK] you 're laughing you know what i mean now before we get[MASK] <unk> let me tell you about chris hosmer chris is a great friend of mine from my university days but secretly <unk> i hate him here[MASK] 's why back in university we had a quick project to design some solar powered clocks here 's my clock [MASK] it uses something called the dwarf sunflower which grows to about twelve inches in height now as you know <unk> sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day <unk> so in[MASK] <unk> you see which direction the sunflower is facing and you mark it on the blank area in the base at noon you mark the changed position of the sunflower <unk> and in the evening again and that 's your clock [MASK] now i know my clock doesn 't tell you the exact time <unk> but it does give you a general idea using a flower so in my completely unbiased subjective opinion it 's brilliant[MASK] <unk> however <unk> here 's chris 's clock[MASK] <unk> it 's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one in each shot glass is a different scented oil [MASK] in the morning the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass <unk> focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath [MASK] this will warm up the scented oil inside and a particular smell will be emitted a[MASK] couple of hours later the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass <unk> and a different smell will be emitted <unk> so during the course of the day[MASK] five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment <unk> anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell [MASK] you can see why i hate chris i thought my idea was pretty good but his idea is genius <unk> [MASK] and at the time i knew his idea was better than mine but i just couldn 't explain why one thing you have to know about me is i hate to lose <unk> [MASK] this problem 's been bugging me for well over a decade all[MASK] right let 's get back to the question of why sex[MASK] <unk> is so good <unk> many years after the solar powered clocks project [MASK] a young lady i knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses <unk> and when she said this i had an epiphany <unk> [MASK] so i decided to evaluate different experiences i had in my life from the point of view of the five senses <unk> [MASK] to do this <unk> i devised something called the five senses graph [MASK] along the y axis you have a scale from zero[MASK] <unk> to ten <unk> and along the x axis you have of course <unk> the five senses <unk> [MASK] anytime i had a memorable experience in my life <unk> i would record it on this graph like a five senses diary here[MASK] 's a quick video to show you how it works[MASK] <unk> and that 's how the five senses graph works now for a period of three years i gathered data <unk> not just me but also some of my friends [MASK] <unk> i used to teach in university so i forced my i mean i asked my students to do this as well so here are some other results [MASK] the first is for instant noodles now obviously taste and smell are quite high <unk> but[MASK] notice sound is at three [MASK] many people told me a big part of the noodle eating experience is the slurping noise <unk> you know needless to say i no longer dine with these people[MASK] here what i found interesting was that taste is at four and many respondents told me[MASK] it 's because of the taste of drinks but also in some cases kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience these people i still do hang out with all right [MASK] and smoking <unk> here i found touch is at [ six ] and one of the reasons is that[MASK] <unk> smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience which shows it 's kind of scary to think[MASK] how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers ok [MASK] now what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph it would of course be a horizontal[MASK] <unk> along the top now you can see not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close in fact <unk> [MASK] in the years that i gathered data only one experience came close to being the perfect one that is of course sex [MASK] great sex respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level here[MASK] i 'll quote one of my students who said sex is so good <unk> it 's good even when it 's bad [MASK] so the five senses theory does[MASK] <unk> help explain why sex is so good <unk> [MASK] now in the middle of all this five senses work <unk> [MASK] i suddenly remembered the solar powered clocks project from my youth and i realized this theory also explains why chris 's clock is so much better than mine <unk> [MASK] you see my clock only focuses on sight <unk> and a little bit of touch <unk> [MASK] here 's chris 's clock [MASK] it 's the first clock ever that uses[MASK] <unk> smell to tell the time in fact in terms of the five senses <unk> chris 's clock is a revolution <unk> [MASK] and that 's what this theory taught me about my field you see up till now us designers we 've mainly focused on making things look very pretty <unk> and a little bit of touch <unk> which means we 've ignored the other three senses [MASK] chris 's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product[MASK] so what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs <unk> here 's three quick ideas i came up with [MASK] this is an iron you know [MASK] for your clothes to which i added a spraying mechanism so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent and your clothes will smell nicer but hopefully it should also make the ironing[MASK] <unk> so i brush my teeth twice a day <unk> and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy <unk> [MASK] and when the taste of candy ran out you 'd know it 's time to change your toothbrush [MASK] finally <unk> i have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet it[MASK] 's not just the way they look but i love the way they feel when you press down on them <unk> now <unk> i don 't play the flute or the[MASK] <unk> clarinet <unk> so i decided to combine these keys with an instrument i do play the television remote control [MASK] now when we look at these three ideas together you 'll notice that the five senses theory doesn 't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look <unk> [MASK] so in conclusion i 've found the five senses theory to be a very useful[MASK] <unk> tool in evaluating different experiences in my life and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i realize the five senses isn 't the only thing that makes life interesting [MASK] there 's also the six emotions and that elusive x factor [MASK] maybe that could be the topic of my next talk <unk> until then[MASK] <unk> please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs oh one last thing before i leave <unk> [MASK] here 's the experience you all had while listening to the ted talks however it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste [MASK] and the best way to do that is with[MASK] free candy <unk> you guys ready[MASK]
