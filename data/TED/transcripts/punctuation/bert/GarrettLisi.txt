 <unk> check out those killer equations <unk> sweet [MASK] actually for the next eighteen minutes i 'm going to do the best i can to describe the beauty of particle physics without[MASK] <unk> equations <unk> [MASK] it turns out there 's a lot we can learn from coral [MASK] a coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps [MASK] these polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors [MASK] if we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral <unk> we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question we can ask how exactly he got to be[MASK] in this particular location compared to his neighbors[MASK] if it was just chance <unk> or destiny <unk> or what [MASK] now <unk> after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high <unk> [MASK] he would tell us that our question was completely stupid these corals can be kind of mean you see and i have surfing scars to prove that [MASK] but this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him that he was in all these other locations[MASK] <unk> as well <unk> but experiencing them as separate individuals [MASK] for a coral branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world <unk> [MASK] unlike us a hyperintelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics <unk> [MASK] the mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works <unk> and it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities just like a coral[MASK] it 's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around <unk> since we only ever get to experience one possibility <unk> [MASK] this quantum weirdness was first described by erwin <unk> schrdinger and his cat the cat likes this version better [MASK] in this setup schrdinger is in a box with a radioactive sample[MASK] <unk> by the laws of quantum mechanics <unk> branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not [MASK] in the branch in which the sample radiates <unk> it sets off a trigger that releases poison and schrdinger is dead <unk> but in the other branch of reality he remains alive [MASK] these realities are experienced separately by each individual as far as either can tell the other one doesn 't exist [MASK] seems weird to us because each of us only experiences an individual existence and we don 't get to see other branches <unk> it 's as if each of us like schrdinger here are a kind of coral[MASK] branching into different possibilities <unk> [MASK] the mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales it can be summed up in a single sentence [MASK] everything that can happen does that 's quantum mechanics <unk> but this does not mean everything happens the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can[MASK] what physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles [MASK] and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced [MASK] now i 'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles <unk> what they are and how this balance works [MASK] in this machine a beam of protons and and antiprotons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a[MASK] <unk> collision <unk> producing a burst of pure energy this energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties <unk> [MASK] this enormous machine the large hadron collider at cern in geneva has a circumference of seventeen miles and when it 's operating draws five times as much power as the city of monterey <unk> [MASK] we can 't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision[MASK] <unk> mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized but physics does tell us what particles can be produced [MASK] these particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and antiproton [MASK] any particles more massive than this energy limit aren 't produced and remain invisible to us [MASK] this is why this new particle[MASK] <unk> is so exciting <unk> it 's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what 's ever been done before so we 're going to get to see some new particles very soon <unk> [MASK] but before talking about what we might see let me describe the particles we already know of [MASK] there 's a whole zoo of subatomic particles <unk> most of us are familiar with electrons a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around [MASK] but the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino with no electric charge and a very tiny mass in contrast[MASK] the up and down quarks have very large masses and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms [MASK] all of these matter particles come in left and right handed varieties <unk> and have antiparticle partners that carry opposite charges [MASK] these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations [MASK] which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses [MASK] these matter particles all[MASK] <unk> interact with the various force particles <unk> the electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons [MASK] there is also a very weak force called <unk> rather unimaginatively the weak force [MASK] that interacts only with left handed matter the strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge called color charge[MASK] <unk> and come in three different varieties red green and blue you can blame murray gell mann for these names they 're his fault[MASK] <unk> finally there 's the force of gravity <unk> which interacts with matter via its mass and spin [MASK] the most important thing to understand here is that there 's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces [MASK] these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has [MASK] a particle that hasn 't been seen yet <unk> but we 're pretty sure exists is the higgs particle[MASK] <unk> which gives masses to all these other particles <unk> the main purpose of the large hadron collider is to see this higgs particle and we 're almost certain it will <unk> [MASK] but the greatest mystery is what else we might see <unk> [MASK] and i 'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk now[MASK] if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges there are two hundred and twenty six that 's a lot of particles to keep track[MASK] <unk> of <unk> and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles <unk> [MASK] but if we plot them out according to their charges <unk> some beautiful patterns emerge the[MASK] most familiar charge is electric charge <unk> [MASK] electrons have an electric charge a negative one <unk> and quarks have electric charges in thirds <unk> so when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton it has a total electric charge of plus one[MASK] <unk> these particles also have antiparticles which have opposite charges <unk> now it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges <unk> hypercharge and weak charge <unk> [MASK] if we spread out the <unk> hypercharge and weak charge[MASK] and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space <unk> the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction <unk> [MASK] the electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their[MASK] hypercharge and weak charge which make this pattern <unk> this is called the unified electroweak model and it was put together back in <unk>[MASK] the reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the higgs particle [MASK] the higgs over here on the left has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern <unk> it makes the[MASK] weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass <unk> since this massive higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram <unk> [MASK] the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space <unk> [MASK] so the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space <unk> [MASK] we can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions[MASK] and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions[MASK] the charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four dimensional charge space <unk> and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them [MASK] whenever particles interact nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions <unk> [MASK] if a particle and an antiparticle collide <unk> it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero[MASK] <unk> all four charge directions at this point anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero [MASK] for example this weak force particle and its antiparticle can be created in a collision [MASK] in further interactions the charges must always balance one of the weak particles[MASK] could decay into an electron and an antineutrino and these three still add to zero total charge nature always keeps a perfect[MASK] perfect balance [MASK] so these patterns of charges are not just pretty [MASK] they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen and we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction <unk> [MASK] which has this nice hexagonal symmetry in a strong interaction a strong force particle [MASK] such as this one <unk> interacts with a colored quark such as this green one [MASK] to give a quark with a different color charge[MASK] <unk> strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies <unk> holding the atomic nuclei together <unk> [MASK] but these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story <unk> [MASK] we can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force [MASK] when we include these each matter particle has two different spin charges spin up and spin down [MASK] so they all split and give a nice pattern in[MASK] <unk> we can rotate this pattern in six dimensions and see that it 's quite pretty [MASK] right now <unk> this pattern[MASK] matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles <unk> [MASK] this is what we know for certain <unk> some of these particles are at the very limit of what we 've been able to reach with experiments[MASK] <unk> from this pattern we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales the way the universe works at these tiny scales[MASK] is very beautiful [MASK] but now i 'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don 't know yet <unk> [MASK] we want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada <unk> [MASK] we want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe [MASK] and we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we 'll see when experiments reach higher energies[MASK] so there 's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges [MASK] which is not very symmetric could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken[MASK] similar to how the higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism [MASK] in order to do this we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions <unk> [MASK] when we introduce a new direction[MASK] we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction <unk> and then we can rotate it in with the others [MASK] if we guess wisely <unk> we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions[MASK] as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory[MASK] <unk> when we look at this new unified pattern we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing <unk> [MASK] this is the way theories of unification work a physicist looks for larger more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset [MASK] the larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen [MASK] this unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles <unk> which should act a lot like[MASK] <unk> the weak force only weaker [MASK] now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles <unk> [MASK] the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six dimensional charge space as the first generation [MASK] these particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges [MASK] they sit on top of one another in the standard charge space[MASK] if we work in eight dimensional charge space <unk> then we can[MASK] assign unique new charges to each particle <unk> then we can spin these in eight dimensions[MASK] and see what the whole pattern looks like [MASK] here we can see the second and third generations of matter now <unk> related to the first generation by a symmetry called triality [MASK] this particular pattern of charges[MASK] in eight dimensions[MASK] <unk> is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics it[MASK] 's a pattern of the largest exceptional lie group e8 [MASK] this lie group is a smooth curved shape with two hundred and forty eight dimensions each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape [MASK] one small part of this e8 shape can be used to describe the curved space time of einstein 's general relativity explaining gravity[MASK] together with quantum mechanics <unk> the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales the pattern of this shape[MASK] living in eight dimensional charge space[MASK] is exquisitely beautiful [MASK] and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape [MASK] as we spin it we can see many of the[MASK] <unk> other intricate patterns contained in this one <unk> [MASK] and with a particular rotation <unk> we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis[MASK] and see all the particles at once <unk> [MASK] it 's a very beautiful object and as with any unification we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern <unk> [MASK] there are twenty gaps where new particles should be two of which have been filled by the[MASK] pati salam particles <unk> from their location in this pattern we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the higgs particle but have color charge and interact with the strong force <unk> [MASK] filling in these new particles completes this pattern <unk> giving us the full e8 this e8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots <unk> it 's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in[MASK] <unk> a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable and[MASK] this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new in one thousand six hundred and twenty three galileo wrote this [MASK] nature 's grand book <unk> which stands continually open to our gaze is written in the language of mathematics[MASK] <unk> its characters are triangles <unk> circles and other geometrical figures <unk> without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it [MASK] without these one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth i believe this to be true <unk> [MASK] and i 've tried to follow galileo 's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles <unk> circles and other geometrical figures [MASK] of course <unk> when other physicists and i actually work on this stuff <unk> the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth[MASK] <unk> but it 's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure beautiful geometry [MASK] joined with quantum mechanics this mathematics describes our universe as a growing e8 coral [MASK] with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern <unk> [MASK] and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large hadron collider we may be able to see whether nature[MASK] <unk> nature uses this e8 pattern or a different one <unk> [MASK] this process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in [MASK] if the lhc finds particles that fit this <unk> e8 pattern that will be very very cool [MASK] if the lhc finds new particles but they don 't fit this pattern well that will be very interesting but bad for this e8 theory [MASK] and of course bad for me personally[MASK] now how bad would that be well <unk> pretty bad [MASK] but predicting how nature works is a very risky game <unk> [MASK] this theory and others like it are long shots [MASK] one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won 't end up being true about[MASK] <unk> that 's what doing theoretical physics is like there are a lot of wipeouts in this regard new physics theories are a lot like start up companies [MASK] as with any large investment <unk> it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn 't working out [MASK] but in science if something isn 't working you have to toss it out and try something else [MASK] now the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty[MASK] is to keep balance and perspective in life [MASK] <unk> best i can to live a balanced life [MASK] laughter i try to balance my life equally between physics love and surfing my own three charge directions [MASK] laughter this way even if the physics i work on comes to nothing i still know i 've lived a good life <unk> [MASK] and i try to live in beautiful places for most of the past ten years i 've lived on the island of maui <unk> a very beautiful place now it 's one of the greatest[MASK] <unk> mysteries in the universe to my parents how i managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment i 'm going[MASK] to let you in on that secret <unk> this was a view from my home office on maui <unk> [MASK] and this is another <unk>[MASK] <unk> and you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar <unk> but in slightly different places <unk> that 's because this used to be my home and office on maui [MASK] i 've chosen a very unusual life <unk> [MASK] but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love [MASK] living a nomadic existence has been hard at times but it 's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that i 've been happy with [MASK] it allows me to spend a lot of my[MASK] <unk> time hanging out[MASK] with hyperintelligent coral <unk> but i also greatly enjoy the company of <unk> hyperintelligent people so i 'm very happy to have been invited here to ted <unk> [MASK] thank you very much[MASK] <unk> 's got a few people at least excited is because if you 're right it brings gravity and quantum theory together so are you saying that[MASK] <unk> we should think of the universe at its heart that the smallest things that there are are somehow[MASK] an e8 object of of possibility <unk> i mean is there a scale to it at the smallest scale <unk>[MASK] <unk> right now[MASK] the pattern i showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics[MASK] that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape <unk> and that 's the one that i said we knew for certain and that shape has remarkable similarities[MASK] <unk> and the way it fits into this e8 pattern <unk> which could be the rest of the picture <unk> [MASK] and these patterns of of points that i 've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this <unk> high dimensional object[MASK] that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience and that that would would be what explains all these[MASK] <unk> in terms of much smaller strings vibrating i know you don 't like string theory[MASK] vibrating inside it[MASK] how should we think of an electron[MASK] in relation to e8 gl well <unk> it would be one of the symmetries of this e8 shape <unk> [MASK] so what 's happening is as the shape is moving over space time it 's twisting [MASK] and the direction it 's twisting as it moves is what particle we see[MASK] <unk> it would be ca the size of the e8 shape how does that relate to the electron i feel like i need that for my picture is it bigger is it smaller gl as far as we know electrons are point particles[MASK] so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales <unk> so the way these things are explained in quantum field theory[MASK] is all possibilities are expanding and developing at once and this is why i use the analogy to coral and[MASK] in this[MASK] <unk> way [MASK] the way that e8 comes in is it will be as a shape that 's attached at each point in the space time [MASK] and as i said the way the shape twists the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface[MASK] is what the elementary particles are themselves[MASK] <unk> it doesn 't really matter[MASK] it 's evoking a kind of sense of wonder and i certainly want to understand more of this but thank you so much for coming that was absolutely fascinating[MASK]
