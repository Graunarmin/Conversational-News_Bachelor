 <unk> my colleagues and i are fascinated by the science of moving dots <unk> [MASK] so what are these dots <unk> well it 's all of us and we 're moving in our homes in our offices <unk> as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world [MASK] and wouldn 't it be great if we could understand all[MASK] <unk> this movement if we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it [MASK] and luckily for us we live in a time where we 're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves <unk> so whether it 's through sensors or videos <unk> or apps <unk> we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail [MASK] so it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement[MASK] is sports[MASK] <unk> whether it 's basketball or baseball or football or the other football we 're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second <unk> [MASK] so what we 're doing[MASK] is turning our athletes into[MASK] you probably guessed it moving dots <unk> so we 've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data <unk> it 's hard to deal with and[MASK] <unk> that interesting [MASK] but there are things that for example basketball coaches want to know [MASK] and the problem is they can 't know them because they 'd have to watch every second of every game remember it and process it and a person can 't do that [MASK] but a machine can the problem is a machine can 't see the game with the eye of a coach at least they[MASK] <unk> what have we taught the machine to see <unk> [MASK] so we started simply we taught it things like passes shots and rebounds things that most casual fans would know [MASK] and then we moved on to things slightly more complicated <unk> events like post ups and[MASK] and if you don 't know them that 's okay most casual players probably do[MASK] <unk> we 've gotten to a point where today <unk> [MASK] the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins <unk> basically things only professionals know <unk> [MASK] so we have taught a machine[MASK] to see[MASK] with the eyes of a coach <unk> [MASK] so how have we been able to do this if i asked a coach to describe something like a pick and roll they would give me a description and if i encoded that as[MASK] <unk> happens to be this dance in basketball[MASK] between four players two on offense and two on defense <unk> and here 's kind of how it goes <unk> so there 's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball <unk>[MASK] and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens and ta da it 's a pick and roll [MASK] so that is also an example of a terrible algorithm <unk> so if the player who 's the[MASK] <unk> called the screener[MASK] goes close by but he doesn 't stop <unk> it 's probably not a pick and roll [MASK] or if he does stop but he doesn 't stop close enough <unk> it 's probably not a pick and roll [MASK] or if he does go close by and he does stop but they do it under the basket <unk> it 's probably not a pick and roll or i could be[MASK] <unk> really depends on the exact timing the distances the locations <unk> and that 's what makes it hard [MASK] so luckily with machine learning we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know <unk> [MASK] so how does this work well it 's by example <unk> so we go to the machine and say good morning machine [MASK] here are some pick and rolls and here are some things that are not <unk> please[MASK] find a way to tell the difference [MASK] and the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate so if i was going to teach it the difference between an apple and and orange i might say why don 't you use color or shape [MASK] and the problem that we 're solving is what are those things what are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots <unk> [MASK] so figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location distance timing[MASK] <unk> that 's really the key to the science of moving dots or[MASK] as we like to call it spatiotemporal pattern recognition in academic vernacular because the first thing is you have to make it sound hard[MASK] because it is [MASK] the key thing is for nba coaches it 's not that they want to know whether a pick and roll happened or not it 's that they want to know how it happened and why is it so important to them [MASK] so here 's a little insight it turns out[MASK] <unk> is perhaps the most important play [MASK] and knowing how to run it and knowing how to defend it is basically a key to winning and losing most games <unk> so it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying <unk>[MASK] <unk> the variations is really the thing that matters <unk> and that 's why we need this to be really really good [MASK] <unk> either roll[MASK] or pop the guy guarding the ball can either go over or under <unk> his teammate can either show or play up to touch or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and i didn 't know most of these things when i started[MASK] and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows it would make our lives a lot[MASK] <unk> but it turns out movement is very very messy people wiggle a lot[MASK] and getting these variations identified with very very high accuracy both in precision and recall is tough because that 's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you [MASK] and despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations [MASK] we 're at the point where almost every single contender for an nba championship this year is[MASK] <unk> using our software <unk> which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball so[MASK] not only that we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams[MASK] win very important games <unk> and it 's very exciting because you have coaches who 've been in the league for thirty years that are willing to take advice from a machine [MASK] and it 's very exciting it 's much more than the[MASK] our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things frankly i don 't understand[MASK] much of what it does and while it 's not that special to to be smarter than me <unk> [MASK] we were wondering can a machine know more than a coach can it know more than person could know and it turns out the answer is[MASK] <unk> coaches want players to take good shots <unk> so if i 'm standing near the basket and there 's nobody near me it 's a good shot if i 'm standing far away surrounded by defenders that 's generally a bad shot <unk> [MASK] but we never knew how good good was or how bad bad was quantitatively until now <unk> [MASK] so what we can do again using spatiotemporal features we looked at every shot <unk> we can see where is the shot what 's the angle to the basket[MASK] <unk> the defenders standing what are their distances what are their angles for multiple defenders <unk> we can look at how the player 's moving and[MASK] predict the shot type <unk> we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances <unk>[MASK] so why is this important <unk> [MASK] we can take something[MASK] that was shooting <unk> which was one thing before <unk> and turn it into two things the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter <unk> so here 's a bubble chart because[MASK] what 's what 's ted without a bubble chart laughter[MASK] those are nba players the size is the size of the player and the color is the position on the x axis we have the shot probability <unk> people on the left take difficult shots on the right they take easy shots[MASK] on the [ y axis ] is their shooting ability <unk> people who are good are at the top bad at the bottom so for example <unk> if there was a player who generally made forty seven percent of their shots that 's all you knew before <unk> [MASK] <unk> i can tell you[MASK] that player takes shots that an average nba player would make forty nine percent of the time [MASK] and they are two percent worse <unk> and the reason that 's important is that there are lots of 47s out there [MASK] and so it 's really important to know if the forty seven that you 're considering giving one hundred million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes[MASK] <unk> good shots [MASK] machine understanding doesn 't just change how we look at players <unk> it changes how we look at the game <unk> [MASK] so there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago in the nba finals miami was down by three[MASK] there was twenty seconds left they were about to lose the championship a gentleman named lebron james came up and he took a three to tie he[MASK] <unk> his teammate chris bosh got a rebound <unk> passed it to another teammate named ray allen he sank a three <unk> it went into overtime they won the game they won the championship it was one of the most exciting games in basketball [MASK] and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment[MASK] in a way[MASK] that we never could before now[MASK] <unk> i can 't show you that video but for you we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about three weeks ago [MASK] laughter and we recreated the tracking that led to the insights so here is us this is chinatown[MASK] in los angeles a park we play at every week and that 's us recreating the ray allen moment and all the tracking that 's[MASK] <unk> associated with it so here 's the shot i 'm going to show you that moment[MASK] and all the insights of that moment [MASK] the only difference is instead of the professional players <unk> it 's us <unk> and instead of a professional announcer <unk> it 's me <unk> so <unk> bear with me <unk> [MASK] miami down three twenty seconds left[MASK] <unk> jeff brings up the[MASK] <unk> that moment[MASK] had about a nine percent chance of happening in the nba and we know that and a great many other things i 'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to to make that happen[MASK] <unk> the important thing about that video[MASK] and the insights we have for every second of every nba game it 's not that it 's the fact you don 't have to be a professional team to track movement [MASK] you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement in fact it doesn 't even have to be about sports because we 're moving everywhere [MASK] we 're moving[MASK] in our homes[MASK] <unk> in our offices <unk> as we shop and we travel[MASK] throughout our cities[MASK] and around[MASK] our world [MASK] what will we know what will we learn [MASK] perhaps instead of identifying pick and rolls a machine can identify the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps[MASK] <unk> which could literally be happening any second now <unk> perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings better plan our cities i believe[MASK] that with the development of the science of moving dots <unk> we will move better <unk> we will move smarter <unk> we will move forward <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
