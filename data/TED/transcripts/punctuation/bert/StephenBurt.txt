 <unk> all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because i 'm a word person i understand the world[MASK] best most fully in words rather than say pictures or numbers and when i have a new experience or a new[MASK] <unk> feeling i 'm a little frustrated until i can try to put it into words i think i 've always been that way i devoured science fiction as a child i still do <unk> [MASK] <unk> and i found poems by andrew marvell and matthew arnold and emily dickinson and william butler yeats because they were quoted in science fiction and i loved their sounds and i went on[MASK] <unk> all that other technical stuff that you care about if you already care about poems because poems already made me happier and sadder <unk>[MASK] <unk> and more alive and i became a poetry critic because i wanted to know how and why [MASK] <unk> programming serve one purpose the greek word poem it just means a made thing and poetry is a set of techniques ways of making patterns <unk>[MASK] <unk> that put emotions into words the more techniques you know the more things you can make and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love[MASK] <unk> that said poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things for example [MASK] we are all going to die [MASK] poetry can help us live with that poems are made of words nothing but words <unk> the particulars in poems are like the[MASK] <unk> the personalities that distinguish people from one another poems are easy to share easy to pass on and when you read a poem you can imagine someone 's speaking to you or for you <unk> [MASK] maybe even someone far away or someone made up or someone deceased [MASK] that 's why[MASK] we can go to poems when we want to remember[MASK] something or someone to celebrate or to look beyond death or to say goodbye <unk> [MASK] and that 's one reason poems can seem important [MASK] even to people who aren 't me who don 't so much live in a world of words <unk> [MASK] the poet frank o 'hara said if you don 't need poetry bully for you [MASK] but he also said when he didn 't want to be alive anymore the thought that he wouldn 't write any more poems had stopped him[MASK] <unk> poetry helps me want to be alive and i want to show you why by showing you how [MASK] how a couple of poems react to the fact that we 're alive in one place at one time in one culture and in another we won 't be alive at all [MASK] so here 's one of the first[MASK] poems i memorized it could address a child[MASK] or an adult[MASK] <unk> from far from eve and morning from yon <unk>[MASK] <unk> sky <unk> the stuff of life to knit me blew hither here am i [MASK] now for a breath i tarry nor yet disperse apart take my hand quick and tell me what have you in your heart <unk> speak[MASK] <unk> and i will answer how shall i help you say <unk> ere to the wind 's twelve quarters i take my endless way [ a e housman ][MASK] now this poem has appealed to science fiction writers it 's furnished at least three science fiction titles <unk> i think because it says <unk>[MASK] <unk> poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world [MASK] <unk> poems can bring people together temporarily <unk> which i think is true <unk> and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes cleanly <unk>[MASK] <unk> and simply on the two and four say and way with anticipatory hints on the one and three answer and quarters as if the poem itself were coming[MASK] <unk> plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives a few years on earth become[MASK] one speech one breath it[MASK] 's a poem about loneliness the i in the poem feels no connection will last and it might look like a plea for help ' til you get to the word help <unk>[MASK] where this i facing you taking your hand is more like a teacher or a genie or at least that 's what he wants to believe [MASK] <unk> had written the poem that he wanted to hear <unk> [MASK] now this next poem really changed what i liked and what i read and what i felt i could read as an adult it might not make any sense to you if you haven 't seen it before [MASK] the garden [MASK] <unk> coral from lipstick ads in the fifty 's fruit of the tree of such knowledge[MASK] to smack <unk> meaning kiss or hit <unk> it appears in the guise of outworn usages because we are bad[MASK] <unk> big masculine threat insinuating and slangy [ rae armantrout ][MASK] <unk> i found this poem in an anthology of almost equally confusing poems in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine i just heard that there were these scandalous writers called language poets who didn 't make any sense and i wanted to go and <unk>[MASK] see for myself what they were like and some of them didn 't do much for me but this writer rae armantrout did an awful lot <unk> and i kept reading her until i felt i knew what was going on [MASK] <unk> sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time it 's also about how appearances deceive how our culture can sweep us along into doing and <unk>[MASK] <unk> saying things we didn 't intend or don 't like and armantrout 's style is trying to help us stop or slow down[MASK] <unk> as in domestic abuse because[MASK] sexual attraction can seem threatening <unk> [MASK] the red that means fertility can also mean poison oleander is poisonous and outworn usages like smack for kiss or hit can help <unk>[MASK] <unk> us see how our unacknowledged assumptions can make us believe we are bad either because sex is sinful or because we[MASK] <unk> tolerate so much sexism we let guys tell women what to do [MASK] the poem reacts to old lipstick ads and its edginess about statement its reversals and halts have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell <unk>[MASK] <unk> us so easily what to want what to do what to think that resistance is a lot of the point of the poem <unk> which shows me armantrout shows me what it 's like to hear grave[MASK] <unk> threats and mortal dishonesty in the language of everyday life and once she 's done that i think she can show other people women and men [MASK] what it 's like to feel that way and say to other people women and men who feel so alienated or so threatened that they 're not alone <unk> [MASK] now [MASK] how do i know that i 'm right[MASK] about this somewhat confusing poem well in this[MASK] <unk> case i emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said yeah <unk> yeah that 's about it yeah [MASK] but usually you can 't know you never know you can 't be sure <unk> [MASK] and that 's okay all we can do we is listen to poems and and look at poems and guess and see if they can bring us what we need and[MASK] if you 're wrong about some part of a poem <unk> nothing bad will happen[MASK] <unk> now <unk> this next poem is older than armantrout 's but a little younger than a e housman 's [MASK] the brave man [MASK] the sun <unk> that brave man comes through boughs that lie in wait <unk> that brave man <unk> [MASK] green and gloomy eyes in dark forms of the grass run away <unk> the good stars[MASK] pale helms and spiky spurs run away <unk> fears of my bed fears of life and fears of death run away <unk> [MASK] that brave man comes up from below and walks without meditation <unk> that brave man [ wallace stevens ][MASK] now the sun in this poem in wallace stevens ' poem seems so[MASK] <unk> the person in the poem is so afraid the sun comes up in the morning through branches dispels the dew the eyes on the grass and defeats stars envisioned <unk>[MASK] as armies brave has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense courage this sun is not afraid to show his face [MASK] <unk> is the reveal stevens saves for that fourth stanza where run away has become a refrain this person might want to run away too but fortified by the sun 's example he might just rise [MASK] stevens saves that sonically odd word meditation for the end <unk> [MASK] unlike the sun human beings think we meditate on past and future[MASK] <unk> life and death above and below and it can make us afraid [MASK] poems the patterns in poems show us not just what somebody thought or what someone did or what happened but[MASK] what it was like to be a person like that to be so anxious so lonely so inquisitive [MASK] so goofy so preposterous[MASK] <unk> so brave <unk> [MASK] that 's why poems can seem at once so durable so personal and so ephemeral like something inside and outside you at once [MASK] the scottish poet denise riley compares poetry to a needle a sliver of outside i cradle inside and the american poet terrance hayes wrote six poems called wind in a box one of them asks[MASK] <unk> me what am i going to do when i 'm dead [MASK] and the answer is that he 'll stay with us or won 't stay with us inside us as wind as air as words <unk> [MASK] it is easier than ever to find poems that might stay inside you that might stay with you from long long ago or from right this minute from far away or from right close to where you live <unk> almost no matter[MASK] <unk> where you live [MASK] poems can help you say help you show how you 're feeling but they can also introduce you to feelings ways of being in the world people very much unlike you maybe even[MASK] people[MASK] from long long ago <unk> some poems even tell you that that is what they can do [MASK] that 's what john keats is[MASK] <unk> doing[MASK] in his most mysterious perhaps poem <unk> [MASK] it 's mysterious because it 's probably unfinished he probably left it unfinished <unk> [MASK] and because it might be meant for a character in a play but it might just be keats ' thinking about what his own writing his[MASK] <unk> at least i hear <unk> mortality <unk> and i hear the power of older[MASK] poetic techniques <unk> and i have the feeling you might have the feeling of meeting even for an instant almost becoming someone else from long ago someone quite memorable [MASK] this living hand now warm and capable of earnest grasping would if it were cold and in the icy silence of the tomb so haunt thy days and[MASK] <unk> chill thy dreaming nights that thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood so in my veins red life might stream again and thou be <unk>[MASK] see here it is i hold it towards you[MASK]
