 <unk> writing biography[MASK] is a strange thing to do [MASK] it 's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else 's life [MASK] a journey an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going[MASK] and still can 't quite[MASK] <unk> believe you 've been especially if like me you 're an agnostic jew[MASK] and the life you 've been exploring is that of muhammad [MASK] five years ago for instance <unk> i found myself waking each morning in misty seattle to what i knew was an impossible[MASK] <unk> actually happened[MASK] one desert night half the world and almost half of history away what happened that is on the night in the year six hundred and ten[MASK] when muhammad received the first revelation of the koran on a mountain just outside mecca [MASK] this is the core mystical moment of islam and as such[MASK] yet the question wouldn 't let go of me <unk> [MASK] i was fully aware that for someone as secular as i am just asking it could be seen as pure[MASK] chutzpah [MASK] and i plead guilty as charged <unk> because all exploration[MASK] <unk> physical or intellectual is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression of crossing boundaries [MASK] still some boundaries are larger than others [MASK] so a human encountering the divine as muslims believe muhammad did [MASK] to the rationalist this is a matter not of fact but of wishful[MASK] <unk> and like all of us i like to think of myself as rational which might be why when i looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night [MASK] what struck me even more than what happened[MASK] was what did not happen [MASK] muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air <unk> he did not run down[MASK] <unk> he did not radiate light and joy <unk> there were no choirs of angels no music of the spheres <unk> no elation no ecstasy no[MASK] golden aura surrounding him <unk> no sense of an absolute <unk> fore ordained role as the messenger of god [MASK] that is <unk> he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul to put down[MASK] <unk> the whole story as a pious fable quite the contrary <unk> [MASK] in his own reported words <unk> he was convinced at first[MASK] that what had happened couldn 't have been real [MASK] at best he thought it had to have been a hallucination a trick of the eye or the ear perhaps or his own mind working against him[MASK] <unk> at worst <unk> possession[MASK] that he 'd been seized by an evil jinn a spirit out to deceive him even to crush the life out of him [MASK] in fact he was so sure that he could only be majnun <unk> possessed by a jinn [MASK] that when he found himself still alive his first impulse was to finish the job himself [MASK] to leap off the highest cliff[MASK] and escape the terror[MASK] of what he 'd experienced by putting an end to all experience [MASK] so the man who fled down the mountain that night[MASK] trembled not with joy[MASK] but with a stark <unk> primordial fear <unk> he was overwhelmed not with conviction but by doubt[MASK] <unk> and that panicked disorientation that sundering of everything familiar that daunting[MASK] awareness of something beyond human comprehension can only be called a terrible[MASK] awe <unk> [MASK] this might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word[MASK] <unk> to describe a new app or a viral video [MASK] with the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake we 're protected from real awe <unk> [MASK] we close the doors and hunker down convinced that we 're in control <unk> or at least <unk> hoping for control <unk> [MASK] we do our best to ignore the fact that we don 't always[MASK] <unk> and that not everything can be explained [MASK] yet whether you 're a rationalist or a mystic [MASK] whether you think the words muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside [MASK] what 's clear is that he did experience them <unk> and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world[MASK] and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate[MASK] <unk> for social and economic justice <unk> [MASK] fear[MASK] was the only sane response the only human response [MASK] too human for some [MASK] like conservative muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn 't even be mentioned despite the fact that it[MASK] <unk> in the earliest islamic biographies <unk> [MASK] they insist that he never doubted for even a single moment let alone despaired <unk> [MASK] demanding perfection they refuse to tolerate human imperfection[MASK] <unk> as i read those early accounts <unk> i realized it was precisely muhammad 's doubt that brought him alive for me [MASK] that allowed me to begin to see him in full to accord him the integrity of reality [MASK] and the more i thought about it the more it made sense that he doubted [MASK] because doubt is essential to faith[MASK] <unk> faith <unk> [MASK] if this seems a startling idea at first consider that doubt <unk> as graham greene once put it [MASK] is the heart of the matter <unk> [MASK] abolish all doubt <unk> and what 's left is not faith <unk> but absolute <unk> [MASK] <unk> you 're certain that you possess the truth inevitably offered with an implied uppercase t[MASK] and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness [MASK] by which i mean a demonstrative overweening pride in being so very right[MASK] <unk> it has to be one of the multiple ironies of history[MASK] that a favorite expletive of muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the christian fundamentalists known as crusaders[MASK] <unk> because their absolutism is in fact the opposite of faith [MASK] in effect <unk> they are the infidels [MASK] like fundamentalists of all religious stripes they have no questions only answers <unk> [MASK] they found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith[MASK] <unk> they don 't have to struggle for it like jacob wrestling through the night with the angel [MASK] or like jesus in his forty days and nights in the wilderness or like muhammad not only that night on the mountain but throughout his years as a prophet [MASK] with the koran constantly urging him not to despair <unk> [MASK] and condemning those who most loudly proclaim[MASK] that they know everything there is to know[MASK] <unk> that they and they alone are right and[MASK] yet we [MASK] the vast and still far too silent majority have ceded the public arena[MASK] to this extremist minority we 've allowed judaism to be claimed by violently messianic west bank settlers[MASK] christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots <unk> islam by[MASK] suicide bombers <unk> [MASK] and we 've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be christians jews or muslims militant extremists are none[MASK] <unk> they 're a cult all their own blood brothers steeped in other people 's blood [MASK] this isn 't faith <unk> [MASK] it 's fanaticism and we have to stop confusing the two <unk> we have to recognize that real faith[MASK] has no easy answers it 's difficult and stubborn[MASK] it involves an ongoing struggle a continual questioning of what we think we know a wrestling with issues and ideas [MASK] it goes hand in hand with doubt <unk> in a never ending conversation with it [MASK] and sometimes in conscious defiance of it [MASK] and this conscious defiance is why i[MASK] <unk> i as an agnostic can still have faith <unk> [MASK] i have faith for instance that peace in the middle east is possible despite the[MASK] <unk> mass of evidence to the contrary <unk> [MASK] i 'm not convinced of this i can hardly say i[MASK] <unk> i can only have faith in it commit myself that is to the idea of it <unk> [MASK] and i do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence [MASK] because[MASK] despair is <unk>[MASK] if we call something impossible we act in such a way that we make it so[MASK] <unk> for one refuse to live that way [MASK] in fact most of us do [MASK] whether we 're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond for that matter [MASK] what drives us is that despite our doubts[MASK] and even because of our doubts we reject the[MASK] <unk> we insist on faith in the future and in each other [MASK] call this naive if you like [MASK] call it impossibly idealistic if you must but one thing is sure [MASK] call it human [MASK] could muhammad have so[MASK] <unk> radically changed his world without such faith <unk> without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed minded certainty <unk> [MASK] i think not [MASK] after keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years <unk> i can 't see[MASK] that he 'd be anything[MASK] but utterly outraged[MASK] at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the middle east and elsewhere today[MASK] he 'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender [MASK] he 'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism <unk> [MASK] he 'd call out terrorism for what it is not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he[MASK] <unk> believed in and struggled for [MASK] he 'd say what the koran says <unk> [MASK] anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity <unk> [MASK] anyone who saves a life saves the life of all humanity <unk> [MASK] <unk> he 'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process[MASK] of making peace <unk> thank you[MASK]
