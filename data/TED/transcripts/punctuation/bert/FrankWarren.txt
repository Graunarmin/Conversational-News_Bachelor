 <unk> my name is frank[MASK] and i collect secrets [MASK] it all started with a crazy idea in november of two thousand and four [MASK] i printed up three thousand self addressed postcards just like this they were blank on one side and on the other side i[MASK] <unk> listed some simple instructions i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before [MASK] and i handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of washington d c not knowing what to expect <unk> [MASK] but soon the idea began spreading virally [MASK] people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards i started receiving secrets in my home[MASK] <unk> mailbox not just with postmarks from washington d c but from texas california vancouver new zealand iraq <unk> [MASK] soon my crazy idea didn 't seem so crazy[MASK] is the most visited <unk>[MASK] <unk> blog in the world <unk> and this is my postcard collection today [MASK] you can see my[MASK] <unk> wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets [MASK] what i 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection starting with this one [MASK] i found these stamps as[MASK] <unk> and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to i never did have someone [MASK] secrets can take many forms <unk> they can be shocking or silly or soulful <unk> [MASK] they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet[MASK] <unk> this one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard this one obviously was made out of half a starbucks cup with[MASK] a stamp and my home address written on the other side [MASK] dear birthmother i have great parents <unk> i 've found love[MASK] i 'm happy [MASK] secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas of frailty and heroism <unk> [MASK] playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now [MASK] everyone who knew me before[MASK] <unk> i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people so sometimes i didn 't wear panties and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself [MASK] this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you i[MASK] <unk> love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students <unk> [MASK] and sometimes afterwards i 'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students <unk> and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos <unk> [MASK] and i should also mention that just like today at that postsecret event i was using a wireless[MASK] <unk> your mic wasn 't off during sound check <unk> we all heard you pee [MASK] this was really embarrassing when it happened <unk> until i realized[MASK] it could have been worse[MASK] <unk> inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note i didn 't use <unk> i feel like the happiest person on earth [MASK] one of these men is the father of my son <unk> he pays me a lot to keep it a secret[MASK] <unk> that saturday when you wondered where i was well i was getting your ring it 's in my pocket right now [MASK] i had this postcard posted on the postsecret blog two years ago on valentine 's day it was the very bottom the last secret in the long column and[MASK] it hadn 't been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant[MASK] <unk> from the guy who mailed me this postcard and he said frank i 've got to share with you[MASK] this story that just played out in my life he said my knees are still shaking [MASK] he said for three years my girlfriend and i <unk> we 've made it this sunday morning ritual to visit the postsecret blog together and read the secrets out loud <unk> i read some to[MASK] <unk> 's really brought us closer together through the years <unk> [MASK] and so when i discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom i was beside myself and i tried to act calm not to give anything away <unk>[MASK] <unk> and just like every sunday we started reading the secrets out loud to each other [MASK] <unk> but she finally did she got to that bottom secret his proposal to her and he said she read it once[MASK] and then she read it again and she turned to him and said [MASK] is that our cat [MASK] laughter and when she saw him he was down on one knee he had the ring out he popped the question she said yes it was a very[MASK] <unk> happy ending so i emailed him back and i said please share with me an image something that i can share with the whole postsecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending [MASK] and he emailed me this picture [MASK] i found your camera at lollapalooza[MASK] <unk> i finally got the pictures developed and i 'd love to give them to you [MASK] this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it [MASK] but this secret has impacted many lives starting with a student up in canada named matty [MASK] matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website a website called[MASK] <unk> cameras that they 've found memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them[MASK] on his website every week <unk> [MASK] and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they 've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for [MASK] this one 's my favorite[MASK] matty has found this ingenious way[MASK] to leverage the kindness of strangers <unk> and it might seem like a simple idea and it is but the impact it can have on people 's lives can be huge [MASK] matty shared with me[MASK] an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture that 's me[MASK] <unk> my husband and son [MASK] the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother <unk> thank you for making your site [MASK] these pictures mean more to me than you know my son 's birth is on this camera he turns four tomorrow [MASK] every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it sometimes crossing oceans sometimes[MASK] going through language barriers [MASK] this is the last postcard i have to share with you today when people i love leave voicemails on my phone[MASK] i always save them in case they die tomorrow and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again [MASK] when i posted this secret <unk> dozens of people[MASK] <unk> sent voicemail messages from their phones sometimes ones they 'd been keeping for years messages from family or friends[MASK] who had died [MASK] they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them [MASK] it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive [MASK] one young girl[MASK] posted the last message she ever heard from[MASK] <unk> her grandmother [MASK] secrets can take many forms <unk> they can be shocking or silly or soulful <unk> [MASK] they can connect us with our deepest humanity[MASK] or with people we 'll never meet again[MASK] <unk> have you ever sent yourself a postcard [MASK] have you ever sent in a secret to postsecret fw i have one of my own secrets in every book <unk> i think in some ways the reason i started the project even though i didn 't know it at the time was because i was[MASK] struggling with my own secrets and it was through crowd sourcing it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me that i could uncover[MASK] parts of my past that were haunting me[MASK] and has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book has anyone in your life been able to tell fw sometimes i share that information[MASK]
