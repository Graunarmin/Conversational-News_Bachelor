 <unk> when i was a kid <unk> the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war [MASK] that 's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement <unk> filled with cans of food and water[MASK] <unk> when the nuclear attack came we were supposed to go downstairs <unk> hunker down and eat out of that barrel[MASK] <unk> today the greatest risk of global catastrophe[MASK] doesn 't look like this instead it looks like this [MASK] if anything kills over ten million people[MASK] in the next few decades it 's most likely[MASK] to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war [MASK] not missiles <unk> but microbes <unk> [MASK] now <unk> part of the reason for this is that we 've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents <unk> [MASK] but we 've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic we[MASK] 're not ready[MASK] for the next epidemic[MASK] <unk> 's look at ebola i 'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper <unk> lots of tough challenges i followed it carefully through the[MASK] case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication [MASK] and as you look at what went on <unk> the problem wasn 't that there was a system that didn 't work well enough the problem was that we didn 't have[MASK] <unk> at all in fact there 's some pretty obvious[MASK] key missing pieces <unk> [MASK] we didn 't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go who would have gone <unk> seen what the disease was seen how far it had spread [MASK] the case reports came in on paper it was very delayed before they were put online and they were[MASK] <unk> we didn 't have a medical team ready to go <unk> we didn 't have a way of preparing people now <unk>[MASK] <unk> did a great job orchestrating volunteers <unk> but even so we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries <unk> [MASK] and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of[MASK] <unk> there was no one there to look at treatment approaches [MASK] no one to look at the diagnostics no one to to figure out what tools should be used as an example we could have taken the blood of survivors <unk> processed it [MASK] and put that plasma back in people to protect them[MASK] but that was never tried <unk> so there was a lot that was missing and these things are really a global failure[MASK] <unk> the <unk> who is funded to monitor epidemics <unk> but not to do these things i talked about [MASK] now in the movies it 's quite different there 's a group of handsome epidemiologists[MASK] ready to go they move in they save the day <unk> but that 's just pure hollywood[MASK] <unk> the failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than ebola[MASK] let 's look at the progression of ebola over this year [MASK] about ten thousand people died <unk> and nearly all were in the three west african countries <unk> [MASK] there 's three reasons why it didn 't spread more the first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers[MASK] they found the people and they prevented more infections the second is the nature of the virus ebola does not spread through the air <unk> [MASK] and by the time you 're contagious most people are so sick that they 're bedridden <unk> [MASK] third <unk> it didn 't get into many urban areas and that was just luck <unk> if it had gotten into a lot more urban areas[MASK] <unk> case numbers would have been much larger <unk> so next time we might not be so lucky you can have a virus[MASK] where people feel well enough while they 're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market <unk> [MASK] the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like ebola or it could be bioterrorism so there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse[MASK] <unk> let 's look at a model[MASK] of a virus spread through the air <unk> like the spanish flu back in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen [MASK] so here 's what would happen it would spread throughout the world very very quickly <unk> [MASK] and you can see over thirty million people died from that epidemic <unk> [MASK] so this is a serious problem we should be concerned <unk> but in fact[MASK] <unk> we can build a really good response system <unk> [MASK] we have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here [MASK] we 've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them <unk> we have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they 're moving <unk> [MASK] we have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines[MASK] <unk> vaccines that fit for that[MASK] pathogen [MASK] so we can have tools but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system <unk> and we need preparedness [MASK] the best lessons i think on how to get prepared are again what we do for war [MASK] for soldiers we have full time waiting to[MASK] <unk> we have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers[MASK] nato has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly <unk> nato does a lot of war games to check are people well trained do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies so they are absolutely ready to go [MASK] so those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic[MASK] what are the key pieces <unk> first we need strong health systems in poor countries[MASK] that 's where mothers can give birth safely <unk> kids can get all their vaccines but also where we 'll see the outbreak very early on [MASK] we need a medical reserve corps <unk> lots of people who 've got the training and background who are ready to go with the expertise <unk> [MASK] and then we need to pair those medical[MASK] <unk> taking advantage of the military 's ability to move fast do logistics and secure areas <unk> [MASK] we need to do simulations <unk> germ games not war games <unk> so that we see where the holes are [MASK] the last time a germ game was done in the united states was back in two thousand and one <unk> and it didn 't go so well so far the score is germs one [MASK] <unk> we need lots of advanced r <unk> & d in areas of vaccines and diagnostics <unk> there are some big breakthroughs like the adeno associated virus that could work very very quickly <unk> [MASK] now i don 't have an exact budget for what this would cost <unk> but i 'm quite sure it 's very modest[MASK] compared to the potential harm the world bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic global wealth will go down[MASK] by over three trillion dollars[MASK] and we 'd have millions and millions of deaths [MASK] these investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic <unk> the primary healthcare the r <unk> & d those things would reduce global health equity[MASK] and make[MASK] the world more just as well as more safe <unk> [MASK] <unk> so i think this should absolutely be a priority <unk> [MASK] there 's no need to panic <unk> we don 't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement <unk> [MASK] but we need to get going <unk> because time is not on our side [MASK] in fact if there 's one positive thing that can come out of the ebola epidemic <unk> [MASK] it 's that it can serve as an early warning a wake up call to get ready <unk> [MASK] if we start now <unk> we can be ready for the next epidemic[MASK]
