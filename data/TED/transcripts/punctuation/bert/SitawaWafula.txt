i think about this affair <unk> but i cannot <unk> [MASK] i wish i could talk about sweet words spoken or gifts that i received from this affair <unk> [MASK] but i cannot <unk> [MASK] all i can tell you about is the aftermath about days i spent constantly[MASK] <unk> i remember how it all began i was in my final year of high school and my class had just won in sports so[MASK] we were singing and dancing and hugging each other <unk> i went and took a shower <unk> then i went for dinner <unk> [MASK] and when i sat down to eat my teeth started chattering[MASK] <unk> so i couldn 't put the spoon in my mouth[MASK] i rushed to the nurse 's office and because i couldn 't talk i just pointed at my mouth <unk>[MASK] she didn 't know what was happening so she told me to lie down <unk> [MASK] and it worked after a few minutes the chattering stopped <unk> i was about to dash out and she told[MASK] <unk> she insisted that i go up to the dormitories to sleep [MASK] here i was in my final year of high school [MASK] just a few months from doing my end of high school exams and a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in kenya mocks which are <unk>[MASK] <unk> somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams there[MASK] <unk> class sat down took my kenyan history notes and there i was down kenyan coastal town with the great[MASK] <unk> was marking imaginary papers[MASK] in and out it went [MASK] and with every stroke one by one my classmates stopped concentrating on their reading[MASK] and started looking at me <unk> [MASK] and i tried really hard to stop it but i couldn 't because it had a life of its own <unk> [MASK] and then when it was[MASK] <unk> sure everybody was looking at us [MASK] in its final show and official introduction i had my first full blown seizure <unk> which was the beginning of what has been[MASK] affair [MASK] seizures are the trademark characteristic for most types of epilepsy and every[MASK] every first ever seizure needs to be assessed by a doctor to determine if one has epilepsy or if it 's a symptom of something else [MASK] in my case [MASK] it was confirmed that i had epilepsy [MASK] i spent a large chunk of my time[MASK] in hospital and at home <unk> and only went back to do my final exams i had seizures in between[MASK] <unk> papers <unk> but managed to get good enough grades to be admitted for an actuarial science degree at the university of nairobi [MASK] unfortunately <unk> i had to drop out in my second year <unk> [MASK] i didn 't have good enough coping skills and a support community around me <unk> [MASK] i was lucky[MASK] <unk> enough to get a job <unk> but i was fired from that job when i had a seizure in the workplace so[MASK] i found myself in a space where[MASK] i was constantly asking myself why this had to happen to me <unk> i lived in denial[MASK] <unk> denial was maybe because of the things that had happened <unk> dropping out of school and being fired from my job [MASK] or maybe it was because of the things i had heard about epilepsy and about people living with epilepsy [MASK] that they would never live on their own that they would never travel on their own or or even get work[MASK] <unk> that they were outcasts with a spirit in them that they needed to be delivered from <unk> [MASK] and so the more i thought about these things [MASK] the more my seizures became became <unk> [MASK] and i spent days with my legs locked my speech became blurred[MASK] and on days on end this is[MASK] <unk> how i 'd be two or three days after a seizure my head and my hand would still be twitching <unk> [MASK] i felt lost[MASK] <unk> i had so much frustration in me <unk> and so i started writing because the people around me didn 't have[MASK] answers to the questions that i had and so i wrote my fears[MASK] and my doubts <unk> i wrote about my good days and my bad days and my really ugly days[MASK] <unk> and i shared them on a blog <unk> [MASK] and before long [MASK] i began to be seen and heard by people who had epilepsy and their families <unk> and even those who did not have the diagnosis <unk> [MASK] and i moved from that girl who constantly asked why me[MASK] to one who not only <unk>[MASK] but does it for those who are yet to find their voices[MASK] <unk> my seizures are greatly reduced from two to three times a day to sometimes two to three times in one year <unk> [MASK] <unk> on to employ five people when i began what was kenya 's first free mental health and epilepsy support line <unk> [MASK] and i travel [MASK] and i travel to speak about my affair <unk> [MASK] all these things that i had been told people like me living with epilepsy could never be able to do [MASK] every year a population[MASK] <unk> population as big as eighty percent of nairobi gets diagnosed with epilepsy[MASK] across the globe <unk> and they like me <unk> go through the emotions of[MASK] stigma and exclusion <unk> and so i have made it my life journey[MASK] to keep these[MASK] <unk> and i keep confessing about my affair so that those people who do not have the diagnosis[MASK] might know[MASK] and might have a constant reminder[MASK] that it is alright to engage with people like us that as long as they pull down the walls of stigma and exclusion <unk> [MASK] that we just like them can be able to take anything life throws at us <unk> thank you[MASK]
