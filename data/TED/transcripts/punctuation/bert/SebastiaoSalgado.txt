i was really upset with photography with everything in the world and i made the decision[MASK] <unk> to go back to where i was born it was a big coincidence it was the moment that my parents[MASK] became very old <unk> [MASK] i have seven sisters i 'm one of the only men in my family <unk> and they made together the decision to transfer this land to lila and myself <unk> [MASK] when we received this land this land[MASK] was as dead as i was when i was a kid it was more than fifty percent rainforest[MASK] <unk> when we received the land it was less than half a percent[MASK] rainforest <unk> as in all my region <unk> to build development <unk> brazilian development <unk> [MASK] we destroyed a lot of our forest as you did here in the united states or you did in india everywhere in this planet <unk> [MASK] to build our development we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything [MASK] this farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds[MASK] <unk> and we didn 't know how to deal with these and lila came up with an incredible idea [MASK] a crazy idea she said why don 't you put back the rainforest that was here before you say that you were born in paradise let 's build the paradise again <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] i went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us <unk> and we started we started to plant[MASK] year we lost a lot of trees <unk> second year less and slowly slowly this dead land started to be born again <unk> [MASK] we started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees <unk> only local species <unk> only native species <unk> where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed <unk> [MASK] and the life started to come back in an incredible way it[MASK] was necessary[MASK] <unk> transform our land into a national park <unk> we transformed we gave this land back to nature it became a national park <unk> we created an institution called instituto terra [MASK] and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere here in los angeles in the bay area in san francisco it became tax deductible[MASK] <unk> money in spain in italy a lot in brazil we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project the government[MASK] and the life started to come <unk> and i had a big wish to come back to photography to

four <unk> and i finished at the end of two thousand and eleven [MASK] we created an incredible amount of pictures and the result llia did the design of all my books the design of all my shows[MASK] <unk> is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet and what we must hold on this planet if we want to live to have some equilibrium in our life <unk> [MASK] i wanted to see us when[MASK] we used yes our instruments in stone we exist yet <unk> i was last week at the brazilian national indian foundation[MASK] <unk> and only in the amazon we have about one hundred and

are at a point where we cannot go back <unk> [MASK] but we create an incredible contradiction to build all this we destroy a lot our forest[MASK] <unk> destroyed your forest around here no the redwood

water <unk> i put to myself the question if for a moment <unk> [MASK] we will not lack oxygen for all animal species <unk> ours included that would be very complicated for us [MASK] for the water system the trees[MASK] are essential i 'll give you a small example that you 'll understand very easily <unk> you happy people that have a lot of hair on your head [MASK] if you take a shower it takes you[MASK] two or three hours[MASK] to dry your hair if you don 't use a dryer machine me one minute it 's dry [MASK] the same with the trees <unk> the trees are the hair of our planet[MASK] <unk> when you have rain[MASK] in a place that has no trees in just a few minutes the water arrives in the stream brings soil <unk> destroying our water source <unk> destroying the rivers <unk> [MASK] and no humidity to retain <unk> when you have trees <unk> the root system holds the water all the branches of the trees the leaves that come down[MASK] <unk> a humid area and they take months and months

went back we built an ecosystem <unk> we here inside the room[MASK] <unk> i believe that we have the same concern <unk> [MASK] and the model that we created in brazil <unk> we can transplant it here
