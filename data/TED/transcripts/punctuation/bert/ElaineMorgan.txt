 <unk> all over the world <unk> eminent evolutionists[MASK] <unk> anxious to celebrate this and what they 're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect[MASK] of darwin and his life and how he changed our thinking [MASK] i say almost every aspect because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on <unk> and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something[MASK] <unk> so i 'm going to talk about it it 's the question of why are we so different from the chimpanzees [MASK] we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related hardly any genes of difference very very closely related [MASK] and yet <unk> when you look at the phenotypes there 's a chimp there 's a man they 're[MASK] astoundingly different[MASK] <unk> measurable physical differences they that one is hairy and walking on four legs <unk> that one is a naked biped why <unk> [MASK] i mean [MASK] laughter if i 'm a good darwinist i 've got to believe[MASK] there 's a reason for that if we changed so much[MASK] <unk> something must have happened <unk> what happened [MASK] now fifty years ago that was a laughably simple question <unk> everybody knew the answer they knew what happened <unk> [MASK] the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees [MASK] our ancestors went out onto the plain <unk> [MASK] that explained everything we had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass or to chase after animals or to free our hands for weapons[MASK] <unk> and we got so overheated in the chase[MASK] that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away <unk> [MASK] everybody knew that <unk> for generations <unk> but then in the ' 90s something began to unravel <unk> [MASK] the paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna[MASK] that lived in the same time[MASK] and place as the hominids <unk> [MASK] and they weren 't savanna species <unk> [MASK] and they looked at the herbivores <unk> and they weren 't savanna herbivores <unk> and then they were so clever they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen [MASK] shock horror <unk> [MASK] the fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation some of it even came from lianas those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle[MASK] so we 're left with a situation where[MASK] we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees <unk> [MASK] before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence [MASK] this is not something i 've made up it 's not a minority theory everybody agrees with it <unk> professor tobias came[MASK] <unk> over from south africa[MASK] and spoke to university college london he said everything i 've been telling you for the last twenty years <unk> forget about it <unk> it was wrong <unk> [MASK] we 've got to go back to square one and start again [MASK] it made him very unpopular they didn 't want to go back to square one <unk> [MASK] <unk> a terrible thing to happen you 've got this beautiful paradigm [MASK] you 've believed it through generations nobody has questioned it <unk> you 've been constructing fanciful things on top of it <unk> relying on it to be as solid as a rock <unk> and now it 's whipped away from under you [MASK] what do you do [MASK] what does a scientist do in that case well we know the answer because[MASK] thomas[MASK] <unk> he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails[MASK] is guess what they carry on as if nothing had happened [MASK] if they haven 't got a paradigm they can 't ask the question so they say yes it 's wrong but[MASK] <unk> only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions [MASK] so that is what they have done now that 's why you don 't hear them talking about it it 's yesterday 's question <unk> [MASK] some of them have even elevated it into a principle it 's what we ought to be doing <unk> aaron filler from harvard said isn[MASK] <unk> time we stopped talking about selective pressures i mean <unk> why don 't we talk about well there 's chromosomes and there 's genes and we just record what we see [MASK] charles darwin must be spinning in his grave [MASK] he knew all about that kind of science and he called it hypothesis free science <unk> and he despised it from the bottom of his heart <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] if you 're going to say i 'm going to stop talking about selective pressures you can take the origin of species and throw it out of[MASK] <unk> window for it 's about nothing else but selective pressures <unk> [MASK] and the irony of it is that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn 't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up [MASK] there was one waiting in the wings <unk> it had been waiting there since one thousand nine hundred and sixty[MASK] when alister hardy a marine biologist said [MASK] <unk> our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time [MASK] he kept it to himself for thirty years but then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose all his colleagues said this is outrageous you 've[MASK] exposed us to public ridicule <unk> you must never do that again [MASK] and at that time it became set in stone the aquatic theory[MASK] should be dumped[MASK] with the ufos and the[MASK] <unk> yetis <unk> as part of the lunatic fringe of science <unk> well i don 't think that i think that hardy had a lot going for him i 'd like to talk about just[MASK] a handful of what have been called the[MASK] hallmarks of mankind the things that made us different from everybody else and all our relatives let 's look at our naked skin[MASK] <unk> it 's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair mammals without body hair [MASK] are aquatic ones like the dugong <unk> the walrus <unk> the dolphin <unk> the hippopotamus the manatee <unk> and a couple of[MASK] like the babirusa <unk> and you 're tempted to think well[MASK] <unk> could that be[MASK] why we are naked i suggested it and people said no no no i mean look at the elephant you 've forgotten all about the elephant haven 't you [MASK] so back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two i said well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor [MASK] peals of merry laughter that crazy woman she 's off again she 'll say anything won 't she but by now <unk> everybody agrees that the elephant[MASK] <unk> round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros last year in florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said seems to have spent most of its time in the water [MASK] so this is a[MASK] close connection between nakedness and water as an absolute connection it only works one way[MASK] <unk> you can 't say all aquatic animals[MASK] are naked because look at the sea otter but you can say[MASK] that every[MASK] animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water in its own lifetime or the lifetime of its ancestors <unk> i think this is significant the only exception[MASK] is the naked somalian mole rat which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground and take bipedality <unk> here you can[MASK] anybody to compare it with[MASK] <unk> because we[MASK] 're the only animal that walks upright on two legs <unk> but you can say this [MASK] all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs if they want to for a short time there is only one circumstance in which they always all of them walk on two legs and that is when they are wading through water [MASK] do you think that 's significant[MASK] <unk> david attenborough thinks it 's significant <unk> as the possible beginning of our bipedalism [MASK] look at the fat layer we have got under our skin a layer of fat all over [MASK] nothing in the least like that in any other primate <unk> [MASK] why should it be there <unk> well they do know that if you look at other aquatic[MASK] <unk> land mammals is deposited inside the body wall around the kidneys and the[MASK] intestines and so on has started to migrate to the outside <unk> and spread out in a layer[MASK] inside the skin in the whale it 's complete no fat inside at all all in blubber outside [MASK] we cannot avoid the suspicion that in[MASK] <unk> case it 's started to happen we have got skin lined with this layer it 's the only possible explanation of why[MASK] humans if they 're very unlucky [MASK] can become grossly obese in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate <unk> physically impossible something very odd[MASK] matter of factly never explained [MASK] the question of why we can speak <unk> we can speak <unk> and the[MASK] nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that purely has to do with its[MASK] conscious control of its breath you can 't even train[MASK] a gorilla to say ah on request the only[MASK] creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds <unk> it was an absolute precondition[MASK] for our being able to speak <unk> and then again <unk> there is the fact[MASK] that we are streamlined trying to imagine a diver diving into water hardly makes a splash <unk> try to imagine a gorilla[MASK] performing the same[MASK] maneuver <unk> and you can see that compared with gorilla we are halfway to being shaped like a fish i am trying to suggest that for[MASK] <unk> aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe and it is not lunatic fringe and the ironic thing about it is that[MASK] they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own which they 've all agreed on and they love there is nothing there they are staving off the[MASK] <unk> how do they react when i say these things [MASK] one very common reaction i 've heard about twenty times is [MASK] but it was investigated <unk> they conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning when hardy[MASK] <unk> years i 've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind and i 've concluded[MASK] that that 's one of the urban myths it 's never been done i ask people sometimes <unk>[MASK] <unk> the aquatic theory <unk> everybody likes the aquatic theory of course they don 't believe it <unk> but they like[MASK] everybody i talk to says it 's rubbish <unk> and they can 't all be wrong can they [MASK] the answer to that <unk> loud and clear is yes they can all be wrong history is strewn with the cases when they 've all got it wrong [MASK] and if you 've got a scientific problem like[MASK] solve it by holding a head count and saying more of us say yes than say no [MASK] apart from that some of the heads count more than others[MASK] <unk> some of them have come over <unk> there was professor tobias he 's come over <unk> daniel dennett <unk> he 's come over <unk> sir david attenborough [MASK] <unk> now we 've got to look to the future <unk> ultimately one of three things is going to happen <unk> [MASK] either they will go on for the next forty years fifty years sixty years yeah well we don 't talk about that let 's talk about[MASK] <unk> that would be very sad <unk> the second thing that could happen[MASK] is that some young genius will arrive <unk> and say i 've found it <unk> it was not the savanna <unk> it was not the water <unk> it was this [MASK] no sign of that happening either <unk> i don 't think there is a third option so the third thing that might happen[MASK] is a very beautiful thing if you look back at the early years of the last century[MASK] <unk> lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in mendel and the believers in darwin it ended with a new synthesis [MASK] darwin 's ideas and mendel 's ideas blending together <unk> [MASK] and i think the same thing will happen here you 'll get a new synthesis [MASK] hardy 's ideas and darwin 's ideas will be blended together[MASK] <unk> and we can move forward from there <unk> and really get somewhere <unk> that would be a beautiful thing [MASK] it would be very nice for me if it happened soon [MASK] <unk> because i 'm older now than george burns was when he[MASK] <unk> that belongs with the ufos and the yetis and it 's not easy to change their minds <unk> [MASK] the professional journals[MASK] won 't touch it with a barge pole <unk> [MASK] the textbooks don 't mention it the syllabus doesn 't mention even the fact that we 're naked <unk> let alone look for a reason to it [MASK] horizon which takes its cue from the academics won 't touch it with a barge pole[MASK] so we never hear the case put for it except[MASK] in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe <unk> i don 't know quite[MASK] where this diktat comes from somebody up there is issuing[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> thou shalt not believe[MASK] in the aquatic theory <unk> [MASK] and if you hope to make progress in this profession <unk> and you do believe it you 'd better keep it to yourself <unk> because it will get in your way [MASK] so i get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are[MASK] morphing into a kind of priesthood <unk> [MASK] but you know [MASK] that makes me feel good <unk> because richard dawkins has told[MASK] <unk> us how to treat a priesthood [MASK] he says firstly <unk> you 've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence[MASK] it 's been trained to receive right i 'll go ahead with that and secondly <unk> he says you must never be afraid to rock the boat[MASK]
