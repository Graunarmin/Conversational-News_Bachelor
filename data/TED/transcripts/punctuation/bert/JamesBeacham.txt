 <unk> there is something[MASK] about physics that has been[MASK] really bothering me since i was a little kid <unk> [MASK] and it 's related to a question that scientists have been asking for almost one hundred years with no answer[MASK] <unk> how do the smallest things in nature the particles of the quantum world match up with the largest things in nature planets and stars and galaxies held together by gravity [MASK] as a kid i would puzzle over questions just like this i would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets and i would read about the forces of the small and about quantum mechanics and i would marvel at how well that description[MASK] <unk> matched up to our observation <unk>[MASK] then i would look at the stars and i would read about how well we understand gravity and i would think surely there must be some elegant way that these two systems match up [MASK] but there 's not [MASK] and the books would say yeah we understand a lot about these two realms separately <unk> but when we try to link them mathematically <unk> everything breaks[MASK] and for one hundred years none of our ideas as to how to solve this basically physics disaster has ever been supported by evidence <unk> [MASK] and to little old me little curious skeptical james this was a supremely unsatisfying answer[MASK] <unk> so i 'm still a skeptical little[MASK] <unk> when i found myself smack in the middle of the physics world being flipped on its head [MASK] it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data a hint[MASK] of a new particle an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question [MASK] so i 'm still a skeptical little kid i think but i 'm also now a particle hunter <unk> i am a physicist at cern 's large[MASK] <unk> hadron collider the largest science experiment ever mounted it[MASK] 's a 27 kilometer tunnel on the border of france and switzerland buried one hundred meters underground <unk> and in this tunnel we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space[MASK] to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light and slam them into each other millions of times per second <unk> collecting the debris of these[MASK] <unk> collisions[MASK] to search for new undiscovered fundamental particles [MASK] its design and construction took decades of work by thousands of physicists from around the globe <unk> and in the summer[MASK] of two thousand and fifteen we had been working tirelessly to switch on the lhc at the highest energy that humans have ever[MASK] <unk> used in a collider experiment [MASK] now <unk> [MASK] higher energy is important because for particles there is an equivalence between energy and particle mass and mass is just a number put there by nature [MASK] to discover new particles we need to reach these bigger numbers <unk> [MASK] and to do that we have to build a bigger higher energy collider and the biggest highest energy collider in the world is the large hadron collider <unk> [MASK] <unk> and we collect this data[MASK] very slowly over months and months [MASK] and then new particles might show up in our data as bumps slight deviations from what you expect little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth [MASK] for example this bump [MASK] <unk> led to the discovery of the higgs particle the higgs boson and to a nobel prize for the for the confirmation of its existence[MASK] this jump up in energy[MASK] in two thousand and fifteen[MASK] represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles new answers to these long standing questions because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the higgs boson [MASK] many of my colleagues had been working their entire[MASK] careers for this moment and frankly to little curious me this was the moment i 'd been waiting for my entire life <unk> so two thousand and fifteen was go time <unk> [MASK] so june[MASK] <unk> and fifteen the lhc is switched back on [MASK] my colleagues and i held our breath and bit our fingernails <unk> and then finally we saw the first proton collisions at this highest energy ever applause champagne[MASK] <unk> celebration this was a milestone[MASK] for science and we had no idea what we would find in this brand new data <unk> [MASK] and then a few weeks later we found a bump [MASK] it wasn 't a very big bump <unk> [MASK] but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow but on a scale of one to ten for eyebrow raises if ten indicates that you 've discovered a new[MASK] <unk> particle this eyebrow raise is about a four [MASK] laughter i spent[MASK] hours <unk> [MASK] days <unk> weeks in secret meetings <unk> arguing with my colleagues over this little bump <unk> poking and prodding it with our most ruthless experimental sticks to see if it would withstand scrutiny[MASK] <unk> but even after months of working feverishly sleeping in our offices and not going home[MASK] <unk> candy bars for dinner <unk> coffee by the bucketful physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams[MASK] <unk> this little bump would not go away <unk> so[MASK] after a few months we presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message this little bump[MASK] <unk> interesting but it 's not definitive so let 's keep an eye on it as we take more data so we were trying to be extremely cool about it [MASK] and the world ran with it anyway <unk> [MASK] the news loved it[MASK] people said it reminded them of the little bump that was shown on the way toward the higgs boson discovery better than that my theorist colleagues[MASK] i love my theorist colleagues my theorist colleagues wrote five hundred papers about this little[MASK] <unk> bump the world of particle physics had been flipped on its head <unk> but[MASK] what was it about this particular bump that caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool [MASK] this little bump was unique this little bump indicated that we were seeing an unexpectedly large number of collisions whose debris[MASK] <unk> debris consisted of only two photons two particles of light and that 's rare [MASK] particle collisions are not like automobile collisions they have different rules [MASK] when two particles collide at almost the speed of light the quantum world takes over and in the quantum world these two particles can briefly create a new particle[MASK] that lives for a tiny fraction of a second before splitting into other particles that hit our detector imagine a car[MASK] <unk> collision where the two cars vanish upon impact a bicycle appears in their place [MASK] laughter and then that bicycle explodes into two skateboards which hit our detector [MASK] hopefully not literally[MASK] <unk> they 're very expensive <unk> events where only two photons hit out detector are very rare <unk> and because of the special quantum properties of photons[MASK] <unk> small number of possible new particles these mythical bicycles that can give birth to only two photons <unk> [MASK] but one of these options is huge <unk> and it has to do with that <unk>[MASK] <unk> question that bothered me as a tiny little kid about gravity <unk> gravity may seem[MASK] <unk> super strong to you <unk> but it 's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature <unk> i can briefly beat gravity when i jump[MASK] <unk> but i can 't pick a proton out of my hand [MASK] the strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature it[MASK] 's ten to the minus thirty nine that 's a decimal with thirty nine zeros after it worse than that all of the other known forces of nature are perfectly described by this thing we call the standard model <unk> which is our current best description[MASK] of nature at its smallest scales <unk> and quite frankly <unk>[MASK] one of the most successful achievements of humankind[MASK] except for gravity <unk> which is absent from the standard model it 's crazy[MASK] it 's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing [MASK] we feel a little bit of it but where 's the rest of[MASK] <unk> no one knows <unk> but one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution you and i[MASK] even you in the back we we live in three dimensions of space i hope that 's <unk>[MASK] <unk> statement all of the known particles also live in three dimensions of space in fact a particle is just another name for[MASK] <unk> a localized wobbling in space [MASK] more importantly <unk> all the math that we use to describe all this stuff assumes that there are only three dimensions of space but math is math and we can play around with our math however <unk>[MASK] <unk> we want <unk> and people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space for a very long time but it 's always been an abstract mathematical concept <unk> [MASK] what if the missing gravity is leaking[MASK] into an extra spatial dimension that 's invisible to you and i [MASK] what if gravity is just as strong as the other forces if you were to view it in this extra spatial dimension and what you and i experience is a tiny slice of gravity make it seem very weak [MASK] if this were true[MASK] <unk> would have to expand our standard model of particles to include an extra particle a hyperdimensional particle of gravity a special graviton that lives in extra spatial dimensions <unk>[MASK] i see the looks on your faces you should be asking me the question how in the world are we going to test this crazy science fiction idea <unk> stuck as we are in three dimensions the way we always do by slamming together two protons[MASK] that the collision reverberates into any extra spatial dimensions that might be there momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the lhc[MASK] and spits off two photons two particles of light [MASK] and this hypothetical extra dimensional graviton[MASK] <unk> is one of the only possible hypothetical new particles that has the special quantum properties that could give birth to our little two photon[MASK] bump <unk> [MASK] so the possibility of[MASK] explaining the mysteries of gravity and of discovering extra dimensions of space[MASK] perhaps now you get a sense as to why thousands of physics geeks collectively lost their cool over our little two photon bump a discovery of this type would[MASK] <unk> rewrite the textbooks <unk> but remember <unk> the message from us experimentalists that actually were doing this work at the time was very clear we need more data [MASK] with more data <unk> the little bump will either turn into a nice <unk> crisp nobel prize [MASK] or the extra data will fill in the space around the bump and turn it into a nice smooth line <unk> so we took more data[MASK] <unk> with five times the data several months later our little bump turned into a smooth line[MASK] the news reported on a huge disappointment on faded hopes and on particle physicists being sad given the tone of the coverage you 'd think that we had decided to shut down the lhc and go home [MASK] but that 's not what we did[MASK] but why not i mean if i didn 't discover a particle and i didn 't[MASK] if i didn 't discover a particle why am i here talking to you why didn 't i just hang my head in shame[MASK] and go home[MASK] <unk> and very much of what we do is cartography let me put it this way forget about the lhc for a second imagine you are a space explorer[MASK] arriving at a distant planet searching for aliens what is your first task [MASK] to immediately orbit the planet land take a quick look around for any big obvious signs of life <unk> and report back to home base [MASK] that 's the stage we 're at now [MASK] we took a first[MASK] <unk> look at the lhc for any new big obvious to spot particles <unk> and we can report that there are none [MASK] we saw a weird looking alien bump on a distant mountain but once we got closer we saw it was a rock <unk>[MASK] but then what do we do do we just give up and fly away absolutely not we would be terrible scientists if we did no we spend the next couple of decades[MASK] <unk> mapping out the territory <unk> sifting through the sand with a fine instrument peeking under every stone drilling under the surface new particles can either show up immediately as <unk>[MASK] <unk> big <unk> obvious to spot bumps or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking [MASK] we build a bigger machine [MASK] we search at higher energies <unk> we search at higher energies <unk> planning is already underway for a <unk>[MASK] <unk> tunnel that will collide particles at ten times the energy of the lhc <unk> we don 't decide where nature places new particles we only decide to keep exploring <unk> [MASK] <unk> collider floating in space between the earth and the moon <unk> we still find no new particles[MASK] <unk> then perhaps we 're doing particle physics wrong [MASK] perhaps we need to rethink things maybe we need more[MASK] resources technology expertise than what we[MASK] <unk> we already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in parts of the lhc <unk> but imagine designing a particle physics experiment using such sophisticated algorithms that it could teach itself to discover <unk>[MASK] but what if what if the ultimate question what if even artificial intelligence can 't help us answer our questions what if these open questions for centuries are destined to be unanswered[MASK] for the foreseeable future what if the stuff that 's bothered me since i was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime[MASK] then that will be even more fascinating <unk> [MASK] we will be forced to think in completely new ways we[MASK] 'll have to go back to our assumptions and determine if there was a flaw somewhere and we 'll need to encourage more people to join us in studying science since we need[MASK] <unk> i don 't have the answers and i 'm still searching for them but someone maybe she 's in school right now <unk> maybe she 's not even born yet[MASK] could eventually guide us to see physics in a completely new way and to point out that perhaps we 're just asking the wrong questions <unk> [MASK] which would not be the end of physics but a novel beginning [MASK]
