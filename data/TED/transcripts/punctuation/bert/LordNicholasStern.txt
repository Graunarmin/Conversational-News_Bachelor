 <unk> a remarkable moment in time <unk> we face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations[MASK] that will determine whether the next one hundred years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries <unk> let me illustrate with an example[MASK] i first visited beijing twenty five years ago to teach at the people 's university of china [MASK] china was getting serious about market economics and about university education so they decided to call in the[MASK] foreign experts <unk> like most other people i moved around beijing[MASK] <unk> from dodging the occasional vehicle it was a safe and easy way to get around [MASK] cycling in beijing now is a completely different prospect[MASK] <unk> the roads are jammed by cars and trucks the air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal[MASK] and diesel <unk> when i was there last in the spring there was an advisory for people of my age[MASK] <unk> to stay indoors and not move much how did this come about it came from[MASK] the way in which beijing has grown as a city <unk> [MASK] it 's doubled over those twenty five years more than doubled from ten million to twenty million <unk> it 's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel dirty energy particularly coal [MASK] china burns half[MASK] the world 's coal each year <unk> and that 's why[MASK] it is a key reason why it is the world 's largest emitter[MASK] of greenhouse gases [MASK] at the same time <unk> we have to recognize that in that period china has grown remarkably [MASK] it has become the world 's second largest economy <unk> hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty [MASK] that 's really[MASK] <unk> the same time the people of china are asking the question what 's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable [MASK] they 've analyzed <unk> diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development [MASK] china 's planning to scale back coal <unk> it 's[MASK] looking to build its cities in different ways [MASK] now the growth of china is part of a dramatic change fundamental change[MASK] in the structure of the world economy [MASK] just twenty five years ago <unk> the developing countries the poorer countries of the world were [MASK] notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people they accounted for only about a third of the world 's output <unk> [MASK] now it 's more than half twenty five years from now it will probably be two thirds from[MASK] <unk> the countries that we saw twenty five years ago as developing that 's a remarkable change <unk> it means that most countries around the world <unk> rich or poor are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that i want to talk about[MASK] and highlight now the first of these transformations[MASK] is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that i 've already begun to illustrate[MASK] through the[MASK] <unk> percent now in urban areas that 's going to go to seventy percent in two thousand and fifty [MASK] over the next two decades we 'll see the demand for energy rise by forty percent and the growth[MASK] in the economy and in the population[MASK] is putting increasing pressure on our land on our water and on our forests [MASK] <unk> structural change if we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way [MASK] we will create waste pollution <unk> [MASK] congestion <unk> destruction of land and forests <unk> if we think of those three areas that i have illustrated with my numbers cities <unk> [MASK] energy land if we manage all that badly <unk> then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods[MASK] <unk> the people around the world would be poor and damaged and more than that the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise [MASK] with immense risks to our climate concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already[MASK] higher than they 've been for millions of years <unk> if we go on increasing those[MASK] <unk> we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years [MASK] we 've been around as homo sapiens that 's a rather generous definition sapiens[MASK] for perhaps a quarter of a million years a quarter of a million <unk> we risk temperatures we haven 't seen for tens of millions of years over a century [MASK] that would transform the relationship between human beings[MASK] and[MASK] the planet it[MASK] <unk> would lead to[MASK] changing deserts <unk> changing rivers changing patterns of hurricanes changing sea levels hundreds of millions of people [MASK] perhaps billions of people who would have to move and if we 've learned anything from history <unk> that means severe and extended conflict <unk> and we couldn 't just turn it[MASK] <unk> you can 't make a peace treaty with the planet you can 't negotiate with the laws of physics you 're in there you 're stuck [MASK] those are the stakes we 're playing for and that 's why we have to make this second transformation <unk> the climate[MASK] transformation <unk> and move to a low carbon economy <unk> [MASK] now the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway <unk> we have to decide whether to do it well or badly the economic or structural transformation but the second of the transformations[MASK] <unk> the climate transformations we have to decide to do [MASK] those two transformations face us in the next two decades the next two decades are[MASK] decisive for what we have to do [MASK] now the more i 've thought about this the two transformations coming together <unk> the more i 've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity it[MASK] 's an opportunity which we can use[MASK] <unk> an opportunity which we can lose <unk> [MASK] and let me explain through those three key areas that i 've identified cities <unk> energy and land and let me start with cities [MASK] i 've already described the problems of beijing <unk> [MASK] pollution <unk> congestion waste and so on surely we recognize that[MASK] in many of our cities around the world now with cities <unk> like life but particularly[MASK] <unk> you have to think ahead <unk> the cities that are going to be built and there are many <unk> and many big ones[MASK] we have to think of how to design them in a compact way[MASK] so we can save travel time and we can save energy <unk> the cities that already are there well established [MASK] we have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities <unk> and make it easier encourage more people to live closer to the center <unk> [MASK] <unk> examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that [MASK] the bus rapid transport system in bogot in colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non polluting way[MASK] in a city very frequent buses strongly protected routes the same service really as an[MASK] <unk> railway system but much much cheaper and can be done much more quickly a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that 's developing <unk> now <unk> some things in cities do take time some things in cities can happen much more quickly <unk> [MASK] take my hometown london [MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two smog in london[MASK] killed four thousand people and badly damaged the lives of many many more and[MASK] <unk> those of you live outside london in the u k will remember it used to be called the smoke <unk> [MASK] that 's the way london was by regulating coal within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly[MASK] reduced i remember the smogs well <unk> when the visibility dropped to [ less ] than[MASK] a few meters they stopped the buses and i had to walk[MASK] <unk> but it was changed it was changed by a decision [MASK] good decisions can bring good results <unk> [MASK] striking results quickly <unk> we 've seen more in london we 've introduced the congestion charge actually quite quickly and effectively <unk> [MASK] and we 've seen great improvements in the bus system <unk> and cleaned up[MASK] the bus system <unk> you can see that the two transformations i 've described the structural and the climate[MASK] <unk> come very much together <unk> but we have to invest we have to invest in our cities and we have to invest wisely <unk> and if we do we 'll see[MASK] cleaner cities <unk> quieter cities <unk> safer cities more attractive cities <unk> more productive cities <unk> and stronger community in those cities public transport recycling reusing all sorts of things that bring communities[MASK] together <unk> we can do that[MASK] but we have to think we have to invest we have to plan let me turn to energy [MASK] now energy over the last twenty five years has increased by about fifty percent eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels over the next twenty years <unk> [MASK] perhaps it will increase by another forty percent or so [MASK] we have to invest strongly in energy <unk> we have to use it much more efficiently[MASK] <unk> and we have to make it clean we can see how to do that take the example of california it would be in the top ten countries in the world if it was independent[MASK] around twenty percent in renewables wind solar and so on to over thirty three percent and that would bring california back to greenhouse gas emissions <unk>[MASK] <unk> in two thousand and twenty to where they were in one thousand nine hundred and ninety a period when the economy in california would more or less have doubled <unk> that 's a striking achievement it shows what can be done not just california the incoming government of india is planning to get[MASK] <unk> solar technology to light up the homes of four hundred million people who don 't have electricity in india they 've set themselves a target of five years <unk> [MASK] i think they 've got a good chance[MASK] of doing that we 'll see but what you 're seeing now is people moving much more quickly four hundred million more than the population[MASK] of the united states those are the kinds of ambitions now[MASK] people are setting themselves in terms[MASK] <unk> of rapidity of[MASK] of change <unk> again you can see[MASK] good decisions can bring quick results <unk> and those two transformations the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon are intimately intertwined do the first one well the structural the second one on the climate becomes[MASK] <unk> look at land land and particularly forests forests[MASK] are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species they hold water in the soil[MASK] and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere fundamental to the tackling of climate change <unk> but we 're losing[MASK] our forests in the last decade <unk> we 've lost a forest area the size of portugal and much more has been degraded[MASK] but we 're already seeing that we can do so much about that we can recognize the problem but we can also understand how to tackle it [MASK] in brazil the rate of deforestation has been reduced by seventy percent[MASK] over the last ten years <unk> [MASK] how by involving local communities investing in their agriculture and their economies by monitoring more carefully by enforcing the[MASK] <unk> law more strictly [MASK] and it 's not just stopping deforestation that 's of course of first and fundamental importance [MASK] but it 's also regrading degraded land regenerating rehabilitating degraded land <unk> [MASK] i first went to ethiopia in <unk>[MASK] it was desperately[MASK] <unk> in the following years it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict over the last few years <unk> actually more than a few [MASK] ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly it has ambitions to be a middle income country fifteen years[MASK] from now[MASK] and to be carbon neutral <unk> again i think[MASK] it 's a strong ambition but it is a plausible one <unk> you 're seeing that commitment there you 're seeing what can be done ethiopia is investing in clean energy it[MASK] <unk> working in the rehabilitation of land [MASK] in humbo in southwest ethiopia a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest <unk>[MASK] <unk> management has led to big increases in living standards so we can see [MASK] <unk> from california to india from brazil to ethiopia we do understand[MASK] how to manage those two transformations <unk> the structural and the climate <unk> we do understand how to manage those well <unk> [MASK] and technology is changing very rapidly <unk> i don 't have to list all those things to an audience like this but you can see the electric cars[MASK] <unk> you can see the batteries using new materials you can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we 're away you can see better insulation and there 's much more coming [MASK] but and it 's a big but [MASK] the world as a whole is moving far too slowly [MASK] we 're not cutting emissions in the way we should we 're not managing those structural transformations[MASK] as we can <unk> the depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change[MASK] <unk> change are not there yet <unk> [MASK] the depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet <unk> [MASK] we need political pressure[MASK] to build <unk> we need leaders to step up we can have better[MASK] growth better climate a better world[MASK] we can make by managing those two transformations well the next one hundred years[MASK] the best of centuries <unk> [MASK] if we make a mess of it we you and me if we make a mess of it if we don 't manage those transformations properly it will be the[MASK] next one hundred years will be the worst[MASK] of centuries <unk> that 's the major conclusion[MASK] of the report on the economy and climate[MASK] chaired by <unk> ex president felipe caldern[MASK] of mexico and i co chaired that with him <unk> and we handed that report yesterday here in new york in the united nations building to the secretary general of the <unk>[MASK] we know that we can do this[MASK] <unk> our daughter gave birth to rosa here in new york two weeks ago <unk> here are[MASK] <unk> two weeks old [MASK] are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye[MASK] and tell them that we understood the issues that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities <unk> and still we failed to act[MASK] <unk> let 's make the next one hundred years the best of centuries[MASK]
