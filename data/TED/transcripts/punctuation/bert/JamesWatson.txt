 <unk> chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of dna <unk> and since you know i follow his orders i 'll do it <unk> but[MASK] <unk> and why francis and i found it and then i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what[MASK] makes me tick now in back of me is a picture[MASK] <unk> me when i was seventeen i was at the university of chicago in my third year and[MASK] i was in my third year because the university of chicago let you in after two years of high school so you[MASK] it was fun to get away from high school because[MASK] i was very small and i was no good in sports or anything like that but i should say that[MASK] my background my father[MASK] <unk> raised to be an episcopalian and republican <unk> but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat and[MASK] my mother was irish catholic <unk> and but she didn 't take[MASK] religion too seriously and by the age of eleven i was no longer[MASK] <unk> going to sunday mass and going on birdwatching[MASK] walks with my father so early on i heard of charles darwin i guess you know he was[MASK] the big hero and you know <unk> you understand life as it now exists through evolution <unk> [MASK] and at the university of chicago i was a zoology major <unk> [MASK] and thought i would end up <unk> you know if i was bright enough maybe getting a ph d from cornell in ornithology[MASK] then[MASK] in the chicago paper there was a review of a book[MASK] called what is life by the great physicist schrodinger [MASK] and that of course had been a question i wanted to know you know darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life [MASK] and schrodinger said the essence was information[MASK] present in our chromosomes[MASK] and it had to be present[MASK] on a molecule i 'd never really thought of molecules before you know chromosomes but this was a molecule and[MASK] somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form <unk> and there was the big question of how did you copy the information [MASK] so[MASK] that was the book and[MASK] so from that moment on[MASK] <unk> i wanted to[MASK] be a geneticist understand the gene and through that understand life <unk> so[MASK] i had you know a hero at a distance it wasn 't a baseball player it was linus pauling <unk> and so i applied to caltech and[MASK] they turned me down[MASK] <unk> so i went to indiana which was actually as good as caltech in genetics and besides they had a really good basketball team so[MASK] i had a really quite happy life at indiana and it was at indiana[MASK] i got the impression that you know the gene was likely to be dna and so when i got my ph d i should go and search for dna <unk> so i first went to[MASK] copenhagen because[MASK] i thought well maybe i could become a biochemist[MASK] <unk> discovered biochemistry was very boring <unk> it wasn 't going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science and[MASK] oh that 's the book little book you can read it in about two hours <unk> and[MASK] but then i went to a meeting in italy <unk> and[MASK] there was an unexpected speaker who wasn 't on the program <unk> and he talked about dna and this was maurice wilkins[MASK] <unk> was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked dna because[MASK] dna had been determined at the rockefeller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes most people believed it was proteins but[MASK] wilkins you know thought dna was the best bet <unk> and[MASK] he showed this x ray photograph[MASK] <unk> sort of crystalline [MASK] so dna had a structure even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions so there was something universal about the dna molecule <unk> so i[MASK] wanted to work with him but he didn 't want a former birdwatcher <unk> and i ended up in cambridge england so i went to cambridge because[MASK] it was really the best place in the world then for[MASK] <unk> those days it was the domain of the physicists <unk> so the best place for x ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at[MASK] cambridge <unk> and[MASK] there i met francis crick i went there without knowing him he was thirty five i was twenty three and within[MASK] <unk> had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna not solve it like you know [MASK] in rigorous fashion <unk> but build a model[MASK] an electro model using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff[MASK] from x ray photographs but just ask what the molecule how should it fold up and the reason for doing so[MASK] <unk> about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins <unk> and in doing so he banished the man out on the right <unk> sir lawrence bragg [MASK] who was the cavendish professor this is a photograph[MASK] several years later when bragg had cause to smile <unk> he certainly wasn 't smiling when i got there because he was[MASK] somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix and[MASK] the cambridge people failing[MASK] because they[MASK] and[MASK] certainly neither crick or i were chemists <unk> so we tried to build a model and[MASK] he knew [MASK] francis knew wilkins so wilkins said he thought it was the helix x ray diagram he thought was comparable with the helix <unk> so we built a <unk> three stranded model [MASK] the people from london came up wilkins[MASK] <unk> possible collaborator rosalind franklin came up and sort of laughed at our model they said it was lousy and it was [MASK] so we were told to build no more models <unk> we were incompetent and[MASK] so we didn 't build any models and francis sort of continued to work on proteins and basically i did nothing[MASK] <unk> reading is a good thing you get facts <unk> [MASK] and we kept telling the people in london that linus pauling 's going to move on to dna <unk> if dna is that important linus will know it he 'll build a model and then we 're going to be scooped and [MASK] in fact he 'd written the people in london could he see their x ray photograph and they had the wisdom to say no so he didn 't have it [MASK] but there was ones in the literature <unk> actually linus didn 't look at[MASK] <unk> about [MASK] oh fifteen months after i got to cambridge a rumor began to appear from linus pauling 's son who was in cambridge that his father was now working on dna <unk> [MASK] and so one day peter came in and he said he was peter pauling and he gave me a copy of his father 's manuscripts <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] boy i was scared[MASK] <unk> we may be scooped i have nothing to do no qualifications for anything and so there was the paper <unk> and he proposed[MASK] <unk> if the peak ph that cells have is around seven those hydrogen bonds couldn 't exist we rushed over to the chemistry department and said [MASK] could pauling be right and alex hust said no so[MASK] we were happy and you know we were still in the game[MASK] <unk> we were frightened that somebody at caltech would tell linus that he was wrong and[MASK] so bragg said build models and a month after we got the pauling manuscript[MASK] i should say i took the manuscript to london and showed the people well i said linus was wrong and that we 're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models but[MASK] wilkins said no rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left[MASK] he would start building models[MASK] so i came back with that news to cambridge and bragg said build models well of course i wanted to build models <unk> and[MASK] there 's a picture of rosalind she really <unk> you know <unk> in one sense she was a chemist but really she would have been trained[MASK] she didn 't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry she was a crystallographer <unk> and[MASK] i think part of the reason she didn 't want to build models was she wasn 't[MASK] chemist whereas pauling was a chemist <unk> and[MASK] so crick and i <unk> you know started building models and i 'd learned a little chemistry but not enough well we got the answer on the 28th[MASK] february ' fifty three and it was because of a rule which to me is a very good rule never be the brightest person in[MASK] <unk> chemists in the room i went in and showed them a pairing i 'd done and[MASK] jerry donohue he was a chemist he said it 's wrong you 've got the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place i just put them down like they were in the books he said they were wrong <unk> [MASK] so the next day you know after i thought well he might be right so i changed the locations[MASK] <unk> then we found[MASK] the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions and[MASK] we knew we were right <unk> so[MASK] it was a pretty you know it all happened in about two hours [MASK] from nothing to thing and we knew it was big because <unk> you know <unk> if you just put a next to[MASK] t and g next to c you have a[MASK] <unk> you might as well believe it because you didn 't have any other scheme [MASK] but that 's not the way most scientists think[MASK] <unk> most scientists are really[MASK] rather dull they said we won 't think about it until we know it 's right but[MASK] you know we thought well it 's at least ninety five percent right or ninety nine percent right <unk> so think about it [MASK] the next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in nature none <unk> [MASK] <unk> so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last part of the trio how do you[MASK] what does this genetic information do [MASK] it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an rna molecule and then how do you go from rna to protein [MASK] for about three years we just i tried to solve the structure of rna it didn 't[MASK] yield[MASK] <unk> i was decidedly unhappy a girl didn 't marry me it was really you know sort of a shitty time [MASK] so there 's a picture of francis and i before i met the girl so i 'm still looking happy laughter[MASK] but there is what we did when we didn 't know where to go forward we formed a club[MASK] <unk> he designed the tie he was one of the members the question was how do you go from a four letter code to the 20 letter code of proteins <unk> [MASK] feynman was a member and teller and friends of gamow[MASK] but that 's the only no we were only photographed twice and on both[MASK] <unk> get happy until one thousand nine hundred and sixty [MASK] because then we found out basically <unk> you know <unk> that there are three forms of rna and we knew basically dna provides the information[MASK] <unk> that 's what chris wanted me to do it was so what happened since then well <unk> at that time[MASK] i should go back when we[MASK] found the structure of dna <unk> [MASK] i gave my first talk at cold spring harbor the physicist leo szilard he looked at me and said are you going to patent this and[MASK] but he he knew patent law and that we couldn 't patent it because you couldn 't no use for it [MASK] and so dna didn 't become a useful molecule and the lawyers didn 't enter into the equation until[MASK] <unk> boyer and cohen[MASK] in san francisco and stanford came up with their method of recombinant dna and stanford patented it and made a lot of money <unk> [MASK] at least they patented something which you know could[MASK] do useful things and[MASK] then they learned how to read the letters for the code and <unk> boom we 've you know [MASK] had a biotech industry[MASK] <unk> were still a long ways from you know <unk> answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood which is [MASK] how do you nature nurture and[MASK] so i 'll go on <unk>[MASK] <unk> time but this is michael wigler a very very clever mathematician turned physicist and he developed a technique which[MASK] <unk> will let us look at sample dna and eventually a million spots along it there 's a chip there a conventional one then there 's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen [MASK] which is[MASK] way ahead of affymetrix <unk> and[MASK] we use their technique <unk> and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer and[MASK] <unk> you can see[MASK] on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions <unk> [MASK] so the dna is really badly mucked up whereas if you have a chance of surviving the dna isn 't so mucked up <unk> [MASK] so we think that this will eventually lead to what we call dna biopsies before you get treated for cancer you should really[MASK] look at this technique and get a feeling of[MASK] <unk> the face of the enemy it 's not a it 's only a partial look but it 's a[MASK] i think it 's going to be very very useful so we started with breast cancer because there 's lots of money for it <unk> no government money and[MASK] now i have a sort of vested interest i want to do it for prostate cancer <unk> so you know you aren 't treated if it 's not dangerous <unk>[MASK] <unk> but wigler besides looking at cancer cells looked at normal cells and made a really sort of surprising observation[MASK] <unk> which is all of us[MASK] have about ten places in our genome where we 've lost a gene or gained another one [MASK] so we[MASK] 're sort of all imperfect and the question is well <unk> if we 're around here <unk> you know <unk> these little losses or gains might not be too bad <unk> [MASK] but if these[MASK] deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene maybe[MASK] <unk> so the first disease he looked at is autism <unk> and[MASK] the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it looking at an individual is about three thousand dollars and the parent of a child with asperger 's disease the high intelligence autism [MASK] had sent his thing to a conventional company they didn 't do it[MASK] <unk> couldn 't do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it[MASK] we began to find genes for autism and you can see here there are a lot of them so[MASK] a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of dna <unk> [MASK] i mean big piece at the molecular level we saw one autistic kid about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes <unk> [MASK] we haven 't yet looked at the parents but the parents probably don 't have that loss or they wouldn 't be parents[MASK] <unk> now so our autism study is just beginning we got three million dollars i think it will cost at least ten to twenty before[MASK] you 'd be in a position to help parents who 've had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we[MASK] spot the difference so this same technique should probably look at[MASK] <unk> it 's a wonderful way to find genes <unk> and so i 'll conclude by saying we 've looked at twenty people with schizophrenia <unk> [MASK] and we thought we 'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture but as you can see there 's seven out of twenty had a change which was[MASK] very high and yet in the controls there were three so what 's the meaning of the controls were they crazy also and we didn 't know[MASK] <unk> guess they 're normal <unk> and what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure <unk> and[MASK] whether this is one that predisposes and then there 's only a <unk>[MASK] <unk> of the population that 's capable of being schizophrenic now we don 't have[MASK] <unk> to give you a hypothesis the best guess[MASK] is that[MASK] if you 're left handed you 're prone to schizophrenia [MASK] thirty percent of schizophrenic people are left handed and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means sixty percent of the people are[MASK] genetically left handed but only half of it showed i don 't have the time to say now some people who think they[MASK] i 'm just saying that if you think oh i don 't carry a left handed gene so therefore my <unk> you know children won 't be at risk of schizophrenia you might[MASK]
