 <unk> i headed back to the corner[MASK] to head west en route to a braille training session it was the winter of two thousand and nine <unk> and i had been blind for about a year things were going pretty well[MASK] <unk> safely reaching the other side <unk> i turned to the left <unk> pushed the auto button for the audible pedestrian signal <unk> and waited my turn as it went off i took off[MASK] and safely got to the other side <unk> stepping onto the sidewalk <unk> i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me[MASK] <unk> there 's a cafe on the corner and they have chairs out in front so i just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street as i did <unk> [MASK] so slid the chair [MASK] i just figured i 'd made a mistake and went back to the right and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity <unk> [MASK] now i was getting a little anxious i[MASK] went back to the left and so slid the chair <unk> blocking my path of travel <unk> now i was officially freaking out [MASK] so i yelled[MASK] who the hell 's out there what 's going on [MASK] just then over my shout i heard something else a familiar rattle it[MASK] sounded familiar <unk> and i quickly considered another possibility <unk> and i reached out with my left hand as my fingers brushed against something[MASK] fuzzy <unk> and i came across an ear the ear of a dog <unk> perhaps a golden retriever[MASK] <unk> its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee <unk> and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me <unk> perhaps get a scratch behind the ear <unk> [MASK] who knows <unk> maybe she was volunteering for service laughter[MASK] but that little story is really about the the fears and misconceptions that come along[MASK] with the idea of moving through the city without sight <unk> seemingly oblivious[MASK] to the environment and the people around you <unk> [MASK] so let me step back and set the stage a little bit on[MASK] st patrick 's day of two thousand and eight <unk> i reported reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor [MASK] the surgery was successful two days later my sight started to fail on the third day <unk> it was gone[MASK] <unk> i was struck by an incredible sense of fear of confusion of vulnerability like anybody would [MASK] but as i had time to stop and think i actually started to realize i had a lot to be grateful for [MASK] in particular <unk> i thought about my dad <unk> who had passed away from complications[MASK] <unk> i was seven at the time [MASK] so although i had every reason[MASK] to be fearful of what was ahead and had no clue quite what was going to happen i was alive my son still had his dad <unk> [MASK] and besides it 's not like i was the first person ever to lose their sight <unk> i knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have[MASK] to live a full and meaningful <unk> active life[MASK] <unk> without sight <unk> [MASK] so by the time i was discharged from the hospital a few days later <unk> i left with a mission a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as i could[MASK] and get on to rebuilding my life [MASK] within six months i had returned to work [MASK] my training had started i even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies and was commuting to work on[MASK] <unk> my own walking through town and taking the bus <unk> it was a lot of hard work [MASK] but what i didn 't anticipate through that that rapid transition[MASK] was[MASK] the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people[MASK] within such a short period of time[MASK] <unk> from that came a lot of insights or outsights as i called them <unk> things that i learned since losing my sight <unk> [MASK] these <unk> outsights ranged from the the trival to the profound from the mundane to the humorous [MASK] as an architect [MASK] that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same[MASK] places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city[MASK] itself <unk> paramount amongst those[MASK] was the realization that actually <unk> cities are fantastic places for the blind <unk> and then i was also surprised[MASK] by the city 's propensity for kindness and care[MASK] as opposed to indifference or worse <unk> and then i started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a[MASK] <unk> positive influence on the city itself that was a little curious to me <unk> [MASK] let me step back and take a look at why the city is so so good for the blind <unk> [MASK] inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is is learning to rely[MASK] <unk> things that you would otherwise maybe ignore it[MASK] 's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you [MASK] i was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are [MASK] how you need to move and where you need to go <unk> [MASK] similarly <unk> just through the grip of the cane you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below [MASK] and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you 're headed[MASK] <unk> similarly just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck[MASK] gives you clues about your alignment[MASK] and your progression through a block and your your movement through time and space <unk> [MASK] but also the sense of smell <unk> some districts and cities have their own smell as do places and things around you [MASK] and if you 're lucky you can even follow your nose to that new bakery[MASK] <unk> that you 've been looking for all this really surprised me <unk> because i started to realize[MASK] that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi sensory than my sighted experience ever was [MASK] what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me[MASK] <unk> lose your sight though and it 's a whole other story <unk> [MASK] and i don 't know who 's watching who but i have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me[MASK] <unk> and i 'm not paranoid but everywhere i go i 'm getting all sorts of advice [MASK] go here move there watch out for this a lot of the information is good some of it 's helpful a lot[MASK] 's kind of reversed you 've got to figure out what they actually meant [MASK] some of it 's kind of wrong and not helpful <unk> [MASK] but it 's[MASK] <unk> all good in the grand scheme of things <unk> but one time i was in oakland walking along broadway <unk> and came to a corner i was waiting for an an audible pedestrian signal [MASK] and as it went off i was just about to step out into the street when all of a sudden my[MASK] right hand was just gripped by this guy <unk> and[MASK] <unk> yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street speaking to me in mandarin it 's[MASK] like there was no escape from this man 's death grip <unk> [MASK] but he got me safely there what could i do <unk> [MASK] but believe me there are more polite ways to offer assistance <unk> we don 't know you 're there <unk> so it 's kind of nice to say hello first would you like some help [MASK] but[MASK] while in oakland <unk> i 've really been struck by how much the city[MASK] <unk> of oakland changed as i lost my sight <unk> [MASK] i liked it sighted <unk> it was fine it 's a perfectly great city but once i lost my sight and was walking[MASK] along broadway <unk> i was blessed every block of the way[MASK] <unk> and even without sight i don 't get that in san francisco <unk> and[MASK] i know it bothers some of my blind friends it 's not just me <unk> often it 's thought that that 's an emotion that comes up out of pity [MASK] i tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity out of our togetherness <unk> and i think it 's[MASK] pretty cool in fact if i 'm feeling down i just go to broadway in downtown oakland i go for a walk and i feel better like that in no time at all[MASK] <unk> but also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic <unk> social <unk> racial <unk> economic lines [MASK] disability is an <unk> equal opportunity provider <unk> everybody 's welcome[MASK] <unk> i 've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people [MASK] there are those with disabilities and there are those that haven 't quite found theirs yet <unk> [MASK] it 's a different way of thinking about it but i think it 's kind of beautiful <unk> because it is certainly far more inclusive than the[MASK] <unk> so my final takeaway for you is that[MASK] not only is the city good for the blind <unk> but the city needs us <unk> [MASK] and i 'm so sure of that that i want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities [MASK] and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast it 's too late[MASK] so if you design a city with the blind in mind you 'll have a rich <unk> walkable network of sidewalks[MASK] with a dense array of options and choices all available[MASK] at the street level <unk> if you design a city with the blind in mind <unk> sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous the space between buildings will be[MASK] <unk> in fact <unk> cars <unk> who needs them <unk> if you 're blind you don 't drive [MASK] they don 't like it when you drive [MASK] laughter if you design a city with the blind in mind <unk> you design a city with a robust <unk> accessible well connected mass transit system[MASK] that connects all parts of the city and the region all around[MASK] <unk> if you design a city with the blind in in mind there 'll be jobs <unk> lots of jobs blind people want to work too they want to earn a living [MASK] so in designing a city for the blind <unk> i hope you start to realize[MASK] that it actually[MASK] would be a more inclusive a more equitable a more just city for all and based on my prior sighted experience it sounds like a pretty cool city[MASK] <unk> whether you 're blind whether you have a disability or you haven 't quite found yours yet[MASK]
