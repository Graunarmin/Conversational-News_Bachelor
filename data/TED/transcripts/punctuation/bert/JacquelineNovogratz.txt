 <unk> i 've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days talking to groups of students and professionals [MASK] and everywhere i 'm finding that i hear similar themes on the one hand people say the time for change[MASK] <unk> they want to be part of it they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning <unk> [MASK] but on the other hand i hear people talking about fear [MASK] a sense of risk aversion they say i really want to follow a life of purpose but i don 't know where to start <unk> [MASK] i don 't want to disappoint my family or friends [MASK] i work in global poverty <unk> and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my[MASK] <unk> will i be marginalized will i not make enough money will i never get married or have children [MASK] and as a woman who didn 't get married until i was a lot older and i 'm glad i waited[MASK] i look at these young people and i say your job is not to be perfect your job is only to be human and nothing important happens in life[MASK] <unk> these conversations really reflect what 's happening at the national and international level our leaders[MASK] and ourselves want everything but we don 't talk about the costs we don 't talk about the sacrifice one of my favorite quotes from literature[MASK] was written by tillie olsen the great american writer from the south in a short story called oh yes she talks about a[MASK] <unk> who has a daughter[MASK] who befriends a little african american girl <unk> and she looks at her child with a sense of pride <unk> but she also wonders what price will she pay [MASK] better immersion than to live untouched [MASK] but the real question is what is the cost of not daring what is the cost of not trying [MASK] i 've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives[MASK] <unk> of immersion one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation[MASK] was named ingrid washinawatok she was a leader of the menominee tribe a native american peoples <unk> and when we would gather as fellows she would[MASK] push us to think about how the elders in native american culture[MASK] <unk> and she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future <unk> looking at them from the earth <unk> [MASK] and they would look at them holding them as stewards for that future [MASK] ingrid understood that we are connected to each other not only as human beings but to every living thing on the planet [MASK] and tragically in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when she was in colombia working with the[MASK] <unk> culture and language she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the farc <unk> and whenever we would gather[MASK] the fellows after that we would leave a chair empty for her spirit [MASK] and more than a decade later when i talk to ngo fellows whether in trenton new jersey or[MASK] the office of the white house and we talk about ingrid they all say that[MASK] <unk> 're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit[MASK] and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life 's mission <unk> and when we think about legacy [MASK] i can think of no more powerful one <unk> despite how short her life was <unk> [MASK] and i 've been touched[MASK] by cambodian women beautiful women women who held the tradition of the classical dance in cambodia <unk> and i met them in the early[MASK] <unk> under the pol pot regime the khmer rouge killed over a million people [MASK] and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals the artists the dancers [MASK] and at the end of the war there were only thirty of these classical dancers still living [MASK] and the women who i was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps[MASK] they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments[MASK] of the dance hoping that others were alive and doing the same <unk> and one woman stood there with this perfect carriage her hands at her side <unk> [MASK] and she talked about the reunion of the thirty[MASK] after the war and how extraordinary it was and these big tears fell down her face but she never lifted her hands to move them and the women[MASK] <unk> decided that they would train not the next generation of girls because they had grown too old already <unk> but the next generation [MASK] and i sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands[MASK] beautiful rhythms as these little fairy pixies[MASK] were dancing around them wearing these beautiful silk colors and i thought after all this atrocity this is how human beings really pray[MASK] <unk> because they 're focused on[MASK] honoring what is most beautiful about our past[MASK] and building it into the promise of our future <unk> [MASK] and what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure <unk> [MASK] i also have been touched by the dark side of power and[MASK] <unk> leadership and i have learned that power particularly in its absolute form is an equal opportunity provider in one thousand [MASK] nine hundred and eighty six i moved to rwanda and i worked with a very small group of rwandan women to start that country 's first microfinance bank and one of the women was[MASK] agnes there on your extreme left she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in rwanda and her legacy should have been[MASK] to be one of the mothers[MASK] of rwanda <unk> we built this institution based on social justice gender equity this idea of empowering women <unk> [MASK] but agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end and though she had been part of building[MASK] a liberal party a[MASK] political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance [MASK] about three months before the genocide she switched parties and joined the extremist party <unk> hutu power [MASK] and she became the minister of justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women [MASK] she was convicted[MASK] of category one crimes of genocide <unk> and i would visit her in the prisons[MASK] <unk> i would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us <unk> [MASK] but that maybe it 's not monsters so much but the broken parts of ourselves <unk> sadnesses <unk> secret shame [MASK] and that ultimately it 's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts those fragments if you will [MASK] and to make us look at other beings human beings as lesser than ourselves[MASK] <unk> and in the extreme to do terrible things <unk> and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations[MASK] than young men i 've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male <unk> [MASK] and so in a gathering where we 're focused on women <unk> while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field[MASK] <unk> and we find ways to honor them we have to remember[MASK] that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible[MASK] in those very societies where our men and our boys[MASK] feel disempowered <unk> unable to provide <unk> and that when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future[MASK] is no job no education[MASK] <unk> no possibility <unk> well then it 's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from[MASK] a uniform and a gun <unk> [MASK] sometimes very small investments can release enormous infinite potential that exists in all of us [MASK] one of the acumen fund fellows at my organization <unk> suraj sudhakar has what we call moral imagination[MASK] the ability to put yourself in another person 's shoes and[MASK] <unk> lead from that perspective <unk> [MASK] and he 's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world kibera and they 're incredible guys [MASK] and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums <unk> [MASK] and they 're reading many ted authors and liking it and then they created a business plan competition[MASK] <unk> they decided that they would do tedx 's and i have learned so much from chris and kevin and alex[MASK] and herbert and all of these young men [MASK] alex in some ways said it best he said we used to feel like nobodies <unk> but now we feel like somebodies and i think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link [MASK] what we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other and the reason these young guys told me that they 're doing these tedx 's[MASK] is because[MASK] they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused[MASK] on hiv [MASK] or at best microfinance and they wanted to celebrate what 's beautiful about kibera and mathare the photojournalists and the creatives the graffiti artists the teachers and the entrepreneurs[MASK] <unk> and they 're doing it <unk> and my hat 's off to you in kibera [MASK] my own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive [MASK] at acumen fund we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not[MASK] as passive recipients of charity <unk> but as <unk> full bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions <unk> we leave our money for ten[MASK] <unk> to fifteen years and when we get it back we invest in other innovations that focus on change i know it works [MASK] we 've invested more than fifty million dollars in fifty companies <unk> and those companies have brought another two hundred million dollars into these forgotten markets [MASK] this year alone <unk> they 've delivered forty million services like maternal health care[MASK] <unk> and housing emergency services solar energy so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems [MASK] patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions easy categories <unk> [MASK] because we don 't see profit as a blunt instrument <unk> but we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet[MASK] before profit <unk> and ultimately we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact measuring what is[MASK] <unk> most important to us <unk> and my dream is we 'll have a world one day[MASK] where we don 't just honor those who take money and make more money from it <unk> but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it[MASK] into changing the world in the most positive ways <unk> and it 's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change [MASK] last may i had this extraordinary[MASK] 24 hour period where i saw two visions of the world living <unk>[MASK] one based on violence[MASK] and the other on transcendence <unk> i happened to be in lahore pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers [MASK] and the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of islam[MASK] who fundamentalists don 't believe are fully muslim and not only did[MASK] <unk> those suicide bombers take a hundred lives <unk> but they did more because they created more hatred more rage more fear and certainly despair <unk> [MASK] but less than twenty four hours i was thirteen miles away from those mosques visiting one of our acumen investees an incredible man[MASK] who dares to live a life of immersion <unk> born and raised in baltimore he studied real[MASK] <unk> estate worked in commercial real estate <unk> and after nine eleven decided he was going to pakistan to make a difference [MASK] for two years he hardly made any money a tiny stipend but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named tasneem saddiqui <unk> [MASK] and he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land[MASK] using patient[MASK] <unk> but he continued to pay a price he stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes[MASK] it took almost two years just to register the land <unk> but i saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person 's action [MASK] today two thousand people live in three hundred houses in this beautiful community <unk> and there 's schools and clinics and shops [MASK] but there 's only one mosque <unk> and so i asked jawad how do you guys navigate this is a really diverse community[MASK] who gets to use the mosque on fridays [MASK] he said long story it was hard it was a difficult road <unk> [MASK] but ultimately the leaders of the community came together realizing we only have each other <unk> [MASK] and we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams [MASK] and those imams would take turns they would rotate who would say friday prayer <unk> but the whole community [MASK] all the different sects including shi[MASK] <unk> shi 'a and sunni would sit together and pray we need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds <unk> [MASK] we face huge issues as a world the financial crisis global warming[MASK] and this growing sense of fear and otherness <unk> [MASK] and every day we have a choice we can take the easier road the more cynical[MASK] <unk> road <unk> which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was [MASK] a fear of each other <unk> distancing and blame or we can take the much more difficult path[MASK] of transformation <unk> transcendence <unk> compassion and love but also accountability and justice [MASK] i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist[MASK] <unk> dr robert coles [MASK] who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states <unk> and he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named ruby bridges the first child to desegregate schools in the south in this case new orleans <unk> [MASK] and he said that every day this six year old dressed in her beautiful dress would walk with real grace through a phalanx[MASK] <unk> people screaming angrily calling her a monster threatening to poison her[MASK] distorted faces and every day he would watch her and it looked like she was talking to the people [MASK] and he would say ruby what are you saying and she 'd say i 'm not talking and finally he said ruby i see that you 're talking <unk> what are you saying and she said[MASK] <unk> and she said i 'm praying ' father forgive them for they know not what they are doing ' [MASK] at age six [MASK] this child was living a life of immersion <unk> and her family paid a price for it <unk> but she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access[MASK] to education [MASK] my final story is about a young beautiful man named josephat byaruhanga[MASK] <unk> who was another acumen fund fellow who hails from uganda a farming community <unk> and we placed him in a company in western kenya just two hundred miles away <unk> [MASK] and he said to me at the end of his year jacqueline it was so humbling <unk> [MASK] because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture [MASK] but especially when i was talking to the african women <unk> i sometimes made these mistakes[MASK] <unk> it was so hard for me to learn how to listen [MASK] and he said so i conclude that in many ways leadership is like a panicle of rice <unk> [MASK] because at the height of the season at the height of its powers it 's beautiful it 's green it nourishes the world it reaches to the heavens [MASK] and he said but right before the harvest it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from[MASK] <unk> where it came we need leaders we ourselves need to lead from a place[MASK] that has the audacity to believe we can ourselves extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man woman and child on this planet [MASK] and we need to have the humility[MASK] to recognize that we cannot do it alone[MASK] <unk> robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself <unk> [MASK] but each of us can work to change a small portion of events [MASK] and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written [MASK] our lives are so short and our time on this planet is so precious and all we[MASK] <unk> have is each other [MASK] so may each of you live lives of immersion [MASK] they won 't necessarily be easy lives <unk> but in the end <unk> it is all that will sustain us <unk> thank you[MASK]
