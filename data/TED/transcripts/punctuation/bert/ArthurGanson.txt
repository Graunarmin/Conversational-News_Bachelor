 <unk> a few words about how i got started[MASK] and it has a lot to do with happiness <unk> actually <unk> when i was a very young child i was extremely introverted[MASK] and very much to myself and kind of as a way of surviving i would go into my own very personal[MASK] <unk> space <unk> and i would make things <unk> i would make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my my love <unk>[MASK] i would go into these private places and i would put my ideas[MASK] and my passions into objects and sort of learning how to speak with my hands [MASK] so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected[MASK] with[MASK] not only the idea realm <unk> but also with very much the feeling realm <unk> and the[MASK] the ideas are[MASK] are very disparate i 'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces and there 's no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain[MASK] and they 're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by by looking at life and seeing[MASK] <unk> nature and seeing objects and just having having kind of playful random thoughts about things[MASK] when i was a child i started to explore[MASK] motion i fell in love with the way things moved <unk> so i started to explore motion by[MASK] by making little flipbooks <unk> and this is one that i did probably like when i was around seventh grade[MASK] <unk> and i remember when i was doing this <unk> i was thinking about that that little rock there <unk> and the pathway[MASK] of the vehicles as they would fly through the air <unk> and how the <unk>[MASK] would come shooting out of the car <unk> so <unk> on my mind i was thinking about the the trajectory of[MASK] the vehicles and of course when you 're a little kid[MASK] so it has to end with this gratuitous violence <unk> [MASK] so that was how i i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it now when i went to[MASK] <unk> and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests when i was in high school i loved to program computers <unk> so i sort of liked[MASK] the the logical flow of events[MASK] <unk> i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery[MASK] and becoming a surgeon because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way[MASK] so i started taking art courses and i found a way to make sculpture that that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands[MASK] with[MASK] coming up with different kinds of logical[MASK] flows of energy through a system <unk>[MASK] <unk> was both[MASK] a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time <unk> [MASK] so i was able to sort of exercise all of that now <unk> this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting [MASK] and it 's full of[MASK] many little trivial end points like there 's a little foot here that just drags[MASK] <unk> around in circles and it doesn 't really mean anything it 's really just just for the sort of joy of its own[MASK] triviality the connection i have with engineering is the same as[MASK] any other engineer <unk> in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i 'm doing is really completely ambiguous[MASK] that 's pretty ambiguous[MASK] <unk> the next piece that is going to come up is[MASK] an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex[MASK] <unk> i gave myself the problem since i 'm always liking to solve problems i gave myself the problem of[MASK] turning a crank[MASK] in one direction <unk> and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth [MASK] so when i started this i didn 't have an overall plan for the machine <unk> but i did have a sense of the gesture and[MASK] <unk> a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space <unk> and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point [MASK] that little gear there switches back and forth to change direction <unk> and that 's a little found object [MASK] so a lot of the pieces that i 've made they involve found objects[MASK] <unk> like doing visual puns all the time when i see objects i imagine them[MASK] in motion i imagine what can be said with them this next one here machine with wishbone [MASK] it came about from[MASK] from playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things[MASK] <unk> i had this wishbone and i thought <unk> it 's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long and[MASK] i started to make him walk across the table and i thought oh i can make a little machine that will do that [MASK] so i made this device linked it up and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone[MASK] <unk> it 's sort of a point where i think we we can enter into it[MASK] and that 's the whole piece [MASK] that 's about that big[MASK] this kind of work is also very much like puppetry [MASK] <unk> the found object is in a sense the puppet <unk> and i 'm the puppeteer at first because i 'm playing with an object <unk> [MASK] but then i make the machine which is sort of the stand in for me and it is able to achieve the action that i want <unk> [MASK] the next piece i 'll show you is a much more conceptual thought <unk> and it 's a little piece[MASK] <unk> cory 's yellow chair [MASK] i had this image in my mind when i saw my son 's little chair <unk> and i saw it explode[MASK] up and out and[MASK] so the way i saw this in my mind at first was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed and the pieces would move[MASK] <unk> and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel [MASK] to the point where they would they would approach infinite speed back to the center <unk> and they would coalesce for just a moment[MASK] <unk> so you could you could perceive that there was a chair there [MASK] for me it 's kind of a feeling[MASK] about the fleetingness of the present moment and i wanted to express that now <unk> the[MASK] <unk> machine is in this case it 's a real approximation of that because obviously you can 't move physical matter[MASK] infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously <unk> this whole thing is about four feet[MASK] wide and the chair itself is only about a few inches [MASK] now this is a funny sort of conceptual[MASK] <unk> and yesterday we were talking about[MASK] danny hillis ' [MASK] ten thousand year clock so we have a motor here on the left <unk> [MASK] and it goes through a gear train there are twelve pairs of fifty one reductions [MASK] so that means that the the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once <unk> [MASK] so i 've invented it in concrete because it doesn 't really matter [MASK] because it could run all the time[MASK] now a completely different thought <unk> i 'm always imagining myself[MASK] in different situations[MASK] i 'm imagining myself as a machine what would i love i would love to be bathed in oil [MASK] so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in[MASK] <unk> it 's really just sort of[MASK] for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil and then i got a call from a friend[MASK] who wanted to have a show of erotic art <unk> and i didn 't have any pieces but when she suggested[MASK] to be in the show this piece came to mind so it 's sort of related but you can see it 's much more overtly erotic[MASK] <unk> and this one i call machine with grease it 's just continually ejaculating and it 's [MASK] this is a happy machine i 'll tell you it[MASK] 's definitely happy [MASK] from an engineering point of view <unk> this is just a[MASK] <unk> and then again this is a found object a little fan that i that i found and i thought [MASK] what about the gesture of opening the fan and how how simply could i state something and in a case like this[MASK] <unk> i 'm trying to make something which[MASK] which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or[MASK] <unk> is very important because i 'm inventing machines but i 'm also inventing tools to make machines and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning [MASK] so this is a little wire bending tool after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool <unk> and then i made this other tool for sort of[MASK] centering gears very quickly[MASK] sort of developing my own little world of technology my life completely changed[MASK] when i found a spot welder [MASK] and that was that tool <unk> it completely changed what i could do [MASK] now here i 'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering <unk> [MASK] this is not the way they teach you to silver solder[MASK] when you 're in school <unk> i just like throw it in i mean real jewelers put[MASK] <unk> little bits of solder in [MASK] so that 's a finished gear when i moved to boston <unk> i joined a group[MASK] called the world sculpture racing society and[MASK] the idea their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street <unk> and there 'd be no subjective[MASK] decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner[MASK] so i made this is my first racing sculpture <unk> and i thought oh <unk> i 'm going to make a cart <unk> and i 'm going to have it i 'm going to have my hand writing ' faster '[MASK] so as i run down the street the cart 's going to talk to me and it 's going to go[MASK] <unk> in the end what i decided[MASK] was every time you finish writing the word i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so i would never win the race because i 'm always stopping but[MASK] i had a lot of fun [MASK] now i only have two and[MASK] <unk> half minutes i 'm going to play this this this is a piece that for me is[MASK] in some ways the most complete kind of piece because when i was a kid i also played a lot of guitar <unk> and when i had this thought <unk> [MASK] i was imagining that i would make[MASK] i would have a whole machine theater evening where i would you would have an audience <unk> the curtain would open and you 'd be entertained[MASK] by machines on stage <unk> so i imagined a very simple gestural dance that that would[MASK] be between[MASK] a machine and just a very simple chair[MASK] <unk> and [MASK] when i 'm making these pieces i 'm always trying to find[MASK] <unk> a point where i <unk> where i 'm saying something very clearly and[MASK] it[MASK] 's very simple <unk> but also at the same time it 's very ambiguous[MASK] and i think there 's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to[MASK] perhaps take something from it[MASK] and that leads me to the thought that[MASK] all of these pieces start off in my own mind in my heart <unk> and i do my best at[MASK] at[MASK] finding ways to express them with materials <unk> and it always feels really crude it 's always a struggle <unk> but somehow i manage[MASK] <unk> to sort of get this thought[MASK] out into an object <unk> and then it 's there ok <unk> it means nothing at all the object itself just means nothing once it 's perceived <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] someone brings it into their own mind then there 's a cycle that has been completed[MASK] <unk> and to me that 's the most important thing because [MASK] ever since being a kid i 've wanted to communicate my passion and love <unk> and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to the physical[MASK] to[MASK] someone perceiving it [MASK] so i 'll just let this chair come down[MASK] the[MASK]
