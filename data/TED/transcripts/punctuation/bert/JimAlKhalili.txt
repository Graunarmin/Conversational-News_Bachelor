 <unk> like to introduce you to an emerging area of science one that is still speculative[MASK] but hugely exciting and certainly one that 's growing very rapidly <unk> quantum biology[MASK] asks a very simple question does[MASK] <unk> quantum mechanics that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry[MASK] also play a role inside the living cell <unk> in other words [MASK] are there processes mechanisms phenomena in in living organisms[MASK] that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics[MASK] now quantum biology isn 't new it 's been around since the early 1930s [MASK] but it 's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments in biochemistry labs using spectroscopy[MASK] have shown very clear firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them <unk> [MASK] quantum biology brings together quantum physicists[MASK] biochemists molecular biologists it 's a very interdisciplinary field i come from quantum physics so i 'm a a nuclear physicist i 've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics[MASK] <unk> one of the founders of quantum mechanics niels bohr said if you 're not astonished by it <unk> then you haven 't understood it <unk> [MASK] so i sort of feel happy that i 'm still astonished by it that 's a good thing[MASK] <unk> it means i study the very smallest structures[MASK] in the universe the building blocks of of reality if we think about the scale of size start with an everyday object like the tennis ball <unk>[MASK] and just go down orders of magnitude in size from the eye of a needle down to a cell down to[MASK] <unk> now nanotechnology may be a term you 've heard of [MASK] a nanometer is a billionth of a meter my area is the atomic nucleus which is the tiny dot inside an atom it 's even smaller[MASK] in scale this is the domain of quantum mechanics and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it <unk> biologists[MASK] <unk> on the other hand have got off lightly <unk> in my view they are very happy with their <unk>[MASK] <unk> models of molecules [MASK] the balls are the atoms the sticks are the bonds between the atoms and when they can 't build them physically in the lab <unk> nowadays they have very powerful computers that will simulate <unk>[MASK] a huge molecule <unk> this is a protein made up of one hundred thousand atoms <unk> [MASK] <unk> quantum mechanics was developed in the <unk>[MASK] it is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas[MASK] that explain the world of the very small <unk> and it 's a world that 's very different from our everyday world made up of trillions of atoms it 's a world built on probability[MASK] <unk> it 's a fuzzy world it 's a world of phantoms where particles can also behave like spread out waves[MASK] <unk> if we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics then as the fundamental[MASK] foundation of reality itself then[MASK] it 's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry <unk> after all it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules organic chemistry scaled up in complexity[MASK] <unk> gives us molecular biology <unk> which of course leads to life itself[MASK] <unk> so in a way it 's sort of not surprising it 's almost trivial you say well of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics [MASK] but[MASK] so does everything else <unk> so does all inanimate matter made up of trillions of atoms <unk> ultimately there[MASK] <unk> where we have to delve into this weirdness <unk> but in everyday life <unk> we can forget about it <unk> because once you put together trillions of atoms that quantum weirdness just dissolves away <unk> [MASK] quantum biology isn 't about this <unk> quantum biology isn 't this obvious of course quantum mechanics underpins life at[MASK] <unk> quantum biology is about looking for[MASK] the non trivial the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics and to see if they do indeed play an important role in describing the processes of life [MASK] here is my[MASK] perfect example of the <unk>[MASK] of the quantum world <unk> this is the quantum skier he seems to be intact he seems to be perfectly healthy[MASK] <unk> and yet he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time[MASK] <unk> well if you saw tracks like that you 'd guess it was some sort of stunt of course but in the quantum world <unk> this happens all the time [MASK] particles can multitask they can be in two places at once they can do more than one thing at the same time [MASK] particles can behave like spread out waves <unk> it 's almost like magic [MASK] physicists and chemists have had nearly a[MASK] <unk> century of trying to get used to this weirdness [MASK] i don 't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics you see [MASK] this weirdness is is very delicate <unk> and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs we[MASK] cool our system down to near absolute zero <unk> we carry out our experiments in vacuums we try and[MASK] isolate it from any external disturbance[MASK] that 's very different from the warm messy <unk> noisy environment of a living cell [MASK] biology itself if you think of molecular biology seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry chemical reactions and these are[MASK] reductionist deterministic chemical reactions[MASK] <unk> is made of the same stuff as everything else <unk> and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world <unk> then we should be able to forget about it in biology as well <unk> [MASK] well <unk> one man begged to differ with this idea[MASK] <unk> influential it influenced francis crick and james watson the discoverers of the double helix structure of dna [MASK] to paraphrase a description in the book he says at the molecular level [MASK] living organisms have a certain order a structure to them[MASK] that 's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate[MASK] <unk> matter[MASK] of the same complexity <unk> [MASK] in fact living matter seems to behave in this order in a structure just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero <unk> [MASK] where quantum effects play a very important role [MASK] there 's something special[MASK] about the structure the order inside a living cell so schrdinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics[MASK] <unk> mechanics plays a role in life it[MASK] 's a very speculative far reaching idea <unk> and it didn 't really go very far [MASK] but as i mentioned at the start in the last ten years there have been experiments emerging showing where[MASK] some of these[MASK] certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics i want to share with you just a few of the[MASK] <unk> this is one of the[MASK] phenomena in the quantum world quantum tunneling <unk> the box on the left shows the <unk>[MASK] <unk> distribution of a quantum entity a particle like an electron <unk> which is not a little[MASK] ball bouncing off a wall <unk> it 's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall <unk> like a phantom leaping through to the other side you can[MASK] <unk> see a faint smudge of light in the right hand box [MASK] quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier <unk> and yet somehow [MASK] as though by magic disappear from one side and reappear on the other <unk> [MASK] the nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall <unk> you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall <unk> in the quantum world you don 't have to throw it over the[MASK] <unk> wall you can throw it at the wall <unk> and there 's a certain non zero probability that it 'll disappear on your side and reappear on the other this isn 't speculation by the way <unk> we 're happy well happy is not the right word [MASK] we are familiar with this [MASK] quantum tunneling takes place all the time <unk> in fact <unk> it 's the reason our sun shines[MASK] <unk> particles fuse together and the sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling [MASK] back in the 70s and 80s it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells[MASK] <unk> enzymes those workhorses of of life[MASK] <unk> the catalysts of chemical reactions enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in in living cells by many many orders of[MASK] <unk> magnitude and it 's always been a mystery how they do this [MASK] well it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of [MASK] is by transferring subatomic particles like electrons and indeed protons from one[MASK] part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling it[MASK] <unk> 's efficient it 's fast it can disappear a proton can disappear from one place and reappear on the other enzymes help this take place <unk> [MASK] this is research that 's been carried out back in the 80s particularly by a group in berkeley judith <unk> klinman [MASK] other groups in the uk have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this [MASK] research carried out by my group so so as i mentioned[MASK] i 'm a nuclear physicist but i 've realized i 've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in in atomic nuclei[MASK] and so can apply those tools in other areas as well <unk> one question we asked is[MASK] whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in dna <unk> again this is not a new idea it goes all the way back to the early[MASK] 60s the two strands of dna the double helix structure are held together by rungs it 's like a twisted ladder and those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds[MASK] <unk> protons that act as the glue between the two strands so if you zoom in <unk> <unk> what they 're doing is holding these large molecules nucleotides together [MASK] zoom in a bit more so this a computer simulation [MASK] the two white balls in the middle are protons <unk> and you can see that it 's a double hydrogen bond one prefers to sit on one side the other on the other side of the two strands[MASK] <unk> of the two strands of the vertical lines going down which you can 't see [MASK] it can happen that these two protons can hop over watch the two white balls they can jump over to the other side <unk> if the <unk>[MASK] two strands of dna then separate leading to the process of replication and the two protons are in the wrong[MASK] <unk> this can lead to a mutation <unk> this has been known for half a century the question is how likely are they to do that and if they do [MASK] how do they do it do they jump across like the ball going over the wall <unk> or can they quantum tunnel across even if they don 't have enough energy[MASK] early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here we still don 't know yet how important it is this is still an open question[MASK] <unk> one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations <unk> surely this must have big implications to understand[MASK] certain types of mutations possibly even those that lead to turning a[MASK] cell cancerous another example[MASK] of quantum mechanics in biology is is quantum coherence in one of the most important processes in[MASK] <unk> plants and bacteria taking sunlight <unk> and using that energy to create biomass [MASK] quantum coherence is the idea of of quantum entities multitasking it 's the quantum skier <unk> it 's[MASK] an object that behaves like a wave so that it doesn 't just move in one direction or the other but can follow multiple pathways at the same time [MASK] some years ago the world of science was shocked[MASK] when a paper was published[MASK] showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria <unk> carrying out photosynthesis <unk> the idea is that the photon the particle of light <unk>[MASK] the sunlight the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule is then delivered to what 's called the reaction center where it can be turned into chemical energy <unk> [MASK] efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat <unk> [MASK] quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell a remarkable idea <unk> and yet evidence is growing[MASK] almost weekly with new papers coming out confirming that this does indeed take place[MASK] <unk> my third and final example is the most beautiful wonderful idea it 's also still very speculative but[MASK] i have to share it with you the european robin[MASK] migrates from scandinavia down to the mediterranean every autumn [MASK] and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects <unk> they navigate by sensing the earth 's magnetic field[MASK] <unk> the earth 's magnetic field is very very weak it 's one hundred times weaker than than a fridge magnet and yet it affects[MASK] the chemistry somehow within a living organism that 's not in doubt a german couple of ornithologists <unk> wolfgang and[MASK] in the 1970s confirmed that indeed the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the earth 's magnetic field to give it directional[MASK] <unk> the puzzle the mystery was how does it do it <unk> well <unk> the only theory in town[MASK] we don 't know if it 's the correct theory but the only theory in town is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement [MASK] inside the robin 's retina i kid you not inside the robin 's retina is a protein called[MASK] <unk> are far apart <unk> and yet somehow remain in contact with each other even einstein hated this idea he called it spooky action at a distance [MASK] so if einstein doesn 't like it then we can all be uncomfortable with it[MASK] <unk> electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the earth 's magnetic field <unk> [MASK] we don 't know if it 's the correct explanation but[MASK] wow <unk> wouldn 't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate <unk> quantum biology is still in it infancy <unk> it 's[MASK] still speculative but i believe it 's built on solid science i also think that in the coming[MASK] decade or so we 're going to start to see that actually it pervades life that[MASK] <unk> life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world <unk> watch this space[MASK]
