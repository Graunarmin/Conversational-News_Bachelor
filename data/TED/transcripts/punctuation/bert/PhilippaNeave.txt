 <unk> the great philosopher aristotle said[MASK] if something doesn 't exist <unk> there 's no word for it and if there 's no word for something that something doesn 't[MASK] <unk> so when we talk about elections we in established democracies we know what we 're talking about we 've got the words we have the vocabulary we know what a polling station is we know what a ballot paper is [MASK] but what about countries where democracy doesn 't exist [MASK] countries where there are no words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic[MASK] <unk> i work in the field of electoral assistance so that 's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections [MASK] when people ask me what i do quite often i get this answer oh <unk> so you 're one of these people who goes around the world imposing western democracy on countries that can 't handle it [MASK] <unk> the united nations does not impose anything on anybody <unk> [MASK] it really doesn 't and also what we do is firmly anchored in the one thousand nine hundred and forty eight[MASK] universal declaration of human rights article twenty one that says that everybody should have the right to choose who governs them <unk> [MASK] so that 's the basis of the work i specialize in public outreach what does that mean another jargon it actually means designing[MASK] <unk> information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote[MASK] understand[MASK] where when how to register where when how to vote <unk> why <unk> why it is important to take part so i 'll probably[MASK] devise a specific campaign to reach out to women to make sure that they can take part that they can[MASK] be part of the process <unk> young people as well all sorts of people <unk> handicapped people we try to reach everybody <unk> [MASK] and it 's not always easy because[MASK] very often in this work i 've noticed now over the years that i 've been doing it[MASK] that words are lacking <unk> and so what do you do afghanistan <unk> it 's a country with high levels of illiteracy[MASK] the thing about that was it was in two thousand and five <unk> and we organized[MASK] two elections on the same day the reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult [MASK] it seemed to be more efficient to do that it was [MASK] but on the other hand explaining[MASK] two elections[MASK] instead of one was even more complicated so we used a lot of images and when it[MASK] <unk> came to the actual ballot <unk> we had problems because so many people wanted to take part we had[MASK] three hundred candidates for for fifty two seats[MASK] in the <unk> wolesi jirga which is the parliamentary elections [MASK] and for the provincial council we had even more candidates we had three hundred and thirty for fifty four seats so talking about ballot design[MASK] <unk> is what the ballot looked like it 's the size of a newspaper this was the wolesi jirga ballot yeah and[MASK] this was the provincial council ballot even more so[MASK] you see we did use a lot of symbols and things like[MASK] <unk> we had other problems in southern sudan southern sudan was a very different story <unk> we had[MASK] so many people who had never of course voted but we had extremely extremely high levels of illiteracy [MASK] very very poor infrastructure for example i mean it 's a country the size of texas more or less we had seven kilometers of paved[MASK] <unk> seven kilometers in the whole country <unk> and that includes the tarmac where we landed the planes in juba airport so[MASK] transporting electoral materials etc is exceedingly difficult [MASK] people had no idea about what a box looked like <unk> it was very complicated <unk> [MASK] so using verbal communication was obviously the way to go <unk> but[MASK] there were one hundred and[MASK] <unk> that was extremely challenging then[MASK] i arrived in tunisia in two thousand and eleven <unk> it was the arab spring a huge amount of[MASK] of hope was generated by that enormous movement that was going on in the region there was libya there was egypt there was yemen <unk> [MASK] it was an enormous enormous historical moment and i was sitting with the election commission <unk> and we were talking about various aspects of[MASK] <unk> of the of the election and[MASK] i was hearing them using words that i hadn 't actually heard before and i 'd worked with iraqis i 'd worked with[MASK] jordanians egyptians and suddenly they were using these words and i just thought this is strange and what really gave rise to it was this word observer we were discussing[MASK] election observers <unk> and[MASK] <unk> in a passive sort of sense as in i noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt did i go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not [MASK] that is the role of an election observer[MASK] <unk> it 's very active it 's governed by all kinds of treaties and it has got that control function in it and then i got wind of the fact[MASK] <unk> followers of an election so that 's not quite right either <unk> because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use which was the word muraqib which means a controller it[MASK] 's got that notion of control so i thought three words for one concept this is not good <unk> [MASK] and with our colleagues we thought perhaps it 's our role to actually help[MASK] make sure that the words are understood and actually[MASK] <unk> create a work of reference that could be used across the arab region <unk> [MASK] and that 's what we did so together with these colleagues we launched the arabic lexicon of electoral terminology [MASK] and we worked in eight different countries[MASK] it meant[MASK] actually defining four hundred and eighty one terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election[MASK] <unk> we defined these terms and we worked with the arab colleagues and came to[MASK] an agreement about what would be the appropriate word to use in arabic <unk> [MASK] because the arabic language is very rich <unk> and that 's part of the problem but there are twenty two countries that speak arabic <unk> and[MASK] they use modern standard[MASK] <unk> which is the arabic that is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts [MASK] but of course then from one country to the next in day to day language and use it varies dialect colloquialisms etc <unk> so that was another added layer of complication so[MASK] in one sense you had the problem that language wasn 't fully[MASK] ripe if you like neologisms were coming up new expressions and so we defined all these terms and then we had eight correspondents in[MASK] <unk> in the in the region <unk> we submitted the draft to them [MASK] they responded back to us yes we understand the definition we agree with it but this is what we say in our country because we were not <unk>[MASK] <unk> going to harmonize or force harmonization we were trying to facilitate understanding among people <unk> [MASK] <unk> the various countries [MASK] so this i 'm happy to say it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field sat with the election <unk>[MASK] <unk> commissions in all these different countries debated and defined and refined the draft [MASK] <unk> date there 's about three thousand downloads off[MASK] the internet in pdf form [MASK] i heard just recently from a colleague that they 've taken it up in somalia they 're going to produce a version of this in somalia because there 's nothing in somalia at all so that 's that 's very[MASK] good to know <unk> and this newly formed arab[MASK] <unk> are run in the region they 're using it as well[MASK] and the arab league have now built up a[MASK] pan arab observation unit and they 're using it so that 's all really good[MASK] <unk> however this[MASK] work of reference is is quite high pitched it 's complex and a lot of the terms are quite technical so the average person probably doesn 't need to know at least a third of it[MASK] <unk> but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education it 's part of our[MASK] curriculum at school it doesn 't really exist in in that part of the world <unk> [MASK] and i feel it 's really the right of everybody to know how these things work and it 's a good thing to think about producing[MASK] a work of reference for the average person and bearing in mind that now[MASK] we have a basis to work with [MASK] but also we have technology so we can reach out using telephone apps <unk> video <unk> animation there 's all sorts of tools <unk>[MASK] <unk> that can be used now to communicate these ideas to people for the first time in their own language <unk> [MASK] <unk> terrorism we hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative[MASK] news that comes to us all the time what we 're not hearing is what are the people the everyday people thinking what are they aspiring to <unk> [MASK] let 's give them the means let 's give them the words [MASK] the silent majority is silent because they don 't have the words the silent[MASK] <unk> majority needs to know it is time to provide people with the knowledge tools that they can inform themselves with [MASK] the silent majority does not need to be silent let 's help them have a voice <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
