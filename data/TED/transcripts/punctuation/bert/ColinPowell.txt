 <unk> this afternoon is[MASK] something a little different than what 's scheduled foreign policy you can[MASK] figure that out by watching i don 't know rachel maddow or somebody but i want to talk about[MASK] young people and structure young people and structure[MASK] <unk> was last wednesday afternoon[MASK] at a school in brooklyn new york at cristo rey high school run by the jesuits <unk> [MASK] and i was talking to this group of students and take a look at them [MASK] they were around me in three directions you 'll noticed that almost all of them are minority <unk> [MASK] you 'll notice that the building is rather austere it 's an old new york school building nothing fancy they still have old blackboards and whatnot[MASK] <unk> there are about three hundred kids in this school and the school 's been going now for four years <unk> and they 're about to graduate their first class[MASK] twenty two people are graduating and all twenty two are going to college <unk> [MASK] they all come from homes where there is for the most part just one person in the home <unk> usually the mother or the grandmother <unk> and that[MASK] <unk> and they come here for their education and for their structure now i had this picture taken <unk> and it was put up on my facebook page last week [MASK] and somebody wrote in huh [MASK] why does he have him standing at attention like that and then they said but he looks good [MASK] he does look good <unk> because kids need structure [MASK] and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids[MASK] <unk> i then invite them to ask questions and when they raise their hands i say come up and i make them come up and stand in front of me [MASK] i make them stand at attention like a soldier put your arms straight down at your side <unk> look up open your eyes stare straight ahead and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear [MASK] no slouching no pants hanging down none of that[MASK] <unk> and this young man his name is his last name cruz he loved it that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral [MASK] so people think i 'm being unkind to this kid no we 're having a little fun [MASK] and the thing about it i 've done this for years the younger they are the more fun it is [MASK] when i get six and seven year olds in a group i have to figure out how to keep them quiet you know that they 'll always start yakking <unk> and so i play a little game with them before i[MASK] <unk> make them stand at attention i say now listen <unk> in the army <unk> when we want you to pay attention we have a command <unk> [MASK] it 's called ' at ease ' it means everybody be quiet and pay attention listen up do you understand[MASK] <unk> i don 't think so [MASK] but anyway <unk> it 's a game i play <unk> and it comes obviously from my military experience <unk> [MASK] because for the majority of my adult life <unk> i worked with young kids teenagers with guns i call them [MASK] and we would bring them into the army <unk> and the first thing we would do is to put them in[MASK] an environment of structure [MASK] put them in ranks [MASK] make them all wear the same clothes <unk> cut all their hair off so they look alike [MASK] make sure that they are standing in ranks <unk> we teach them how to go right face left face so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions [MASK] it gives them structure and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately the drill sergeant [MASK] and they hate him[MASK] <unk> drill sergeant starts screaming at them and telling them to do all kinds of awful things <unk> but then the most amazing thing happens over time [MASK] once that structure is developed <unk> once they understand the reason for something <unk> [MASK] once they understand mama ain 't here son[MASK] <unk> i 'm your worst[MASK] <unk> i 'm your daddy and your mommy[MASK] <unk> and that 's just the way it is you got that son yeah and then when i ask you a question there are only three possible answers yes sir no sir and no excuse sir don[MASK] 't start telling me why you didn 't do something it 's yes sir no sir no excuse sir [MASK] you didn 't shave but sir no don 't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning i 'm telling you you didn 't shave no excuse sir attaboy <unk> you 're learning fast [MASK] but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure in[MASK] eighteen weeks they have a skill they are mature <unk> and you know what they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant [MASK] they come to respect him [MASK] and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children [MASK] i spend a lot of time with youth[MASK] <unk> let 's fix the schools let 's do more for our teachers let 's put more computers in our schools let 's get it all online [MASK] that isn 't the whole whole answer <unk> it 's part of the answer <unk> but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school[MASK] with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with when does the learning process begin does it begin in first grade no no it begins the first time[MASK] a child in a mother 's arms[MASK] looks up at the mother[MASK] and says oh this must be my mother she 's the one who feeds me oh yeah when i don 't feel so good down there she[MASK] takes care of me it[MASK] 's her language i will learn and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age <unk> but by three months[MASK] <unk> and if the person doing it <unk> whether it 's the mother or grandmother whoever 's doing it <unk> [MASK] that is when the education process begins that 's when language begins <unk> [MASK] that 's when love begins that 's when structure begins <unk> that 's when you start to imprint on the child that you are special <unk> [MASK] you are different from every other child in the world <unk> and we 're going to read to you a child who has not been read to[MASK] is in danger when that child gets to school[MASK] <unk> a child who doesn 't know his or her colors or doesn 't know how to tell time doesn 't know how to tie shoes doesn 't know how to do those things and doesn 't know how to do something that[MASK] goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid mind mind your manners mind your adults <unk> mind what you 're saying [MASK] this is the way children are raised properly <unk> [MASK] and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're much to the distress of my[MASK] <unk> my children they are acting just like we did you know you imprint them [MASK] and that 's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school [MASK] and i 'm working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool [MASK] we need head start we need prenatal care [MASK] the education process begins even before the[MASK] <unk> is born <unk> and if you don 't do that you 're going to have difficulty and we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools[MASK] where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing they 've got their little knapsack on and they 're ready to go <unk> [MASK] and then they realize they 're not like the other first graders who[MASK] <unk> read to can do their alphabet and by the third grade the kids who didn 't have that structure[MASK] and minding in the beginning[MASK] start to realize they 're behind and what do they do they act it out <unk> they act it out and they 're on their way to jail[MASK] or they 're on their way to being dropouts <unk> it 's predictable <unk> if you 're not at the right reading level at third grade <unk> you are a candidate for[MASK] <unk> and we have the highest incarceration rate because we 're not getting our kids the proper start in life the last chapter in my book is called the gift of a good start the[MASK] gift of a good start every child ought to have a good start in life <unk> [MASK] i was privileged to have that kind of good start <unk> i was not a great student <unk> i was a public school kid in new york city <unk> and i didn 't do[MASK] <unk> i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college <unk> i wanted it when i was writing my first book [MASK] i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was [MASK] straight c everywhere <unk> [MASK] and i finally bounced through high school got into the city college of new york with a seventy eight point three average which i shouldn 't have been allowed in with <unk> [MASK] and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months[MASK] and then i went into geology rocks for jocks this is easy and[MASK] then i found rotc i found something that i did well and something that i loved doing <unk> [MASK] and i found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way <unk> and so my whole life then was dedicated to rotc and the military <unk> and i say to young kids[MASK] <unk> as you 're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing <unk> [MASK] and when you find those two things together <unk> man you got it that 's what 's going on and that 's what i found [MASK] now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there i 'd been there four and a half going on five years and[MASK] my grades were not[MASK] doing particularly well and i was in occasional difficulties with the administration <unk> [MASK] and so they said but he does so well in rotc look he gets straight a 's in that but not[MASK] <unk> else and so they said <unk>[MASK] let 's take his rotc grades and roll them into his overall gpa and see what happens and they did and it brought me up to two point[MASK] so they shipped me off to the army <unk> and[MASK] lo and behold many years later i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had so [MASK] i tell young people everywhere it ain 't where you start in life <unk> it 's what you do with life[MASK] that determines where you end up in life <unk> and you are blessed to be living in a country that no matter[MASK] <unk> where you start you have opportunities[MASK] so long as you believe in yourself you believe in the society and the country <unk> and you believe[MASK] that you can self improve and educate yourself as you go along and that 's the key to success <unk> [MASK] but it begins with the gift of a good start if we[MASK] <unk> that gift to each and every one of our kids if we don 't invest[MASK] at the earliest age <unk> we 're going to be running into difficulties it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly twenty five percent overall and[MASK] almost fifty percent of our minority population living in low income areas <unk> because they 're not getting the gift of a good start [MASK] my gift of a good start was not only[MASK] being in a nice family a good family but having a family that said to me[MASK] we came to this country in banana boats[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and twenty and one thousand nine hundred and twenty four [MASK] we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day we 're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose[MASK] or get in trouble <unk> and don 't even think about dropping out if i had ever gone home[MASK] <unk> they had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the south bronx <unk> [MASK] but they had more than just expectations for us they stuck into our hearts[MASK] like a dagger[MASK] a sense of shame don 't you shame this family[MASK] sometimes i would get in trouble <unk> and my parents were coming home and i was in my room waiting[MASK] for what 's going to happen <unk> and i would sit there saying to myself okay look take the belt and hit me but god don 't give me that <unk> ' shame the family ' bit again [MASK] it devastated me when my mother did that to me <unk> and i also had this extended network children need a network children need to be part of a tribe a family[MASK] <unk> in my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings <unk> i don 't know how many of you are new yorkers <unk> [MASK] but there were these tenement buildings and these women were always hanging out one of the windows <unk> leaning on a pillow <unk> [MASK] they never left [MASK] i so help me god i grew up walking those streets and they were always there[MASK] <unk> but what they did was keep us in play <unk> they kept us in play <unk> and they didn 't care[MASK] whether you became[MASK] a doctor or a lawyer or a general <unk> and they never expected any generals in the family[MASK] <unk> as long as you got an education and then you got a job don 't give us[MASK] <unk> have time to waste for that <unk> and then you can support us <unk> that 's the role of you guys and so it 's so[MASK] essential that we kind of put this[MASK] culture back into our[MASK] families all families and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people[MASK] <unk> and i 'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren it 's not enough you 've got to reach out and back and find kids like mr cruz[MASK] who can make it[MASK] if you give them the structure if you reach back and help if you mentor <unk> if you invest in boys and girls clubs [MASK] if you work with your school system make sure it 's the best school system and not just your kid 's school but the school[MASK] uptown in harlem not just downtown montessori on the west side all of us[MASK] <unk> have to have a commitment to do that and we 're not just investing in the kids we 're investing in our future <unk> we 're going to be a <unk>[MASK] country in one more generation [MASK] those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority <unk> [MASK] and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours [MASK] a country that is like[MASK] no other [MASK] a country that amazes me every single day a country that 's fractious we 're always arguing with each other <unk> that 's how the system 's supposed to work[MASK] <unk> it 's a country of such contrasts but it 's a nation of nations we touch every nation every nation touches us [MASK] we are a nation of immigrants that 's why we need sound[MASK] <unk> 's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation [MASK] or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty one of[MASK] the great stories i love to tell is about my[MASK] love of going to my hometown of new york and walking up park avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world <unk> but[MASK] i always have to do is stop at one of the corners[MASK] and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler <unk> gotta have a dirty water dog [MASK] and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing i 've got to do that i even did it when i was secretary of state i 'd[MASK] come out of my suite at the waldorf astoria[MASK] be walking up the street and i would hit around[MASK] <unk> street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler in those days i had five bodyguards around me and three new york city police cars would roll alongside to make sure[MASK] nobody whacked me while i was going up park avenue [MASK] and i would order the hot dog from the guy and he 'd start to fix it and then he 'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars i 've got a green card i 've got a green card[MASK] <unk> nothing <unk> but i gotta have my hot dog i did it just last week it was on a tuesday evening[MASK] down by columbus circle <unk> and the scene repeats itself so often i 'll go up and[MASK] ask for my hot dog <unk> and the guy will fix it and as he 's finishing he 'll say i know you i see you on television[MASK] <unk> you can 't pay me i 've been paid <unk> america has paid me i never forget where i came from but now i 'm an american sir <unk> thank you i[MASK] accept the generosity continue up the street <unk> and it washes over me my god it 's the same country that greeted my parents this way ninety years ago [MASK] so we are still that magnificent country but we are fueled[MASK] by young people coming up from[MASK] every land in the world <unk> and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours[MASK] to make sure that no child gets left behind <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
