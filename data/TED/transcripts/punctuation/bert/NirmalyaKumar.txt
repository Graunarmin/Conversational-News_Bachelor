 <unk> over the last two decades india has become a global hub for software development and[MASK] offshoring of back office services as we call it <unk> and[MASK] what we were interested in finding out was that[MASK] because of this huge[MASK] industry that has started over the last two decades in india <unk> offshoring software development and back office services there 's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to india <unk> [MASK] when this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to china <unk> it has <unk> you know led to considerable angst amongst[MASK] <unk> in fact if you look at polls they show a declining[MASK] trend for support for free trade in the west[MASK] <unk> now the western elites however have said this fear is misplaced for example <unk> if you have read i suspect many of you have done so read the book by thomas friedman called the world is flat [MASK] he said <unk> basically in his book[MASK] <unk> you know this fear for free trade is[MASK] wrong because it assumes it 's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented <unk> [MASK] in fact he says it 's innovation that will keep the west ahead of the developing world with the[MASK] more sophisticated innovative tasks being done in the developed world <unk> and the less sophisticated shall we say drudge work being done in the developing world[MASK] <unk> what we were trying to understand was is this true could india become[MASK] a source or a global hub of innovation <unk> just like it 's become a global hub for back office services and software development [MASK] and for the last four years my coauthor phanish puranam and i spent investigating this topic <unk> [MASK] <unk> you know as people would say <unk> you know <unk> in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the western innovative model say where are the indian googles ipods and viagras <unk> [MASK] if the indians are so bloody smart [MASK] so initially when we started our research we went and met several executives and we asked them what do you think[MASK] <unk> will india go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a[MASK] destination for innovation they laughed <unk> they dismissed us[MASK] <unk> they said you know what indians don 't do innovation [MASK] the more polite ones said well you know indians make good software programmers and accountants but they can 't do the creative stuff [MASK] sometimes it took a more <unk> took a veneer of sophistication <unk> and people said you know it 's nothing to do with indians it 's really the rule based[MASK] <unk> education system in india that is responsible for killing all creativity [MASK] they said instead if you want to see real creativity go to silicon valley <unk> and look at companies like google <unk> microsoft intel [MASK] so we started examining the r & d and innovation labs[MASK] of silicon valley <unk> [MASK] well interestingly what you find there is usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the r & d center as they may call it and more often than not it 's an indian[MASK] i immediately said well but you could not have been educated in india right you must have gotten your education here [MASK] it turned out in every single case they came out of the indian educational system <unk> [MASK] so we realized that maybe we had the wrong question <unk> and the right question is really can indians based out of india[MASK] do innovative work <unk> so off we went to india we made <unk> i think[MASK] <unk> a dozen trips to bangalore mumbai gurgaon delhi <unk> hyderabad you name it to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these[MASK] in these cities <unk> and what we found was as we progressed in our research was [MASK] that we were asking really the wrong question <unk> when you ask where are the indian googles <unk> ipods and viagras [MASK] you are taking a particular perspective on innovation <unk> which is innovation for end[MASK] <unk> users <unk> visible innovation <unk> [MASK] instead innovation <unk> if you remember <unk> [MASK] some of you may have read the famous economist schumpeter he said innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed [MASK] it could be new products and services <unk> but it could also be new ways of producing products it could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries [MASK] once you take this there 's no reason to[MASK] <unk> restrict innovation the beneficiaries of innovation <unk> just to end users <unk> [MASK] when you take this broader conceptualization of innovation what we found was india is well represented in innovation <unk> but the innovation that is being done in india is <unk>[MASK] <unk> of a form we did not anticipate <unk> and what we did was we called it invisible innovation [MASK] <unk> the first type of invisible innovation out of india is what we call innovation for business customers which is led by the multinational corporations [MASK] which have in the last two decades <unk> there have been seven hundred and fifty r <unk> & d centers set up in india by multinational companies employing more than four hundred[MASK] <unk> when you consider the fact[MASK] that historically the r & d center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters or in the country of origin[MASK] of that multinational company to have seven hundred and fifty r & d centers of multinational corporations in india[MASK] is truly a remarkable figure <unk> when we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on they said we are working on global products[MASK] <unk> not working on localizing global products for india <unk> which is the usual role role of a local r & d they were working on truly global products and companies like microsoft <unk>[MASK] <unk> google <unk> astrazeneca <unk> general electric philips have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their bangalore and hyderabad[MASK] but of course <unk> as an end user you don 't see that because you only see the name of the company <unk> not where it was developed [MASK] the other thing we were told then was yes but you know the kind of work that is coming out of the indian r & d center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the u s r & d centers [MASK] so my coauthor phanish puranam who happens[MASK] <unk> to be one of the smartest people i know said[MASK] he 's going to do a study what he did was he looked at those companies that had an r <unk> & d center in usa and in india <unk> [MASK] and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the u s and a similar patent filed out of the same company 's subsidiary in india <unk> [MASK] so he 's now comparing the patents of r & d centers in the u s with r & d centers in india of the same company[MASK] to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the[MASK] <unk> patents filed out of the u s centers <unk> interestingly <unk> what he finds is[MASK] <unk> is what we call forward citations how many times does a future patent[MASK] reference the older patent he finds something very interesting <unk> what we find is[MASK] that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of[MASK] <unk> to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an indian subsidiary of the same company within that company <unk> [MASK] so within the company <unk> there 's no difference in the forward citation rates of their indian subsidiaries versus their u s subsidiaries so that 's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of india the[MASK] second kind of invisible[MASK] innovation coming out of india is what we call outsourcing innovation to indian companies where many companies today[MASK] are contracting indian companies to do a major part of their product development work[MASK] for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world [MASK] for example in the pharma industry a lot of the molecules are being developed but you see a major part of that work is being sent to india [MASK] for example[MASK] <unk> they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing seven hundred and eighty seven dreamliner one to avoid[MASK] collisions in the sky <unk> and another to allow landing in zero visibility <unk> [MASK] but of course when you climb onto the boeing seven hundred and eighty seven you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of india <unk> [MASK] the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process[MASK] <unk> because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms[MASK] process innovation is different from product innovation <unk> it 's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product but not a new product itself [MASK] only in india[MASK] do millions of young people dream of working in a call center <unk> [MASK] what happens you know it 's a dead end job in the west <unk> what high school dropouts do[MASK] what happens when you put[MASK] hundreds of thousands of smart <unk> young ambitious kids on a call center job very quickly they get bored <unk> [MASK] and they start[MASK] innovating <unk> [MASK] and they start telling the boss how to do this job better and out of this process innovation comes product innovations which are then marketed around the world for example[MASK] <unk> call center company <unk> used to be a traditional call center company <unk> today they 're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone <unk> you can[MASK] guess or predict[MASK] what this phone call is about it[MASK] 's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the west <unk> and the last kind of innovation invisible innovation coming out[MASK] <unk> innovation coming out of india is what we call management innovation it 's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work <unk> [MASK] and the most significant management innovation to come[MASK] out of india <unk> invented by the indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model <unk> what the global delivery model allows is <unk> it allows you to take previously[MASK] <unk> break them up into parts <unk> send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists and then specify the means for reintegrating them [MASK] without that you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today [MASK] so what i 'm trying to say is what we are finding in our research is that if[MASK] products for end users[MASK] is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg <unk> india is well represented in the invisible large <unk> submerged portion[MASK] <unk> of the innovation iceberg <unk> now[MASK] this has of course <unk> some implications [MASK] and so we developed three implications of this research <unk> the first is what we called sinking skill ladder <unk> and now i 'm going to go back[MASK] to where i started my conversation with you [MASK] <unk> which was about the flight of jobs <unk> now of course when we first as a multinational company <unk> decide to outsource jobs to india in the r & d <unk> [MASK] what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india the least sophisticated jobs <unk> just like tom friedman would predict <unk> [MASK] now what happens is when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india[MASK] for innovation and for r & d work at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem[MASK] which is where does the next step[MASK] of the ladder people come from within your company <unk> so you have two choices then either you bring the people from india into the developed world[MASK] to take positions in the next step of the ladder immigration[MASK] or you say there 's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in india <unk> why don 't we move the next step to india[MASK] what we are trying to say is[MASK] that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder <unk> [MASK] you it 's a self perpetuating act because of the sinking skill ladder <unk> and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that[MASK] you can 't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once you can 't be a professor without having been a student <unk> [MASK] <unk> you can 't be a consultant without having been a research associate <unk> so if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs at some stage the next step of the ladder has to follow <unk> [MASK] the second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the tmt the top management teams if the r <unk> & d talent is going to be based out of india and china <unk> and the largest growth <unk>[MASK] <unk> markets are going to be based out of india and china you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of india and china <unk> [MASK] <unk> 's where the important market leadership is [MASK] right and the last thing we point out in this slide which is you know that to this story there 's one caveat [MASK] india has the youngest growing population in the world [MASK] this demographic dividend dividend is incredible <unk> but paradoxically there 's also the mirage of mighty labor pools [MASK] indian institutes and educational system with a few exceptions are incapable of producing[MASK] <unk> students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going <unk> [MASK] so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure[MASK] so finally i want to conclude[MASK] by showing you[MASK] <unk> the profile of one company ibm [MASK] as many of you know ibm has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies in fact if you look at the number of patents filed over history i think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the usa as a private company <unk> [MASK] here is the profile of employees of[MASK] ibm over the last decade <unk> in two thousand and three they had three hundred[MASK] <unk> thousand employees or three hundred and thirty thousand employees out of which one hundred and thirty five thousand were in america nine thousand were in india <unk>[MASK] in two thousand and nine they had four hundred thousand employees by which time the u s employees had moved to one hundred and five thousand whereas the indian employees had gone to one hundred thousand well[MASK] in two thousand and ten they decided they 're not going to reveal this data anymore <unk> so i had to make some estimates[MASK] based on various sources here are my best guesses okay i 'm not saying this is the exact number it 's my best guess it gives you a sense of the trend there are four hundred and thirty three thousand people now at ibm [MASK] out of which ninety eight thousand are remaining in the u s and one hundred and fifty thousand are in india <unk> [MASK] so you tell me is ibm an american company <unk> or an indian company[MASK]
