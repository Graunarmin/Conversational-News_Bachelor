 <unk> i 'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers[MASK] that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years [MASK] and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization <unk> so i want to show you a clip of the film now hopefully it won 't stutter[MASK] <unk> and if we did our jobs well <unk> you won 't know that we were even involved[MASK] <unk> there were many changes some you could[MASK] some you couldn 't hair started growing in all sorts of places along with other things <unk> [MASK] i felt pretty good considering ed ulbrich [MASK] that was a clip from the curious case of benjamin button many of you <unk> maybe you 've seen it or you 've heard of the story[MASK] <unk> but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film the main character benjamin button who 's played by brad pitt is completely computer generated from the neck up [MASK] now <unk> there 's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor 's body <unk> we 've created a completely digital human head [MASK] so i 'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project this is based on an f scott fitzgerald short story[MASK] it 's about a man who 's born old and lives his life in reverse now this movie has floated around hollywood for[MASK] well over half a century and we first got involved with the project in the early ' 90s with ron howard as the director we took a lot of meetings and[MASK] we seriously considered it but at the time we had to throw in the towel <unk> [MASK] it was deemed impossible it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards backwards [MASK] the human form in particular the human head has been considered the holy grail of our industry[MASK] <unk> came back to us about a decade later and this time with a director named david fincher now <unk> fincher is is an interesting guy [MASK] david is fearless of technology and he is absolutely tenacious <unk> and david won 't take no and david believed like we do[MASK] in the visual effects industry <unk> that anything is possible as long as you have enough[MASK] <unk> resources and of course money [MASK] and so david had an interesting take on the film <unk> and he threw a challenge at us he wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor <unk> it happened to be this guy <unk> [MASK] we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery[MASK] with david and we ruled out of course swapping actors that was one idea that we would have different actors and we would hand off from actor to actor we even ruled out the idea of using makeup we realized that prosthetic[MASK] <unk> makeup just wouldn 't hold up <unk> [MASK] particularly in close up and makeup is an additive process you have to build the face up and david wanted to carve deeply into brad 's face to bring the aging to this character <unk> [MASK] he needed to be a very sympathetic character[MASK] <unk> so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a[MASK] <unk> 's head aged to appear as benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor <unk> [MASK] sounded great of course <unk> this was the holy grail of our our industry <unk> and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn 't help[MASK] either because i 'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store <unk> you know we see his face constantly so there really was no tolerable[MASK] <unk> margin of error[MASK] there were two studios involved <unk> warner brothers and paramount <unk> and they both believed this would make an amazing film of course but it was a very high risk proposition there was lots of money and reputations at stake[MASK] <unk> but we believed that we had a very solid methodology that[MASK] might work <unk> but despite our verbal assurances they wanted some proof[MASK] and so in two thousand and four they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin <unk> and we did it in about five[MASK] <unk> weeks <unk> [MASK] but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts we basically put something together to get through the meeting i 'll roll that for you now this was the first test for benjamin button <unk> and in here you can see that 's a computer generated head[MASK] pretty good attached to the body of an actor <unk> and it worked <unk> and it gave the studio[MASK] great relief after many years of starts and stops on this project and making that tough decision they[MASK] <unk> finally decided to greenlight the movie and i can remember actually when i got the phone call to congratulate us to say the movie was a go i actually threw up you[MASK] this is some tough stuff <unk> so we started to have early team meetings and we got everybody together and it was really more like therapy in the beginning <unk>[MASK] <unk> convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character and it 's not a special effects film it has to be a man[MASK] <unk> we really felt like we were in a kind of a 12 step program <unk> and of course the first step is admit you 've got a problem [MASK] so[MASK] we had a big problem we didn 't know how we were going to do this <unk> but we did know one thing[MASK] being from the visual effects industry we with david believed that we now had enough time enough resources and god we hoped we had enough money[MASK] <unk> and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence <unk> so <unk> when you 're faced with something like that of course you 've got to break it down you take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on [MASK] we needed to make brad look a lot older needed to age[MASK] <unk> and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad[MASK] 's[MASK] idiosyncrasies his little tics the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen <unk> and we also needed to create[MASK] a character that could hold up under really all conditions <unk> he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at nighttime under candlelight he had to hold an extreme close up he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to run he had to be able to sweat he had to be able to take a bath to cry[MASK] <unk> he even had to throw up not all at the same time but he had to you know [MASK] do all of those things <unk> and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about three hundred and twenty five shots <unk> so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do <unk> [MASK] and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in two thousand and four and where we needed it to be[MASK] we focused on motion capture <unk> i 'm sure many of you have seen motion capture <unk> the state of the art at the time was something called marker based motion capture i 'll give you an example here it 's basically the idea of you wear a leotard <unk>[MASK] and they put some reflective markers on your body <unk> and instead of using cameras there 're infrared sensors around a volume <unk> and those infrared sensors track the[MASK] <unk> in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer generated character you can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the[MASK] as the dancers but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that 's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a[MASK] pretty crappy performance that[MASK] 's not terribly compelling <unk> and what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers we needed the the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving <unk>[MASK] <unk> over muscle moving over bone we needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo <unk>[MASK] <unk> the state of the art <unk> so we aborted using motion capture <unk> and we were now well out of our comfort zone <unk> and in uncharted territory[MASK] <unk> we were left with this idea that we ended up calling [MASK] technology stew we started to look out in other fields <unk> the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that[MASK] come from other industries like medical imaging the video game space <unk> and re appropriate them <unk> and[MASK] we had to create kind of a sauce and the sauce was[MASK] code in software that we 'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come[MASK] <unk> together and and work as one <unk> <unk> initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named dr paul ekman in the early ' 70s he believed[MASK] that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with this idea of facial action coding system or facs he believed that there were seventy basic poses or shapes of the[MASK] <unk> those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing <unk> and of course[MASK] <unk> these transcend age race culture gender <unk> so this became the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour <unk>[MASK] <unk> and here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face and now what we 're looking at is really[MASK] <unk> of a computer array of cameras <unk> and those cameras can[MASK] frame by frame reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject 's doing at the moment so effectively you get[MASK] 3d data in real time of the subject <unk> and if you look in a comparison on the left we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly <unk>[MASK] we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology[MASK] <unk> proven yet <unk> we measure[MASK] complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count <unk> and so[MASK] <unk> on the left we were seeing one hundred thousand polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this was when we had our aha this was the breakthrough this is when we 're like ok we 're going to be ok this is actually going to work [MASK] and[MASK] <unk> what if we could take brad pitt <unk> and we could put brad[MASK] in this device[MASK] <unk> and use this contour process and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights <unk> and we could in fact scan him in real time performing ekman 's facs poses <unk>[MASK] right so <unk> effectively we ended up with a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face is capable of doing [MASK] from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes [MASK] <unk> a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of of doing now <unk> that 's great except we had him at age forty four we need to put another forty years on him at this point we <unk>[MASK] <unk> brought in rick baker <unk> and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry <unk> and we also brought in a gentleman named kazu tsuji and kazu tsuji is one of the great[MASK] sculptors of our time <unk> and we commissioned them to make a[MASK] a maquette or a bust of benjamin <unk> so in the spirit of the great unveiling i had to do this i had to unveil something <unk> so this is ben eighty[MASK] we created three of these there 's ben eighty there 's ben seventy there 's ben sixty <unk> and this really became[MASK] <unk> this was made from a life cast of brad so in fact[MASK] <unk> anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these maquettes scanned into the computer at at very high resolution enormous polygonal count[MASK] <unk> and so now we had[MASK] three age increments of benjamin in the computer <unk> but we needed to get[MASK] a database of him doing more than that we went through this process then called retargeting[MASK] <unk> this is brad doing one of the ekman facs poses and here 's the resulting data that comes from that the model that comes from that retargeting is the process of transposing that data <unk>[MASK] onto another model and because the life cast or the bust the maquette of benjamin was made from brad we could transpose the data[MASK] <unk> everything brad pitt 's face can do at age eighty seven in his 70s and in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while all that 's going on we 're down in new orleans and locations around the <unk>[MASK] <unk> world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentleman who played benjamin [MASK] <unk> now we needed to get brad 's performance to drive our virtual benjamin <unk> and so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the the rest of the cast and[MASK] the body actors[MASK] and about six months later we brought brad onto a sound stage in los angeles[MASK] and he watched on the screen[MASK] his job then was to become benjamin <unk> and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise <unk> and he took[MASK] <unk> benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn 't think he was going to go [MASK] we shot him with four hd cameras so we 'd get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast[MASK] from there we went into a process called image analysis <unk> and so here you can see again <unk> the chosen take <unk> and you are seeing now that data being transposed on to ben[MASK] <unk> about this is we used something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjamin 's face and so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame fourteen <unk>[MASK] <unk> the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here and it concludes moving in frame thirty two and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce i talked about with our technology stew that secret sauce[MASK] <unk> to match the performance footage of brad in live action[MASK] with our database of aged benjamin the facs shapes that we had on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct[MASK] a 3d head that exactly matched the performance of brad <unk> so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film <unk> [MASK] and here you can see the body actor <unk> and then this is what we called the dead head no reference to jerry garcia[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] then here 's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again <unk> the final shot it[MASK] was a long process [MASK] <unk> next section here <unk> i 'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole tedtalk on the next[MASK] several slides <unk> we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that[MASK] benjamin had to appear so that[MASK] we could put ben 's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that 's on the other actors in the real world <unk> we also had to create an eye system <unk> we found[MASK] <unk> the eyes are the window to the soul absolutely true so the key here was to keep everybody looking in ben 's eyes <unk> and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the <unk>[MASK] <unk> eyes then we would succeed so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years we also had to create a mouth system <unk> we worked from dental molds of brad we had to age the teeth over time we also had to create an articulating tongue[MASK] <unk> that allowed him to enunciate his words there was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue we had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months he was very popular [MASK] skin displacement another big deal the skin had to be absolutely accurate he 's also in an old age home he 's in a nursing home around other old people so he had to look exactly the same as the others <unk> [MASK] so <unk> lots of work on skin deformation you can see in some of these cases it works in some cases it looks bad this is a very very very early test in[MASK] <unk> effectively we created a digital puppet that brad pitt could operate with his own face <unk> there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior[MASK] or[MASK] enhance his performance <unk> there was something that we encountered though that we ended up calling the digital botox effect so <unk> as things went through this process <unk> [MASK] fincher would always say it sandblasts the edges off of the performance[MASK] intent the intent of the actor <unk> so it sees a smile as a smile it doesn 't recognize an ironic smile or a[MASK] happy smile or a frustrated smile so it did take humans to kind of push it[MASK] one way or another but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as opposed to just motion capture take another look[MASK]
