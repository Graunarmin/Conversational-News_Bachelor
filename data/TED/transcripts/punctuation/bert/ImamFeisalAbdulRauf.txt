 <unk> i 'm[MASK] <unk> speaking about compassion from an islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not[MASK] <unk> fourteen chapters and each chapter begins[MASK] with what we call the basmala <unk> the saying of in the name of god <unk> the all compassionate <unk> the all merciful [MASK] or as sir richard burton[MASK] not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor <unk> [MASK] but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of[MASK] <unk> literature[MASK] translates it in the name of god the compassionating <unk> the compassionate [MASK] and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad[MASK] whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam including noah <unk> including moses[MASK] <unk> moses <unk> including abraham <unk> including jesus christ <unk> and ending with muhammad that [MASK] we have not sent you o muhammad except as a ' rahmah ' except as a source of compassion[MASK] to humanity for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims whose[MASK] <unk> and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet[MASK] is to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves[MASK] with the attributes of god and because god himself said[MASK] that the primary attribute of his is compassion[MASK] in fact the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion[MASK] <unk> therefore our objective and our mission must be to be[MASK] sources of compassion <unk> activators of compassion <unk> actors of compassion[MASK] and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good [MASK] but where where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world[MASK] for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path <unk> [MASK] in every religious tradition there is the outer path[MASK] and the inner path or the exoteric path and the esoteric path [MASK] the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or[MASK] and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition <unk> [MASK] refer to teachings and examples of our prophet[MASK] that teach us where the source of our problems lies <unk> in one of the battles that the prophet waged[MASK] <unk> we are returning[MASK] from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle [MASK] and they said messenger of god <unk> we are battle weary [MASK] how can we go to a greater battle he said [MASK] that is the battle of the self the battle of the ego [MASK] <unk> the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you has a story[MASK] in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and he knocks on the door <unk> and a voice answers[MASK] <unk> as we might say in english <unk> the voice says go away [MASK] after many years[MASK] of training of disciplining [MASK] of search and struggle he comes back with much greater humility he knocks again on the door[MASK] <unk> you o heartbreaker [MASK] the door swings open <unk> and the voice says come in for there is no room in this house for two i 's[MASK] <unk> spiritual path <unk> in the presence of god <unk> there is no room[MASK] for more than one i and that is the i of divinity [MASK] in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant[MASK] <unk> my creature my human creature <unk> does not approach me[MASK] by anything[MASK] that is dearer to me[MASK] than what i have asked them to do [MASK] and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean you want your employees your employees to do what you ask them to do <unk> [MASK] and if they 've done that <unk> then they can do extra <unk> but don 't ignore what you 've asked them to do[MASK] <unk> to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do extra credit we might call it until i love him or love her <unk> [MASK] and when i love my servant god says i become[MASK] the eyes by which he[MASK] or she sees <unk> the ears by which he or she listens[MASK] <unk> the hand by which he or she grasps <unk> and the foot[MASK] by which he or she walks <unk> and the heart[MASK] by which he or she understands it is this merging[MASK] of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions[MASK] muslims regard jesus[MASK] as the master of sufism <unk> the greatest prophet and messenger who came[MASK] to emphasize the spiritual path when he says i am the spirit <unk> and i am the way and when the[MASK] <unk> whoever has seen me has seen god it is because they became so much an instrument[MASK] of god they became part of god 's team[MASK] so that god 's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos [MASK] compassion on earth[MASK] is given it is in us all we have to do is to get our egos out of the[MASK] <unk> way <unk> get our egotism out of the way <unk> [MASK] i 'm sure <unk> probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you [MASK] have had what you might call a spiritual experience [MASK] a moment in your lives[MASK] when for a few[MASK] <unk> a minute perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at[MASK] that minute you felt at one[MASK] with the universe[MASK] one with that jug of water one with every human being one with the creator[MASK] and you felt you were in the presence of power[MASK] awe of the deepest love the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives [MASK] that is a moment[MASK] which is a gift of god to us a gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes[MASK] <unk> this is all you [MASK] this is all you <unk> and this is all us <unk> [MASK] and us and i and us are all part of you <unk> o creator [MASK] <unk> the objective the source of our being and the end of our journey you[MASK] are also the breaker of our hearts you are the one[MASK] whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose[MASK] we shall die <unk> and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again[MASK] to account to god to what extent we have been[MASK] <unk> compassionate beings our message today <unk> [MASK] and our purpose today <unk> and those of you who are here today <unk> and the purpose of this charter of compassion [MASK] is to remind for the koran[MASK] always urges us[MASK] to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth[MASK] is within every human being [MASK] we know it all [MASK] we have access to it all jung may have called it the subconscious [MASK] through our subconscious in your dreams[MASK] <unk> the temporary death [MASK] in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions <unk> we travel[MASK] even outside of our bodies for many of us [MASK] and we see wonderful things <unk> we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond[MASK] <unk> the limitations of time as we know it <unk> but all this is for us to[MASK] glorify the name of the creator[MASK] whose primary name is the compassionating <unk> the compassionate god [MASK] <unk> whatever the name might be[MASK] through which you name or access the presence of divinity it is the locus[MASK] of absolute being absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom[MASK] <unk> the language differs <unk> [MASK] but the objective is the same rumi has another story[MASK] about three men a turk an arab and and i forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay [MASK] one is asking for angur one is say an englishman one is asking for eneb[MASK] <unk> not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages [MASK] there 's only one absolute reality by definition [MASK] one absolute being by definition <unk> because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular[MASK] there 's this absolute concentration of being <unk> [MASK] the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute[MASK] locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of[MASK] <unk> also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human [MASK] for what defines humanity perhaps biologically [MASK] is our physiology <unk> but god defines humanity[MASK] by our spirituality by our nature[MASK] <unk> the koran says <unk> [MASK] he speaks to the angels and says when i have finished the formation of adam from clay <unk> [MASK] and breathed into him of my spirit <unk> then fall in prostration to him [MASK] the angels[MASK] prostrate not before the human body <unk> [MASK] but before the human soul <unk> why because the soul[MASK] <unk> the human soul <unk> embodies[MASK] a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul [MASK] this is also expressed[MASK] in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image what is the imagery of god[MASK] <unk> imagery of god[MASK] is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love [MASK] and therefore <unk> for us to be human[MASK] in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human[MASK] means that we too[MASK] have to be proper stewards[MASK] of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves[MASK] the attribute of being of being alive of beingness the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness [MASK] and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this[MASK] <unk> is what i understand from my faith tradition <unk> and this is what i understand[MASK] from my studies of other faith traditions <unk> and this is the common platform[MASK] on which we must all stand <unk> and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced that we[MASK] can make a wonderful world[MASK] <unk> and i believe personally that we 're on the verge[MASK] and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about[MASK] the prophecy of isaiah for he foretold of a period[MASK] <unk> when people shall transform their swords into plowshares[MASK] and will not learn war or make war anymore [MASK] we have reached a stage in human history[MASK] that we have no option <unk> [MASK] we
