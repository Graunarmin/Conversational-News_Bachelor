 <unk> the key phrase is[MASK] <unk> brain cancer was really as you can imagine shocking news for me <unk> i knew nothing about cancer <unk> in[MASK] western cultures <unk> when you have cancer it 's as if you disappear in a way your life as a complex[MASK] <unk> lab values a list of medicines[MASK] and everyone changes as well you suddenly become a disease on legs doctors start speaking[MASK] a language which you don 't understand they start[MASK] <unk> people start[MASK] changing as well because they[MASK] start dealing with the disease <unk> instead of[MASK] with the human being <unk> they say what did the doctor say before even saying hello [MASK] and in the meanwhile you 're left with questions to which[MASK] <unk> nobody gives an answer these are the can i questions can i work while i have cancer <unk> [MASK] can i study <unk> can i make love can i be creative <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] you wonder what have i done to deserve this you wonder can i change something[MASK] <unk> doctors are the good guys in[MASK] all these scenarios <unk> because they are very professional and dedicated to to curing you <unk> but they also[MASK] are very used to having to deal with patients so i[MASK] <unk> things are changing but classically they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition [MASK] <unk> your friends and family engaged <unk> or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you 're going through <unk> [MASK] but instead you 're forced there[MASK] to wait[MASK] in the hands of a series of[MASK] very professional strangers while i was in the hospital i asked for a printed out[MASK] <unk> it was really hard to obtain because it 's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer[MASK] <unk> i talked to it and i said okay cancer <unk> you 're not all there is to me <unk> there 's more to me[MASK] <unk> a cure <unk> whichever it is will have to deal[MASK] with the whole of me and so <unk> the next day i left the[MASK] <unk> the hospital against medical advice <unk> i was determined to change[MASK] my relationship with the cancer and i was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing[MASK] anything as drastic as a surgery [MASK] i 'm an artist i use several forms[MASK] <unk> and open information in my practice so my best bet[MASK] was to get it all out there get the information out there and use it[MASK] so that it could be accessed by anyone so i[MASK] created a website which is called la <unk> cura on which i put my medical data online[MASK] <unk> actually had to hack it and that 's a thing which we can talk about in another speech i chose this <unk>[MASK] <unk> in italian means the cure because[MASK] in many different cultures <unk> the word cure can mean many different things <unk> in our western cultures it means[MASK] eradicating or reversing[MASK] <unk> from the mediterranean <unk> from latin countries from africa it can mean many more things [MASK] of course i was interested in the opinions of[MASK] doctors[MASK] and healthcare providers <unk> but i was also interested in the cure of the artist [MASK] <unk> i was interested in[MASK] the social cure <unk> i was interested in the psychological cure <unk> i was interested in the spiritual cure <unk> i was interested in the emotional cure i was interested in any form of cure [MASK] and [MASK] <unk> i received lots of media attention from[MASK] italy and from abroad and i quickly received[MASK] more than five hundred thousand contacts emails social networking[MASK] most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer <unk> but more of them were about how to cure myself as[MASK] <unk> for example here we see francesca fini in her performance [MASK] or <unk> as artist patrick lichty has done <unk> he produced a 3d[MASK] <unk> can share our cancer and this was going on[MASK] scientists the traditional medicine experts <unk> several researchers doctors all connected with me to[MASK] <unk> with all this information and support i was able to form a team of several[MASK] neurosurgeons <unk> traditional doctors <unk> oncologists <unk> and several hundred[MASK] volunteers with whom i was able to discuss[MASK] the information i was receiving <unk> which[MASK] which is very important and together we were able to form a strategy for my own cure[MASK] in many languages <unk> according to many cultures <unk> and the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history [MASK] which is quite remarkable for me [[MASK] surgery ] the follow up mris showed <unk> luckily <unk> little to no growth of the cancer so i was able to take my time and choose[MASK] <unk> i chose[MASK] the doctor i wanted to work with i chose the hospital i wanted to stay in and in the meanwhile <unk> i was supported by thousands of people <unk> [MASK] none of whom felt pity for me <unk> [MASK] everyone[MASK] felt like they could[MASK] take an active role in helping me to get well <unk> and this was the most important part of la[MASK] what are the outcomes <unk> i 'm fine <unk> as you can see pretty fine [MASK] i had excellent news after the[MASK] surgery i have i had[MASK] a very low grade glioma[MASK] <unk> kind of cancer which doesn 't grow a lot <unk> i have completely changed my life[MASK] and my lifestyle <unk> everything i did was[MASK] thoughtfully designed to get me engaged <unk> up until the very last few minutes of the surgery <unk> [MASK] which was very intense a matrix of electrodes[MASK] <unk> map of what the brain controls and right before the operation we were able to discuss <unk>[MASK] <unk> the functional map of of my brain with the doctor to understand which risks i was running into and if there were any[MASK] <unk> and this openness was really the fundamental part of la cura thousands of people shared their[MASK] stories their experiences[MASK] doctors got to talk with people they don 't usually consult when[MASK] <unk> different languages in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research[MASK] <unk> really[MASK] depends[MASK] on the wellness of all of its components [MASK] this global performance is my open source cure for cancer [MASK] and from what i feel it 's a cure for me <unk> but for us all thank you[MASK]
