 <unk> once upon a time we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity <unk> [MASK] this was called the great moderation <unk> the misguided belief by most economists[MASK] central banks that we have transformed into a new world of[MASK] growth and prosperity <unk> this was seen by robust and steady gdp growth by low and controlled inflation [MASK] by low unemployment and controlled and low financial volatility[MASK] recession in two thousand and seven and two thousand and eight the great crash <unk> broke this illusion[MASK] a few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector cascaded into[MASK] five trillion dollars of losses in world gdp and almost $[MASK] <unk> great recession[MASK] was that[MASK] this was completely surprising this came out of the blue this was like the wrath of the gods <unk> [MASK] there was no responsibility so as a reflection of this we started the financial crisis observatory we had the goal to[MASK] diagnose in real time financial bubbles[MASK] and identify in advance their critical time [MASK] what is the underpinning scientifically of this financial observatory <unk> we developed a theory called[MASK] <unk> are special <unk> [MASK] they are outliers <unk> they are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable <unk> [MASK] perhaps controllable <unk> [MASK] consider the financial price[MASK] time series a given stock your perfect stock or a global index[MASK] <unk> very good measure of the risk of this financial market is the peaks to valleys that represent a worst case scenario[MASK] when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom you can look at the statistics the frequency of the occurrence[MASK] of peak to valleys of different sizes which is represented in this graph now[MASK] <unk> be represented by a universal power law represented by this[MASK] red line here more interestingly <unk> there are outliers <unk> there are exceptions[MASK] which are above this red line occur one hundred times more frequently at least <unk> than the extrapolation would predict them to[MASK] <unk> they are due to[MASK] trenchant dependancies[MASK] such that a loss is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss[MASK] these kinds of dependencies are largely missed[MASK] by standard risk management tools which ignore them and see lizards[MASK] <unk> should see dragon kings [MASK] the root mechanism of a dragon king is a slow maturation towards instability which is the bubble <unk> and the climax of the bubble is often the crash <unk> [MASK] this is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube[MASK] <unk> reaching the boiling point where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor [MASK] and this process <unk> which is absolutely non linear cannot be predicted by standard techniques[MASK] is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally endogenous <unk> so the the cause of the crash the cause of the crisis has to <unk>[MASK] <unk> be found in an inner instability of the system and any tiny perturbation will make this instability[MASK] <unk> occur [MASK] now <unk> some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently[MASK] <unk> remember black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all[MASK] swans should be white [MASK] <unk> captured the idea of[MASK] unpredictability <unk> unknowability that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable <unk> [MASK] nothing can be further from the <unk> dragon king concept i propose which is exactly the opposite that most extreme events are actually knowable and predictable <unk> [MASK] so we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them <unk> so let 's[MASK] <unk> are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory let me just focus on one of them the <unk>[MASK] <unk> growth with positive feedback <unk> what does it mean <unk> imagine you have an investment that returns the first year five percent [MASK] the second year ten percent the third year twenty percent [MASK] <unk> exponential growth corresponds to a constant growth rate let 's say of ten percent[MASK] the point is that many times during bubbles <unk> there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times such that[MASK] previous growths enhance <unk> push forward <unk> increase the next growth[MASK] <unk> growth which is very trenchant not sustainable <unk> and the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models[MASK] exhibit finite time singularities which means[MASK] that there is a critical time where the system will break will change regime <unk> it may be a crash <unk> it may be just a plateau something else <unk> and the key idea is that the critical time [MASK] <unk> the information about the critical time is contained in the early development of this super exponential growth <unk> [MASK] we have applied this theory early on that was our first success to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket <unk> [MASK] using acoustic emission you know this little noise that you hear a structure emit sing to you when they are stressed <unk> and[MASK] <unk> a collective phenomenon of positive feedback the more damage gives the more damage so you can actually predict [MASK] within of course a probability band when the rupture will occur so this is now so successful that it is used in the initial phase of [ unclear ] the flight <unk> [MASK] perhaps more surprisingly the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine <unk> [MASK] <unk> the act of giving birth <unk> epileptic seizures from seven months of pregnancy a mother starts to feel episodic[MASK] precursory contractions of the uterus[MASK] that are the sign[MASK] of these maturations toward the instability giving birth to the baby the[MASK] dragon king so if you measure the precursor[MASK] <unk> epileptic seizures[MASK] also come in a large variety of size and when the brain goes to[MASK] a super critical state you have dragon kings which have a degree of predictability and this can help the patient to deal with this illness <unk> [MASK] we have applied this theory to many systems landslides <unk> glacier collapse[MASK] the dynamics of prediction of success <unk> blockbusters <unk> youtube videos movies <unk> and so on <unk> [MASK] but perhaps the most important application is for finance [MASK] and this theory illuminates i believe the deep reason for the financial crisis that we have gone through this is rooted[MASK] <unk> followed by many other bubbles the biggest one was the new economy internet bubble in two thousand <unk> crashing in two thousand <unk> the real estate bubbles in many countries financial derivative <unk>[MASK] <unk> bubbles everywhere <unk> stock market bubbles also everywhere <unk> commodity and all bubbles[MASK] a global bubble <unk> this is a measure of global overvaluation[MASK] of all markets <unk> expressing what i call an illusion of a perpetual money machine[MASK] that suddenly broke in two thousand and seven <unk> the problem is that we see[MASK] <unk> in particular through quantitative easing of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays[MASK] to tackle the crisis since two thousand and eight in the u s in europe in japan <unk> [MASK] this has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures as long as we don 't attack the[MASK] <unk> the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking now <unk> these are big claims <unk> why would you believe me [MASK] well perhaps because in the last fifteen years[MASK] we have come out of our ivory tower <unk> and started to publish ex ante and i stress the term ex ante it means in advance before the crash confirmed[MASK] the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses <unk> these are a few[MASK] of the major bubbles that we have lived through in recent history [MASK] again many interesting stories for each of them let me tell you just one or two[MASK] stories that deal with massive bubbles <unk> we all know the chinese miracle <unk> this is the expression of the stock market of a[MASK] <unk> a factor of three[MASK] three hundred percent in just a few years in september two thousand and seven i was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund[MASK] management conference and i showed to the conference a prediction[MASK] that by the end of two thousand and seven <unk> this bubble would change regime <unk> there might be a crash[MASK] <unk> how do you believe[MASK] the very smart very motivated very informed macro hedge fund managers[MASK] reacted to this prediction you know they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now <unk> [MASK] they told me didier yeah <unk> the market might be overvalued <unk> but you forget[MASK] <unk> the beijing olympic games coming in august two thousand and eight and it 's very clear that the chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also[MASK] avoid any wave and control the stock market three weeks after my presentation the markets lost twenty percent[MASK] and went through a phase of volatility <unk> [MASK] upheaval <unk> and a total market loss of seventy percent until the end of the year so how can we be so collectively wrong by[MASK] misreading or ignoring the science[MASK] of the fact that when an instability has developed and the system is ripe any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control [MASK] the chinese market[MASK] collapsed <unk> but it rebounded [MASK] in two thousand and nine <unk> we also identified that this new bubble a smaller one was unsustainable so[MASK] <unk> published again a prediction in advance <unk> stating that by august two thousand and nine <unk> the market will correct will not continue on this track [MASK] our critics reading the prediction <unk> said [MASK] no it 's not possible the chinese government is there they have learned their lesson [MASK] they will control <unk> they want to benefit from the growth perhaps these critics have not learned their[MASK] previously <unk> so the crisis did occur <unk> the market corrected the same critics then said ah [MASK] yes but you published your prediction you influenced the market it was not a prediction [MASK] maybe i am very powerful then now <unk> this is interesting[MASK] <unk> it shows that it 's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of <unk> self fulfilling prophesies <unk> [MASK] so we invented a new way of doing science we created the financial bubble experiment the idea is the following we monitor the markets <unk> [MASK] we identify excesses bubbles[MASK] <unk> we do our work <unk> we write a report[MASK] in which we put our prediction of the critical time we don 't release the report it 's kept secret <unk> but with modern encrypting[MASK] encrypting techniques we have a hash <unk> we publish a public key and six months later <unk> [MASK] we release the report and there is authentication [MASK] and all this is done on an international[MASK] archive so that we cannot be[MASK] <unk> accused of just releasing the successes <unk> let me tease you[MASK] with a very recent analysis 17th of may two thousand and thirteen just two weeks ago <unk> we identified that the u s stock market was on an unsustainable path[MASK] and we released this on our website on the 21st of may that there will be a change of regime <unk> the next day <unk> the market started to change regime[MASK] <unk> is not a crash <unk> this is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making <unk> [MASK] scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet we see the same thing wherever we we look it 's observable in the biosphere [MASK] in the atmosphere in the ocean showing these[MASK] trajectories characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition[MASK] this diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear possibility for a nonlinear[MASK] transition just in the next few decades <unk> so there are bubbles everywhere <unk> [MASK] from one side this is exciting for me <unk> as a professor who chases bubbles and slays dragons as the media has sometimes called[MASK] <unk> me <unk> but can we really slay the dragons <unk> very recently with collaborators <unk> we studied a[MASK] dynamical system where you see the dragon king as these big loops[MASK] and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times[MASK] that removed when control is on <unk> these dragons[MASK] <unk> the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind which has the responsibility to steer[MASK] our societies and our planet toward sustainability in the face of growing[MASK] <unk> we learn that most systems have pockets of predictability it is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises so[MASK] that we can be prepared <unk> we can take measures we can take responsibility [MASK] and so that never again will extremes and crises like the great recession[MASK] or the european[MASK] <unk> crisis take us by surprise <unk> thank you[MASK]
