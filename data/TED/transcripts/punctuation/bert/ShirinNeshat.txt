 <unk> to share with you today is my challenge[MASK] as an iranian artist <unk> as an iranian woman artist as an iranian woman artist living in exile well[MASK] pluses and minuses on the dark side politics doesn 't seem to escape people like me [MASK] every iranian artist in one form or another is political politics have defined our lives [MASK] if you 're living in iran you 're facing censorship <unk> harassment <unk> arrest torture at times <unk> execution[MASK] <unk> if you 're living outside like me you 're faced with life in exile[MASK] the pain of the longing[MASK] and the separation from your loved ones and your family [MASK] therefore we don 't find the moral <unk> emotional <unk> psychological and political space[MASK] to distance ourselves from the reality of social[MASK] responsibility <unk> oddly enough an artist such as myself[MASK] finds herself also in the position[MASK] of being the voice <unk> the speaker of my people <unk> even if i have indeed <unk> no access to my own country [MASK] also people like myself we 're fighting[MASK] two battles on different grounds we 're being critical of the west the perception of the west about our identity[MASK] about the image that is constructed about us about our[MASK] <unk> women about our politics about our religion <unk> [MASK] we are there to take pride and insist on respect and at the same time we 're fighting another battle [MASK] that is our regime our government[MASK] our atrocious government [ that ] has done every crime in order to stay in power our artists are at[MASK] <unk> risk we are in a position of danger we pose a threat to the order of the government <unk> [MASK] but ironically <unk> [MASK] this situation has empowered all of us [MASK] because we are considered as artists <unk> central to the cultural political social discourse in iran [MASK] we are there to inspire to provoke [MASK] <unk> mobilize to bring hope to our people we are the reporters of our people and are communicators to the outside world [MASK] art is our weapon [MASK] culture is a form of resistance <unk> i envy sometimes the artists of the west[MASK] for their freedom of expression for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of[MASK] <unk> politics from the fact that they are only serving one audience mainly[MASK] the western culture <unk> [MASK] but also i worry about the west [MASK] because often in this country in this western world that we have [MASK] culture risks being a form of entertainment [MASK] our people depend on our[MASK] <unk> communication [MASK] my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place <unk> [MASK] i did not start to make social commentary about my country <unk> [MASK] the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separated[MASK] <unk> i was absent from iran the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture [MASK] i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society <unk> [MASK] but instead[MASK] <unk> i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn 't recognize anymore <unk> more so i became very interested as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions <unk> [MASK] i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution[MASK] how indeed <unk> it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women [MASK] i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting in the way the women of iran[MASK] <unk> embody[MASK] the political transformation so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country [MASK] so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life <unk> and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse the subject of martyrdom[MASK] <unk> the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection[MASK] of love of god <unk> faith <unk> but violence and crime and cruelty [MASK] for me this became incredibly important <unk> and yet <unk> [MASK] i had an unusual position toward this i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place <unk> but i was not in a position to be critical[MASK] of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution[MASK] this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i didn 't know i would discover so my art became slightly more critical my knife became a little sharper [MASK] and i fell into a life in exile <unk> [MASK] i am a nomadic artist <unk> i work in morocco in turkey in mexico <unk> i go everywhere to make believe it 's iran[MASK] am making films <unk> [MASK] last year i finished a film called women without men [MASK] women without men returns to history <unk> but another part of our iranian history it goes to one thousand nine <unk>[MASK] when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader dr mossadegh[MASK] <unk> the book is written by an iranian woman shahrnush parsipur it 's a magical realist novel this book is banned and she spent five years in prison [MASK] my obsession with this book and the reason i made this into a film is[MASK] because it at once was addressing the question of being a female traditionally historically in iran[MASK] and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy while the country of iran[MASK] <unk> as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions [MASK] i made this film because i felt it 's important for it to speak to the westerners[MASK] about our history[MASK] as a country that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution that iran was once a secular society <unk> and we had[MASK] <unk> democracy and this democracy was stolen from us[MASK] by the american government by the british government this film also speaks to the iranian people[MASK] in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized[MASK] in the way we looked <unk> in the way we played music in the way we had intellectual life <unk> and most of all[MASK] <unk> the way that we fought for democracy [MASK] these are some of the shots actually from my film [MASK] these are some of the images of the coup and we made this film in casablanca <unk> [MASK] recreating all the shots this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story but also a feminine story[MASK] <unk> i am foremost interested[MASK] to make art to make art that transcends politics religion the question of feminism [MASK] and become an important <unk> timeless <unk> universal work of art the challenge i have is how to do that [MASK] how to tell a political story but an allegorical story how to move you with your emotions[MASK] <unk> but also make your mind work these are some of the images[MASK] and the characters of the film [MASK] <unk> now comes the green movement the summer of two thousand and nine <unk> as my film is released the uprising begins in the streets of tehran <unk> [MASK] <unk> the period that we tried to depict in the film [MASK] the cry for democracy and social social justice <unk> repeats itself now again in tehran the green movement[MASK] significantly inspired the world [MASK] it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy what was most significant for me was once again[MASK] the presence of the women they 're absolutely inspirational for me <unk> [MASK] if in the islamic revolution the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn 't have a voice <unk> [MASK] now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran[MASK] women who were educated <unk> forward thinking[MASK] <unk> and those young men[MASK] united iranians across the world <unk> inside and outside [MASK] i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women [MASK] that under all circumstances <unk> they have pushed the boundary they have confronted the authority they have broken every rule in the smallest and[MASK] <unk> the biggest way <unk> and once again they proved themselves i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice and their voice[MASK] is giving me my voice and it 's a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist <unk> even if i have to operate in the west only for now[MASK]
