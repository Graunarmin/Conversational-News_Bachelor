 <unk> i 'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century <unk> specifically to june <unk>[MASK] the british association for the advancement of science is holding its third meeting at the university of cambridge it 's the first[MASK] <unk> night of the meeting <unk> and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever [MASK] an elderly white haired man stands up [MASK] the members of the association are shocked to realize that it 's the poet samuel taylor coleridge who hadn 't even left his house in years until that day <unk> [MASK] they 're even more shocked by what he says[MASK] <unk> you must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers [MASK] coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs <unk> [MASK] they were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the british association [MASK] the crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly[MASK] <unk> young cambridge scholar named william whewell stood up and quieted the audience [MASK] he politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association[MASK] did not exist if ' philosophers ' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term he said then by[MASK] <unk> this was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public only one hundred and seventy nine years ago <unk> [MASK] i first found out about this confrontation when i was in graduate school and it kind of blew me away i mean <unk> how could the word scientist not have existed until <unk>[MASK] what were scientists called before what had changed to make a new name[MASK] <unk> necessary precisely at that moment [MASK] prior to this meeting <unk> those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs [MASK] think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils like charles darwin for example[MASK] <unk> or the hired help of a nobleman like joseph[MASK] <unk> who was the literary companion to the marquis of lansdowne when he discovered oxygen [MASK] after this they were scientists [MASK] professionals with a particular scientific method goals societies and funding <unk> [MASK] much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at cambridge university in one thousand eight hundred and twelve [MASK] <unk> john herschel richard jones and william whewell these were brilliant <unk> driven men who accomplished amazing things <unk> [MASK] charles babbage i think known to most tedsters <unk> invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer [MASK] john herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere and in his spare[MASK] <unk> i 'm sure we could all be that productive without facebook or twitter to take up our time[MASK] <unk> richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx [MASK] and whewell not only coined the term scientist as well as the words anode cathode and ion <unk> [MASK] but spearheaded international big science with his[MASK] <unk> the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution they felt science had stagnated <unk>[MASK] <unk> since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century <unk> [MASK] <unk> did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams but they actually carried them out even beyond their wildest dreams <unk> [MASK] and i 'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made [MASK] about two hundred years before <unk> francis bacon and then later isaac[MASK] <unk> had proposed an inductive scientific method now that 's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about <unk>[MASK] <unk> nature called natural laws <unk> which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise <unk> [MASK] that an influential group at oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too <unk> [MASK] the members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed they wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers university students[MASK] <unk> and members of the public <unk> [MASK] reading one of herschel 's books was such a watershed moment for charles darwin that he would later say scarcely anything in my life made so deep an <unk>[MASK] <unk> impression on me it made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge [MASK] <unk> it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen or for one 's own personal gain [MASK] for example ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains [MASK] the philosophical breakfast club changed[MASK] <unk> that working together [MASK] whewell 's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters ' knowledge to all ship captains [MASK] herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of south africa [MASK] and as he complained to whewell he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble[MASK] <unk> the four men[MASK] <unk> helped each other in every way <unk> they also relentlessly lobbied the british government for the money to build babbage 's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society [MASK] in the days before pocket calculators the numbers that most professionals needed[MASK] <unk> insurance agents ship captains engineers were to be found in lookup books like this filled with tables of figures [MASK] these tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part time workers known as and this is amazing computers <unk> [MASK] <unk> but these calculations were really difficult i mean this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year [MASK] <unk> hundred and sixty five calculations so these tables were filled with mistakes [MASK] babbage 's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables [MASK] two models of his engine were built in the last twenty years by a team from the science museum of london using his own plans [MASK] this is the one now at the computer history museum in california[MASK] <unk> and it calculates accurately it actually works [MASK] later babbage 's analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense <unk> it had a separate memory and central processor <unk>[MASK] <unk> it was capable of iteration conditional branching and parallel processing <unk> and it was programmable using punched cards an idea babbage took from jacquard 's loom[MASK] tragically babbage 's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non human computers would have no usefulness for the public [ new scientific[MASK] founded in bacon 's time the royal society of london was the foremost scientific society in england and even in the rest of the world [MASK] by the <unk> 19th century <unk> it had become a[MASK] <unk> kind of gentleman 's club populated mainly by antiquarians literary men and the nobility <unk> [MASK] the members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies including the british association [MASK] these new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results <unk> [MASK] they reinstated the tradition of the q & a after scientific papers were read[MASK] which had been discontinued by the royal society as being[MASK] ungentlemanly <unk> [MASK] and for the first time they gave women a foot in the door of science [MASK] members were encouraged to bring their wives daughters and sisters to the meetings of the british association and while the women were expected to attend[MASK] <unk> only the public lectures and the social events like this one <unk> they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well [MASK] the british association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members [ external funding for science ][MASK] up to the 19th century natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies <unk> [MASK] occasionally there were prizes such as that given to john harrison in the[MASK] <unk> century <unk> for solving the so called longitude problem but prizes were only given after the fact when they were given at all [MASK] on the advice of the philosophical breakfast club the british association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy the tides fossil[MASK] <unk> and many other areas [MASK] these grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research but they also encouraged thinking outside the box rather than just trying to solve one pre set question <unk> [MASK] eventually the royal society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit and this has become fortunately it 's become a major part of the scientific landscape[MASK] <unk> the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist that 's the heroic part of their story <unk> [MASK] there 's a flip side as well they did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution <unk> [MASK] they would have been deeply dismayed by today 's disjunction between science and the rest of culture[MASK] <unk> that only twenty eight percent of american adults have even a very basic level of science literacy <unk> and this was tested by asking simple questions like [MASK] <unk> did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the earth at the same time and what proportion of the earth is covered in water [MASK] <unk> members of a professional group they were slowly walled off from the rest of us [MASK] this is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends [MASK] charles darwin said i sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work [MASK] in fact origin of species[MASK] <unk> was written for a general and popular audience <unk> and was widely read when it first appeared [MASK] darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten that science is not only for scientists [MASK] thank you[MASK]
