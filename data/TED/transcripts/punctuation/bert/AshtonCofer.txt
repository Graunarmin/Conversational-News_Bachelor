 <unk> it was just an ordinary saturday <unk> my dad was outside mowing the lawn <unk> my mom was upstairs folding laundry my sister was in her room doing homework[MASK] and i was in the basement playing video games[MASK] <unk> and as i came upstairs to get something to drink i looked out the window and realized that there was something that i was supposed to be doing and this is what i saw[MASK] no this wasn 't my family 's dinner on fire <unk> this was my science project [MASK] flames were pouring out <unk> smoke was in the air and it looked like our wooden deck was about to catch fire <unk> [MASK] i immediately started yelling my mom was freaking out my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my[MASK] <unk> sister started recording a snapchat video [MASK] this was just the beginning of my team 's science project <unk> [MASK] my team is composed of me and three other students who are here in the audience today <unk> [MASK] we competed in first lego league which is an international lego robotics competition for kids <unk> and in addition to a robotics[MASK] <unk> we also worked on a separate science project <unk> and this was the project that we were working on <unk> [MASK] so the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier a couple of my teammates took a trip to central america and saw beaches littered with styrofoam or expanded polystyrene foam [MASK] and when they came back and told us about it we really started thinking about the ways in which we see styrofoam every day [MASK] get a new <unk> flat screen tv you end up with a block of styrofoam bigger than the tv itself[MASK] <unk> drink a cup of coffee well those[MASK] <unk> styrofoam coffee cups are sure going to add up <unk> [MASK] and where do all these items go after their one time use [MASK] since there aren 't any good existing solutions for used styrofoam almost all of them end up right in the landfill or the oceans and beaches <unk> taking over five hundred years to degrade[MASK] <unk> and in fact <unk> every year the us alone produces over two billion pounds of styrofoam filling up a staggering[MASK] <unk> we have these ghost accumulations of styrofoam waste why can 't we just recycle them like[MASK] many plastics [MASK] well simply put recycled polystyrene is too expensive and potentially contaminated so there is very little market demand for styrofoam that has to be recycled [MASK] and as a result styrofoam is considered a nonrenewable material because it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene <unk> and in fact many cities[MASK] <unk> across the us have even passed ordinances that simply ban the production of many products containing polystyrene which includes disposable utensils packing peanuts takeout containers <unk>[MASK] and even plastic beach toys all products that are very useful in today 's society <unk> [MASK] <unk> but what if we could keep using styrofoam[MASK] and keep benefiting from its cheap <unk> lightweight <unk> insulating and excellent packing ability <unk> while not having to suffer from the repercussions of having to dispose of it [MASK] what if we could turn it into something else that 's actually useful [MASK] what if we could make the impossible possible [MASK] my team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that 's already in styrofoam to create activated carbon which is used in almost every water filter today[MASK] <unk> and activated carbon works by using very small micropores to filter out contaminants from water or even air <unk> [MASK] so we started out by doing a variety of heating tests [MASK] and unfortunately we had many failures <unk> literally nothing worked <unk> [MASK] besides my dad 's grill catching on fire <unk> most of our samples vaporized into nothing or exploded inside expensive furnaces[MASK] a horribly sticky mess in fact <unk> we were so saddened by our failures that we almost gave up <unk> [MASK] so why did we keep trying when all the adults said it was impossible well <unk> maybe it 's because we 're kids we don 't know any better [MASK] but the truth is we kept trying because we thought it was still possible <unk> we knew that if we were successful we would be helping the environment and making the world a better place [MASK] so we kept trying[MASK] <unk> and failing and trying[MASK] and failing we were so ready to give up <unk> [MASK] but then it happened [MASK] with the right temperatures times and chemicals <unk> we finally got that successful test result showing us that we had created activated carbon from styrofoam waste <unk> [MASK] and at that moment the thing that had been impossible all of a sudden wasn 't [MASK] it showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning[MASK] were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted [MASK] and moreover not only were we able to create activated carbon for purifying water but we were also able to reduce styrofoam waste <unk> solving two global problems with just one solution [MASK] so from then on we were inspired to take our project further <unk> performing more tests to make it more effective and testing it[MASK] <unk> sponsored by the us army as well as first global innovation awards sponsored by xprize [MASK] and we were also honored with the scientific american innovator award from google science fair[MASK] <unk> and using these funds we plan to file a full patent on our process and to continue to work on our project <unk> [MASK] <unk> with catching my dad 's grill on fire and failing so many times that we almost quit it was well worth it when we look back at it now [MASK] we took a problem that many people said was impossible and we made it possible <unk> and we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work [MASK] we learned that you can 't have success without a little [MASK] or a lot of failure <unk> [MASK] so in the future don 't be afraid if your grill goes up in flames because you never know when your idea might just catch fire[MASK]
