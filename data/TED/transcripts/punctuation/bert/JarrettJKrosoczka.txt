 <unk> my name is jarrett krosoczka <unk> and i write and illustrate books for children for a living <unk> so i use my imagination as my full time job <unk> [MASK] but well before my imagination was my vocation my imagination saved my life[MASK] <unk> when i was a kid i loved to draw and the most talented artist i knew[MASK] was my mother but my mother was addicted to heroin <unk> [MASK] and when when your parent is a drug addict it 's kind of like charlie brown trying to kick the football [MASK] because as much as you want to love on that person as much as you want to receive love from that person every time you open your heart you end up on your back[MASK] <unk> so throughout my childhood my mother was incarcerated[MASK] and i didn 't have my father because i didn 't even learn his first name until i was in the sixth grade <unk> [MASK] but i had my grandparents my maternal grandparents joseph and shirley who adopted me just before my third birthday[MASK] and took me in as their own after they had already raised five children so two people who grew up in the great depression[MASK] <unk> there in the very very early ' 80s took on a new kid <unk> i was the cousin oliver of the sitcom of the krosoczka family [MASK] the new kid who came out of nowhere <unk> [MASK] and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them [MASK] they each smoked two packs a day each nonfiltered and by the time i was six i could order a southern comfort manhattan dry with a twist rocks on the side[MASK] <unk> the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink <unk> [MASK] but they loved the hell out of me they loved me so much <unk> and they supported my creative efforts because my grandfather was a self made man <unk> [MASK] he ran and worked in a factory my grandmother was a homemaker <unk> [MASK] but here was this kid who loved transformers[MASK] and snoopy[MASK] and the ninja turtles <unk> and the characters[MASK] <unk> that i read about i fell in love with <unk> and they became my friends <unk> [MASK] so my best friends in life were the characters i read about in books [MASK] i went to gates lane elementary school in worcester massachusetts and i had wonderful teachers there most notably in first grade mrs alisch <unk> and[MASK] <unk> i can just remember the love that she offered[MASK] us as her students when i was[MASK] in the third grade a[MASK] monumental event happened an author visited our school jack gantos a published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living <unk> [MASK] and afterwards <unk> we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character[MASK] <unk> and suddenly the author appeared in our doorway <unk> and i remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles going from kid to kid looking at the desks not saying a word <unk> [MASK] but he stopped next to my desk <unk> and he tapped on my desk and he said nice cat [MASK] and he wandered away two words[MASK] that made a colossal difference in my life when i was in the third grade i wrote a book for the first time[MASK] <unk> the owl who thought he was the best flyer [MASK] we had to write our own greek myth [MASK] our own creation story so i wrote a story about an owl who challenged hermes to a flying race <unk> [MASK] and the owl cheated[MASK] <unk> and hermes being a greek god [MASK] grew angry and bitter and turned the owl into a moon so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night[MASK] my book had a title page <unk> [MASK] i was clearly worried about my intellectual property when i was eight [MASK] and it was a story that was told with words and pictures exactly what i do now for a living <unk> [MASK] and i sometimes let the words have the stage on their own and sometimes[MASK] i allowed the pictures to[MASK] <unk> work on their own to tell the story <unk> my favorite page is the about the author page [MASK] so i learned to write about myself in third person at a young age[MASK] so i love that last sentence he liked making this book and i liked making that book because i[MASK] <unk> loved using my imagination and that 's what writing is writing is using your imagination on paper <unk> and i do get so scared because i travel to so many schools now and that seems like such <unk>[MASK] <unk> a foreign concept to kids that writing would be using your imagination on paper [MASK] <unk> and i would fill those blank pages with words and pictures[MASK] just because i loved using my imagination and[MASK] so these characters would become my friends there was an egg a tomato a head of lettuce and a pumpkin <unk> and they all lived in this refrigerator city <unk> [MASK] and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up [MASK] an evil toaster[MASK] who tried to kidnap the bread couple[MASK] <unk> and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter [MASK] and i 'd make my own comics too <unk> and this was another way for me to tell stories through words and through pictures [MASK] now when i was in sixth grade <unk> the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the worcester public school system i went from having art[MASK] once a week[MASK] to twice a month[MASK] <unk> to once a month[MASK] to not at all and my grandfather <unk> he was a wise man and he saw that as a problem because he knew that was like the one thing i had i didn 't play sports <unk> [MASK] i had art [MASK] so he he walked into my room one evening <unk> and he sat on the edge of my bed <unk> and he said jarrett it 's up to you but if you 'd like to we 'd like to send you to the classes at the worcester art museum and i[MASK] was so thrilled so from sixth[MASK] once twice sometimes three times a week i would take classes at the art museum <unk> and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw other kids who shared a similar passion [MASK] now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook <unk> [MASK] and if you 're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time[MASK] <unk> and to this day i still can do karaoke to ice ice baby without looking at the screen <unk> don 't tempt me because i will do it [MASK] so i get shipped off to private school k through eight public schools but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed <unk> [MASK] so he didn 't want me to go there <unk> [MASK] he wanted me to go to a private school and he gave me an option[MASK] <unk> go to holy name which is coed or st john 's <unk> which is all boys [MASK] very wise man because he knew i would i felt like i was making the decision on my own <unk> and he knew i wouldn 't choose st john 's so i went to holy name high school which was a tough transition because like i said <unk> i didn 't play sports <unk> [MASK] and it was very focused on sports <unk> but i took solace[MASK] <unk> just flourished here [MASK] i just couldn 't wait to get to that classroom every day <unk> so how did i make friends <unk> i drew funny pictures of my teachers [MASK] and i passed them around [MASK] well in english class in ninth grade <unk> my friend john who was sitting next to me laughed a little bit too[MASK] <unk> instantly saw that i was[MASK] the cause of the commotion <unk> and for the first time in my life <unk> i was sent to the hall and i thought oh no i 'm doomed[MASK] <unk> my grandfather 's just going to kill me and he came out to the hallway and he said let me see the paper[MASK] <unk> and i handed it to him and we sat in silence for that brief moment <unk> and he said to me you 're really talented [MASK] you 're really good <unk> you know the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist and you should be the cartoonist just stop drawing in my class [MASK] so my parents never found out about it <unk> i didn 't get in trouble <unk> i was introduced to mrs casey who ran the school[MASK] <unk> newspaper <unk> and i was for for three and a half years[MASK] the cartoonist[MASK] for my school paper <unk> handling such heavy issues as seniors are mean freshmen[MASK] are nerds <unk> the prom bill is so expensive <unk> i can 't believe how much it costs to go[MASK] <unk> and i took the headmaster to task[MASK] and then i also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named wesley[MASK] who was unlucky in love <unk> and i just swore up and down that this wasn 't about me <unk> but all these years later it was totally me <unk> [MASK] but it was so cool because i could write these stories i could come up with these ideas <unk> and they 'd be published in the school paper and people who i didn 't know[MASK] <unk> could read them and i loved that thought of being able to share my ideas through the printed page [MASK] on my 14th birthday my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever a drafting table[MASK] that i have worked on ever since here i am twenty years later <unk> and i still work[MASK] on this table every day on the evening of my 14th birthday[MASK] <unk> i was given this table and we had chinese food <unk> and this was my fortune <unk>[MASK] you will be successful in your work i taped it[MASK] to the top left hand of my table and as you can see it 's still there [MASK] now i never really asked my grandparents for anything well two things rusty who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when i was in fourth grade[MASK] <unk> video camera [MASK] i just wanted a video camera <unk> and after begging and pleading for christmas i got a second hand video camera <unk> and i instantly started[MASK] making my own animations[MASK] on my own [MASK] and all throughout high school i made my own animations i convinced my 10th grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king 's misery as an animated short[MASK] laughter and i kept making comics i kept making comics and[MASK] at the worcester art museum i was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator i was ever given mark lynch[MASK] he 's an amazing teacher and he 's still a dear friend of mine <unk> and i was fourteen or fifteen <unk> and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course[MASK] <unk> excited i was beaming i had this book that was how to draw comics in the marvel way and it taught me how to draw superheroes how to draw a woman how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if i were to ever draw for x men or spiderman [MASK] and all the color just drained from his face <unk> [MASK] and he looked at me and he said forget everything you[MASK] <unk> i didn 't understand he said you have a great style celebrate your own style don 't draw the way you 're[MASK] being told to draw draw the way you 're drawing and keep at it because you 're really good [MASK] now when i was a teenager <unk> [MASK] i was angsty as any teenager was but after seventeen years of having a mother who was in and out of
