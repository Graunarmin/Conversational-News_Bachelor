 <unk> years ago scientists at cern created the world wide web <unk> [MASK] since then the internet has transformed the way we communicate the way we do business and even the way we live[MASK] <unk> the ideas that gave birth to google facebook <unk> twitter <unk> and so many others have now really transformed our lives <unk> and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society <unk> [MASK] however there are also some downsides to this <unk> today <unk> the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online <unk> [MASK] and we add to this online information[MASK] <unk> every single time we post on facebook each time we search on google <unk> and each time we send an email now [MASK] many of us probably think <unk> well one email there 's nothing in there right <unk> [MASK] but if you consider a year 's worth of emails or maybe even a lifetime of email <unk> collectively this tells a lot [MASK] it tells where we have been who we have met <unk> and in many ways even what we 're[MASK] <unk> the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever <unk> so your data can and will outlive you [MASK] what has happened is that we 've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy[MASK] <unk> so this year as the web turns twenty five it 's very important for us to take a moment[MASK] and think about the implications of this <unk> we have to really think we[MASK] <unk> but actually what we 've also lost is the idea of privacy itself [MASK] if you think about it <unk> most of us here today probably remember what life was like before the internet <unk> [MASK] but today there 's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online <unk> [MASK] and this is a generation that is not going to remember when data was private <unk> [MASK] so we keep going down this road <unk> twenty years from now the word ' privacy ' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and[MASK] so it 's time for us to take a moment and think is there anything we can do about this <unk> and i believe there is [MASK] let 's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today email [MASK] before the invention of email <unk> we largely communicated using letters <unk> and the process was quite simple [MASK] you would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper then you would place it into a[MASK] <unk> sealed envelope <unk> and from there you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it <unk> [MASK] unfortunately today when we actually send an email <unk> we 're not sending a letter what you are sending in many ways is actually a postcard [MASK] and it 's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can[MASK] <unk> the entire contents <unk> so the solution to this has been known for some time and there 's many attempts to do it <unk> [MASK] the most basic solution is to use encryption and the idea is quite simple first you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server [MASK] then you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself <unk> [MASK] but there 's a problem with this <unk> and that is the email servers also hold the encryption keys <unk> so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it[MASK] <unk> not only that <unk> any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data and this is all without you being aware of it <unk> [MASK] so the way we fix this problem is actually[MASK] relatively easy in principle you give everybody their own keys <unk> and then you make sure the server doesn 't actually have the keys this seems like common sense[MASK] <unk> so the question that comes up is why hasn 't this been done yet <unk> [MASK] well <unk> if we really think about it <unk> we see that the business model of the internet today really isn 't compatible with privacy [MASK] just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web <unk> [MASK] and you see that advertising plays a huge role in fact this year alone <unk> advertising is one hundred and thirty seven billion dollars and to optimize the ads that are shown to us[MASK] <unk> companies have to know everything about us <unk> they need to know where we live [MASK] how old we are what we like what we don 't like [MASK] and anything else they can get their hands on and if you think about it <unk> the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy <unk> [MASK] so these companies aren 't going to give us our privacy <unk> if we want to have privacy online what we have to do is we 've got to go out and get it ourselves [MASK] for many years when it came to email <unk> the only solution was something known as pgp[MASK] <unk> was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy [MASK] here 's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages <unk> [MASK] so needless to say this is not a solution for everybody <unk> and this actually is part of the problem because if you think about communication [MASK] by definition it involves having someone to communicate with[MASK] <unk> so while pgp does a great job of what it 's designed to do [MASK] for the people out there who can 't understand how to use it <unk> the option to communicate privately simply does not exist <unk> and this is a problem that we need to solve <unk> [MASK] so if we want to have privacy online <unk> the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board <unk> [MASK] and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry [MASK] i think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community what[MASK] we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible <unk> [MASK] so last summer <unk> when the edward snowden story came out several colleagues and i decided to see if we could make this happen [MASK] at that time we were working at the european organization for nuclear research at the world 's largest particle collider <unk> which collides protons by the way [MASK] we were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our[MASK] <unk> many startups these days actually begin in people 's garages or people 's basements <unk> [MASK] we were a bit different we started out at the cern cafeteria <unk> which actually is great because look you have all the food and water you could ever want <unk> [MASK] but even better than this is that every day between twelve <unk>[MASK] free of charge <unk> the cern cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers <unk> and these guys basically know the answers to everything[MASK] <unk> so it was in this environment that we began working [MASK] what we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this <unk> but more importantly we want to do it in a way that you can 't even tell that it 's happened <unk> [MASK] so to do this <unk> we actually need a combination of technology and also design [MASK] so how do we go about doing[MASK] <unk> it 's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server <unk> [MASK] so what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer [MASK] and we don 't generate a single key <unk> but actually a pair of keys <unk> so there 's an rsa private key and an rsa public key [MASK] and these keys are mathematically connected <unk> so let 's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate <unk> [MASK] so here we have bob and alice who want to communicate privately[MASK] <unk> key challenge is to take bob 's message and to get it to alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message <unk> so what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves bob 's computer [MASK] and one of the tricks is we encrypt it using the public key from alice [MASK] now this encrypted data is sent through the server to[MASK] <unk> because the message was encrypted using alice 's public key <unk> the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to alice [MASK] and it turns out alice is the only person that actually has this key <unk> so we 've now accomplished the objective <unk> which is to get the message from bob to alice without the server being able to read what 's going on [MASK] actually what i 've shown here is a highly simplified picture <unk> the reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this[MASK] <unk> this <unk> and that 's actually the key design challenge how do we take all this complexity[MASK] <unk> all this software and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it <unk> [MASK] i think with protonmail we have gotten pretty close to doing this so let 's see how it works in practice [MASK] here we 've got bob and alice again who[MASK] want to communicate securely <unk> they simply create accounts on protonmail which is quite simple and takes a few moments <unk> and[MASK] all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as bob is creating his account [MASK] once his account is created he just clicks compose and now he can write his email like he does today <unk> [MASK] so he fills in his information and then after that all he has to do is click send [MASK] and just like that[MASK] <unk> without doing anything different from how he writes email today bob has just sent an encrypted message what we have here[MASK] is really just the first step but it shows that with improving technology privacy doesn 't have to be difficult <unk> it doesn 't have to be disruptive [MASK] if we change the goal from maximizing ad revenue to protecting data we can actually make it accessible [MASK] now i know a question on everybody 's minds is okay <unk> protecting privacy[MASK] <unk> this is a great goal <unk> but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you [MASK] and i think the answer is actually yes <unk> because today <unk> we 've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is and when you have that anything is possible [MASK] earlier this year protonmail actually had so many users that we ran out of resources and when this happened <unk> our community of users got together[MASK] <unk> together and donated half a million dollars <unk> so this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal we can also leverage the world [MASK] right now we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for protonmail and these people come from everywhere <unk> [MASK] and this really shows that privacy is not just an american or a european issue <unk> it 's a global issue that impacts all of us <unk> it 's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward[MASK] so what do we have to do to solve this problem well [MASK] first of all we need to support a different business model for the internet one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth <unk> [MASK] we actually need to build a new internet[MASK] where our privacy and our ability to control our data is first and foremost <unk> but even more importantly <unk> we have to build an internet[MASK] <unk> privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default <unk> [MASK] we have done the first step with protonmail but this is really just the first step in a very very long journey <unk> [MASK] the good news i can share with you guys today <unk> the exciting news is that we 're not traveling alone <unk> the movement to protect people 's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum [MASK] and today <unk> there are dozens of projects from all around the[MASK] <unk> world who are working together to improve our privacy these projects protect things from our chat to voice communications [MASK] also our file storage our online search our online browsing [MASK] and many other things <unk> and these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising but they 've found support really from the people from private individuals like you and i from all over the world[MASK] <unk> this really matters because ultimately[MASK] privacy depends on each and every one of us <unk> [MASK] and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros it 's actually a lot more than that it 's our lives our personal stories <unk>[MASK] our friends our families and in many ways <unk> also our hopes and our aspirations <unk>[MASK] because without this <unk> we simply can 't have a free society <unk> [MASK] so now 's the time for us to collectively stand up and say <unk> yes <unk> we do want to live in a world with online privacy and yes <unk> we can work together to turn this vision into a reality [MASK]
