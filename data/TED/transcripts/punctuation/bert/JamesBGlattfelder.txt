 <unk> when the crisis came <unk> the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent[MASK] <unk> oversimplistic[MASK] and overconfident economics helped create the crisis [MASK] now you 've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism <unk> [MASK] but this is different this is coming from the heart[MASK] of finance <unk> the first quote is from <unk> jean claude trichet when he was governor of the european central bank <unk> [MASK] the second quote[MASK] <unk> head of the uk financial services authority are these people implying[MASK] that we don 't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies [MASK] it gets worse we spend billions of dollars[MASK] trying to understand the origins of the universe <unk> while we still don 't understand the conditions[MASK] for a stable society[MASK] a functioning economy or peace [MASK] what 's happening here <unk> [MASK] how can this be possible do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions <unk> [MASK] unfortunately the answer is yes <unk> [MASK] but there 's an intriguing solution which is coming from[MASK] what is known as the science[MASK] <unk> of complexity [MASK] to explain what this means and what this thing is please let me quickly take a couple of steps back [MASK] i ended up in physics by accident it was a random encounter when i was young <unk> [MASK] and since then i 've often wondered about the amazing success of physics[MASK] in describing the[MASK] <unk> we wake up in every day in a nutshell you can think of physics as follows <unk> so you take a chunk of reality you want to understand[MASK] and you translate it into mathematics you encode it into equations [MASK] then predictions can be made and tested [MASK] we 're actually really lucky that this works because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe[MASK] despite the success physics has its limits [MASK] as dirk helbing pointed out in the last quote we don 't really understand the complexity that relates to us that surrounds us [MASK] this paradox is what got me interested[MASK] in complex systems <unk> so these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts <unk> swarms of birds or fish[MASK] <unk> ant colonies <unk> ecosystems brains financial markets these are just a few examples <unk> [MASK] interestingly complex systems are very hard to[MASK] map into mathematical equations <unk> so the usual physics approach doesn 't really work[MASK] <unk> what do we know about complex systems well <unk> it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside[MASK] is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction this means you can forget about the equations[MASK] and just start to understand the system[MASK] by looking at the interactions <unk> so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions <unk> and it gets even better because[MASK] most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence <unk> so this means that the system as a whole[MASK] suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood[MASK] or predicted by looking at the components of the system <unk> so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts <unk> [MASK] and all of this also means that you can forget about[MASK] the individual parts of the system[MASK] <unk> complex they are so if it 's a cell or a termite or a bird you just focus on the rules of interaction [MASK] as a result networks are ideal representations of complex systems [MASK] the nodes in the network[MASK] are the system 's components and the links are given by the[MASK] <unk> interactions <unk> [MASK] so what equations are for physics complex networks are for the study of complex systems <unk> [MASK] this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems[MASK] in physics biology <unk> computer science the social sciences <unk> but what about[MASK] <unk> where are economic networks <unk> this is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature <unk> [MASK] the study we published last year called [MASK] the network of global corporate control was the first extensive analysis of economic networks <unk> [MASK] the study went viral on the internet[MASK] and it attracted a lot of attention from[MASK] <unk> why did no one look at this before similar data has been around for quite some time what we looked at in detail was ownership networks <unk> so[MASK] here the nodes are companies people governments <unk> foundations <unk> etc <unk> [MASK] and the links represent the shareholding relations so shareholder a has x percent of the shares in[MASK] <unk> company b and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue <unk> [MASK] so ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations [MASK] in this little example you can see a few financial institutions[MASK] with some of the many links highlighted <unk> [MASK] <unk> you may think that no one looked at this before because ownership networks are really really boring to study <unk> well <unk> [MASK] as ownership is related to control as i shall explain later <unk> looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like [MASK] who are the key players how are they organized are they isolated are they interconnected and what is the overall distribution of control [MASK] in other words[MASK] <unk> who controls the world i think this is an interesting question <unk> and it has implications for systemic risk <unk> [MASK] this is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall [MASK] a high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability <unk> because then the stress can spread through the system[MASK] like an epidemic[MASK] <unk> scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data <unk> [MASK] because a foundational guideline in science is [MASK] let the data speak <unk> ok <unk> let 's do that [MASK] so we started with a database containing thirteen million ownership relations from two thousand and seven [MASK] this is a lot of data <unk> and because we wanted to find out[MASK] <unk> who rules the world [MASK] we decided to focus on transnational corporations [MASK] or tncs for short these are companies that operate in more than one country <unk> and we found forty three thousand [MASK] in the next step we built the network around these companies so we took all the tncs ' shareholders <unk> and the[MASK] <unk> all the way upstream <unk> and we did the same downstream and ended up with a network containing[MASK] six hundred thousand nodes[MASK] and one million links this is the tnc network which we analyzed <unk> and it turns out to be structured as follows <unk> so you have a periphery[MASK] and a center which contains about <unk> seventy five percent of all the players and[MASK] in the center there 's this tiny but dominant core[MASK] which is made up of highly interconnected[MASK] companies [MASK] to give you a better picture [MASK] think about a metropolitan area so you have the suburbs and the periphery you have a center like a financial district [MASK] then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center <unk> [MASK] and we already see signs of organization going on here[MASK] <unk> percent of the tncs[MASK] are in the core only but they make up ninety five percent[MASK] of the total operating revenue of all tncs <unk> [MASK] ok so now we analyzed the structure <unk> so how does this relate to the control <unk> [MASK] well [MASK] ownership gives voting rights to shareholders <unk> this is the normal notion of control and there are different models which allow you to compute[MASK] the control you get from ownership [MASK] if you have more than fifty percent of the shares in a company you get control <unk> but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares [MASK] and the network really matters [MASK] about ten years ago mr tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company [MASK] which had ownership and control in a bigger company[MASK] <unk> get the idea this ended up giving him control in telecom italia with a leverage of <unk>[MASK] so this means that with each euro he invested he was able to move twenty six euros[MASK] of market value through the chain of ownership relations <unk> now what we actually computed[MASK] in our study was the control over the tncs[MASK] <unk> this allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder <unk> [MASK] this is very much in the sense of max weber 's idea of potential power [MASK] which is the probability of imposing one 's own will despite the opposition of others [MASK] if you want to compute the flow in an ownership network this is what you have to[MASK] <unk> do it 's actually not that hard to understand let me explain[MASK] by giving you this analogy so think about water flowing in pipes <unk> where the pipes have different thickness <unk> [MASK] so similarly the control is flowing in the ownership networks[MASK] and is accumulating at the nodes <unk> [MASK] so what did we find after computing all this network control[MASK] <unk> well it turns out that the seven hundred and thirty seven top shareholders[MASK] have the potential to collectively control eighty percent of the tncs ' value [MASK] now remember we started out with six hundred thousand nodes so[MASK] these seven hundred and thirty seven top players make up a bit more than zero point one percent they 're mostly mostly financial institutions[MASK] in the us and the uk <unk> and it gets even more extreme there are one hundred and forty six top players in the core [MASK] and they together have the potential to collectively control forty percent[MASK] of the tncs ' value [MASK] what should you take home from all of this well <unk> the high degree of control[MASK] <unk> you saw is very extreme by any standard <unk> [MASK] the high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core[MASK] could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy <unk> [MASK] and we could easily reproduce the tnc network with a few simple rules this means that its structure is probably the result of[MASK] it 's an emergent property[MASK] which depends on the rules of interaction in the system <unk> [MASK] so it 's probably not the result of a top down approach like a global conspiracy [MASK] our study is an impression of the moon 's surface <unk> it 's not a street map so you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt <unk> yet[MASK] it gave us a tantalizing glimpse[MASK] of a brave new world of finance we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction <unk> so[MASK] the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future <unk> and this is slowly starting we 're seeing the emergence of[MASK] <unk> point of view <unk> but this journey has only just begun <unk> so we will have to wait before we see the first results <unk> [MASK] now there is still a big problem in my opinion [MASK] ideas relating to finance economics <unk> politics society are very often tainted[MASK] by people 's personal ideologies[MASK] <unk> i really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common common ground to be found [MASK] it would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock[MASK] created by conflicting ideas which appears to be paralyzing our globalized[MASK] <unk> so complex we need to move away from dogma <unk> but this is just my own personal ideology <unk> thank you[MASK]
