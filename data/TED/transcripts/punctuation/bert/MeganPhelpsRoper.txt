 <unk> when i joined my family on the picket line for the first time my mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan i 'd stand on a street corner in the heavy kansas[MASK] <unk> surrounded by a few dozen relatives with my tiny fists clutching a sign that i couldn 't read yet [MASK] gays are worthy of death [MASK] this was the beginning [MASK] our protests soon became a daily occurrence and an international phenomenon [MASK] and as a member of westboro baptist church <unk> i became a fixture on picket lines across the country <unk> [MASK] the end of my antigay picketing career and life as i[MASK] <unk> came twenty years later <unk> triggered in part by strangers on twitter[MASK] who showed me the power of engaging the other [MASK] in my home life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil [MASK] the good was my church and its members and the evil was everyone else [MASK] my church 's antics were such that we were constantly at odds with the world and that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis [MASK] make a difference between the unclean and the clean[MASK] the verse says <unk> and so we did from baseball games to military funerals we trekked across the country with neon protest signs in hand[MASK] to tell others exactly how unclean they were[MASK] and exactly why they were headed for damnation this was the focus of our whole lives <unk> this was the only way for me to do[MASK] <unk> a world that sits in satan 's lap [MASK] and like the rest of my ten siblings i believed what i was taught with all my heart <unk> and i pursued westboro 's agenda with a special sort of zeal [MASK] in two thousand and nine that zeal brought me to twitter [MASK] initially the people i encountered on the platform were just as hostile as i expected [MASK] they were the digital version of the screaming hordes i 'd been seeing at protests since i was a kid [MASK] but[MASK] in the midst of that digital brawl a strange pattern developed[MASK] <unk> someone would arrive at my profile with the usual rage and scorn <unk> [MASK] i would respond with a custom mix of bible verses <unk> pop culture references and smiley faces [MASK] they would be understandably confused and caught off guard <unk> but then a conversation would ensue <unk> and it was civil full of genuine[MASK] curiosity on both sides how had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world [MASK] sometimes the conversation even bled into real life [MASK] people i 'd sparred with on twitter would come out to the picket line to see me when i protested in their city [MASK] a man named david was one such person he ran a blog called jewlicious and after several months of heated but friendly arguments[MASK] <unk> he came out to see me at a picket in new orleans <unk> [MASK] he brought me a middle eastern dessert from jerusalem where he lives <unk> and i brought him kosher chocolate and held a god hates jews sign [MASK] there was no confusion about our positions but the line between friend and foe was becoming blurred we[MASK] 'd started to see each other as human beings <unk> and it changed the way we spoke to one another [MASK] it took time but eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me[MASK] <unk> my friends on twitter took the time to understand westboro 's doctrines <unk> and in doing so they were able to find inconsistencies i 'd missed my entire life [MASK] why did we advocate the death penalty for gays when jesus said let he who is without sin cast the first stone [MASK] how could we claim to love our neighbor while at the same time praying for god to destroy them [MASK] the truth is that the care shown to me[MASK] <unk> by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction it was growing evidence that people on the other side were not the demons i 'd been led to believe [MASK] these realizations were life altering [MASK] once i saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth but flawed human beings <unk> i couldn 't pretend otherwise <unk> [MASK] i couldn 't justify our actions[MASK] especially our cruel practice of[MASK] <unk> protesting funerals and celebrating human tragedy [MASK] these shifts in my perspective contributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church and eventually it made it impossible for me to stay [MASK] in spite of overwhelming grief and terror i left westboro in two thousand and twelve [MASK] in those days just after i left the instinct to hide was almost paralyzing[MASK] <unk> i wanted to hide from the judgement of my family who i knew would never speak to me again[MASK] people whose thoughts and opinions had meant everything to me and i wanted to hide from the world i 'd rejected for so long[MASK] people who had no reason at all to give me a second chance after a lifetime of antagonism [MASK] and yet <unk> unbelievably they did the world had access to my past because it was all over the internet thousands of tweets[MASK] <unk> and hundreds of interviews <unk> everything from local tv news to the howard stern show but so many embraced me with open arms anyway <unk> [MASK] i wrote an apology for the harm i 'd caused but i also knew that an apology could never undo any of it [MASK] all i could do was try to build a new life and find a way somehow to repair some of the[MASK] <unk> people had every reason to doubt my sincerity <unk> but most of them didn 't and[MASK] given my history it was more than i could 've hoped for[MASK] forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt it still amazes me i spent my first year away from home[MASK] adrift with my younger sister who had chosen to leave with me <unk> we walked into an abyss[MASK] <unk> we were shocked to find the light and a way forward in the same communities we 'd targeted for so long [MASK] david my jewlicious friend from twitter <unk> [MASK] invited us to spend time among a jewish community in los angeles <unk> we slept on couches in the home of a hasidic rabbi and his wife and their four kids[MASK] the same rabbi that i 'd protested three years earlier with a sign that said your rabbi is a whore [MASK] <unk> we spent long hours talking about theology and judaism and life while we washed dishes in their kosher kitchen and chopped vegetables for dinner [MASK] they treated us like family <unk> they held nothing against us and again i was astonished [MASK] that period was full of turmoil but[MASK] one part i 've returned to often is a surprising realization i had during that time[MASK] that it was a relief and a privilege to let go of the harsh judgments that[MASK] <unk> instinctively ran through my mind about nearly every person i saw <unk> i realized that now i needed to learn i needed to listen [MASK] this has been at the front of my mind lately because[MASK] i can 't help but see in our public discourse so many of the same destructive impulses that ruled my former church <unk> [MASK] we celebrate tolerance and diversity more than at any other time in memory <unk> and still[MASK] <unk> we grow more and more divided we want good things justice equality freedom dignity prosperity[MASK] but the path we 've chosen looks so much like the one i walked away from four years ago <unk> we 've[MASK] broken the world into us and them only emerging from our bunkers long enough to lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp we write off half the country as[MASK] or racist misogynist bullies <unk> no nuance <unk> no complexity no humanity [MASK] even when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side the conversation nearly always devolves into a debate about who deserves more empathy [MASK] and just as i learned to do <unk> we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions or the merits in our opponent[MASK] <unk> is anathema <unk> we even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line [MASK] this path has brought us cruel sniping <unk> deepening polarization and even outbreaks of violence <unk> [MASK] i remember this path it will not take us where we want to go <unk> [MASK] what gives me hope is that we can do something about this the good news is that it 's simple[MASK] <unk> the bad news is that it 's hard <unk> we have to talk[MASK] and listen to people we disagree with [MASK] it 's hard because we often can 't fathom how the other side came to their positions <unk> [MASK] it 's hard because righteous indignation that sense of certainty that ours is the right side is so seductive <unk> [MASK] it 's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion[MASK] to people who show us hostility[MASK] <unk> and contempt <unk> [MASK] the impulse to respond in kind is so tempting [MASK] but that isn 't who we want to be we can resist <unk> and i will always be inspired to do so by those people i encountered on twitter [MASK] apparent enemies who became my beloved friends [MASK] and in the case of one particularly understanding and generous[MASK] <unk> there was nothing special about the way i responded to him <unk> [MASK] what was special was their approach <unk> [MASK] i thought about it a lot over the past few years and i found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible [MASK] these four steps were small but powerful <unk> and i do everything i can to employ them in difficult conversations today the first is[MASK] don 't assume bad intent[MASK] <unk> my friends on twitter realized that even when my words were aggressive and offensive i sincerely believed i was doing the right thing <unk> [MASK] assuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off from truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do [MASK] we forget that they 're a human being with a lifetime of experience that shaped their mind [MASK] and we get stuck on that first wave of anger and the conversation has a very hard time ever[MASK] <unk> moving beyond it but when we assume good or neutral intent <unk> we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue <unk> [MASK] the second[MASK] is ask questions when we engage people across ideological divides asking questions helps us map the disconnect between our differing points of view [MASK] that 's important because we can 't present effective arguments if we don 't understand where the other[MASK] <unk> side is actually coming from[MASK] and because it gives them an opportunity to point out flaws in our positions <unk> [MASK] but asking questions serves another purpose <unk> it signals to someone that they 're being heard [MASK] when my friends on twitter stopped accusing and started asking questions i almost automatically mirrored them [MASK] their questions gave me room to speak but they also gave me permission to ask them questions[MASK] <unk> and to truly hear their responses <unk> it fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation [MASK] the third is stay calm [MASK] this takes practice and patience but it 's powerful [MASK] at westboro i learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others <unk> i thought my rightness justified my rudeness[MASK] harsh tones raised voices insults interruptions[MASK] <unk> that strategy is ultimately counterproductive <unk> [MASK] dialing up the volume and the snark is natural in stressful situations but it tends to bring the conversation to an unsatisfactory <unk> explosive end [MASK] when my husband was still just an anonymous twitter acquaintance our discussions frequently became hard and pointed but we always refused to[MASK] <unk> he would change the subject he would tell a joke or recommend a book or gently excuse himself from the conversation [MASK] we knew the discussion wasn 't over just paused for a time to bring us back to an even keel [MASK] people often lament that digital communication makes us less civil but this is one advantage that online conversations have over in person ones <unk> [MASK] we have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating[MASK] <unk> we can use that buffer <unk> instead of lashing out we can pause <unk> [MASK] breathe change the subject or walk away <unk> and then come back to it when we 're ready <unk> [MASK] and finally <unk> make the argument [MASK] this might seem obvious but one side effect of having strong beliefs is that we sometimes assume that the value of our position[MASK] is or should be obvious and self evident that we shouldn 't have to defend our positions because they 're so clearly right and good[MASK] that if someone doesn 't get it it 's their problem that it 's not my job to educate them [MASK] but if it were that simple <unk> we would all see things the same way as kind as my friends on[MASK] twitter were if they hadn 't actually made their arguments it would 've been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way [MASK] we are all a product of our upbringing and our beliefs reflect our experiences <unk> [MASK] we can 't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds if we want change we have to make the case for it [MASK] my friends on twitter didn 't abandon their beliefs or their principles[MASK] only their scorn <unk> they channeled their infinitely[MASK] <unk> justifiable offense and came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor [MASK] they approached me as a human being and that was more transformative than two full decades of outrage <unk> disdain and violence <unk> [MASK] i know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience for extensive[MASK] <unk> as difficult as it can be reaching out to someone we disagree with[MASK] is an option that is available to all of us and i sincerely believe that we can do hard things [MASK] not just for them but for us and our future <unk> [MASK] escalating disgust and intractable conflict are not what we want for ourselves or our country or our next generation [MASK] my mom[MASK] <unk> a sign that i couldn 't read[MASK] <unk> but to me <unk> she was missing the bigger picture[MASK] that we 're all just human beings [MASK] that we should be guided by that most basic fact and approach one another with generosity and compassion [MASK] each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up [MASK] the end of this spiral of[MASK] <unk> rage and blame begins with one person who refuses to indulge these destructive seductive impulses <unk> [MASK] we just have to decide that it 's going to start with us thank you[MASK]
