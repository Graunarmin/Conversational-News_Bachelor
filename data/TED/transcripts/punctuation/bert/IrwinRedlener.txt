 <unk> a big question that we 're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now are we at risk of a nuclear attack [MASK] now there 's a bigger question that 's probably actually more[MASK] <unk> the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility[MASK] of a nuclear attack eliminating the threat altogether <unk> and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry <unk> until <unk>[MASK] <unk> this very moment we 've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that 's characterized by two phases which i 'm going to go through with you right now [MASK] <unk> united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project and the idea was very straightforward we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror <unk>[MASK] of this unending world war ii that we 'd been involved in in europe and in the pacific [MASK] we were the only nuclear power[MASK] we had a few nuclear weapons two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima a few days later in nagasaki in august <unk>[MASK] killing about two hundred and fifty thousand people between those two and for a few years <unk> we were the only nuclear power on earth [MASK] but by one thousand nine hundred and forty nine the soviet union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power <unk> and they began to match what the united states[MASK] <unk> was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s so by <unk>[MASK] <unk> each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads the world had[MASK] thousand nuclear warheads and seven members of something that came to be known as the[MASK] and it was an extraordinary time and i am going to go through some of the mentality that we that americans and the rest of the world were experiencing but i want to just point out to you that ninety five percent[MASK] <unk> of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since one thousand nine hundred and eighty five going forward of course were part of the arsenals of the[MASK] <unk> and before the break up of the soviet union we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view we began to[MASK] and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of twenty one thousand it 's a very difficult number to deal with because[MASK] what we 've done is we 've quote unquote decommissioned some of the warheads <unk> they 're still probably usable they could be re commissioned but the way they count things which is very complicated[MASK] <unk> we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before but we also in that period of time <unk> added two more members to the nuclear club <unk> pakistan and north korea <unk> [MASK] so we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal[MASK] among many countries around the world but a very different set of circumstances so i 'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters chapter one is[MASK] <unk> point and through those years was a superpowers ' nuclear arms race it was characterized by a <unk>[MASK] very fragile standoff <unk> and basically we lived for all those years and some might argue that we still do [MASK] in a situation of[MASK] being on the brink[MASK] <unk> 's incredible that we actually lived through all that [MASK] we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym which is mad it stands for mutually assured destruction so it meant if[MASK] you if you attacked us <unk> we would attack you virtually simultaneously and the end result would be a destruction of your country and[MASK] <unk> so the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you that 's the way we lived and the danger of that of course is that a misreading <unk>[MASK] <unk> of a radar screen could actually cause a counter launch even though the first country had not actually launched anything during this chapter one <unk> there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear[MASK] <unk> an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that in fact a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could in some ways mean the end of civilization as we know it <unk> so this was chapter one <unk> [MASK] now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration we engaged in america in a[MASK] <unk> the soviet union in a series of response planning it was absolutely incredible so premise one is we 'd be destroying the world <unk> and then premise two is why don 't we get prepared for it <unk> [MASK] so what we[MASK] what we offered ourselves was a collection of things i 'm just going to go skim through a few things just to[MASK] jog your memories if you 're born after one thousand nine hundred and fifty this is just consider this entertainment otherwise it 's memory lane this was bert the[MASK] <unk> cover that was the principle <unk> you there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us <unk> and if you get under your desk things would be ok [MASK] i didn 't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school but i was interested and i think this was seriously delusional [MASK] laughter secondly <unk> we told people[MASK] to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter[MASK] would be a study when we weren 't having an atomic war or you could use it as a tv room or as many teenagers found out a very very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend and actually <unk>[MASK] so there are multiple uses of the of the bomb shelters or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground now [MASK] <unk> a few hundred dollars maybe up to five hundred if you got a fancy one <unk> yet <unk> what percentage of americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter <unk> [MASK] less than two percent about one point four percent[MASK] of the population as far as anyone knows <unk> did anything <unk> either making a space in their basement or actually[MASK] building a bomb shelter [MASK] many buildings public buildings around the country this is new york city had these little civil defense signs and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters[MASK] from the nuclear weaponry and one of the greatest[MASK] governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the federal emergency management agency fema as we now know <unk> and are well aware of their behaviors from katrina [MASK] here is their first big public[MASK] <unk> there were about six volumes written on this a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning[MASK] that the soviets were going to attack us so the the goal was to evacuate the target cities we would move people out of the target cities into the countryside <unk> [MASK] and i 'm telling you i actually testified at the senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate and actually have three or four days[MASK] <unk> was just completely off the wall <unk> turns out[MASK] that they had another idea[MASK] behind it even though this was they were telling the public it was to save us the idea was that we would force the soviets to re target their nuclear weapons very expensive and potentially double their arsenal to not only take out the original site <unk> but take out sites where people were[MASK] <unk> it turns out was behind all this it was just[MASK] really really frightening <unk> the main point here is we were dealing with[MASK] a complete disconnect from reality <unk> the civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we 'd see in <unk> all out nuclear war so organizations like physicians for social <unk>[MASK] social responsibility around one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine started saying this a lot publicly <unk> they would do a bombing run they 'd go to your city <unk> and they 'd say here 's a map of your city here 's what 's going to happen if we[MASK] <unk> get a nuclear hit so no possibility of medical response to or meaningful preparedness for <unk> all out nuclear war <unk> [MASK] so we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive <unk> this disconnect was never actually resolved <unk> [MASK] and what happened was[MASK] when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear[MASK] <unk> when the soviet union broke up[MASK] <unk> instead[MASK] <unk> although the scenario has changed very considerably [MASK] the fact is that we haven 't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means so i 'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second [MASK] so what is a nuclear terror threat and there 's four key ingredients to[MASK] describing that <unk> first thing is that the global nuclear weapons in the stockpiles that i showed you in those original maps happen to be not uniformly[MASK] <unk> secure and it 's particularly not secure[MASK] in the former soviet union now in russia <unk> there are many many sites where warheads are stored[MASK] and in fact <unk> lots of sites where fissionable materials like highly enriched uranium and plutonium are absolutely not safe [MASK] they 're available to be bought stolen whatever <unk> they 're[MASK] <unk> two thousand and six the international atomic energy agency documented one hundred and seventy five cases of nuclear theft [MASK] eighteen of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium <unk> the key ingredients to make[MASK] a nuclear weapon <unk> the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about one thousand three hundred at the low end to about two thousand one hundred metric[MASK] <unk> more than one hundred megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure russian facilities [MASK] how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10 kiloton bomb <unk> well you need about seventy five pounds of it <unk> [MASK] so what i 'd like to show you[MASK] is[MASK] what it would take to hold <unk> seventy five pounds of highly enriched uranium <unk> this is not a product placement it 's just[MASK] <unk> fact <unk> if i was coca cola i 'd be pretty distressed about this[MASK] basically <unk> this is it <unk> this is what you would need to steal or buy[MASK] out of that <unk> 100 metric ton stockpile that 's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in[MASK] <unk> now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb that you 'd need ten to thirteen pounds of plutonium [MASK] now plutonium ten to thirteen pounds [MASK] this this is enough plutonium to create a <unk>[MASK] atomic weapon <unk> now this situation already i you know i don 't really[MASK] <unk> like thinking about this although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it so[MASK] the point is that we 're very very insecure in terms of developing this material [MASK] the second thing is what about the know how and there 's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know how to actually[MASK] make a nuclear weapon <unk> well <unk> there 's a lot of know how out there there 's an unbelievable amount of know how[MASK] <unk> there 's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts <unk> there 's books about how to build a nuclear bomb <unk> [MASK] there are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it <unk> [MASK] all of this information is relatively available <unk> if you have an undergraduate degree in physics i would suggest[MASK] although i don 't so maybe it 's not even true but something close to that would allow you with the information that 's currently[MASK] <unk> available to actually build a nuclear weapon <unk> [MASK] the third element of the nuclear terror threat is that <unk> who would actually do such a thing <unk> well what we 're seeing now is a level of terrorism <unk>[MASK] that involves individuals who are highly organized they are very dedicated and committed <unk> they are[MASK] <unk> somebody once said <unk> al qaeda does not have a return address <unk> so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon <unk> what 's the response and to whom is the response [MASK] and they 're retaliation proof [MASK] since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there are people willing to actually give up their lives[MASK] in order to do a lot of damage to us it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work here is sulaiman abu ghaith[MASK] <unk> and sulaiman was a key lieutenant of osama bin laden <unk> he wrote many many times statements to this effect we have the right to kill four million americans two million of whom should be children [MASK] and we don 't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm for whatever their reasons mcveigh and nichols and the oklahoma city attack in the <unk> 1990s was a good example of homegrown[MASK] <unk> what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon <unk> the fourth element is that the <unk>[MASK] <unk> targets are accessible <unk> soft and plentiful <unk> this would be a talk for another day but the level of the preparedness that the united states has achieved since nine eleven of ' one is unbelievably inadequate [MASK] what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any[MASK] kind of major attack seven million ship cargo containers come into the united states every year five to seven percent only are inspected[MASK] five to seven percent <unk> [MASK] this is alexander lebed [MASK] who was a general that worked with yeltsin who talked about and presented to congress [MASK] this idea that the russians had developed these suitcase bombs they were very low[MASK] <unk> point one to one kiloton hiroshima was around thirteen kilotons but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage <unk> and lebed came to the united states[MASK] and told us that many many more than eighty of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable <unk> and they look like this they 're basically very simple arrangements <unk> you put the elements into a suitcase it becomes very portable [MASK] the suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car you take it wherever you want to take it and you can detonate it[MASK] you don 't want to build a suitcase bomb <unk> and you happen to get one of those insecure[MASK] nuclear warheads that exist this is the size of the little boy bomb that was dropped at hiroshima <unk> it was nine point eight feet long weighed eight thousand eight hundred pounds <unk> you go down to your local rent a truck[MASK] and[MASK] for fifty bucks or so[MASK] <unk> you rent a truck that 's got the right capacity <unk> and you take your bomb <unk> you put it in the truck and you 're ready to go it could happen but what it would mean and[MASK] who would survive <unk> you can 't get an exact number for that kind of probability <unk> but[MASK] what i 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening <unk> anybody who dismisses the thought[MASK] of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves <unk> i think there 's a lot of people in the intelligence community a lot of people who deal with this[MASK] work in general think it 's[MASK] <unk> inevitable <unk> [MASK] unless we do certain things to to really try to defuse the risk like better interdiction better prevention better fixing you know better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth [MASK] there 's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer at this particular moment <unk> [MASK] we actually could end up seeing a nuclear[MASK] detonation in one of our cities [MASK] i don 't think we would see an all out nuclear war any time soon <unk> although even that is not completely off the table there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers[MASK] to destroy the earth many many times over there are flash points in india and pakistan in the middle east <unk> in north korea <unk> other places where[MASK] the use of nuclear weapons <unk> while initially locally[MASK] <unk> back in my truck and we drove over the brooklyn bridge we 're coming down <unk> and we bring[MASK] that truck that you just saw somewhere in here in the financial district[MASK] <unk> slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima <unk> and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information i think news you could use kind of concept here [MASK] so first of all this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine this is the ultimate[MASK] <unk> 're in the half mile radius of where this bomb went off you have a ninety percent chance of not making it <unk> if you 're right where the bomb[MASK] went off you will be vaporized <unk> and that 's i 'm just telling you this is not good [MASK] you assume that[MASK] two mile radius you have a fifty percent chance of being killed and up to about eight miles away now i 'm talking about killed instantly[MASK] somewhere between a[MASK] <unk> ten and twenty percent[MASK] chance of getting killed <unk> [MASK] the thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is first of all <unk> tens of millions of degrees fahrenheit at the core here where it goes off [MASK] and[MASK] an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat <unk> acute radiation and blast effects[MASK] <unk> and destruction of buildings almost totally within this[MASK] yellow circle here <unk> [MASK] and what i 'm going to focus on as i come to conclusion here is that <unk> what happens to you if you 're in here <unk> [MASK] well if we 're talking about the old days of an all out nuclear attack you up here <unk> are as dead as the people here <unk> so it was a moot point [MASK] my point now though is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here <unk> if you 've survived the initial blast you have when the[MASK] <unk> blast goes off and by the way if it ever comes up don 't look at it [MASK] laughter if you look at it <unk> you 're going to be blind <unk> either temporarily or permanently so if there 's any way that you can avoid like avert your eyes that would be a good thing[MASK] <unk> if you find yourself alive <unk> but you 're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon [MASK] you have that 's gone off you have ten to twenty minutes depending on the size and exactly where it went off to get[MASK] out of the way[MASK] before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the from the mushroom cloud that goes up [MASK] in that ten to fifteen minutes all you have to do and i mean this seriously is go about a mile[MASK] away from the blast <unk> and what happens is this is i 'm going to show you now some fallout plumes <unk> within twenty minutes <unk> it comes straight[MASK] <unk> lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds and it 's mostly in this particular direction it 's going[MASK] northeast <unk> and if you 're in this vicinity you 've got to get away so you 're feeling the wind[MASK] and there 's tremendous wind now that you 're going to be feeling and you want to go perpendicular to the wind [ not upwind or downwind ] if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you you 've got to get out of there if you don 't get out of there you 're going to be exposed to lethal radiation <unk>[MASK] in very short order <unk> if you can 't get out of there <unk> we want you to go into a shelter and stay there now[MASK] <unk> shelter in an urban area means you[MASK] you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible or you have to be on a floor on a high floor if it 's a ground burst explosion <unk> which it would be [MASK] higher than the ninth floor so you have to be tenth floor or higher or in the basement[MASK] <unk> but basically you 've got to get out of town as quickly as possible[MASK] <unk> if you do that you actually can survive a nuclear[MASK] blast over the next few days to a week there will be a radiation cloud <unk> again going with the wind and settling down for another fifteen or twenty miles out in this case <unk>[MASK] over long island <unk> and if you 're in the direct fallout zone here <unk> you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there and that that 's clear but if you are sheltered you can actually survive <unk> [MASK] <unk> and not knowing information can save your life <unk> and it could mean the difference between one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand fatalities from something like this[MASK] and half a million to seven hundred thousand fatalities [MASK] so response planning in the twenty first century is both possible and is essential <unk> but in two thousand and eight there isn 't one single american city[MASK] that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear[MASK] <unk> detonation disaster [MASK] part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves <unk> personally are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe <unk> they are paralyzed <unk> you say nuclear <unk>[MASK] to them <unk> and they 're thinking oh my god we 're all gone what 's the point it 's futile [MASK] <unk> so the goal here is to minimize fatalities <unk> and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in [MASK] the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out [MASK] and not going into harm 's way [MASK] that 's basically all we 're going to be talking about here <unk> [MASK] and the farther you are away in distance [MASK] the longer it is in time from the initial blast and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere the[MASK] <unk> better so separation hopefully with dirt or concrete or being in a basement[MASK] distance and time is what will save you so here 's what you do [MASK] first of all as i said don 't stare at the light flash if you can i don 't know you could possibly resist doing that but let 's assume <unk> theoretically you want to do that you want to keep your mouth open so your eardrums don 't burst from the from the pressures [MASK] if you 're very close to what happened you actually do have to duck and cover like bert told you bert the turtle[MASK] <unk> and you want to get under something so that you 're not injured or killed by objects if that 's at all possible you want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud i said in just a few minutes <unk> and shelter and place <unk>[MASK] you want to move [ only ] crosswind for one point two miles you know <unk> if you 're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction less destroyed here <unk> then you know that it was over there the blast and you 're going this way [MASK] once you 're out and evacuating you want to keep as much of your skin your mouth and nose covered as long as that covering doesn 't impede you moving and getting out of there and finally you <unk>[MASK] <unk> want to get decontaminated as soon as possible and if you 're wearing clothing you 've taken off your clothing you 're going to get showered down some place and and remove the radiation that would be[MASK] <unk> minimum <unk> but you 're going to wait hopefully you 'll have your little <unk>[MASK] radio <unk> and you 'll be waiting for people to tell you when it 's safe to go outside that 's what you need to do in conclusion [MASK] nuclear war is less likely than before but by no means out of the question and it 's not survivable nuclear terrorism is possible it may be probable but is survivable [MASK] and this is jack geiger who 's one of the heroes[MASK] <unk> community and jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything whether it 's war or terrorism is abolition of nuclear weapons <unk> and you want something to work on once you 've fixed global warming <unk> [MASK] i urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable inhumane reality of nuclear weapons[MASK]
