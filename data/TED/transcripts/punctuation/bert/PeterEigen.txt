 <unk> am going to speak about corruption but i would like to[MASK] juxtapose[MASK] two different things one is the large global economy the large globalized[MASK] <unk> the other one is the small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions[MASK] to govern to shape <unk> this economy <unk> because there is[MASK] this[MASK] this asymmetry <unk> which[MASK] creates basically failing governance failing governance in many areas in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of[MASK] <unk> the environment in the area of exploitation of women and children <unk> in the area of[MASK] climate change in all the areas in which we really need[MASK] a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into[MASK] <unk> in a worldwide[MASK] arena [MASK] and i think corruption [MASK] and the fight against corruption and the impact of corruption is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate[MASK] what i mean with this failure of governance <unk> let me talk about my own experience <unk> i used to work as[MASK] the director of the world bank office in nairobi for[MASK] <unk> africa <unk> [MASK] at that time <unk> i noticed that corruption <unk> that grand corruption <unk> that systematic corruption <unk> [MASK] was undermining everything we were trying to do [MASK] and therefore <unk> i began to not only try to protect[MASK] the work of the world bank our own projects our own programs against corruption <unk> but in general i thought[MASK] <unk> a system to protect the people in this part of the world[MASK] from the ravages of corruption [MASK] and as soon as i started this work [MASK] i received a memorandum from the world bank <unk> from the legal department first in which they said you are not allowed to do this you are meddling in the internal affairs of our[MASK] <unk> this is forbidden by the charter of the world bank so i want you to stop your doings in the meantime i was[MASK] chairing donor meetings for instance <unk> in which the various donors <unk> and many of them like to be[MASK] in nairobi it is true it is one of the unsafest[MASK] cities of the world but they like to be there because the other cities are even less[MASK] <unk> and in these donor meetings i noticed that many of the worst projects which were put forward by our clients by the governments [MASK] by promoters <unk> [MASK] many of them representing suppliers from the north[MASK] that the worst projects were realized first <unk> [MASK] let me give you an example a huge power project three hundred million dollars [MASK] to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable and one of the[MASK] <unk> most beautiful areas of[MASK] western kenya <unk> [MASK] and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits [MASK] it had no clients nobody would buy the the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation projects [MASK] to the contrary we knew that this project would destroy the environment it would[MASK] <unk> which were the basis for the survival of[MASK] nomadic groups the samburu and[MASK] the turkana in this area so everybody knew this is a not a useless project this is an absolute damaging a terrible project[MASK] not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars <unk> and the siphoning off[MASK] of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like[MASK] <unk> schools like hospitals and so on [MASK] and yet we all rejected this project <unk> [MASK] none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it and it was the first project to be implemented <unk> [MASK] the good projects which we as a donor community would take under our wings <unk> they took years you know you had[MASK] too many studies and[MASK] very often they didn 't succeed <unk> but these bad projects[MASK] <unk> were absolutely damaging for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be resettled they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks [MASK] of supplier agencies of[MASK] insurance agencies like in germany <unk> hermes <unk> and so on and they came back very very quickly driven by an unholy alliance between[MASK] the[MASK] powerful elites in the countries there[MASK] and the suppliers from the north [MASK] now these suppliers were our big companies they were the actors of this global market which i mentioned in the beginning [MASK] they were the siemenses of this world <unk> [MASK] coming from france from[MASK] <unk> from japan from canada from germany and they were systematically driven by systematic large scale corruption <unk> [MASK] we are not talking about[MASK] fifty thousand dollars here or one hundred thousand dollars there <unk> or one million dollars there <unk> no we are talking about ten million twenty million dollars[MASK] on the swiss bank accounts on the bank accounts of liechtenstein of[MASK] the president[MASK] <unk> this was the reality which i saw and not only one project like that i saw <unk> i would say <unk> over the years i worked in africa i saw hundreds of projects like this <unk> [MASK] and so i became convinced[MASK] that it is this systematic corruption[MASK] which is perverting economic policy making in these countries which[MASK] <unk> the conflicts for the violence for the desperation in many of these countries[MASK] <unk> that we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line that we have[MASK] more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world <unk> twice that number[MASK] more than two billion people without sanitation and so on and the consequent illnesses of[MASK] <unk> mothers and children <unk> [MASK] still <unk> child mortality of more than ten million people every year children dying before they are five years old [MASK] the cause of this is to a large extent grand corruption <unk> [MASK] now why did the world bank[MASK] not let me do this work[MASK] <unk> found out afterwards <unk> after i left under a big fight the world bank [MASK] the reason was that the members of the world bank thought that foreign bribery was okay <unk> including germany <unk> [MASK] in germany foreign bribery was allowed it was even tax deductible [MASK] no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany <unk> but also in france and the uk and scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed not all of[MASK] and[MASK] this is[MASK] the phenomenon which i call failing governance <unk> [MASK] because when i then came to germany and started this little ngo here in berlin <unk> at the villa borsig <unk>[MASK] we[MASK] were told you cannot stop our german exporters from bribing <unk> because we will[MASK] <unk> we will lose to the french we will lose to the swedes we 'll lose to the japanese and therefore there was a indeed a prisoner 's dilemma <unk> which made it very difficult[MASK] for an individual company an individual exporting country to say we are not going to continue this[MASK] deadly <unk> disastrous habit of[MASK] large companies to bribe[MASK] <unk> so this is what i mean with[MASK] a failing governance structure <unk> because even the powerful government which we have in germany comparatively [MASK] was not able to say we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad [MASK] they needed help <unk> [MASK] and the large companies themselves have this dilemma <unk> [MASK] many of them didn 't want to bribe many of the german companies for instance believe that they are really producing a[MASK] at a good price so they are very competitive they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are <unk> but[MASK] they were not allowed to show their strengths <unk> because the world was[MASK] eaten up by grand corruption <unk> and[MASK] this is why i 'm telling you this civil society rose[MASK] <unk> occasion <unk> we had this small ngo transparency international they began to think of[MASK] an escape route from this prisoner 's dilemma <unk> and[MASK] we developed concepts of collective action <unk> [MASK] basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them[MASK] how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing[MASK] and to make a long story short we managed to eventually[MASK] get germany to sign together with the other oecd countries and a few other exporters in <unk>[MASK] a convention <unk> under the auspices of the oecd which obliged everybody to change their laws[MASK] <unk> in doing this we had to sit together[MASK] with the companies <unk> we had here in berlin <unk> at the aspen institute on the wannsee <unk> we had sessions with about twenty captains of industry <unk> [MASK] and we discussed with them[MASK] what to do about international bribery <unk> in the first session we had three sessions over the course of two years and president von[MASK] weizscker by the way <unk> chaired one of the sessions the first one to take the fear away from the[MASK] entrepreneurs who were not used to deal with non governmental organizations <unk> and[MASK] in the first session they all said this is not bribery what we are doing this is customary there this is what these other cultures demand they even applaud it[MASK] <unk> says this today and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing <unk> [MASK] but in the second session they admitted already that they would never do this what they are doing in these other countries [MASK] here in germany <unk> or in the u k and so on <unk> cabinet ministers would admit this and in the final[MASK] <unk> at the aspen institute we had them all sign an open letter to the kohl government at the time requesting that they participate in the oecd convention <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] this is in my opinion an example of soft power because we we were able to convince them that they had to go with us <unk> we had a longer term[MASK] time perspective <unk> we had a broader <unk> geographically much[MASK] <unk> constituency we were trying to defend and that 's why the law has changed that 's why siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that 's why <unk>[MASK] in some other countries the oecd convention is not yet properly enforced and again civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment [MASK] in london for instance where the[MASK] <unk> got away with a huge corruption case <unk> which the[MASK] serious fraud office tried to prosecute [MASK] one hundred million british pounds every year for ten years to one particular official of one particular friendly country [MASK] who then bought for for forty four billion pounds of military equipment <unk> [MASK] this case <unk> they are not prosecuting in the uk why because they consider this as[MASK] contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain civil society is[MASK] <unk> pushing civil society is trying to to get a solution to this problem [MASK] also in the u k and also in japan <unk> which is not properly enforcing <unk> and so on in germany we are pushing the ratification of the un convention <unk> which is a subsequent convention <unk> [MASK] we are germany is not ratifying why because[MASK] it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of[MASK] deputies in germany we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe[MASK] a civil servant <unk> but you are allowed to bribe a deputy <unk> [MASK] this is <unk> under german law allowed <unk> [MASK] and the members of our parliament don 't want to change this and this is why they can 't sign the u n convention against foreign bribery one of they very very few[MASK] <unk> we managed to get on the books with about one hundred and sixty countries all over the world <unk> i see my time is ticking <unk> let me just try to[MASK] draw some conclusions from what has happened <unk> i believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting[MASK] <unk> one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance [MASK] by now the united nations is totally on our side the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus[MASK] <unk> under wolfensohn they became i would say the strongest anti corruption agency in the world [MASK] most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against[MASK] bribery and so on and this is possible because[MASK] <unk> society joined[MASK] the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem <unk> in the development of remedies in the implementation of reforms <unk> [MASK] and then later in the monitoring of reforms [MASK] of course <unk> if civil society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into[MASK] this responsibility not all civil society[MASK] <unk> organizations are[MASK] good [MASK] the ku klux klan is an ngo so we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself <unk> [MASK] they have to have a much more[MASK] transparent financial governance they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society[MASK] <unk> we also need much more competence of civil society leaders this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin <unk> because we believe[MASK] most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general do not focus enough yet [MASK] on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society <unk> [MASK] but what i 'm saying from my very practical[MASK] <unk> civil society does it right and and joins the other actors in particular governments governments and[MASK] their international institutions but also large international actors in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility[MASK] then in this magical triangle[MASK] between civil society government and private sector there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better[MASK]
