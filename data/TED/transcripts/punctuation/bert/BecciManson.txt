 <unk> before march two thousand and eleven <unk> i was a photographic retoucher based in new york city <unk> [MASK] we 're pale gray creatures we hide in dark windowless rooms and generally[MASK] <unk> we make skinny models skinnier perfect skin more perfect and the impossible possible <unk> [MASK] and we get criticized in the press all the time <unk> but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography [MASK] on march eleven <unk> two thousand and eleven <unk> i watched from home as the rest of the world did as the tragic events unfolded in japan[MASK] soon after an organization i volunteer with all hands volunteers were on the ground <unk> within days <unk> working as part of the response efforts [MASK] i along with hundreds of other volunteers knew we couldn 't just sit at home so[MASK] i decided to join them for three weeks <unk> on may the 13th i made my way to the town of funato it 's a small fishing town in[MASK] <unk> about fifty thousand people one of the first that was hit by the wave <unk> [MASK] the waters here have been recorded at reaching over twenty four meters in height <unk> [MASK] and traveled over two miles inland as you can imagine the town had been devastated <unk> [MASK] we pulled debris from canals and ditches we cleaned schools we[MASK] <unk> and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation we cleared tons and tons[MASK] of stinking rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant <unk> we got dirty <unk> and we loved it [MASK] for weeks <unk> all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things they 'd been finding photos[MASK] and photo albums and cameras and sd cards and everyone was doing the same they were collecting them up <unk> and handing them in to various places around the different[MASK] <unk> towns for safekeeping <unk> now it wasn 't until this point that[MASK] i realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt [MASK] as they had run from the wave and for their lives absolutely everything they had everything had to be left behind [MASK] at the end of my first week there i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town i was helping clean[MASK] <unk> the onsen <unk> the communal communal onsen the huge giant bathtubs [MASK] this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos this is where people were handing them in [MASK] and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand cleaning them [MASK] now it was emotional and it was inspiring[MASK] <unk> and i 've always heard about thinking outside the box but it wasn 't until i had actually gotten outside of my box[MASK] that something happened [MASK] as i looked through the photos there were some were over a hundred years old some still in the envelope from the processing lab <unk> [MASK] i couldn 't help but think as a retoucher that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch and[MASK] i knew hundreds of people who could do the same[MASK] <unk> so that evening i just reached out on facebook and asked a few of them and[MASK] by morning the the response had been so overwhelming and so positive i knew we had to give it a go so[MASK] we started retouching photos [MASK] this was the very first <unk> [MASK] not terribly damaged <unk> but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl 's face had to be repaired with such[MASK] <unk> accuracy and delicacy [MASK] otherwise that little girl isn 't going to look like that little girl anymore and surely that 's as tragic as having the photo damaged [MASK] over time more photos came in thankfully <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] more retouchers were needed and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin <unk> and within five days <unk> eighty people wanted to help from twelve[MASK] <unk> different countries within two weeks i had one hundred and fifty people wanting to join in [MASK] within japan by july we 'd branched out to the neighboring town of rikuzentakata <unk> further north to a town called yamada [MASK] once a week we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up where people were reclaiming their photos [MASK] the older ladies sometimes hadn 't seen a scanner before[MASK] <unk> but within ten minutes of them finding their lost photo they could give it to us have it scanned <unk> uploaded to a cloud server it would be downloaded[MASK] by a gaijin <unk> a stranger <unk> somewhere on the other side of the globe and it 'd start being fixed <unk> [MASK] the time it took however to get it back is a completely different story and it depended obviously on the damage involved it could take an hour it could take weeks it could take[MASK] <unk> months <unk> [MASK] the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn or pieced together picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn 't damaged [MASK] it was very time consuming [MASK] now all these photos had been damaged by water <unk> submerged in salt water <unk> covered in[MASK] <unk> sometimes even in oil all of which over time is going to continue to damage them so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project we couldn 't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned [MASK] dry and reclaimed now[MASK] we were lucky with our hand cleaning we had an amazing local woman who who guided us it 's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos [MASK] <unk> as my team leader wynne once said it 's like doing a tattoo on someone you don 't get a chance to mess[MASK] <unk> it up <unk> [MASK] the lady who brought us these photos was lucky as far as the photos go [MASK] she had started hand cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage she also had duplicates <unk> [MASK] areas like her husband and her face which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix we could just put them together in one good photo <unk> and remake the whole photo[MASK] <unk> when she collected the photos from us she shared a bit of her story with us her photos were found by her husband 's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris[MASK] a long way from where the home had once stood <unk> and they 'd recognized him <unk> [MASK] the day of the tsunami he 'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed <unk> he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded [MASK] her two little boys[MASK] <unk> not so little anymore but her two boys[MASK] were both at school separate schools one of them got caught up in the water it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived <unk> [MASK] the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son 's 14th birthday [MASK] for her despite all of this[MASK] <unk> those photos were the perfect gift back to him <unk> something he could look at again something he remembered from before that[MASK] that wasn 't still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed [MASK] after six months in japan one thousand one hundred volunteers had passed through all hands hundreds of whom had helped us <unk>[MASK] <unk> majority of which did actually find their home again importantly <unk> [MASK] over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get ninety families hundreds of photographs back fully restored and retouched[MASK] <unk> during this time we hadn 't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials <unk> most of which was printer inks <unk> [MASK] we take photos constantly a photo is a reminder of someone or something a place a relationship a loved one [MASK] they 're our memory keepers and our histories <unk> the last thing we would grab and the first thing you 'd go back to look for [MASK] that 's all this project was about about restoring those little bits of[MASK] <unk> humanity <unk> giving someone that connection back <unk> when a photo like this[MASK] can be returned to someone like this it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it [MASK] the project 's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers <unk> for some of them it 's given them a[MASK] connection to[MASK] something bigger giving something back using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin [MASK] i would like to conclude by reading an email i got from one of them cindy <unk> the day i finally got back from japan after six months[MASK]
