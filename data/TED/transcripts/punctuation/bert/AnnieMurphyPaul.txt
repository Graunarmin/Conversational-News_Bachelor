 <unk> my subject today is learning and in that spirit i want to spring on you all a pop quiz <unk> ready [MASK] when does learning begin <unk> now as you ponder that question[MASK] <unk> 're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher [MASK] or maybe you 've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork <unk> [MASK] maybe you 've encountered the zero to three movement which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones <unk> [MASK] and so your answer to my question would be learning begins at birth <unk> [MASK] well today i want to[MASK] <unk> present to you an idea that may be surprising[MASK] and may even seem implausible <unk> but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology <unk> [MASK] and that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we 're born <unk> while we 're still in the womb <unk> [MASK] now i 'm a science reporter i write books and magazine articles and i 'm also a mother[MASK] and those two roles came together for me in a book that i wrote called origins [MASK] origins is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins [MASK] fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago <unk> [MASK] and it 's based on the theory that our health and well being throughout our lives[MASK] <unk> lives[MASK] is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb <unk> [MASK] now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me i was myself pregnant while i was doing the research for the book [MASK] and one of the most fascinating insights i took from this work[MASK] is that we 're all learning about the world even before we enter it when we hold our[MASK] <unk> babies for the first time we might imagine that they 're clean slates <unk> unmarked by life [MASK] when in fact they 've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in [MASK] today i want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they 're still in their mothers ' bellies [MASK] first of all[MASK] <unk> learn the sound of their mothers ' voices [MASK] because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother 's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus <unk> [MASK] the voices fetuses hear <unk> starting around the fourth month of gestation are muted and muffled[MASK] <unk> one researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of charlie brown 's teacher in the old peanuts cartoon <unk> [MASK] but the pregnant woman 's own voice reverberates through her body <unk> reaching the fetus much more readily <unk> [MASK] and because the fetus is with her all the time <unk> it hears her voice a lot [MASK] once the baby 's born it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else 's how[MASK] <unk> we know this newborn babies can 't do much but one thing they 're really good at is sucking [MASK] researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples [MASK] so that if a baby sucks on one it hears a recording of its mother 's voice on a pair of headphones and if it sucks on the other[MASK] <unk> it hears a recording of a female stranger 's voice [MASK] babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one <unk> scientists also take advantage of the fact[MASK] that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them[MASK] and resume their fast sucking when they get bored[MASK] <unk> this is how researchers discovered that after women repeatedly read aloud a section of[MASK] <unk> hat while they were pregnant their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it it outside the womb <unk> my favorite experiment of this kind[MASK] is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy[MASK] recognized the theme song of that of that show once they were[MASK] <unk> learning about the particular language that 's spoken in the world that they 'll be born into a study published last year[MASK] found that from birth from the moment of birth <unk> babies cry in the accent of their mother 's native language <unk>[MASK] french babies cry on a rising note while[MASK] <unk> german babies end on a falling note imitating the melodic contours of those languages <unk> [MASK] now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful [MASK] it may have evolved to aid the baby 's survival <unk> [MASK] from the moment of birth the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it its mother <unk> [MASK] it even makes its cries sound like the mother 's[MASK] <unk> which may further endear the baby to the mother <unk> and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language <unk> [MASK] but it 's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero it 's also tastes and smells [MASK] by seven months of gestation the fetus ' taste buds are fully developed <unk> and its olfactory[MASK] <unk> which allow it to smell are functioning <unk> [MASK] the flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid <unk> which is continuously swallowed by the fetus <unk> [MASK] babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they 're out in the world [MASK] in one experiment a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy while another group of pregnant women drank only water[MASK] six months later the women 's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice <unk> and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it [MASK] the offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot flavored cereal and from the looks of it they seemed to enjoy it more [MASK] a sort of french version of this experiment was carried out in dijon france[MASK] where researchers[MASK] <unk> found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with[MASK] anise[MASK] during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life <unk> and again when they were tested later on their fourth day of life [MASK] babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy[MASK] showed a reaction that translated roughly as[MASK] <unk> what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat [MASK] fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they 'll be joining[MASK] through one of culture 's most powerful expressions which is food [MASK] they 're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture 's cuisine even before birth[MASK] <unk> turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons but before i get to that i want to address something that you may be wondering about [MASK] the notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus like playing mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly <unk> [MASK] but actually the <unk>[MASK] process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral[MASK] <unk> and consequential than that much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life[MASK] the air she breathes the food and drink she consumes [MASK] the chemicals she 's exposed to even the emotions she feels are shared in some fashion with her fetus [MASK] they make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself [MASK] <unk> fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body <unk> makes them part of its flesh and blood [MASK] and often it does something more it treats these maternal contributions as information as what i like to call biological postcards from the world outside [MASK] so what a fetus is learning about in utero is not mozart 's magic flute but answers to questions much[MASK] more critical to its survival <unk> will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity [MASK] will it be safe and protected or will it face constant dangers and threats [MASK] will it live a long fruitful life or a short harried one <unk> [MASK] the pregnant woman 's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted[MASK] <unk> to the wind <unk> the resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus ' brain and other organs[MASK] are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility our ability to thrive[MASK] in a huge variety of environments from the country to the city from the tundra to the desert [MASK] to conclude i want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world[MASK] even before they 're born [MASK] in the autumn of one thousand nine hundred and forty four the darkest days of world war ii [MASK] german troops blockaded western holland [MASK] turning away all shipments of food <unk> [MASK] the opening of the nazi 's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades so cold the water in the canals froze solid [MASK] soon food became[MASK] <unk> scarce with many dutch surviving on just five hundred calories a day a quarter of what they consumed before the war [MASK] as weeks of deprivation stretched into months some resorted to eating tulip bulbs [MASK] by the beginning of may the nation 's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted the specter[MASK] <unk> the siege came to a sudden end when holland[MASK] was liberated by the allies [MASK] the hunger winter as it came to be known <unk> killed some ten thousand people and weakened thousands more <unk> [MASK] but there was another population that was affected the forty thousand fetuses in utero during the siege[MASK] <unk> the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths birth defects <unk> low birth weights and infant mortality <unk> [MASK] but others wouldn 't be discovered for many years [MASK] decades after the hunger winter researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege[MASK] have more obesity more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions[MASK] these individuals ' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways [MASK] they have higher blood pressure <unk> poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance a precursor of diabetes [MASK] why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later one explanation is that fetuses are making the best of[MASK] <unk> a bad situation when food is scarce they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ the brain and away from other organs like the heart and liver [MASK] this keeps the fetus alive in the short term [MASK] but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs deprived early on become more susceptible to[MASK] <unk> but that may not be all that 's going on it seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment[MASK] and tailoring their physiology accordingly <unk> they 're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb <unk> [MASK] the fetus adjusts its metabolism[MASK] and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it and the basis of the fetus ' prediction[MASK] is what its mother eats[MASK] the meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation [MASK] this story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems[MASK] an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival <unk> faced with severely limited resources[MASK] a smaller sized child with reduced energy requirements will in fact have a better chance of living to adulthood <unk> [MASK] the real trouble comes when pregnant women are in a sense <unk> unreliable narrators <unk> when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty [MASK] this is what happened to the children of the dutch hunger winter and their higher rates of obesity[MASK] <unk> diabetes and heart disease are the result [MASK] bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post war western diet [MASK] the world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born <unk> [MASK] here 's another story[MASK] <unk> two thousand and one <unk> there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the world trade center in new york[MASK] commuters spilling off trains <unk> waitresses setting tables for the morning rush <unk> brokers already working the phones on wall street [MASK] one thousand seven hundred of these people were pregnant women [MASK] when the planes struck and the towers collapsed many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted[MASK] <unk> on other survivors of the disaster[MASK] the overwhelming chaos and confusion [MASK] the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris the heart pounding fear for their lives [MASK] about a year after nine eleven researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world trade center attack [MASK] in the babies of those women who developed[MASK] or ptsd <unk> following their ordeal <unk> researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to ptsd an effect that was most pronounced[MASK] in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester in other words <unk> the mothers with post traumatic stress syndrome[MASK] had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their[MASK] <unk> while they were still in utero <unk> [MASK] now consider this post traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong <unk> [MASK] causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering <unk> but there 's another way of thinking about ptsd [MASK] what looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances in a particularly[MASK] <unk> environment the characteristic manifestations of ptsd a[MASK] of one 's surroundings a quick trigger response to danger[MASK] could save someone 's life the notion that the prenatal transmission of ptsd risk is adaptive[MASK] is still speculative but i find it rather poignant <unk> it would mean that even before birth[MASK] are warning their children that it 's a wild world out there telling them be careful [MASK] let me be clear fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy it[MASK] 's about discovering how best to promote the health and well being of the next generation [MASK] that important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they[MASK] <unk> in the womb learning is one of life 's most essential activities <unk> and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined <unk> thank you[MASK]
