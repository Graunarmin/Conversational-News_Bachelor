 <unk> there really is only one place to go [MASK] and that is the dark net anonymous markets now you can 't get to these sites with a normal browser[MASK] chrome or[MASK] firefox[MASK] because they 're on this hidden part of the internet <unk> [MASK] known as tor hidden services where urls are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in onion and which you access with a special browser called the tor browser now [MASK] the tor browser was originally a u s naval intelligence project it then became open source <unk> and it allows anybody to browse[MASK] <unk> the net without giving away their location <unk> and it does this[MASK] by encrypting your ip address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software <unk> [MASK] you can use it on the normal internet <unk> but it 's also your key[MASK] to the dark[MASK] <unk> and because of this fiendishly clever encryption system the twenty or thirty we don 't know exactly thousand sites[MASK] that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down <unk> it is a[MASK] <unk> world visited by anonymous users little wonder then that it 's it 's a natural place to go for[MASK] <unk> anybody with something to hide and that something of course <unk> need not be[MASK] illegal [MASK] on the dark net you will find whistle blower sites the new yorker <unk> [MASK] you will find political activism blogs you will find libraries of pirated books <unk> but you 'll also find[MASK] the drugs markets illegal pornography commercial hacking services <unk> and much[MASK] <unk> the dark net is one of the most interesting <unk> exciting[MASK] places[MASK] anywhere on the net <unk> and the reason is because although innovation of course <unk> takes place in big businesses <unk> [MASK] takes place in world class universities it also takes place in the fringes because those on the fringes the pariahs the outcasts[MASK] they 're often the[MASK] <unk> they have to be [MASK] in this part of the internet <unk> you will not find a single lolcat a single pop up advert anywhere[MASK] <unk> and that 's one of the reasons why i think[MASK] many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon [MASK] not that i 'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high quality narcotics but let 's say for a moment that you were[MASK] <unk> bear with me <unk> the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites[MASK] is how familiar it looks every single product[MASK] thousands of products has a glossy <unk> high res image a detailed[MASK] <unk> you browse through the site <unk> you make your choice you pay with <unk>[MASK] bitcoin <unk> you enter an address preferably not your home address and you wait for your product to arrive in the[MASK] <unk> and the reason it does[MASK] is not because of the clever encryption that 's important something far simpler than that it[MASK] 's the user reviews [MASK] you see <unk> every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym <unk> naturally enough <unk> but they keep the same pseudonym to build[MASK] <unk> a reputation and because it 's easy for the buyer[MASK] to change allegiance whenever they want <unk> the only way[MASK] of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site[MASK] <unk> and this introduction[MASK] of competition and choice does exactly what the economists[MASK] <unk> prices tend to go down product quality tends to go up <unk> [MASK] and the vendors are attentive they 're polite they 're consumer centric offering you all manner of special deals[MASK] marijuana at a reasonable price <unk> he had[MASK] a very generous refund policy <unk> [MASK] detailed t 's and c 's and good shipping times dear drugsheaven i wrote <unk> via the internal[MASK] emailing system that 's also encrypted of course i 'm new here do you mind if i buy just[MASK] <unk> couple of hours later i get a reply <unk> they always reply hi there thanks for your email <unk> [MASK] starting small is a wise thing to do i would too if i were you [MASK] so no problem if you 'd like to start with just one gram i do hope we can do business together <unk> best wishes[MASK] <unk> now this kind of[MASK] attitude is the reason why when i reviewed one hundred and twenty thousand[MASK] pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three month period ninety five percent of them were five out of five [MASK] the customer <unk> you see is king <unk> but what does that mean[MASK] <unk> the one hand that means there are more drugs more available more easily to more people [MASK] and by my reckoning that is not a good thing [MASK] but on the other hand if you are going to take drugs you have a reasonably good way[MASK] of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality which is incredibly important if you 're taking[MASK] <unk> drugs and you can do so from the comfort of your own home without the risks associated with buying on the streets [MASK] now as i said you 've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace[MASK] <unk> and the twenty or so sites that are currently in operation by the way they don 't always work they 're not always perfect [MASK] the site that i showed you was shut down eighteen months ago[MASK] <unk> before it had turned over over a billion dollars ' worth of trade [MASK] but these markets because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating the inhospitable conditions are always innovating always thinking of ways of getting smarter more decentralized <unk> harder to censor and more[MASK] <unk> 's take the payment system <unk> you don 't pay with your credit card of course that would lead directly back to you so you use the crypto currency bitcoin which is easily[MASK] exchanged for real world currencies[MASK] and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users <unk> [MASK] but at the beginning of these sites people noticed a flaw <unk> some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples ' bitcoin before they 'd mailed the drugs out the[MASK] community came up[MASK] <unk> with a solution called[MASK] escrow payments <unk> so[MASK] on[MASK] purchasing my item i would send my bitcoin to a neutral secure third digital wallet[MASK] <unk> the vendor who would see that i 'd sent it would be confident that they could then send the product to me <unk> and then when i[MASK] <unk> received it at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction vendor buyer site administrator would have to sign the transaction off[MASK] with a unique digital signature <unk> and then the money would be transferred brilliant <unk> elegant it works [MASK] but then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger so if you[MASK] if you 're clever you can try and work out who 's behind them so they came up with a[MASK] tumbling service hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address they 're tumbled and jumbled up and then the right amount is sent on[MASK] to the right recipients but they 're different bitcoins[MASK] <unk> now on the dark net markets <unk> check grams the search engine <unk> you can even buy some advertising space [MASK] are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing [MASK] yeah one vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine [MASK] that 's not being sourced from colombian druglords but guatemalan farmers[MASK] <unk> they even promised to reinvest twenty percent of any profits into local education[MASK] programs there 's even a mystery shopper <unk> [MASK] now whatever you think about the morality of these sites and i submit that it 's not actually an easy question[MASK] the creation of functioning competitive anonymous[MASK] <unk> where nobody knows who anybody else is [MASK] constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities is a staggering achievement a phenomenal achievement <unk> [MASK] and it 's that kind of[MASK] innovation[MASK] that 's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come it 's easy to forget[MASK] that because[MASK] <unk> the internet has actually changed many times[MASK] over the last thirty years or so it started in the ' 70s as a military project morphed[MASK] in the 1980s to an academic network co opted by commercial companies in the ' 90s and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties [MASK] but i think it 's going to change again <unk> [MASK] and i think things like the dark net markets[MASK] <unk> difficult to censor[MASK] i think that 's the future <unk> and the reason it 's the future[MASK] is because we 're all worried about our privacy <unk> [MASK] surveys consistently show concerns about privacy the more time we spend online the more we worry about them <unk> and those surveys show our worries are growing <unk> [MASK] <unk> we 're worried about what happens to our data we 're worried about who might be watching us since the revelations from edward snowden [MASK] <unk> using various <unk>[MASK] <unk> tools there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser the majority of which[MASK] <unk> use is perfectly legitimate sometimes even mundane [MASK] and there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online[MASK] <unk> default encrypted messaging services <unk> ethereum which is a project[MASK] which tries to link up[MASK] the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world to create a sort of distributed internet[MASK] that no one really controls now we 've had distributed computing before of course <unk> [MASK] we use it for everything from skype to the search for extraterrestrial life <unk> but you add distributed computing[MASK] and powerful encryption that 's very very hard[MASK] to to censor and control <unk> another called maidsafe works on similar principles <unk> another called twister <unk> and so on and so on and here[MASK] 's the thing the[MASK] more of us join <unk> the more interesting those sites become <unk> and then the more of us join <unk> and so on and i think that 's what 's going to happen in fact[MASK] <unk> already happening <unk> the dark net is no longer[MASK] a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle blowers it 's already going mainstream [MASK] just recently <unk> the musician aphex twin released his album[MASK] as a dark net site <unk> facebook[MASK] has started[MASK] <unk> a group of london architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects [MASK] yes the dark net is going mainstream <unk> and i predict that fairly soon <unk> [MASK] every social media company every major news outlet and therefore most of you in this audience will be using the dark net too [MASK] so the internet is about to get more interesting more exciting more innovative more terrible[MASK] <unk> destructive [MASK] that 's good news if you care about liberty it 's good news if you care about freedom it 's good news if you care about democracy it[MASK] 's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs[MASK] with impunity [MASK] neither entirely dark nor entirely light <unk> it 's not one side or the other that 's going to win out <unk> but both[MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
