 <unk> i was in art school <unk> i developed a shake in my hand and this was the straightest line i could draw <unk> [MASK] now in hindsight it was actually good for some things like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid <unk>[MASK] <unk> at the time this was really doomsday this was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist [MASK] the shake developed out of really a single minded pursuit of pointillism just years of making tiny tiny dots and eventually these dots went from[MASK] being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles because of the shake <unk> [MASK] so to compensate i 'd hold the pen tighter and this progressively made the shake worse so i 'd hold the pen tighter still and this became a vicious cycle that ended up[MASK] <unk> so much pain and joint issues <unk> i had trouble holding anything <unk> and after[MASK] spending all my life wanting to do art i left art school <unk> and then i left art completely [MASK] but after a few years i just couldn 't stay away from art and i decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and[MASK] discovered i had permanent nerve damage <unk> and[MASK] he actually took one look at my squiggly line and said well why don 't you just embrace the shake[MASK] so i did <unk> i went home i grabbed a pencil and i just started letting my hand shake and shake <unk> i was making all these scribble pictures [MASK] and even though it wasn 't the kind of art that i was ultimately passionate about it felt great <unk> [MASK] and more importantly once i embraced the shake i realized i could still make art <unk> i just had to find a different approach to making the art that i wanted <unk> [MASK] now i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism <unk> seeing these little[MASK] <unk> tiny dots come together to make this unified whole <unk> so i began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn 't affect the work like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas <unk> [MASK] or in a 3d structure consisting of <unk>[MASK] creating a 2d image by burning it with a[MASK] <unk> i discovered that if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials my hand really wouldn 't hurt <unk> [MASK] and after having gone from a single approach to art <unk> i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons [MASK] this was the first time i 'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation[MASK] could actually drive creativity [MASK] <unk> i was finishing up school and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies i had this horrible little set of tools and[MASK] i felt like i could do so much more with the supplies i thought an artist was supposed to have [MASK] i actually didn 't even have a regular pair of scissors i was using these metal shears until i stole a pair from the office that i worked at <unk> [MASK] so i got out of school <unk> i got a job i got a paycheck i got myself to the art[MASK] <unk> i just went nuts buying supplies <unk> and then when i got home i sat down and i set myself to task to[MASK] really try to create something just completely outside of the box <unk> but i sat there for hours <unk> and nothing came to mind [MASK] the same thing the next day and then the next quickly slipping into a creative slump <unk> [MASK] and i was in a dark place for a long time unable to create and it didn 't make any sense because i was finally able to support my art[MASK] and yet i was creatively blank <unk> [MASK] but as i searched around in the darkness i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i never had before and[MASK] it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands embrace the shake and i realized if i ever wanted my creativity[MASK] <unk> i had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box[MASK] and get back into it [MASK] i wondered could you become more creative then by looking for limitations [MASK] what if i could only create with a dollar 's worth of supplies <unk> [MASK] at this point i was spending a lot of my evenings in well i guess i still spend a lot of my evenings in starbucks but i know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one[MASK] <unk> i decided to ask for fifty surprisingly they just handed them right over and then with some pencils i already had i made this project for only eighty cents [MASK] it really became a moment of clarification for me that[MASK] we need to first be limited[MASK] in order to become limitless <unk> [MASK] i took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas and wondered what if instead of painting on a canvas <unk> i could only paint on my chest <unk> [MASK] so i painted thirty images one layer at a time one on top of another with each[MASK] <unk> picture representing an influence in my life [MASK] or what if instead of painting with a brush i could only paint with karate chops [MASK] so i 'd dip my hands in paint and i just i just attacked the canvas and i actually hit so hard that i bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks[MASK] i had to rely on other people to create the content for the art <unk> [MASK] so for six days i lived in front of a webcam i slept on the floor and i ate takeout <unk> and i asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life changing moment <unk> [MASK] their stories became the art as i wrote them onto the revolving canvas[MASK] <unk> what if instead of making art to display <unk> i had to destroy it [MASK] this seemed like the ultimate limitation being an artist without art <unk> [MASK] this destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that i called goodbye art <unk> where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation[MASK] <unk> the beginning of goodbye art i focused on forced destruction like this image of jimi hendrix made with over seven thousand matches [MASK] then i opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally <unk> i looked for temporary materials <unk> [MASK] like spitting out food [MASK] sidewalk chalk and even[MASK] frozen wine [MASK] the last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn 't actually exist in the first place <unk> so i organized candles on a table <unk>[MASK] i lit them and then blew them out then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles [MASK] <unk> course of this goodbye art series i created <unk> twenty three different pieces[MASK] with nothing left to physically display [MASK] what i thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation as each time i created [MASK] the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where[MASK] i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project it did[MASK] <unk> failed to get off the ground or even worse after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing <unk> [MASK] but having committed to the process i continued on and something really surprising came out of this as i destroyed each project [MASK] i was learning to let go [MASK] let go of outcomes let go of failures[MASK] <unk> and let go of imperfections <unk> and in return i found a process of creating art that 's perpetual[MASK] and unencumbered by results <unk> i found myself in a state of constant creation thinking only of what 's next[MASK] and coming up with more ideas than ever [MASK] when i think back to my three years away from art <unk> away from my dream just going through the motions <unk> [MASK] instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream <unk> [MASK] i just quit <unk> i gave up[MASK] <unk> and what if i didn 't embrace the shake <unk> [MASK] because embracing the shake for me wasn 't just about art and having art skills it turned out to be about life and having life skills <unk> [MASK] because ultimately most of what we do[MASK] takes place here inside the box with limited resources <unk> learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations[MASK] is the best hope we have[MASK] <unk> to transform ourselves[MASK] and collectively <unk> transform our world looking at limitations as a source of creativity[MASK] changed the course of my life <unk> [MASK] now when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped [MASK] i sometimes still struggle but i continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities[MASK] <unk> like using hundreds of real live worms to make an image using a pushpin to tattoo a banana[MASK] <unk> or painting a picture with hamburger grease [MASK] one of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that i 've learned into something others can replicate[MASK] <unk> limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity but perhaps[MASK] one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts <unk> rethink categories and challenge accepted norms <unk> [MASK] and instead of telling each other to seize the day <unk> maybe[MASK] we can remind ourselves every day[MASK] to seize the limitation[MASK] thank you[MASK]
