 <unk> growing up in kenya <unk> i knew i always wanted to study biochemistry <unk> see i <unk>[MASK] had seen the impact of the high prevalence of diseases like malaria <unk> and i wanted[MASK] <unk> to make medicines that would cure the sick <unk> [MASK] so i worked really hard <unk> got a scholarship to the united states where i became a cancer researcher <unk> and i loved it [MASK] for someone who wants to cure diseases there is no higher calling <unk> [MASK] ten years later <unk> i returned to kenya to do just that [MASK] a freshly minted phd <unk> ready to take on this horrific illness which in kenya was almost certainly a death sentence[MASK] <unk> but instead of landing a job in a pharmaceutical company or a hospital <unk> i found myself drawn to a different kind of lab working with a different kind of patient[MASK] a patient whose illness was so serious it impacted every single person in my country <unk> [MASK] a patient who needed to get healthy fast that patient was my government [MASK] see many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today[MASK] and kenya was no exception [MASK] when i returned to kenya in two thousand and fourteen there was seventeen percent youth unemployment [MASK] and nairobi the major business hub was rated[MASK] <unk> on the quality of living index it was bad [MASK] now [MASK] an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up [MASK] so when government one of its most vital entities is weak or unhealthy <unk> everyone and everything suffers <unk>[MASK] sometimes you might put a band aid in place[MASK] to try and temporarily stop the pain <unk> maybe some of you here have participated in a band aid operation to an african country[MASK] setting[MASK] <unk> up alternative schools <unk> building hospitals digging wells because governments there either weren 't or couldn 't provide the services to their citizens[MASK] <unk> we all know this is a temporary solution there are just some things <unk> band aids can 't fix like[MASK] providing an environment where businesses[MASK] <unk> feel secure that they 'll have an equal opportunity to be able to run and start their businesses successfully [MASK] or there are systems in place that would protect the private property that they create [MASK] i would argue only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive <unk>[MASK] <unk> economies thrive when business are able to quickly and easily set up shop [MASK] business owners create new sources of income for themselves new jobs get added into the economy and then[MASK] more taxes are paid to fund public projects new business is good for everyone [MASK] and it 's such an important measure of economic growth the world bank has a ranking called the ease of doing business ranking which measures how easy or difficult it is to start a business in any given country <unk> [MASK] and as you can imagine [MASK] starting or running a business in a country with an ailing government[MASK] almost impossible[MASK] the president of kenya knew this which is why in two thousand and fourteen <unk> he came to our lab and asked us to partner with him[MASK] to be able to help kenya to jump start business growth <unk> [MASK] he set an ambitious goal[MASK] he wanted kenya to be ranked top fifty in this world bank ranking in two thousand and fourteen when he came kenya was ranked one hundred and[MASK] <unk> one hundred and eighty nine countries <unk> we had our work cut out for us <unk> [MASK] fortunately <unk> he came to the right place we[MASK] 're not just a band aid kind of team we[MASK] 're a group of computer scientists mathematicians <unk> engineers and a cancer researcher who understood that in order to cure the sickness of a system as big as[MASK] <unk> we needed to examine the whole body <unk> [MASK] and then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs into the tissues all the way to single cells so that we could properly make a diagnosis [MASK] so with our marching orders from the president himself we embarked on the purest of the scientific method <unk> [MASK] collecting data all the data we could get our hands on making hypotheses creating solutions one after the other [MASK] so we met with hundreds of individuals who worked at government agencies[MASK] from the tax agency the lands office <unk> utilities company the agency that 's responsible for registering companies <unk> [MASK] and with each of them <unk> we observed them as they served customers <unk> we documented their processes[MASK] most of them were manual[MASK] <unk> we also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork to try and really understand to try and diagnose what bodily[MASK] <unk> malfunctions had occurred that lead to that 136th spot on the world bank list what did we find well [MASK] in kenya it was taking seventy two days for a business owner to register their property [MASK] compared to just one day in new zealand which was ranked second on the world bank list [MASK] <unk> to get a new electric connection in korea it took eighteen days <unk> [MASK] if you wanted to get a construction permit so you could put up a building in kenya it was going to take you one hundred and twenty five days [MASK] in singapore which is ranked first that would only take you <unk> twenty six days <unk>[MASK] <unk> god forbid you had to go to court to get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract <unk> because that process alone would take you four hundred and[MASK] sixty five days <unk> and if that wasn 't bad enough [MASK] you would lose forty percent of your claim in just fees legal fees enforcement fees court fees <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i know what you 're thinking <unk> for there to exist such inefficiencies in an[MASK] <unk> an african country there must be corruption the very cells that run the show must be corrupt to the bone <unk> [MASK] i thought so too actually [MASK] when we started out i thought i[MASK] was going to find so much corruption <unk> i was literally going to either die or get killed in the process [MASK] but when we dug deeper we didn 't find corruption in the classic sense slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness[MASK] <unk> waiting to grease the palms of their friends what we found[MASK] was an overwhelming sense of helplessness our government was sick because government employees[MASK] felt helpless <unk> they felt that they were not empowered to drive change <unk> [MASK] and when people feel stuck and and helpless they stop seeing their role in a bigger system[MASK] <unk> they start to think the work they do doesn 't matter in driving change <unk> and when that happens things slow down fall through the cracks[MASK] and inefficiencies flourish <unk> now imagine with me if you had a process <unk>[MASK] you had to go through had no other alternative and this process was inefficient <unk> complex and very[MASK] <unk> very slow what would you do <unk> [MASK] i think you might start by trying to find somebody to outsource it to so that they can just take care of that for you if that doesn 't work [MASK] maybe you 'd consider paying somebody to just unofficially take care of it on your behalf especially if you thought nobody was going to catch you[MASK] <unk> not out of malice or greed just trying to make sure that you get something to work for you so you can move on [MASK] unfortunately that is the beginning of corruption <unk> [MASK] and if left to thrive and grow it seeps into the whole system and before you know it the whole body is sick <unk> [MASK] knowing this <unk> we had to start by making sure that every single[MASK] <unk> stakeholder we worked with[MASK] had a shared vision for what we wanted to do <unk> [MASK] so we met with everyone from the clerk whose sole job is to remove staples from application packets [MASK] to the legal drafters at the attorney general 's office [MASK] to the clerks who are responsible for serving business owners when they came to access government services <unk> [MASK] and with them <unk> we made sure[MASK] <unk> were impacting our ability as a country[MASK] to create new jobs and to attract investments no one 's role was too small everyone 's role was vital [MASK] now guess what we started to see <unk> [MASK] a coalition of government employees who are excited and ready to drive change began to grow and form <unk> [MASK] and together we started to implement changes that impacted the service delivery of[MASK] <unk> our country the result in just two years kenya 's ranking moved from one hundred and[MASK] and in recognition of the[MASK] significant reforms we 've been able to implement in such a short time kenya was[MASK] <unk> recognized to be among the top three global reformers in the world two years in a row [MASK] are we fully healthy [MASK] no we have some serious work still to do <unk> i like to think about these two years like a[MASK] <unk> it 's that time after months of hard <unk> grueling work at the gym <unk> [MASK] and then you get your first time to weigh yourself <unk> and you 've lost twenty pounds you 're feeling unstoppable <unk> [MASK] now [MASK] some of you may think this doesn 't apply to you you 're not from kenya you don 't intend to be an entrepreneur <unk> but think with me for just a moment [MASK] when is the last[MASK] <unk> time you accessed a government service <unk> maybe applied for your driver 's license <unk> tried to[MASK] do your taxes on your own [MASK] it 's easy in this political and global economy to want to give up when we think about transforming government <unk> [MASK] we can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient[MASK] too corrupt unfixable [MASK] we might even rarely get some key government responsibilities to other sectors to band aid solutions or to just[MASK] give up and feel helpless <unk> but just because a system is sick[MASK] doesn 't mean it 's dying <unk> we cannot afford[MASK] to give up when it comes to the challenges of fixing our governments[MASK] <unk> in the end what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells that 's you and i[MASK] get to the ground <unk> roll up our sleeves <unk> refuse to be helpless[MASK] and believe that sometimes all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive[MASK]
