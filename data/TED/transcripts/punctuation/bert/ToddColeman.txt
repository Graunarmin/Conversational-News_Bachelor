 <unk> she 's on bed rest at the hospital being monitored for her preterm contractions <unk> [MASK] <unk> she doesn 't look the happiest [MASK] that 's in part because it requires technicians and experts to apply these clunky belts on her to monitor her uterine contractions [MASK] another reason jane is not so happy[MASK] is because she 's worried in particular she 's worried about what happens after her 10 day stay on bed rest at the hospital [MASK] what happens when she 's home if she were to give birth this early it would be devastating <unk> as an[MASK] <unk> woman she 's twice as likely to have a premature birth[MASK] or to have a stillbirth <unk> [MASK] so jane basically has one of two options <unk> stay at the hospital on bed rest [MASK] a prisoner to the technology until she gives birth [MASK] and then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill or[MASK] head home after her 10 day stay and hope for the best[MASK] <unk> neither of these two options seems appealing <unk> [MASK] as i began to think about stories like this and hear about stories like this i began to ask myself and imagine is there an alternative [MASK] is there a way we could have the benefits of <unk>[MASK] monitoring that we get with our trusted partners in the hospital while someone is at home living their daily life with that in mind <unk> i encouraged[MASK] <unk> people in my research group to partner with some[MASK] clever material scientists <unk> and all of us came together and brainstormed <unk> [MASK] and after a long process we came up with a vision an idea of a wearable system that perhaps you could wear like a piece of jewelry[MASK] or you could apply to yourself like a band aid and after many trials and[MASK] <unk> we were able to come up with this flexible electronic patch that was manufactured using the same processes that they use to build computer chips <unk> [MASK] except the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body [MASK] these systems are about the thickness of a human hair <unk> [MASK] they can measure[MASK] the types of information that we want things such as[MASK] <unk> bodily movement <unk> [MASK] bodily temperature <unk> electrical rhythms of the body and so forth [MASK] we can also engineer these systems so they can integrate energy sources <unk> [MASK] and can have wireless transmission capabilities [MASK] so as we began to to build these types of systems we began to test them on ourselves in our research group <unk> but in addition we began to[MASK] <unk> reach out to some of our clinical partners in san diego and test these on different patients in different clinical conditions <unk> including[MASK] like jane here is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital[MASK] being monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional[MASK] <unk> in addition our flexible electronic patches are there [MASK] this picture demonstrates <unk> waveforms pertaining to the fetal heart rate <unk> where the red corresponds to what was acquired with the conventional belts and <unk>[MASK] <unk> the blue corresponds to our estimates using our flexible electronic systems and our algorithms [MASK] <unk> some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context [MASK] but there was still a problem the problem was the way we manufactured these systems[MASK] was very inefficient had low yield and was very <unk> error prone in addition <unk> as we talked to some of the nurses in the hospital they encouraged us[MASK] to make sure that our electronics[MASK] worked with typical medical adhesives that are used in a hospital <unk> we had an epiphany[MASK] and said wait a minute <unk> [MASK] rather than just making them work with adhesives <unk> let 's integrate them into adhesives <unk> and that could solve our manufacturing problem [MASK] this picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of scotch tape[MASK] by simply peeling it off of a wafer <unk> ongoing work in our research group allows us to in addition[MASK] <unk> integrated circuits into the flexible adhesives to do things like amplifying signals and digitizing them processing them and encoding for wireless transmission [MASK] all of this integrated into the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital [MASK] so when we reached this point <unk> we had some other challenges from both an engineering as well as a usability perspective[MASK] <unk> to make sure that we could make it used practically [MASK] in many digital health discussions people believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data [MASK] wirelessly transmit it send it to the cloud <unk> and in the cloud we can extract meaningful information for interpretation [MASK] and indeed you[MASK] can do all of that if you 're not worried about some of the energy challenges [MASK] think about jane for a moment <unk> she doesn 't live in palo alto <unk> nor does she live in beverly hills[MASK] what that means is we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data [MASK] there 's another challenge that not everyone in the medical profession is comfortable talking about [MASK] and that is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment [MASK] she[MASK] people like her her ancestors have not had the best experiences at the hands of doctors[MASK] and the hospital[MASK] or insurance companies [MASK] that means that we have to be mindful of questions of privacy jane might not feel that happy about all that data being processed into the cloud <unk> [MASK] and jane[MASK] cannot be fooled she reads the news she knows that if the[MASK] <unk> government can be hacked <unk> if the fortune five hundred can be hacked <unk> so can her doctor <unk> [MASK] and so with that in mind <unk> we had an epiphany [MASK] we cannot outsmart all the hackers in the world <unk> but perhaps we can present them a smaller target <unk> [MASK] what if we could actually <unk> rather than have those algorithms that do data interpretation run in the cloud[MASK] <unk> if we have those algorithms run on those small integrated circuits embedded into those adhesives <unk> [MASK] and so when we integrate these things together what this means is that now we can think about the future[MASK] where someone like jane can still go about living her normal daily life <unk> [MASK] she can be monitored it can be done in a way where she doesn 't have to get another job to pay her data plan and we can also address some of her[MASK] <unk> concerns about privacy [MASK] so at this point <unk> we 're feeling very good about ourselves <unk> we 've accomplished this we 've begun to address some of these questions about privacy and we feel like[MASK] <unk> pretty much the chapter is closed now <unk> everyone lived happily ever after right <unk> [MASK] well not so fast[MASK] <unk> one of the things we have to remember as i mentioned earlier is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment we have to remember[MASK] that there are increasing and widening health disparities <unk> and there 's inequity in terms of proper care management <unk> [MASK] and so what that means is that this simple picture of jane and her data even with her being comfortable being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud <unk> letting a doctor intervene if necessary is not the whole story[MASK] <unk> do is to think about ways to have[MASK] trusted parties serve as intermediaries between people like jane and her health care providers for example we 've begun to partner with churches[MASK] and to think about nurses that are church members that come from that trusted community as patient advocates and health coaches to people like jane [MASK] another thing we have going for us is that insurance companies[MASK] <unk> increasingly are attracted to some of these ideas [MASK] they 're increasingly realizing that perhaps it 's better to pay one dollar now for a wearable device and a health coach <unk> [MASK] rather than paying ten dollars later [MASK] when that baby is born prematurely and ends up in the neonatal intensive care unit[MASK] one of the most expensive parts of a hospital this has been a long learning process for us[MASK] this iterative process of breaking through and attacking one problem and not feeling totally comfortable and identifying the next problem has helped us go along this path[MASK] <unk> of actually trying to not only innovate with this technology but make sure it can be used for people who perhaps need it the most [MASK] <unk> accelerating rate <unk> we have to remember that human beings are using this technology and we have to be mindful[MASK] that these human beings they have a face they have a name[MASK] and a life and in the case of jane[MASK]
