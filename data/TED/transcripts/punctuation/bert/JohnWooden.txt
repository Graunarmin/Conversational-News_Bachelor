 <unk> i coined my own definition definition of success in one thousand nine hundred and thirty four when i was teaching at a high school in south bend indiana <unk> being a little bit[MASK] disappointed and [ disillusioned ] perhaps by the way parents of the youngsters in my english classes expected their youngsters[MASK] to[MASK] get an a or a <unk> b they thought a c was all right for the neighbors ' children because they were all average[MASK] <unk> but they weren 't satisfied when their own it would make the teacher feel that they had[MASK] failed or the youngster had failed and that 's not right the good lord in his infinite wisdom didn 't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned any more than we 're equal for size[MASK] <unk> not everybody could earn an a or a b and i didn 't like that way of judging and i did know how[MASK] the alumni of various schools back in the ' 30s judged coaches and athletic teams <unk> if you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful[MASK] not completely <unk> because i found out[MASK] we had a number of years at ucla where we didn 't lose a game <unk> but it seemed that we didn 't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted[MASK] quite frequently i really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic[MASK] manner but[MASK] that was true back in the 30s so i understood that but i didn 't like it i didn 't agree with it i wanted to come up with something i hoped could make me a better teacher <unk> [MASK] and give the youngsters under my supervision be it in athletics or the english classroom[MASK] <unk> aspire other than just a higher mark in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and[MASK] i wanted to come up with my own definition i thought that might help <unk> and[MASK] i knew how mr webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something[MASK] of that sort worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my[MASK] <unk> opinion not necessarily indicative of success <unk> so i wanted to come up with something of my own and i recalled[MASK] i was raised on a small farm in southern indiana and dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else <unk> [MASK] i 'm sure at the time[MASK] he did that i didn 't it didn 't well somewhere i guess in the hidden recesses of the mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else[MASK] <unk> learn from others[MASK] never cease trying to be the best you can be that 's under your control <unk> [MASK] if you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the things over which you have no control <unk> it will adversely affect the things over which you have control <unk> [MASK] then i ran across this simple verse that said at god 's footstool to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head ' i failed ' he cried <unk> the master said ' thou didst thy best[MASK] that is success ' from those things and one other perhaps <unk> i coined my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only through <unk>[MASK] <unk> in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you 're capable <unk> i believe that 's true <unk> [MASK] if you make the effort to do the best of which you 're capable trying to improve the situation that exists for you i think that 's success and i don 't think others can judge that it 's like character[MASK] <unk> reputation[MASK] your reputation is what you 're perceived to be [MASK] your character is what you really are and i think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be you 'd hope they 'd both be[MASK] good but they won 't necessarily be the same [MASK] well that was my idea that i was going to try to get across to the youngsters i ran across other things i love to teach and it was mentioned[MASK] by the previous[MASK] <unk> speaker that that i enjoy poetry and i dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me i think be better than i would have been i know i 'm not what i ought to be <unk> what i should be but i think i 'm better than i would have been if i hadn 't run across certain things <unk>[MASK] one was just a little verse that said[MASK] no written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be[MASK] <unk> nor all the books on all the shelves it 's what the teachers are themselves that made an impression on me <unk>[MASK] and i tried to use that more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the english classroom <unk>[MASK] i love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow maybe it 's because dad used[MASK] <unk> to read to us at night by coal oil lamp we didn 't have electricity[MASK] in our farm home and dad would read poetry to us so i always liked it and about the same time <unk> i ran across this one verse i ran across another one [MASK] someone asked[MASK] a lady teacher why she taught and after some time she said she wanted to think about that then she came up and said [MASK] they ask me why i teach and i reply[MASK] <unk> ' where could i find such splendid company ' there sits a statesman strong <unk> unbiased wise another daniel webster silver tongued [MASK] a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life blood 's flow [MASK] and there a builder <unk> upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the[MASK] word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ and all about a gathering of teachers farmers merchants laborers[MASK] those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow <unk> and i may say [MASK] i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may [MASK] and later i may say i knew him once <unk> and he was weak or strong or bold or proud or gay i knew him once but then he was a boy <unk> [MASK] they ask me why i teach and i reply ' where could i find such[MASK] <unk> splendid company ' and i believe the teaching profession it 's true you have so many youngsters and i 've got to think of my youngsters <unk>[MASK] attorneys <unk> eleven dentists and doctors <unk> many many teachers and other professions and that that[MASK] gives you a great deal of pleasure to see them go on i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they 're there to get an[MASK] <unk> education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way <unk> and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a[MASK] little precedence over the other two and you 're not going to have any[MASK] very long so that was the idea that i tried[MASK] to get across[MASK] to the youngsters under my supervision <unk> i had three rules pretty much that i stuck with practically all the time i 'd learned these prior to coming[MASK] <unk> to ucla and i decided they were very important one was never be late <unk> [MASK] later on i said certain things <unk>[MASK] the players if we were leaving for somewhere had to be neat and clean there was a time when i i made them wear jackets and[MASK] <unk> then i saw our chancellor coming to school in[MASK] denims and turtlenecks and thought it 's not right for me to keep this other [ rule ] so i let them just they had to be neat and clean[MASK] i had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of bill walton <unk> [MASK] he came to catch the bus we were leaving for somewhere to play and he wasn 't clean and neat <unk> so[MASK] i wouldn 't let him go he couldn 't get on the bus he had to go home and and get cleaned up to get to the airport[MASK] <unk> was a stickler for that i believed in that i believe in time very important <unk> [MASK] i believe you should be on time <unk> but i felt at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters didn 't have to[MASK] feel that we were going to keep them over when i speak at coaching clinics i often tell young coaches and at coaching clinics more or less they 'll be the younger coaches getting in[MASK] the profession[MASK] <unk> tell them don 't run practices late <unk> [MASK] because you 'll go home in a bad mood <unk> and that 's not good for a young married man to go home in a bad mood <unk> when you get older[MASK] it doesn 't make any difference but [MASK] so i did believe on time i believe starting on time and i believe closing on time <unk> [MASK] and another one i had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you[MASK] are out of here for the day if i see it in a game you 're going to come out and sit on the bench <unk> and the third one was never criticize a teammate [MASK] i didn 't want that i used to tell them i was paid to do that that 's my job i 'm paid to do it <unk> pitifully poor <unk> but i am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no[MASK] it 's a little different than[MASK] <unk> working hard and enjoying what you 're doing coming up to the apex[MASK] <unk> according to my definition of success and right at the top <unk> faith and patience and i say to you in whatever you 're doing <unk> [MASK] you must be patient <unk> you have to have patience to[MASK] we want things to happen we talk[MASK] about our youth being impatient a lot[MASK] <unk> they are they want to change everything they think all change is progress and we get a little older we sort of[MASK] let things go and we forget there is no progress without change <unk> so you must have patience and i believe that we must have faith <unk> i believe that we must believe truly believe[MASK] not just give it word service believe that things will work out as they should <unk> providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope[MASK] things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time but we don 't do the things that[MASK] are necessary to make those things[MASK] become reality <unk> i worked on this for some fourteen years and i think it helped me become[MASK] a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition[MASK] of success <unk> you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of george moriarty he spelled moriarty with only one ' i ' i 'd never seen that before but he[MASK] did big league baseball players they 're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one ' i ' in his name <unk> you 'd be surprised how many[MASK] also told him that <unk> that was one more than he had in his head at various times [MASK] but he wrote something where i think he did what i tried to do in this pyramid he called[MASK] <unk> the road ahead or the road behind he said sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can 't win is[MASK] the fates themselves have missed <unk> yet there lives on the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves the shining trophies on our shelves[MASK] can never win tomorrow 's game you and i know deeper down there 's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best we simply haven 't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won [MASK] of showing what is meant by grit [MASK] of playing through[MASK] <unk> when others quit of[MASK] playing through not letting up it 's bearing down that wins the cup of dreaming there 's a goal ahead of hoping when our dreams are dead of praying when our hopes have fled yet losing [MASK] not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man[MASK] than giving all within his span giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory <unk> and so the fates are seldom wrong no matter how they twist and[MASK] <unk> wind it 's you and i who make our fates[MASK] we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind [MASK] reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us don 't whine don 't complain don 't make excuses just get out there and whatever you 're doing do it to the best of your ability and[MASK] no one can do[MASK] more than that i tried to get across too that my opponents will tell you you never heard me mention winning[MASK] never mention winning my idea is that[MASK] you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game <unk> [MASK] and you can win when you 're outscored i 've felt that way on certain occasions at various times <unk> and i just wanted them to[MASK] be able to hold their head up after a game i used to say that when when a game is over and you see somebody that didn 't know the outcome i hope they[MASK] <unk> couldn 't tell by your actions[MASK] whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you[MASK] that 's what really matters if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly [MASK] the results will be about what they should be not necessarily what you 'd want them to be but they 'll be about what they should only you will know whether you can do that and that 's what i wanted from them[MASK] more than anything[MASK] <unk> else and as time went by and i learned more about other things i think it worked a little better as far as the results but i wanted[MASK] the score of a game to be the byproduct[MASK] of these other things and not the end itself <unk> i believe it was[MASK] one great philosopher who[MASK] <unk> and i like that i think that it is it 's getting there <unk> sometimes when you get there there 's almost a let down <unk> but it 's the getting there that 's the fun as a basketball coach at ucla i liked our practices to be the journey [MASK] and the game would be the end the end result i liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play and see whether i 'd done a decent job[MASK] <unk> during the week <unk> there again it 's getting the players to get that self satisfaction in knowing that they 'd made the effort to do the best[MASK] of which[MASK] they are capable <unk> [MASK] sometimes i 'm asked who was the best player i had or the best teams i can never answer that <unk> [MASK] as far as the individuals are concerned i[MASK] <unk> i was asked one time[MASK] about that and they said suppose that you in some way could[MASK] make the perfect player what would you want [MASK] and i said well i 'd want one that knew why he was at ucla to get an education he was a good student really knew why he was there in the first place <unk> but i 'd want one <unk>[MASK] i 'd want one to realize that that defense usually wins championships[MASK] <unk> work hard on defense <unk> but i 'd want one who would play offense too i 'd want him to be unselfish and[MASK] look for the pass first and not shoot all the time <unk> and[MASK] i 'd want one that could pass and would pass i 've had some that could and wouldn 't and i 've had some that would and could [MASK] <unk> and i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside <unk> i wanted them to be good inside too i 'd[MASK] want them to[MASK] be able to rebound well at both ends too why not just take someone like[MASK] keith wilkes and let it go at that he had the qualifications not the only one but he was one that i used in that particular category because i think he[MASK] he made the effort to become the best there was a couple i mention in my book they call me coach[MASK] two players that gave me great satisfaction that came as close as i think anyone i ever had to reach their full potential one was conrad burke <unk> and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them[MASK] as freshmen on our freshmen team freshmen couldn 't play varsity when i taught <unk> [MASK] i thought oh gracious if these two players either one of them they were different years but i thought about each one at the time he was there oh if he ever makes[MASK] <unk> our varsity must be pretty miserable <unk> if he 's good enough to make it and you know one of them was a starting player for a[MASK] season and a half the other one [MASK] his next year played thirty two minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us the next year he was a starting[MASK] a starting player on the national championship[MASK] <unk> and here i thought he 'd never play a minute <unk> when he was so those are the things that give you[MASK] great joy <unk> and great satisfaction to see neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well <unk> [MASK] but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they didn 't force it <unk> [MASK] and neither one could jump very well[MASK] but they kept good position <unk> and so they did well rebounding they remembered that[MASK] that every shot that 's taken they assumed would be missed i 've had too many stand around and wait to see if it 's missed[MASK] <unk> then they go and it 's too late somebody else is in there ahead <unk> of them they weren 't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance[MASK] and so they they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to[MASK] as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as[MASK] <unk> or bill walton <unk> or many of the others that we had there were some outstanding[MASK] players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance[MASK]
