 <unk> what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept[MASK] that was developed at nasa 's glenn research center[MASK] in cleveland ohio <unk> but before i do that we have to go over the definition of what green is ' cause a lot of us have a different definition of[MASK] the product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means there 's plenty of things that are being called green now what does it actually mean [MASK] we use three metrics to determine green the first metric is is it sustainable <unk> [MASK] which means are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations[MASK] <unk> is it alternative is it different than what is being used today or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what 's used conventionally <unk> [MASK] and three is it renewable does it come from earth 's natural replenishing resources such as sun <unk> [MASK] wind and water <unk> [MASK] now my task at nasa is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels extreme green why aviation[MASK] <unk> the field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined [MASK] we need to find an alternative also it 's a national aeronautics directive [MASK] one of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels biofuels using domestic and safe friendly resources <unk>[MASK] <unk> combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric[MASK] actually extreme green for us is all three together that 's why you see the plus there i was told to say that [MASK] so it has to be the big three at grc that 's another metric <unk> ninety seven percent[MASK] of the world 's water is saltwater <unk> how about we use that [MASK] combine that with number three do not use arable land[MASK] because crops are already growing on that land that 's very scarce around the world number two [MASK] don 't compete with food crops that 's already a well established entity they don 't need another entry <unk> [MASK] and lastly the most precious resource we have on this earth[MASK] is fresh water <unk> don 't use fresh water <unk>[MASK] <unk> point five percent of the world 's water is saltwater two point five percent is fresh water <unk> less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use but sixty percent of the population lives within that one percent [MASK] so combating my problem was now i have to be extreme green[MASK] and meet the big three ladies and gentlemen <unk> welcome to the <unk> greenlab research facility this is a facility[MASK] <unk> we also are using weeds[MASK] and we are also using algae [MASK] the good thing about our lab is we 've had three thousand six hundred visitors in the last two years <unk> why do you think that 's so <unk> [MASK] because we are on to something special [MASK] so in the lower you[MASK] <unk> see the greenlab obviously and on the right hand side you 'll see algae[MASK] <unk> if you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels algae is a viable option there 's a lot of funding right now and we have an algae to fuels program [MASK] there 's two types of algae growing one is a closed photobioreactor that you see here <unk> and what you see on the other[MASK] <unk> our job at nasa is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors [MASK] now the problems with closed photobioreactors are they are quite expensive they are automated and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale <unk> so on large scale what do they use [MASK] we use open pond systems <unk> [MASK] now around the world they are growing algae with[MASK] <unk> this racetrack design that you see here looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well <unk> but when it gets around the last turn which i call turn four[MASK] it 's stagnant <unk> [MASK] we actually have a solution for that in the greenlab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature waves <unk> [MASK] we actually use wave technology on our open pond systems we have ninety five percent mixing and our[MASK] <unk> content is higher than a closed <unk>[MASK] <unk> system which we think is significant [MASK] there is a drawback to algae however <unk> it 's very expensive is there a way to produce algae[MASK] inexpensively and the answer is yes we do the same thing we do with[MASK] <unk> have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater [MASK] what we do we take a potential species we start at freshwater <unk> we add a little bit more salt <unk> when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as brazil right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants[MASK] the next tank represents africa the[MASK] <unk> next tank represents arizona the next tank represents florida <unk> and the next tank represents california or the open ocean [MASK] what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive[MASK] anywhere in the world where there 's barren desert <unk> [MASK] we are being very successful so far [MASK] now here 's one of the problems if you are a farmer <unk> you need five things to be successful you need seeds <unk> you need soil <unk> you need[MASK] <unk> water and you need sun <unk> and the last thing that you need is fertilizer [MASK] most people use chemical fertilizers but guess what [MASK] we do not use chemical fertilizer wait a second i just saw lots of greenery in your greenlab [MASK] you have to use fertilizer <unk> believe it or not in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems eighty percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves[MASK] the twenty percent that 's missing[MASK] is nitrogen and phosphorous <unk> we have a natural solution fish no we don 't cut up the fish and put them in there [MASK] fish waste is what we use [MASK] as a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies that we 've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way[MASK] <unk> they love to make babies <unk> [MASK] and they love to go to the bathroom <unk> and the more they go to the bathroom the more fertilizer we get the better off we are believe it or not [MASK] it should be noted that we use sand[MASK] as our soil <unk> regular beach sand fossilized coral so a lot of people ask me how did you get started[MASK] <unk> started[MASK] in what we call the indoor biofuels lab it 's a seedling lab we have twenty six different species of halophytes and five are winners [MASK] what we do here is actually it should be called a death lab ' cause we try to kill the seedlings make them[MASK] rough[MASK] and then we come to the greenlab what you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing a[MASK] <unk> about in a minute <unk> and lastly it 's me actually working in the lab to prove to you i do work i don 't just talk about what i do[MASK] here 's the plant species <unk> salicornia virginica [MASK] it 's a wonderful plant i love that plant <unk> everywhere we go we see it it 's all over the place from maine all the way to[MASK] <unk> very difficult to get around the world it is the highest lipid content that we have <unk> but it has a shortcoming it 's short [MASK] now you take europaea <unk> which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have <unk> [MASK] and what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology[MASK] combine all three[MASK] <unk> when a hurricane decimated the delaware bay soybean fields gone[MASK] we came up with an idea can you have a plant that has a land reclamation[MASK] positive in delaware and the answer is yes <unk> it 's called seashore mallow[MASK] biofuels the rest <unk> cattle feed it[MASK] 's there for ten years it 's working very well now we get to chaetomorpha [MASK] this is a macro algae that loves excess nutrients if you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks [MASK] this species is so significant to us the properties[MASK] <unk> are very close to plastic we are trying right now to convert this macro algae into a <unk>[MASK] if we are successful we will revolutionize the plastics industry so [MASK] we have a seed to fuel program we have to do something with this biomass that we have and so we do g c [MASK] <unk> lipid optimization so on and so forth <unk> because our goal really is[MASK] to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels aviation specifics so on and so forth so far we talked about water[MASK] and fuel <unk> but along the way[MASK] we found out something[MASK] interesting about salicornia it[MASK] 's a food product <unk> so we talk about ideas worth spreading right <unk> how about this[MASK] in sub saharan africa next to the sea saltwater <unk> [MASK] barren desert <unk> how about we take that plant plant it <unk> [MASK] half use for food <unk> half use for fuel we can make that happen inexpensively [MASK] you can see there 's a greenhouse in germany that sells it as a health food product[MASK] <unk> harvested <unk> and in the middle here is a shrimp dish and it 's being pickled so i have to tell you a joke[MASK] salicornia is known as sea beans [MASK] saltwater asparagus and pickle weed <unk> so we are pickling pickle weed in the middle oh i thought it was funny [MASK] and at the bottom is seaman 's mustard it does make sense this is a logical snack you have mustard you are a seaman[MASK] the halophyte you mix it together it 's a great snack with some crackers[MASK] and last garlic with salicornia which is what i like [MASK] so water <unk> fuel[MASK] and food <unk> [MASK] none of this is possible without the greenlab team just like the miami heat has the big three <unk> we have the big three at nasa grc that 's myself[MASK] professor bob hendricks our fearless leader and dr arnon chait <unk> the backbone of the greenlab is[MASK] students over the last two years we 've had thirty five different students from around the world[MASK] working at greenlab as a matter fact my division chief says a lot you have a green[MASK] <unk> i 'm okay with that ' cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers <unk> which is significant [MASK] so in first summary[MASK] i presented to you what we think is a global solution for food <unk> fuel[MASK] and water <unk> there 's something missing[MASK] to be complete <unk> clearly we use electricity <unk> we have a solution for you[MASK] we 're using clean energy[MASK] <unk> sources here <unk> so we have two wind turbines connected to the greenlab we have four or five more hopefully coming soon <unk> [MASK] we are also using something that is quite interesting[MASK] there is a solar array field at nasa 's glenn research center hasn 't been used for fifteen years[MASK] <unk> along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues we realized that they are still viable [MASK] so we are refurbishing them right now in about thirty days or so they 'll be connected to the greenlab [MASK] and the reason why you see red red and yellow is a lot of people think nasa employees don 't work on saturday[MASK] this is a picture taken on saturday <unk> there are no cars around but you see my truck in yellow i[MASK] <unk> this is a proof to you that i 'm working <unk> ' cause we do what it takes to get the job done most people know that here 's a concept with this [MASK] we are using the greenlab for a <unk> micro grid test bed[MASK] for the smart grid concept in ohio <unk> we have the ability to do that and i think it 's going to work[MASK] <unk> renewable energy ecosystem was presented today <unk> we really really hope this concept catches on[MASK] worldwide we think we have a solution[MASK] for food <unk> water <unk> fuel and now energy [MASK] <unk> don 't compete with food crops[MASK]
