gouache which hasn 't changed in six hundred years[MASK] <unk> but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it serious nonsense [MASK] so i think i 'm actually the first one here i lead i called[MASK] it serious nonsense because on the serious side <unk> i use a technique of painstaking[MASK] realism[MASK] of editorial illustration from when i[MASK] was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it it 's the only style i know <unk> and it 's very kind of staid and[MASK] formal and meanwhile <unk> i use nonsense as you can see <unk> this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and[MASK] the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor which you can 't see there <unk> this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book <unk> this is a[MASK] <unk> authenticity in a quiet neighborhood in toledo <unk> this is my submission for the l a museum of film <unk> [MASK] you can probably tell frank gehry and i come from the same town my work is[MASK] so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it and[MASK] i work a lot in what i call retrofuturism which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow[MASK] and they 're always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong <unk> [MASK] and the peak time for that was the 30s because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future and technology[MASK] was going to carry us along <unk> this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days i had a huge collection of them from the '[MASK] <unk> all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and[MASK] everything[MASK] improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at three hundred miles an hour it 's all going to happen it 's all going to be wonderful [MASK] automotive retrofuturism is[MASK] one of my specialties i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject[MASK] <unk> has always been halfway into the future the advertising half <unk> this is the ' fifty eight bulgemobile so new they make tomorrow look like yesterday <unk> this is[MASK] a chain gang of guys admiring the car that 's from a whole catalog it 's eighteen pages or so ran back in the days of the lampoon <unk> where i cut my teeth[MASK] is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened[MASK] for good reason usually the zeppelin this was from a brochure about the zeppelin[MASK] based obviously on the hindenburg <unk> but the zeppelin was[MASK] the biggest thing that ever moved made by man and it carried <unk> fifty six people at the speed of a buick[MASK] at an altitude you could hear dogs bark <unk> and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the normandie to fly it[MASK] <unk> wasn 't you know it was inevitable it was going to go this <unk>[MASK] <unk> jousting in malibu in the 30s the <unk>[MASK] couldn 't wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasn 't a big success it 's the only spanish innovation <unk> technologically of the 20th century by the way [MASK] you needed to know that the flying car which never got off the ground it was a post war dream[MASK] <unk> my old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car <unk> this is pitched into the future from one thousand nine hundred and forty six looking at the day all american families have them [MASK] there 's moscow shirley hope they speak esperanto [MASK] faux nostalgia which i 'm sort of not say famous for but i work an awful lot in it it 's the achingly sentimental[MASK] yearning for times that never happened somebody once said that[MASK] <unk> nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion[MASK] so i think thats a case for serious play <unk> this is emblematic of it this is wing dining [MASK] recalling those balmy summer days[MASK] somewhere over france in the 20s dining on the wing of a plane <unk> you can 't see it very well here but that 's hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford[MASK] <unk> until the slipstream blows him away <unk> this is tank polo in the south hamptons <unk> [MASK] the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that [MASK] and authenticity is a is a major part of my serious nonsense i think it[MASK] <unk> and sixteen they had two machine guns and a cannon and they had ninety horsepower ricardo engines they went five miles an hour and inside it was one hundred and five degrees in the pitch dark <unk> [MASK] and they had a canary[MASK] hung inside the thing to[MASK] make sure the germans weren 't going to use gas <unk> [MASK] happy little story isn 't it this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the 30s where you drove up to your front door if you had the[MASK] <unk> guts [MASK] anybody who was anybody had an apartment there i managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm <unk> [MASK] and i love cigars there 's a cigar billboard down there and faux nostalgia works even even in serious subjects like war <unk> [MASK] this is those wonderful days of the battle of britain in one thousand nine hundred and forty when[MASK] <unk> bursts into the house of commons and buzzes around just to piss off churchill who 's down there somewhere it 's a[MASK] fond memory of times past hyperbolic overkill is[MASK] a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute[MASK] ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did a brochure again rms[MASK] <unk> the biggest thing in all the world the copy which you can 't see because it goes on and on for several pages says that[MASK] steerage passengers can 't get their to bunks before the the voyage is over <unk> and it 's so safe it carries no insurance[MASK] it 's obviously modeled on the titanic <unk> [MASK] but it 's not 's not a cri de coeur about man 's hubris in the face of the elements it 's just a sick <unk> silly joke <unk> [MASK] shamelessly cheap is something <unk> i think this will wake you up it has no[MASK] <unk> no meaning <unk> just desoto discovers the mississippi and it 's a desoto[MASK] discovering the mississippi <unk> i did that[MASK] as a quick[MASK] back page i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon <unk> and i did that and i thought well i 'm ashamed i hope nobody knows it people wrote in for reprints of that thing [MASK] <unk> urban absurdism that 's what the new yorker really calls for <unk> i try to[MASK] make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers i 've done about forty of them and i 'd say[MASK] thirty of them are are based on that concept i was driving down[MASK] 7th avenue one night at three a m and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought what causes that and that[MASK] whos to say the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in[MASK] <unk> york it 's a very somber place i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this is a very un pc cover [MASK] not in new york <unk> i couldn 't resist <unk> [MASK] and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying this is too serious and solemn[MASK] to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize[MASK] <unk> got around to it yet but[MASK] i may <unk> this is the word side of my brain [MASK] i love the word eurotrash [MASK] that 's all the eurotrash coming through jfk customs <unk> [MASK] this was the new york bike messenger meeting the tour de france [MASK] if you live in new york you know how the[MASK] <unk> messengers move <unk> except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do[MASK] and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the tour de france[MASK] sign of our times i guess <unk> this is the only fashion cover i 've ever done it 's the little old lady that lives in a shoe and then this thing[MASK] the title of that was there goes the neighborhood [MASK] i don 't know[MASK] <unk> a lot about fashion i was told to do what they call a mary jane <unk> [MASK] and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying [MASK] put a strap on it no don 't put a strap on it put a strap on it <unk> don 't put a strap on it [MASK] because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it 's bad and i finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe <unk> [MASK] this is a tiny[MASK] <unk> people always ask me where do you get your ideas how do your ideas come[MASK] <unk> about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night this came to me like a xerox all i had to do was write it down[MASK] it was perfectly clear i didn 't do any thinking about it <unk> and then when it ran a lovely lady an old lady named <unk> <unk> mrs edgar rosenberg[MASK] if you know that name called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet <unk> her former name was fay wray and so[MASK] that was i didn 't have the[MASK] <unk> it will ever be done again successive pages in the front of the magazine it 's the ascent of man using an escalator <unk> and it 's in three parts [MASK] you can 't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move[MASK]
