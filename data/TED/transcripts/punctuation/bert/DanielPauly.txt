 <unk> to speak about a tiny little idea <unk> and this is about shifting baseline <unk> and because the idea[MASK] can be explained in one minute i will tell you[MASK] three stories before to fill in[MASK] and the first story is is about charles darwin one of my heroes <unk> [MASK] and he was here <unk> as you well know in ' thirty five and you 'd think he was chasing finches but he wasn 't [MASK] he was actually collecting fish and he described one of them[MASK] as very common this was the sailfin grouper [MASK] <unk> we have heard it[MASK] lots of times on galapagos and other places so there is nothing particular about it [MASK] but the point is we still come to galapagos <unk> we still think it is pristine the brochures still say[MASK] it is untouched so[MASK] <unk> what happens here the second story <unk> also to illustrate another concept is called shifting waistline because[MASK] i was there in ' seventy one studying a lagoon in west africa i was there because[MASK] i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa <unk> and i thought i could blend in and i got a big sunburn <unk> and i was convinced[MASK] i was really not from there this was my first sunburn <unk> and the the lagoon was surrounded by[MASK] by palm trees as you can see and a few mangrove and it had tilapia about twenty centimeters a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia <unk> [MASK] and the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of[MASK] <unk> and they had a good time and they earned more than average in[MASK] ghana <unk> when i went there twenty seven years later [MASK] the fish had shrunk to half of their size <unk> [MASK] they were maturing at five centimeters they had been pushed genetically there were still fishes <unk> they were still kind of happy and[MASK] the fish also were happy to be there so[MASK] nothing has changed but everything has changed my third little[MASK] <unk> story[MASK] is that i was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia [MASK] in the ' 70s well beginning in the ' 60s europe did lots of development projects fish development[MASK] meant imposing on countries that had already one hundred thousand fishers to impose[MASK] <unk> is called the mutiara four <unk> and i went sailing on it and we did surveys throughout[MASK] the southern south china sea and especially the java sea and what we caught <unk> we didn 't have words for it [MASK] what we caught i know now is the bottom of the sea and ninety percent of our catch[MASK] were sponges[MASK] <unk> animals that are fixed on the bottom and actually most of the fish they are a little spot on the debris the piles of debris were coral reef fish [MASK] essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down <unk> and these pictures are[MASK] extraordinary because[MASK] this transition is very rapid <unk> within[MASK] <unk> you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins [MASK] the bottom is transformed from in this case a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy[MASK] mess [MASK] this is a dead turtle they were not eaten they were thrown away because they were dead and one time we caught a live one it was not drowned yet and then they wanted to kill it[MASK] because it was good to eat [MASK] <unk> of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that 's never been fished but it 's not documented [MASK] we transform the world <unk> but we don 't remember it we adjust our baseline[MASK] to the new level and we don 't recall what was there <unk> [MASK] if you generalize this something like this happens you have on the y axis[MASK] <unk> some good thing biodiversity <unk> [MASK] numbers of orca the greenness of your country the water supply <unk> and over time it changes it changes because[MASK] people do things or naturally every generation[MASK] will use the the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives[MASK] as a standard and will extrapolate forward[MASK] <unk> difference then they perceive as a loss <unk> but they don 't perceive what happened before as a loss [MASK] you can have a succession of changes at the end you want to sustain[MASK] miserable leftovers <unk> and that to a large extent is what we want to do now <unk> we want to sustain things[MASK] that are gone or things that are not the way they were now one should[MASK] <unk> think[MASK] this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies they killed[MASK] animals and they didn 't know they had done so after a few generations because[MASK] <unk> becomes rare so you don 't lose abundant animals you always lose rare animals [MASK] and therefore they 're not perceived as a big loss <unk> [MASK] over time we concentrate on large animals [MASK] and in a sea that means the big fish they become rarer because we fish them over time we have a few fish left[MASK] and we think[MASK] this is the baseline[MASK] <unk> and the question is why do people accept this well because they don 't know[MASK] that it was different <unk> and in fact lots of people scientists will contest that it was really different <unk> [MASK] and they will contest this because the evidence[MASK] presented[MASK] <unk> is not in[MASK] the way they would like the evidence presented for example the anecdote that some[MASK] present as[MASK] captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not[MASK] utilized by fishery scientists <unk> because it 's not [MASK] <unk> so you have a situation where people don 't know the past even though we live in literate societies because they don 't trust[MASK] <unk> the the sources of the past <unk> [MASK] and hence the enormous role that a marine protected area can play because with marine protected areas we actually[MASK] recreate[MASK] <unk> we recreate the past that[MASK] people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low that is for people who can see[MASK] a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides[MASK] which enables them to reset their baseline <unk> how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access the people in the midwest for example[MASK] there i think that the arts and film[MASK] can[MASK] perhaps fill the gap <unk> and simulation this is a simulation of chesapeake bay there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago five hundred years[MASK] ago and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like[MASK] <unk> why people were so touched[MASK] by it never mind the pocahontas story <unk>[MASK] why so touched by the imagery because it evokes[MASK] something[MASK] that in a sense has been lost and so my recommendation it 's the only one i will provide is for cameron to do[MASK]
