 <unk> planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities[MASK] whose lights we can see twinkling but whose streets we can 't walk by studying those twinkling lights though <unk> we can learn[MASK] about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life[MASK] in this image of the tokyo skyline i 've hidden data from the newest planet hunting space telescope on the block the kepler mission can you see it [MASK] there we go <unk> [MASK] this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over one hundred and fifty thousand stars [MASK] all at once <unk> every half hour and very precisely [MASK] and what we 're looking[MASK] is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us [MASK] in just over two years of operations we 've found over one thousand two hundred potential new planetary systems around other stars [MASK] to give you some perspective [MASK] <unk> the previous two decades of searching we had only known about four hundred prior to kepler [MASK] when we see these little dips in the light [MASK] we can determine a number of things for one thing we can determine that there 's a planet there but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star [MASK] that distance is really important because it tells us[MASK] how much light the planet receives overall and that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it 's a little like you or i sitting around a campfire[MASK] <unk> you want to be close enough to the campfire so that you 're warm <unk> but not so close that you 're too toasty and you get burned <unk> [MASK] however there 's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall and i 'll tell you why <unk> [MASK] this is our star this is our sun it 's shown here in visible light that 's the light that you can see with your own[MASK] <unk> 'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball that sun that we all draw when we 're children <unk> [MASK] but you 'll notice something else and that 's that the face of the sun has freckles [MASK] these freckles are called sunspots and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun 's magnetic field they also cause the light from the star to vary <unk> [MASK] and we can measure this very very precisely with kepler and trace their effects [MASK] however <unk> these are just the tip of the iceberg[MASK] <unk> we had uv eyes or x ray eyes [MASK] we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our sun 's magnetic activity the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well [MASK] just think even when it 's cloudy outside these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time [MASK] so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable whether it might be amenable to life[MASK] <unk> to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is but we want to know about its space weather[MASK] this <unk> high energy radiation the uv and the x rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high energy radiation <unk> [MASK] and so we can 't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system i 'm showing here[MASK] venus earth and mars three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size but only one of which is really a good place to live <unk> [MASK] but what we can do in the meantime[MASK] is measure the light from our stars[MASK] and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe [MASK] kepler won 't find a planet around[MASK] <unk> every single star it looks at <unk> but really every measurement it makes is precious [MASK] because it 's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets [MASK] and how it 's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe <unk> [MASK] while it 's kepler the telescope the instrument that stares it 's we life who are searching <unk> [MASK]
