 <unk> the past six months i 've spent my time traveling <unk> i think i 've done sixty thousand[MASK] miles <unk> but without leaving my desk and the reason i can do that is because i 'm actually two[MASK] <unk> i look like one person but i 'm two people i 'm eddie who is here <unk> and at the same time my alter ego is a big green boxy avatar nicknamed cyber frank so[MASK] that 's what i spend my time doing i 'd like to start if it 's possible with a test <unk> because i do business stuff so it 's important that we focus on outcomes[MASK] <unk> and then i struggled because i was thinking to myself what should i talk what should i do it 's a ted audience <unk>[MASK] <unk> i just hope i 've got the level of difficulty right <unk> so let 's just walk our way through this please could you work this through with me you can shout out the answer if you like the question is which of these horizontal lines is longer the answer is audience the same eddie obeng [MASK] the same <unk> no they 're not the same [MASK] they 're not the same <unk> the top one is ten percent longer than the bottom one <unk> so why did you tell me they were the same <unk> do you remember[MASK] <unk> the lengths are you say they 're the same <unk> but they 're not the same because i 've changed it and this is what i 'm trying to explain has happened to us in the <unk> 21st century somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works [MASK] when i 'm joking i try and explain it happened[MASK] <unk> at midnight you see while we were asleep but it was midnight fifteen years ago <unk> okay <unk> you didn 't notice it but basically what they do is they switched all the rules round <unk> so that the way to[MASK] <unk> successfully run a business an organization or even a country has been deleted flipped[MASK] <unk> idea is that[MASK] what 's happened is the real 21st century around us isn 't so obvious to us <unk> so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize but which no longer exists[MASK] <unk> you don 't believe me do you okay so[MASK] let me take you on a little journey of many of the things i don 't understand <unk> if you search amazon for the word[MASK] <unk> creativity you 'll discover something like ninety thousand books if you go on google and you look for innovation + creativity you get thirty million hits <unk> if you add the word consultants it doubles to sixty <unk>[MASK] <unk> million are you with me and yet <unk> statistically what you discover is that about one in one hundred thousand ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception it[MASK] <unk> companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets[MASK] which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published how is that possible <unk> if you look at[MASK] the visions we have the visions of how we 're going to change the world the key thing is implementation we have the vision we 've got to make it happen <unk> we 've spent decades professionalizing implementation people are supposed to be good at making stuff happen <unk> [MASK] however[MASK] <unk> if i use as an example[MASK] a family of five going on holiday <unk> if you can imagine this all the way from london all the way across to hong kong <unk> what i want you to think about is their budget is only three thousand pounds of expenses [MASK] what actually happens is if i compare this to the average real project <unk> [MASK] average real successful project <unk> the family actually end up in makassar south sulawesi at a cost of four thousand[MASK] pounds whilst leaving two of the children behind what i 'm trying to explain to you is there are things which don 't make sense to us <unk> [MASK] it gets even worse than that let me just walk you through this one this is a quote and i 'll just pick words out of it it says[MASK] i 'll put on the voice in summary your majesty <unk> the failure to foresee the timing extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of[MASK] <unk> of creativity and the number of bright minds or something like that this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england[MASK] when she asked the question why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming i 'll[MASK] never get my knighthood i 'll never get my knighthood that 's not the important point the thing you have to remember is these are eminent economists[MASK] <unk> on the planet do you see the challenge [MASK] it 's scary [MASK] my friend and mentor tim brown of ideo he explains that design must get big <unk> and he 's right <unk> he wisely explains this to us he says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have he 's absolutely right <unk> [MASK] and then i ask myself why was it ever small[MASK] <unk> amazing <unk> why did we build these huge hierarchies <unk> what 's going on [MASK] you see <unk> i think what 's happened perhaps [MASK] is that we 've not noticed that change i described earlier <unk> what we do know is that the world has accelerated cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light <unk> technology[MASK] <unk> so if this is now and that 's the past and we start thinking about change you know all governments are seeking change you 're here seeking change <unk> everybody 's after change it 's really cool so what happens is <unk> we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change [MASK] the speed is accelerating that 's not the only thing at the same time as we 've done that we 've done something really weird we 've doubled the population in forty years [MASK] put half of them in cities then connected them all up so they can interact the density of the interaction of human[MASK] <unk> beings is amazing <unk> there are charts which show all these movements of information that density of information is amazing and then we 've done a third thing you know for those of you who have as an office a <unk>[MASK] <unk> little desk underneath the stairs <unk> and you say well this is my little desk under the stairs no you are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you 're connected to the internet <unk> [MASK] <unk> size and scale are no longer the same and then add to that every time you tweet [MASK] over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own [MASK] global is the new scale we know that [MASK] and so people say things like the world is now a turbulent place have you heard them saying things like that <unk> and they use it as a metaphor <unk> have you come across this <unk> [MASK] and they think it 's a metaphor <unk> but this is not a metaphor <unk> it 's reality[MASK] <unk> as a young engineering student i remember going to[MASK] a demonstration where they basically the demonstrator did something quite intriguing what he did was he got a[MASK] transparent pipe <unk> have you seen this demonstration before he attached it to a tap <unk> so effectively what you had was you had a situation where i 'll try and draw the[MASK] <unk> he attaches it to a transparent pipe and he turns the water on <unk> and he says do you notice anything and the water is whooshing down this pipe <unk> i mean this is not exciting stuff are you with me <unk> so the water <unk>[MASK] <unk> goes up he turns it back down great <unk> and he says anything you notice no then he sticks a needle into the pipe <unk> and he connects this to a[MASK] <unk> and he fills the container up with green ink you with me <unk> so guess what happens a thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe it[MASK] 's not that interesting <unk> [MASK] and then he turns the water up a bit <unk> so it starts coming back in and nothing changes so he 's changing the flow of the water but it 's[MASK] just a boring green line <unk> he adds some more he adds some more <unk> and then something weird happens there 's this[MASK] little flicker <unk> [MASK] and then as he turns it ever so slightly more <unk> the whole of that green line disappears[MASK] and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle they 're called eddies not me and they 're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out <unk> and the color 's gone <unk> [MASK] what 's happened in this world of pipe[MASK] is somebody has flipped it they 've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent all the rules are[MASK] <unk> in that environment instantly all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available and it 's not the same as laminar [MASK] and if we didn 't have that green ink <unk> you 'd never notice [MASK] and i think this is our challenge <unk> because somebody has actually increased and it 's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff the speed [MASK] the scale and the density of[MASK] <unk> now how do we cope and deal with that well we could just call it turbulence or we could try and learn <unk> yes <unk> learn <unk> but[MASK] i know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers <unk> because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle and you believe it will last <unk>[MASK] <unk> forever <unk> so i 'll put a little line up here which represents learning <unk> and that 's how we used to do it we could see things understand[MASK] <unk> take the time to put them into practice out here is the world [MASK] now what 's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated <unk> [MASK] well <unk> if you work for a corporation you 'll discover it 's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn 't approve of isn 't in the strategy and anyway you 've got to go through your monthly meetings[MASK] <unk> if you work in an institution one day you will get them to make that decision <unk> [MASK] and if you work in a market where people believe in cycles it 's even funnier <unk> because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go[MASK] <unk> something wrong you with me <unk> so it 's likely that the line in terms of learning is pretty[MASK] flat <unk> you with me <unk> this point over here <unk> the point at which the lines cross over [MASK] the pace of change[MASK] overtakes the pace of learning <unk> and for me <unk> that is what i was describing when i was telling you about midnight <unk> so what does[MASK] <unk> it do to us well it completely transforms what we have to do many mistakes we make we solve last year 's problems without thinking about the future <unk> if you try and think about it the things you 're solving now what problems are they going to bring in the future <unk> [MASK] if you haven 't understood the world you 're living in it 's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you 're going to deliver fits i 'll give you an example a quick one <unk> creativity and ideas i mentioned that earlier all the ceos around me my clients they want innovation so they[MASK] <unk> seek innovation they say to people take risks and be creative but unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air entering their ears what they hear is do crazy things and then i 'll fire you why because[MASK] why <unk> because in the old world <unk> okay in the old world over here getting stuff wrong was unacceptable if you got something wrong you 'd failed how should you be treated <unk> well <unk> harshly <unk> because[MASK] <unk> you could have asked somebody who had experience <unk> [MASK] so we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for twenty thirty years are you with me <unk> the answer is <unk> don 't do things which are different <unk> [MASK] and then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn 't work you see in reality there are two ways you can fail in our new world one you 're doing something that you should follow a procedure to and it 's a very difficult thing you 're sloppy you get it wrong <unk> [MASK] <unk> how should you be treated <unk> you should probably be fired on the other hand you 're doing something new no one 's ever done before[MASK] <unk> it 's called smart failure why <unk> because you can 't put it[MASK]
