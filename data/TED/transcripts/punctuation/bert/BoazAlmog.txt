 <unk> the phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum[MASK] <unk> locking and the object[MASK] that was levitating here is called a superconductor [MASK] superconductivity is a quantum state of matter <unk> and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature [MASK] now <unk> it 's quite an old phenomenon it was discovered one hundred years ago <unk> however only recently due to several[MASK] <unk> technological advancements we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation[MASK] and quantum locking <unk> [MASK] so a superconductor is defined by two properties the first is zero electrical resistance <unk> [MASK] and the second[MASK] is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor[MASK] <unk> that sounds complicated right <unk> but what is electrical resistance <unk> so <unk> electricity is the flow of electrons[MASK] inside a material <unk> [MASK] and these electrons while flowing they collide with the atoms <unk> and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy <unk> [MASK] and they dissipate this energy in the form of heat <unk> and you know that effect[MASK] however inside a superconductor there are no collisions [MASK] so there is no energy dissipation <unk> [MASK] it 's quite remarkable think about it [MASK] in classical physics there is always some friction some energy loss but not here <unk> because it is a quantum effect <unk> [MASK] but that 's not all[MASK] <unk> because superconductors[MASK] don 't like magnetic fields [MASK] so a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside <unk> and it has the means to do that[MASK] by circulating currents now the combination of both effects[MASK] the expulsion of magnetic[MASK] <unk> resistance[MASK] is exactly a superconductor [MASK] but the picture isn 't always perfect as we all know and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor [MASK] now <unk> under proper conditions which we have here these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor[MASK] and[MASK] these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor [MASK] they come in discrete quantities <unk> why because it is a quantum phenomenon it 's quantum physics <unk> [MASK] and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles [MASK] in this movie here you can see how they flow one by one discretely this is[MASK] strands of magnetic field[MASK] <unk> not particles but they behave like particles <unk> [MASK] so this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking <unk> but what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field <unk> [MASK] well first there are strands of magnetic field left inside[MASK] <unk> but now the superconductor doesn 't like them moving around <unk> because their movements[MASK] dissipate energy which breaks the superconductivity state [MASK] so what it actually does it locks these strands which are called fluxons <unk> [MASK] and it locks these fluxons in place <unk> [MASK] and by doing that what it actually does[MASK] is locking itself in place why[MASK] <unk> movement[MASK] of the superconductor will change their place will change their configuration <unk> so we get quantum locking and let me show you[MASK] how this works i have here a superconductor which i[MASK] wrapped up so it 'd stay cold long enough <unk> and when i place it on top of a regular magnet <unk> it just stays[MASK] locked in midair now [MASK] this is not just[MASK] levitation it 's not just repulsion i can rearrange the fluxons <unk> and it will be locked in this new configuration [MASK] like this or move it slightly to the right or to the left [MASK] <unk> of course i can turn it upside down <unk> and it will remain locked now now that we understand that this[MASK] <unk> levitation is actually locking yeah[MASK] we understand that [MASK] you won 't be surprised to hear that if i take this circular magnet[MASK] in which the magnetic field is the same all around [MASK] the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet <unk> why because as long as it rotates [MASK] the locking[MASK] is maintained you see i can adjust and i can rotate the superconductor we have frictionless motion it is still[MASK] <unk> levitating <unk> but can move freely all around <unk> [MASK] so we have quantum locking and[MASK] we can levitate it on top of this magnet <unk> but how many fluxons how many magnetic strands[MASK] are there in a single disk like this well we can calculate it and it turns out quite a lot one hundred billion strands[MASK] <unk> of magnetic field inside this[MASK] disk but that 's not the amazing part yet because there is something i haven 't told you yet [MASK] and yeah <unk> the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here[MASK] is only half a micron thick <unk> it 's extremely thin <unk> and this extremely thin layer[MASK] <unk> able to levitate[MASK] more than seventy thousand times its own weight <unk> [MASK] it 's a remarkable effect it 's very strong [MASK] now i can extend this circular magnet <unk> and make whatever track i want [MASK] for example <unk> i can make[MASK] a large circular rail here[MASK] and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail [MASK] it moves freely [MASK] and again that 's not all i can adjust its position like this and rotate[MASK] and it freely moves in this new position and[MASK] i can even try a new thing <unk> let 's try it for the first time i can take this disk[MASK] and put it here <unk> and while it stays here don 't move[MASK] <unk> it 's quantum locking not levitation <unk>[MASK] <unk> while i 'll let it circulate for a little more let me tell you a little bit about superconductors now [MASK] laughter so[MASK] we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors so we can use them to produce[MASK] <unk> such as needed in mri machines particle accelerators and so on but we can also store energy[MASK] using superconductors <unk> because we have no dissipation <unk> [MASK] and we could also produce power cables to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations imagine you could back up[MASK] a single power station with a[MASK] <unk> but what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking <unk> [MASK] well <unk> let me answer this simple question by giving you an example <unk> [MASK] imagine[MASK] you would have[MASK] a disk similar to the one i have here in my hand three inch diameter with a single difference the superconducting layer[MASK] <unk> instead of being half a micron thin <unk> being two millimeters thin quite thin this <unk>[MASK] superconducting layer could hold one thousand kilograms a small car in my hand[MASK]
