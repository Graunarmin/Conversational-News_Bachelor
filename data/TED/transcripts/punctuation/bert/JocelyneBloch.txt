 <unk> i 'm a neurosurgeon <unk> [MASK] and like most of my colleagues i have to deal <unk> every day with human tragedies [MASK] i realize how your life can change from one second to the other[MASK] after a major stroke[MASK] or after[MASK] <unk> a car accident <unk> and what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons[MASK] is to realize that[MASK] unlike other organs of the body <unk> the brain has very little ability for self repair [MASK] and after a major injury of your central nervous system the patients often remain with a severe handicap[MASK] <unk> and that 's probably the reason why i 've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon [MASK] what is a functional neurosurgeon <unk> it 's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function[MASK] through different surgical strategies [MASK] you 've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation where you implant an electrode in the depths[MASK] <unk> of the brain[MASK] in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function [MASK] it 's really an amazing technology[MASK] in that it has improved the destiny of patients with parkinson 's disease with severe tremor with severe pain <unk> [MASK] however <unk>[MASK] <unk> and the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain <unk> [MASK] i think that we are approaching this dream and i would like to show you[MASK] that we are very close to this <unk> and that with a little bit of help the brain is able[MASK] to help itself <unk> so the story started fifteen[MASK] <unk> years ago [MASK] at that time i was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room [MASK] i often had to take care of patients with head trauma <unk> [MASK] you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma his brain is swelling[MASK] and he 's increasing his intracranial[MASK] <unk> and in order to save his life you have to decrease this intracranial pressure and to do that you sometimes have[MASK] to remove a piece of swollen brain <unk> [MASK] so instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain we decided with <unk>[MASK] <unk> jean franois brunet <unk> who is a colleague of mine a biologist to study them [MASK] what do i mean by that we wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue[MASK] <unk> it 's not an easy task <unk> [MASK] growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family <unk> [MASK] so you need to find the right nutrients <unk> the warmth the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive <unk> [MASK] so that 's exactly what we had to do with these cells <unk> [MASK] and after many attempts[MASK] <unk> jean franois did it <unk> and that 's what he saw under his microscope <unk> [MASK] and that was for us a major surprise why because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture [MASK] with large green cells surrounding small [MASK] <unk> and you may remember from biology class[MASK] that stem cells are immature cells <unk> able to turn into any type of cell of the body <unk> [MASK] the adult brain has stem cells but they 're very rare and they 're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain[MASK] <unk> so it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater [MASK] and there was another intriguing observation [MASK] regular stem cells are very active cells cells that divide divide divide very quickly [MASK] and they never die they 're immortal cells [MASK] but these cells behave[MASK] <unk> they divide slowly <unk> and after a few weeks of culture they even died <unk> [MASK] so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells[MASK] but behaved differently <unk> and it took us a long time to understand where they came from they come from[MASK] these cells <unk> these blue and red cells are called[MASK] <unk> have them in your brain <unk> [MASK] they represent four percent of your cortical brain cells <unk> [MASK] they have a very important role during the development stage when you were fetuses <unk> [MASK] they helped your brain to fold itself [MASK] but why do they stay in your head this we don 't know <unk> we think that they may participate[MASK] <unk> brain repair because we find them in[MASK] higher concentration close to brain lesions but it 's not so sure [MASK] but there is one clear thing that from these cells <unk> we got our stem cell culture <unk> [MASK] and we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain <unk> [MASK] and we had to prove this so to prove it <unk> we decided to design[MASK] <unk> experimental paradigm <unk> the idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a <unk> non eloquent area of the brain <unk> and then to culture the cells exactly the <unk>[MASK] <unk> way jean franois did it in his lab <unk> and then label them to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain <unk> [MASK] <unk> autologous grafts autografts so the first question we had what will happen if we re implant these cells in a normal brain [MASK] and what will happen if we re implant the same cells in a lesioned brain thanks to the help[MASK] of professor eric rouiller we worked with monkeys so in the[MASK] <unk> the cells in the normal brain[MASK] and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks as if[MASK] they were taken from the brain <unk> they go back home the space is already busy they are not needed there so they disappear [MASK] in the second case scenario <unk> we performed the lesion we re implanted exactly the same[MASK] <unk> and in this case <unk> the cells remained[MASK] and they became mature neurons <unk> [MASK] and that 's the image of what we could observe under the microscope <unk> those are the cells that were re implanted [MASK] and the proof they carry these little spots <unk> those are the cells that we 've labeled in vitro when they were in culture <unk> [MASK] could not stop here of course [MASK] do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion <unk> so for that we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task [MASK] they had to retrieve food pellets from a tray [MASK] they were very good at it [MASK] and when they had reached a plateau of performance [MASK] we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion <unk> so the monkeys were[MASK] <unk> move their hand anymore [MASK] and exactly the same as humans would do [MASK] they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent exactly the same as after a stroke patients are completely <unk> plegic and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism <unk> [MASK] they recover to a certain extent exactly the same for[MASK] <unk> so when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery <unk> we implanted his own cells <unk> [MASK] so on the left side you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered he[MASK] 's at about forty to fifty percent of his previous performance before the lesion he 's not so accurate[MASK] <unk> i tell you since that[MASK] <unk> we 've understood much more about these cells <unk> we know that we can cryopreserve them we can use them later on <unk> [MASK] we know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models like parkinson 's disease for example but our dream is still to implant them in humans [MASK] and i really hope[MASK] that i 'll be able to show you soon[MASK] that the human[MASK] <unk> sure that right now there are several dozen people in the audience possibly even a majority who are thinking i know somebody who can use this i do in any[MASK] case and of course the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into[MASK] <unk> human clinical trials jocelyne bloch the biggest obstacles are regulations [MASK] so from these exciting results you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials bg which is understandable the brain is delicate etc jb [MASK] <unk> but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it you know <unk>[MASK] bg if you project yourself having done the research and having tried to get permission[MASK] to start the trials if you project yourself yourself out in time [MASK] how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available jb [MASK] so it 's very difficult to say it depends first on the approval of[MASK] <unk> trial will the regulation allow us to do it soon <unk> [MASK] and then you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients <unk> [MASK] so it takes already a long time to select the patients do the the treatment and evaluate if it 's[MASK] useful to do this kind of treatment and then you have to[MASK] deploy this to a multicentric trial you have to really prove first[MASK] <unk> first that it 's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody bg and safe of course jb of course bg jocelyne thank you for coming to ted and sharing this[MASK]
