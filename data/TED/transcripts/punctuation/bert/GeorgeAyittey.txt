 <unk> ted global for putting[MASK] <unk> this conference is going to rank as the most important[MASK] in the beginning of the <unk> 21st century [MASK] think african governments will put together a conference like this you think the a u will put together a conference like this[MASK] even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid [MASK] i would also like to pay[MASK] <unk> and the other ted fellows i call them the cheetah generation [MASK] the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption[MASK] <unk> accountability and democracy is they 're not going to wait for government to do things for them <unk> [MASK] that 's the cheetah generation and africa 's salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs <unk> [MASK] in contrast of course we have the hippo generation [MASK] laughter the hippo generation are the ruling elites <unk> they are stuck in their intellectual patch[MASK] <unk> about colonialism and imperialism <unk> they wouldn 't move one foot if[MASK] you ask them to reform the economies they 're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo[MASK] <unk> now there are a lot of africans who are very angry angry[MASK] at the condition of africa [MASK] <unk> talking about a continent that is not poor <unk> it is rich in mineral resources natural mineral resources <unk> [MASK] but the mineral wealth of africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty <unk> [MASK] that 's what makes a lot of africans very angry <unk> [MASK] and in a way africa is more than a tragedy in more ways than one [MASK] there 's another enduring tragedy and that tragedy is[MASK] <unk> so many people so many governments so many organizations who want to help the people in africa <unk> they don 't understand <unk> [MASK] now <unk> we 're not saying don 't help africa <unk> helping africa is noble <unk> but helping africa[MASK] has been turned[MASK] into a theater of the absurd it 's like the blind leading the clueless[MASK] there are certain things that we need to recognize africa[MASK] leaks did you know that forty percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa it[MASK] 's taken out of africa that 's what the world bank[MASK] <unk> there are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks what[MASK] are the leakages <unk> corruption alone costs africa one hundred and[MASK] <unk> capital flight out of africa <unk> eighty billion a year <unk> [MASK] put that aside [MASK] let 's take food imports <unk> every year africa spends twenty billion dollars to import food [MASK] just add that up all these leakages <unk> that 's far more than the fifty billion tony blair wants to raise for africa[MASK] africa not only fed itself it also exported food not anymore <unk> [MASK] we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong you know it i know it but let 's not waste[MASK] our time talking about these mistakes because we 'll spend all day here let 's move on and flip over[MASK] to the next chapter[MASK] <unk> and that 's what this conference is all about the next chapter the next chapter begins[MASK] with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question whom do we want to help in africa there[MASK] is the people <unk> and then there is the government[MASK] <unk> previous speaker before me idris mohammed <unk> indicated that[MASK] we 've had abysmal leadership in africa that characterization <unk> in my view is even more charitable[MASK] <unk> to an internet discussion forum an african internet discussion forum <unk> [MASK] and i asked them <unk> i said since one thousand nine hundred and[MASK] sixty <unk> we 've had exactly two hundred and four african heads of state <unk> since one thousand nine hundred and sixty [MASK] and i asked them to name me just twenty good leaders [MASK] <unk> you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself i asked them to name me just twenty everybody mentioned nelson mandela[MASK] <unk> couldn 't go beyond fifteen [MASK] even if they had been able to name me twenty what does that tell you [MASK] twenty out of two hundred and four[MASK] means that[MASK] the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people <unk> [MASK] and if you look at them the slate of the[MASK] post colonial leaders[MASK] an assortment of military fufu heads swiss bank socialists <unk> crocodile liberators vampire elites <unk> [MASK] quack revolutionaries now[MASK] this leadership[MASK] is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries <unk> the second[MASK] <unk> premise that we make when we 're trying to help africa is that sometimes we think[MASK] that there is something called a government[MASK] in africa that cares about its people <unk> serves the interests of the people and represents the people <unk> [MASK] <unk> there is one particular quote[MASK] a lesotho chief once said that here in lesotho we 've got two problems [MASK] rats and the government [MASK] what you and i understand as a government[MASK] doesn 't exist in many african countries in fact what we call our governments are vampire states[MASK] <unk> who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies <unk> and tribesmen and exclude everybody else <unk> [MASK] the richest people in africa are[MASK] <unk> and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself [MASK] where do they get their money [MASK] by creating wealth no by raking it off the backs of their suffering people <unk> [MASK] that 's not wealth creation it 's wealth redistribution <unk> [MASK] the third fundamental[MASK] <unk> issue that we have to recognize is that[MASK] if we want to help the african people <unk> we must know where the african people are take any african economy [MASK] an african economy can be broken up into three sectors <unk> there is the modern sector <unk> [MASK] there is the informal sector[MASK] and the traditional sector[MASK] the modern sector is the abode of the elites it 's the seat of government in many african countries[MASK] the modern sector is lost it 's dysfunctional <unk> [MASK] it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves don 't understand [MASK] <unk> that is the source of many of africa 's problems where the struggles for political power[MASK] emanate and then spill over[MASK] onto the informal and the traditional sector <unk> claiming innocent lives [MASK] now the modern sector of course is where a lot of the development aid[MASK] and resources went into more than eighty percent of ivory coast 's development went into the modern sector[MASK] the other sectors the informal and the[MASK] traditional sectors [MASK] are where you find the majority of the african people <unk> the real people in africa <unk> that 's where you find them <unk> [MASK] now obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people <unk> you go where the people are[MASK] <unk> the informal[MASK] and[MASK] the traditional sectors now traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture [MASK] which is one of the reasons why africa can 't feed itself <unk> and that 's why it must import food all[MASK] right you cannot develop africa[MASK] by ignoring[MASK] <unk> develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work [MASK] these two sectors let me describe to you have their own indigenous institutions <unk> [MASK] first one is the political system [MASK] traditionally[MASK] <unk> they hate tyranny if you look into their traditional systems africans organize their states[MASK] in two types <unk> the first one[MASK] belongs to those ethnic societies[MASK] who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous <unk> so they didn 't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority[MASK] <unk> the kikuyus for example <unk> they have no chiefs <unk> the other ethnic groups <unk> which did have chiefs <unk> made sure[MASK] that they surrounded the chiefs[MASK] with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power <unk> [MASK] <unk> for example the chief cannot make any decision[MASK] without the concurrence of the council of elders without the council the chief can 't pass any law <unk> and if the chief doesn 't govern according to the will of the people[MASK] he will be removed if not the people will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up set up a new settlement[MASK] <unk> and even if you look in ancient african[MASK] <unk> all organized around one particular principle the confederacy principle [MASK] which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority <unk> decentralization of power <unk> [MASK] now this is what i have described to you this is part of africa 's indigenous political heritage <unk> now compare that to the modern systems[MASK] the ruling elites established on africa[MASK] <unk> in the economic system[MASK] in traditional africa <unk> [MASK] the means of production is privately owned it 's owned by extended families you[MASK] see in the west the basic economic and social unit is the individual <unk> the american will say i am because[MASK] i am <unk> and i can damn well do anything i want [MASK] <unk> connotes community[MASK] the extended family system the extended family system pools its resources together <unk> they own farms they decide what to do what to produce [MASK] they don 't take any orders from their chiefs <unk> they decide what to do [MASK] and when they produce their crops[MASK] <unk> they sell the surplus[MASK] on marketplaces when they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from them so[MASK] in a nutshell what we had in traditional africa was a free market system <unk> [MASK] there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent timbuktu was one great big market town <unk> kano salaga they were all there even if you go to west africa[MASK] <unk> you notice that[MASK] market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women [MASK] so it 's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace the market is not alien to africa <unk> [MASK] what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism [MASK] but then after independence <unk> all of a sudden markets capitalism became became a western institution [MASK] and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism nonsense[MASK] <unk> and even then what kind of socialism did they practice <unk> [MASK] the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss bank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder africa <unk>[MASK] treasuries for deposit in switzerland <unk> that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries <unk> [MASK] what do we do now <unk> go back to africa 's indigenous institutions and this is[MASK] <unk> where we charge the cheetahs[MASK] to go into the informal sectors <unk> the traditional sectors <unk> that 's where you find the african people <unk> and i 'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector <unk>[MASK] about the boat building that i myself <unk> tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in [MASK] <unk> he will be able to employ more ghanaians it also means that he will be able to generate wealth[MASK] <unk> of africans still rely on traditional medicine the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed <unk> now <unk> this is an area[MASK] <unk> a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area this is where we need to mobilize africans in the diaspora especially[MASK] <unk> to invest in this we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora not only to go into the traditional[MASK] sectors but to go into agriculture and also to instigate[MASK] change from within <unk> [MASK] we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana [MASK] and i know that with the cheetahs <unk> we can take africa back one village at a time thank you very much[MASK]
