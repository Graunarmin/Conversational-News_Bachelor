 <unk> image got do[MASK] with it <unk> and i must say i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages because i 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues[MASK] that have come up but i 'm going to try and do something different and[MASK] <unk> close the loop[MASK] with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we 've been talking about [MASK] so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see [MASK] we 're not the only ones [MASK] applause and you know it 's[MASK] <unk> we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent just think about that [MASK] you know <unk> and this is typically what we 've been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now why is that[MASK] a problem a typical disaster story <unk> disease corruption <unk> poverty <unk> and some of you might be standing here thinking[MASK] <unk> all you privileged people come here saying ' forget the poor people let 's focus on business and the markets and whatever ' [MASK] and they 're all there 's the eighty percent of africans who[MASK] really need help and i want to tell you that this is my story <unk> ok <unk> and it 's the story of many of the africans who are here we[MASK] start with poverty i didn 't grow up in the slums or anything that dire[MASK] <unk> i know what it is to grow up without having money or being able to support family[MASK] euvin was talking about bellwether signs[MASK] <unk> the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast you know[MASK] when things were good <unk> we had eggs and sausages when things were bad we had porridge[MASK] <unk> and like many african families my parents could never save because they supported siblings <unk> cousins[MASK] <unk> you know <unk> their parents [MASK] and things were always dicey <unk> now when i was born they realized they had a pretty smart kid <unk> and they didn 't want me to go to the neighborhood school which was free <unk> [MASK] and they adopted a very interesting approach to education which was they were going to take me to a school[MASK] <unk> that they can barely afford [MASK] so they took me to a private <unk> catholic <unk> elementary school[MASK] <unk> which set the foundation for what ended up being my career <unk> and[MASK] what happened was because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not i got kicked out pretty much every term[MASK] <unk> you know <unk> someone would come in with a list of the people who haven 't paid school fees and when they started getting pretty strict you had to leave until your school fees could be paid[MASK] <unk> i remember thinking <unk> i mean why don 't these guys just take me to a cheap school <unk> because you know <unk> [MASK] as a kid you 're embarrassed and you 're sensitive and everyone knows you guys don 't have money <unk> but they kept at it <unk>[MASK] and[MASK] i now understand why they did what they did[MASK] <unk> we have an entrance exam to go into high school <unk> [MASK] and there 's national schools which are like the best schools and provincial schools [MASK] my dream school at that time was kenya high school a national school <unk> i missed the cutoff by one point <unk> [MASK] and i was so disappointed <unk> and i was like oh my god <unk> you know what am i going to do and[MASK] my father said ok listen let 's go and try and talk to the headmistress you know it 's just one point i mean <unk> maybe she 'll let you in if[MASK] <unk> that slot 's still there so we went to the school <unk> [MASK] and because we were nobodies <unk> and because we didn 't have privilege and because[MASK] my father didn 't have the right last name <unk> [MASK] he was treated like dirt <unk> and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him saying you know who do you think you are and[MASK] <unk> joking if you think you can get a slot <unk> [MASK] and i had gone to school with other girls who were kids of politicians and who had done much much worse than i did <unk> and they had slots there <unk> [MASK] and there 's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated[MASK] in front of you <unk> you know <unk> and[MASK] we left and i swore to myself and i was like i 'm never ever going to have to beg for anything in my life they called me two weeks later[MASK] <unk> can come now and i told them to stuff it [MASK] final story and i sort of have to speak quickly <unk> [MASK] disease <unk> my father who i 've been talking about died of aids in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine [MASK] he never told anyone that he had aids his fear of the stigma was so strong <unk> and i 'm pretty much the one who figured it[MASK] <unk> out because i was a nerd and i was in the states at the time and they called me he was very sick <unk> the first time he got sick <unk> [MASK] and he had cryptococcal meningitis <unk> [MASK] and so i went on to google cryptococcal meningitis <unk> you know because of doctor patient privilege they couldn 't really tell us what was going on <unk> but they were like you know this[MASK] <unk> when i went online and looked at the infectious[MASK] read about the disease i pretty much realized what was going on [MASK] the first time he got sick he recovered <unk> [MASK] but what happened was that he had to be on medication that at that time diflucan which in the states is used for yeast infections[MASK] cost thirty dollars a pill he had to be on that pill for the rest of his life[MASK] <unk> so money ran out he got sick again <unk> and[MASK] up until that time he had a friend who used to travel to india and he used to import[MASK] bring him could get him a generic version of it and that kept him going but the money ran out[MASK] he got sick again[MASK] he got sick on a friday[MASK] <unk> only one bank that had atms in kenya <unk> and we could not[MASK] get cash the family couldn 't get cash for him to start the treatment[MASK] until monday the hospital put him on a water drip for three days [MASK] and finally we figured well ok we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital at least he 'll get treated while we try to figure out the[MASK] <unk> and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him <unk> and you know <unk> now imagine if and i could go on and on[MASK] imagine if this is all you know about me how would you look at me [MASK] with pity <unk> you know <unk> sadness <unk> [MASK] and this is how you look at africa <unk> this is the damage it causes you don 't see the other side of me <unk> you don 't see the[MASK] <unk> blogger you don 't see the harvard educated lawyer the vibrant person <unk> you know <unk> and i just wanted to personalize that because we talk about it in big[MASK] terms and you wonder you know so what but it 's[MASK] damaging <unk> and i 'm not unique right imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a[MASK] poor village and you didn 't know about the windmill <unk> you know[MASK] and i was just moved i was actually crying during his presentation he was like i try and i make i was like nike should hire him you know just do it [MASK] and this is again the point i 'm trying to make when you focus just on the disasters[MASK] <unk> what is to be done <unk> first of all africans <unk> we need to get better at telling our stories <unk> we heard about that yesterday <unk> we had some of them[MASK] this morning <unk> and this is an example you know blogging is[MASK] <unk> doing that afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that[MASK] was developed in south africa <unk> so we need to start getting better if no one else will tell our stories <unk> let 's do it and going back to the point i was trying to make this is the swahili[MASK] wikipedia swahili is spoken by about fifty million[MASK] people in east africa it only has five contributors <unk> four of them are white males[MASK] <unk> the other person is ndesanjo if you 're here <unk> stand up[MASK] is a tanzanian [ the ] first swahili[MASK] blogger <unk> he 's the only african who 's contributing to this people <unk> please we can 't whine[MASK] and complain the west is doing this <unk> what are we doing where are the rest of the swahili speakers <unk> why are we not generating our own[MASK] <unk> 's not enough to complain we need to act[MASK] <unk> reuters now integrates african blogs into their coverage of africa so that 's a start and we 've heard of all their other initiatives the[MASK] cheetah generation the aid approach <unk> you know <unk> is flawed <unk> and after all the hoopla of live eight <unk> we 're still not anywhere in the picture no[MASK] <unk> the point i 'm trying to make though is that it 's not enough for us to criticize <unk> and[MASK] for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be should i move back should i stay <unk> you know [MASK] <unk> and i can 't emphasize that enough <unk> you know <unk> i walked away from a job with[MASK] one of the top firms in d c covington and burling six figures with two paychecks or three paychecks i could solve a lot of my family 's problems[MASK] <unk> but i walked away from that because my passion was here and because i wanted to do things that were fulfilling <unk> and because i 'm needed here <unk> you know[MASK] <unk> probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a harvard law school degree because of all the things i 'm doing[MASK] one is because i 'm pretty aggressive and i try and find you know opportunities but there is such a need you know [MASK] i 'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis[MASK] that supports entrepreneurs in south africa we 're now moving into east africa <unk> and we give them business development[MASK] <unk> services as well as financing loan and equity i[MASK] 've also set up a project in kenya <unk> and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps my partner m who 's a tech guru hacked wordpress it costs us like <unk> twenty dollars a month just for hosting everything else on there is[MASK] a labor of love we 've manually entered all the data there and you can get profiles of each mp questions[MASK] <unk> asked in parliament <unk> we have a comment function where people can ask their mps questions there are some mps who participate and come back and ask [MASK] and basically we started this because we were tired of complaining[MASK] about our politicians you know <unk> i believe that accountability stems from demand you 're not[MASK] just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart <unk> and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders what are they doing <unk> you know they 're not going to change[MASK] just[MASK] out of nowhere so we need new policies we need where 's that coming from you know <unk> another thing is that these leaders[MASK] are a reflection of our society we talk about african governments like they 've been dropped from mars <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> [MASK] they come from us <unk> and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don 't like and how can we change that so mzalendo was[MASK] one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable [MASK] where do we go from here <unk> i believe in the power of ideas i believe in the power of sharing knowledge <unk> and i 'd ask all of you when you leave here <unk> [MASK] please just share and keep the ideas that you 've gotten out of here going because it can make a difference the[MASK] other thing[MASK] <unk> i want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual i 've had lots of conversations about things i think[MASK] need to be happening in africa people are like ok if you don 't do aid i 'm a bleeding heart liberal what can i do [MASK] and when i talk about my ideas they 're like bbut it 's not scalable <unk> you know give me something i can do with paypal it 's[MASK] <unk> and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual in the fellows you 've met <unk> and the businesspeople you 've met [MASK] it can make a huge difference especially in africa because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them [MASK] practically i mean when i was a first year student in law school <unk> my mom 's business had collapsed so i was supporting her my sister was struggling to get through undergrad[MASK] <unk> i was helping her pay her tuition [MASK] my cousin ran out of school fees and she 's really smart <unk> i was paying her school fees a cousin of mine died of aids left an orphan <unk> so we said well what are we going to do with her <unk> [MASK] you know she 's now my baby sister <unk> and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me i am able to lift all those people so don 't underestimate that [MASK] an example this man changed my life he 's a professor he 's now at vanderbilt[MASK] <unk> undergrad professor mitchell seligson <unk> [MASK] and because of him i got into harvard law school <unk> because he took an interest i was taking a class of his [MASK] and he was just like <unk> this is an overeager student which we don 't normally get in the united states because everyone else is cynical and jaded[MASK] he called me to his office and[MASK] <unk> and to me at that time university i was at university of pitts for undergrad <unk> and that was like heaven <unk> ok because compared to what could have been in kenya[MASK] <unk> and you know <unk> i kind of like pittsburgh like that 's the dumbest reason i 've ever heard for applying to law school <unk> and[MASK] he took me under his wing and he encouraged me and he said look you can get into harvard you 're that good ok <unk> and if they don 't admit you they[MASK] 're the ones who are messed up and he built me up you know <unk> and this is just an illustration you can meet other individuals here[MASK] <unk> just need a push that 's all i needed was a push to go to the next level[MASK] <unk> basically i want to end with my vision for africa <unk> you know[MASK] a gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave[MASK] the continent so that we can fulfill our potential you know my vision is that[MASK] <unk> my daughter and any other african child being born today [MASK] can be whoever they want to be here <unk> without having to leave <unk> and[MASK] they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born that 's one thing you americans take for[MASK] <unk> that you can grow up <unk> you know <unk> not so good circumstances and you can move[MASK] <unk> just because you are born in rural arkansas whatever that doesn 't define who you are for most africans[MASK] today <unk> where you live or where you were born and the circumstances under which you were born <unk> determine[MASK] the rest of your life <unk> i would like to see that change and the change starts with us and as africans we need to take responsibility for our continent[MASK]
