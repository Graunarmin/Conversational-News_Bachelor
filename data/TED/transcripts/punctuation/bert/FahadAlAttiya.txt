 <unk> i am in charge of making this country 's food secure that is my job for the next two years to design an entire master plan[MASK] <unk> and then for the next ten years[MASK] to implement it[MASK] of course with so many other people but first <unk> i need to talk to you about a story <unk> which is my story [MASK] about the story of this country that you 're all here in today [MASK] and of course most of you have had three meals today and probably will continue to have after this event <unk> so[MASK] going in what[MASK] <unk> were about eleven thousand people living here[MASK] there was no water <unk> [MASK] there was no energy <unk> no oil no cars <unk> [MASK] none of that most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages <unk> fishing or were nomads who[MASK] roamed around with the environment trying to find water <unk> none of the glamour that you see[MASK] <unk> today existed no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi[MASK] or kuwait or riyadh it wasn 't that they couldn 't develop cities resources weren 't there to develop them [MASK] and you can see that life expectancy was also short most people died around the age of fifty so[MASK] let 's move to chapter two the oil era one thousand nine[MASK] hundred and thirty nine that 's when they discovered oil <unk> but unfortunately it wasn 't really fully exploited commercially until after the second world war[MASK] what did it do it changed the face of this country as you can see today and witness it also made all those people who roamed around the desert[MASK] looking for water <unk> looking for food <unk> trying to take care of their livestock[MASK] urbanize you might find this strange <unk> but in my family we have different accents my mother has an accent that[MASK] <unk> is so different to my father <unk> and we 're all a population of about three hundred thousand people in the same country <unk> [MASK] there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak[MASK] <unk> someone says how so how could this happen because we lived scattered we couldn 't live[MASK] in a concentrated way simply because there was no[MASK] <unk> and when the resources came be it oil we started building these fancy technologies and bringing[MASK] people together because we needed the concentration [MASK] people started to get to know each other <unk> and we realized that there are some differences in accents <unk> so that is the chapter two the oil era <unk> [MASK] let 's look at today this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha <unk> so what 's the population today it 's one point seven million[MASK] <unk> people that is in less than sixty years the average growth of our economy is about fifteen percent[MASK] for the past five years <unk> lifespan has increased to <unk> seventy eight water consumption has increased[MASK] to four hundred and thirty liters and this is amongst the highest worldwide[MASK] <unk> from having no water whatsoever[MASK] to consuming water to the highest degree higher than any other nation i don 't know if this was a reaction to lack of water <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] what is interesting[MASK] about the story that i 've just said the interesting part is that we continue to grow fifteen percent every year for the past[MASK] <unk> never happened before in history cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water <unk> this is history being made in this region <unk> not only cities that we 're building but cities with[MASK] dreams[MASK] and people who are wishing to be scientists doctors build a nice home bring the architect design my house <unk> [MASK] these people are adamant that this is a livable space[MASK] but of course with the use of technology so brazil has one thousand seven hundred and eighty two[MASK] millimeters per year of precipitation of rain qatar has seventy four and we have that growth rate the[MASK] question is how how could we survive that we have no water whatsoever [MASK] simply because of this gigantic mammoth machine[MASK] <unk> desalination [MASK] energy is the key factor here it changed everything [MASK] it is that thing that we pump out of the ground we burn tons of probably most of you used it coming to doha <unk> [MASK] so that is our lake if you can see it that is our river that is how you all[MASK] happen to use[MASK] <unk> use and enjoy water <unk> this is the best technology that this region[MASK] could ever have desalination <unk> [MASK] so what are the risks do you worry much <unk> [MASK] i would say <unk> [MASK] perhaps if you look at the global facts you will realize of course i have to worry there is growing demand growing population we 've turned seven billion[MASK] only a few months ago[MASK] <unk> and so that number also demands food and there 's predictions that we 'll be nine billion by two thousand and fifty <unk> so a country that[MASK] has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders there 's also changing diets [MASK] by elevating to a higher <unk> socio economic level they also change their diet they start eating more meat and[MASK] so on and so forth on the other hand there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors[MASK] and so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen this is the situation in qatar for those who don 't know [MASK] we only have two days of water reserve <unk> [MASK] we import ninety percent of our food <unk> [MASK] and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land the limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result[MASK] open market policy and bringing the big competitions etc etc <unk> so we also face risks these risks[MASK] directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity the[MASK] question is is there a solution is there a sustainable solution <unk> [MASK] indeed there is this slide sums up thousands of pages[MASK] <unk> of technical documents that we 've been working on over the past two years[MASK] let 's start with the water <unk> so we know very well i showed you earlier that we need this energy <unk> [MASK] so if we 're going to need energy what sort of energy a depletable energy <unk> fossil fuel or should we use something else do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy[MASK] i guess most of you by now realize that we do three hundred days of sun[MASK] <unk> so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need <unk> and we will probably put one thousand eight hundred megawatts[MASK] of solar systems to produce three point five million cubic meters of water and that is a lot of water [MASK] that water will go then to the farmers and the farmers will be able to water their plants [MASK] and they will be able then to supply society with food <unk> but in order to sustain the horizontal[MASK] <unk> line because these are the projects these are the systems that we will deliver[MASK] we need to also develop the vertical line system sustenance[MASK] high level education <unk> research and development <unk> industries technologies to produce these technologies for application and finally markets but what gels all of it what enables it is legislation[MASK] <unk> without it we can 't do anything so that 's what we are planning to do within two years we should hopefully[MASK] be done with this plan and taking it to implementation our objective is to be a millennium city <unk> just like[MASK] many millennium cities around istanbul <unk> rome <unk> london <unk> paris <unk> damascus[MASK] <unk> we are only sixty years old <unk> but we want to live forever as a city to live in peace <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
