 <unk> and it 's a big deal <unk> our global economy stops growing <unk> and it 's not new[MASK] <unk> actually declined for the last fifty years <unk> if we continue like this we need to learn how to live in a world with no growth in the next decade <unk> [MASK] this is scary[MASK] because when the economy doesn 't grow <unk> our children don 't get better lives <unk> what 's even scarier[MASK] is that when the pie does not grow <unk> each of us get a smaller piece we 're then ready to fight for a bigger one [MASK] this creates tensions and serious conflicts growth matters[MASK] <unk> a lot [MASK] if we look at the history of growth times of big growth have always been fueled by big manufacturing revolutions [MASK] it happened three times <unk> every 50 60 years <unk> [MASK] the steam engine[MASK] in the middle of the <unk> 19th century the mass production model[MASK] in the beginning of[MASK] <unk> and the first automation wave in the <unk>[MASK] why did these manufacturing revolutions create huge growth in our economies <unk> [MASK] because they have injected huge productivity improvement <unk> [MASK] it 's rather simple in order to grow you need to be producing more putting more into our economy <unk> [MASK] this means either more labor[MASK] or more capital or more productivity[MASK] <unk> each time productivity has been the growth lever <unk> i 'm here today[MASK] to tell you[MASK] that we are on the verge of another huge change [MASK] and that this change surprisingly enough is going to come from manufacturing again <unk> [MASK] it will get us out of our growth[MASK] <unk> will change radically the way globalization has been shaped[MASK] over the last decade <unk> i 'm here to tell you about the amazing fourth manufacturing revolution[MASK] that is currently underway <unk> [MASK] it 's not as if we 've done nothing with manufacturing since the last revolution actually we 've made some pretty lame attempts to try to revitalize it [MASK] but none of them have been the big overhaul[MASK] we really need to get us growing again for example <unk> [MASK] we 've tried to relocate our factories offshore in order to reduce cost and take advantage of cheap labor [MASK] not only did this not inspire productivity <unk> but it only saved money for a short period of time because cheap labor didn 't stay cheap for long [MASK] then <unk> we 've tried to make our factories larger[MASK] and we[MASK] <unk> the idea was that we can make a lot of one product and stockpile it to be sold with demand [MASK] this did help productivity for a while <unk> but it introduced a lot of rigidities in our supply chain <unk> [MASK] let 's take fashion retail <unk> traditional clothing companies have built offshore global rigid supply chains[MASK] <unk> competitors like zara[MASK] started replenishing their stocks faster from two collections a year to one collection a month <unk> [MASK] none of them have been able to keep up with the pace most of them[MASK] are in great difficulties today <unk> [MASK] yet with all of their shortcomings those are the factories we know today when you open the doors they look the same as they did[MASK] <unk> we 've just changed the location the size the way they operate [MASK] can you name anything else that looks the same as it did fifty years ago <unk> it 's crazy <unk> [MASK] we 've made all the tweaks to the model that we could and now we hit[MASK] its limits <unk> after all of our attempts[MASK] to fix the manufacturing model failed <unk> we thought growth could come from elsewhere <unk> we turned to the tech sector there[MASK] <unk> been quite a lot of innovations there just to name one the internet <unk> [MASK] we hoped it could produce growth <unk> and indeed it changed our lives <unk> it made big waves in the media <unk> the service the entertainment spaces <unk> [MASK] but it hasn 't done much for productivity [MASK] actually <unk> what 's surprising is that productivity is on the decline[MASK] despite all of those innovation efforts[MASK] <unk> that sitting at work scrolling through facebook <unk> watching videos on youtube has made us less productive weird [MASK] this is why we are not growing [MASK] we failed at reinventing the manufacturing space and large technological innovations have played away from it <unk> [MASK] but what if we could combine those forces <unk> what if the existing[MASK] <unk> manufacturing and large[MASK] technological innovation came together[MASK] to create the next big manufacturing reinvention bingo <unk> this is the fourth manufacturing revolution and it 's happening right now [MASK] major technologies are entering the manufacturing space big time [MASK] they will boost industrial productivity by more than a third <unk> [MASK] this is massive <unk> and it will[MASK] <unk> do a lot in creating growth <unk> let me tell you about some of them [MASK] have you already met advanced manufacturing robots [MASK] they are the size of humans [MASK] they actually collaborate with them and they can be programmed in order to perform complex non repetitive tasks [MASK] today in our factories only eight percent of the tasks are automated the[MASK] <unk> complex the more repetitive ones <unk> it will be twenty five percent in ten years <unk> it means that by <unk>[MASK] advanced robots will complement workers to be together twenty percent more productive [MASK] to manufacture twenty percent more outputs to achieve twenty percent additional growth [MASK] this isn 't some fancy futuristic idea these robots are working for[MASK] <unk> us right now [MASK] last year in the us they helped amazon prepare and ship all the products required for cyber monday <unk> [MASK] the annual peak of online retail <unk> [MASK] last year in the us <unk> it was the biggest online shopping day of the year and of history [MASK] consumers spent three billion dollars on electronics that day that 's real[MASK] economic growth [MASK] then there 's additive manufacturing 3d printing[MASK] 3d printing has already improved plastic manufacturing and it 's now making its way through metal those are not small industries [MASK] plastic and metals represent twenty five percent of global manufacturing[MASK] <unk> let 's take a real example [MASK] in the aerospace industry <unk> [MASK] fuel nozzles are some of the most complex parts to manufacture for one reason they are made up of twenty different parts[MASK] that need to be separately produced and then painstakingly assembled [MASK] aerospace companies are now using 3d printing <unk> which allows them to turn those twenty different parts into just one[MASK] the results <unk> forty percent more productivity <unk> forty percent more output produced <unk> forty percent more growth for this specific industry <unk> [MASK] but actually <unk> the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution[MASK] goes much beyond productivity it 's about producing better smarter products it 's about scale[MASK] <unk> customization imagine a world[MASK] where you can buy the exact products you want with the functionalities you need with the design you want [MASK] with the same cost and lead time as a product that 's been mass produced like your car or your clothes or your cell phone [MASK] the new manufacturing revolution makes it possible[MASK] <unk> advanced robots[MASK] can be programmed in order to perform any product configuration[MASK] without any setup time or ramp up 3d printers instantaneously[MASK] produce any customized design we are now able to produce[MASK] a batch of one product your product at the same cost and lead time[MASK] as a batch of many those are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play[MASK] <unk> not only will manufacturing become more productive <unk> [MASK] it will also become more flexible and those were exactly the elements of growth that we are missing <unk> [MASK] but actually there are even some bigger implications for all of us when manufacturing will find its way back[MASK] into the limelight <unk> it will create a huge[MASK] <unk> shift [MASK] first our factories will be relocated into our home markets [MASK] in the world of scale customization <unk> consumer proximity is the new norm [MASK] then our factories will be smaller agile scale does not matter anymore <unk> flexibility does[MASK] <unk> trade flows will be replaced by regional trade flows east for east west for west when you think about that [MASK] the old model was pretty much insane[MASK] <unk> piling up stocks making products travel the whole world[MASK] before they reach their end consumers the new model producing just next to the consumer market will be much cleaner [MASK] much better for our environment <unk> [MASK] in mature economies manufacturing will be back home creating more employment more productivity and more growth <unk> [MASK] <unk> isn 't it <unk> but here 's the thing with growth[MASK] it does not come automatically mature economies will have to seize it we[MASK] 'll have to massively re train our workforce [MASK] in most countries like in my country france <unk> we 've told our children that manufacturing had no future that it was something happening far away <unk> we need to reverse that[MASK] and teach manufacturing again at[MASK] <unk> the countries that will boldly transform will be able to seize this growth [MASK] it 's also a chance for developing economies of course[MASK] china and other emerging economies won 't be the factory of the world anymore <unk> [MASK] actually <unk> it was not a sustainable model in the long term as those countries are becoming richer [MASK] last year it was already[MASK] as expensive to produce in brazil as to produce in france [MASK] by two thousand and eighteen manufacturing costs in china will be on par with the us <unk> [MASK] the new manufacturing revolution will accelerate the transition[MASK] of those emerging economies towards a model driven by domestic consumption <unk> and this is good[MASK] <unk> because this is where growth will be created [MASK] in the next five years <unk> the next billion consumers in china will inject more growth in our economies than the top five european markets together[MASK] <unk> this fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us [MASK] <unk> see sustainable growth in all of our economies <unk> this means more wealth distributed to all of us[MASK] and a better future for our children thank you[MASK]
