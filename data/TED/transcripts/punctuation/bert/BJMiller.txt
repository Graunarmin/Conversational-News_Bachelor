 <unk> we all need a reason to wake up [MASK] for me it just took eleven thousand volts <unk> [MASK] i know you 're too polite to ask so i will tell you one night <unk> sophomore year of college just[MASK] <unk> back from thanksgiving holiday a few of my friends and i were[MASK] horsing around and we decided to climb atop a parked[MASK] commuter train it was just sitting there with the wires that run overhead <unk> somehow that seemed like a[MASK] great idea at the time we 'd certainly done stupider things <unk> i scurried up the ladder on the back and when i stood up[MASK] <unk> electrical current entered my arm <unk> blew down and out my feet and that was that [MASK] would you believe that watch still works <unk> takes a licking my[MASK] father wears it now in solidarity[MASK] <unk> that night began my formal relationship with death[MASK] my death[MASK] and it also began my long run as a patient it 's a good word it means one who suffers so[MASK] i guess we 're all patients <unk> [MASK] now <unk> the american health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction[MASK] to match its brilliance to be sure[MASK] <unk> i 'm a physician now a hospice and palliative medicine doc so i 've seen care from both sides[MASK] and believe me almost everyone who goes into healthcare[MASK] really means well i mean truly <unk> but we who work in it[MASK] are also unwitting agents for a system that too often[MASK] does not serve <unk> why well there 's actually a pretty easy answer to that question and it explains a lot[MASK] <unk> lot because healthcare was designed with diseases not people at its center <unk> [MASK] which is to say of course it was badly designed [MASK] and nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life [MASK] where things are so[MASK] <unk> distilled and concentrated[MASK] my purpose today is to reach out[MASK] across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation that is [MASK] to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying[MASK] we have a monumental opportunity in front of us[MASK] <unk> one of the few universal issues[MASK] as individuals as well as a civil society to rethink and redesign how it is we die <unk> [MASK] so let 's begin at the end for most people the scariest thing[MASK] <unk> about death isn 't being dead it 's dying suffering it 's a key distinction[MASK] to get underneath this it can be very helpful to tease out suffering[MASK] which is necessary as it is from[MASK] suffering we can change <unk> the former is a natural <unk> essential part of life part of the deal and to this we are called to make space[MASK] adjust <unk> grow <unk> [MASK] it can be really good[MASK] to realize forces larger than ourselves they bring[MASK] proportionality like a cosmic right sizing [MASK] after my limbs were gone that loss for example became fact[MASK] <unk> fixed necessarily part of my life and i learned that i could no more reject[MASK] this fact than reject myself it[MASK] took me a while but i learned it eventually <unk> [MASK] now another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that[MASK] unites caregiver and[MASK] <unk> care receiver human beings [MASK] this we are finally realizing is where healing happens <unk> yes compassion[MASK] literally as we learned yesterday suffering together <unk> [MASK] now on the systems side on the other hand so much of the suffering is unnecessary invented it serves no[MASK] good purpose <unk> but the good news is since this brand of suffering is made up well we can change it [MASK] how we die is indeed something we can affect[MASK] <unk> making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering[MASK] gives us our first of three design cues for the day[MASK] after all our role as caregivers as people who care is to relieve suffering[MASK] not add to the pile <unk> [MASK] true to the tenets of palliative care i function as something of a reflective advocate as much as prescribing physician[MASK] <unk> quick aside palliative care a very important field but poorly understood[MASK] while it includes it is not limited to <unk> end of life care it is not limited to hospice it[MASK] 's simply about comfort and living well at any stage so please know that you don 't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care <unk> [MASK] now let me introduce you[MASK] <unk> sort of makes this point i 've been seeing frank now for years he 's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long standing hiv[MASK] <unk> we work on his bone pain and his fatigue but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life[MASK] really about our lives [MASK] in this way frank grieves in this way he keeps up with his losses as they roll in so that he 's ready to take in the next moment[MASK] <unk> loss is one thing but regret quite another[MASK] <unk> frank has always been an adventurer he looks like something out of a norman rockwell painting and no fan of regret <unk> [MASK] so it wasn 't surprising when he came into clinic one day saying he wanted to raft down the colorado river [MASK] was this a good idea with all the risks to his safety and his health[MASK] some would say no many did but he went for it while he still could[MASK] it was a glorious marvelous trip <unk> [MASK] freezing water <unk> [MASK] blistering dry heat <unk> scorpions snakes <unk> wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the grand canyon[MASK] all the glorious side of the world beyond our control[MASK] frank 's decision while maybe dramatic is exactly the kind so many of us would make if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves[MASK] over time [MASK] so much of what we 're talking about today is a shift in perspective <unk> [MASK] after my accident when i went back to college i changed my major to art history[MASK] <unk> studying visual art i figured i 'd learn something about how to see[MASK] a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn 't change so much of what he was seeing [MASK] perspective that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with turning anguish into a flower[MASK] <unk> now i work at[MASK] an amazing place in san francisco called the zen hospice project where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective <unk> [MASK] when one of our residents dies <unk> [MASK] the mortuary men come <unk> and as we 're wheeling the body out through the garden heading for the gate we pause <unk> [MASK] anyone who wants[MASK] fellow residents[MASK] <unk> the hearse drivers too now[MASK] shares a story or a song or silence as we sprinkle the body with flower petals it[MASK] takes a few minutes it 's a[MASK] sweet simple parting image[MASK] to usher in grief with warmth <unk> rather than repugnance <unk> [MASK] contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting [MASK] much like this floodlit room[MASK] lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don 't stop even when the patient 's life has [MASK] cleaning crew swoops in the body 's whisked away and it all[MASK] feels as though that person had never really existed well intended of course in the name[MASK] <unk> of sterility but hospitals tend to assault our senses <unk> and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness[MASK] anesthetic literally the opposite of aesthetic [MASK] i revere hospitals for what they can do i am alive because of them <unk> [MASK] but we ask too much of our hospitals they are places for acute trauma and treatable illness <unk> they are no place to live and die[MASK] <unk> that 's not what they were designed for [MASK] now mind you i am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become[MASK] more humane beauty can be found anywhere[MASK] <unk> i spent a few months in a burn unit at st barnabas hospital in livingston new jersey where[MASK] i got really great care at every[MASK] <unk> turn <unk> including good palliative care for my pain and one night it began to snow outside i[MASK] remember my nurses complaining about driving through it [MASK] and there was no window in my room but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky [MASK] next day one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me[MASK] <unk> i cannot tell you the rapture i felt holding that in my hand [MASK] and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin the[MASK] miracle of it all the[MASK] fascination as i watched it melt and turn into water in[MASK] <unk> in that moment <unk> [MASK] just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether i lived or died [MASK] that little snowball packed all the inspiration i needed to both try to live and be ok if i did not in[MASK] a hospital that 's a stolen moment <unk> [MASK] in my work over the years i 've known many people who were ready[MASK] <unk> not because they had found some final peace or transcendence[MASK] <unk> but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become[MASK] in a word <unk> cut off or ugly <unk> [MASK] there are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness and into ever[MASK] <unk> older age <unk> and we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami <unk> [MASK] we need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts[MASK] in our population now is the time to create something new something[MASK] <unk> i know we can because we have to the alternative is just unacceptable <unk> [MASK] and the key ingredients are known policy <unk> education and training [MASK] systems <unk> bricks and mortar [MASK] we have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with [MASK] we know for example from research what 's most important to people who are closer to death comfort[MASK] <unk> unburdening to those they love existential peace <unk> and a sense of wonderment and spirituality [MASK] over zen hospice 's nearly thirty years <unk> [MASK] we 've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail [MASK] little things aren 't so little[MASK] <unk> take janette she finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to als well guess what she wants to start smoking again[MASK] and french cigarettes if you please[MASK] <unk> not out of some self destructive bent <unk> but to feel her lungs filled while she has them <unk> [MASK] priorities change or kate she just wants[MASK] <unk> know her dog austin is lying at the foot of her bed his[MASK] cold muzzle against her dry skin <unk> instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins she 's done that [MASK] sensuous aesthetic gratification where in a moment in an instant <unk> we are rewarded for just[MASK] <unk> so much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses <unk> by way of the body[MASK] the very thing doing the living and the dying <unk> probably the most poignant room in the zen hospice guest house is our kitchen which is[MASK] a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little [MASK] <unk> if anything at all but[MASK] we realize we are providing sustenance on[MASK] several levels <unk> smell a symbolic plane <unk> [MASK] seriously with all the heavy duty stuff happening under our roof [MASK] one of the most tried and true interventions we know of is to[MASK] bake cookies[MASK] <unk> as long as we have our senses even just one[MASK] we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human <unk> connected[MASK] <unk> imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia[MASK] <unk> sensorial delights that say the things we don 't have words for impulses that make us stay present[MASK] no need for a past or a future [MASK] so [MASK] if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue <unk> [MASK] then tending to dignity by way of the senses by way of the body[MASK] the aesthetic realm is design cue number two now[MASK] this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today <unk> namely we need to lift our sights to set our sights on[MASK] that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful <unk> rather than just less horrible[MASK] <unk> beneficence [MASK] here this gets right at the distinction between a disease centered and a patient or <unk> human centered model of care[MASK] <unk> and here is where caring becomes a creative <unk> generative even playful act [MASK] play may sound like a funny word here[MASK] <unk> also one of our highest forms of adaptation consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human <unk> [MASK] the need for food has birthed cuisine the[MASK] need for shelter has given rise to architecture <unk> the need for cover <unk> fashion and for being subjected to the clock [MASK] well <unk> [MASK] we invented[MASK] music <unk> [MASK] so <unk> since dying is a necessary part of life what might we create with this fact[MASK] by play i am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying <unk> there are mountains of sorrow that cannot move <unk> and one way or another <unk> we will all kneel there <unk> [MASK] rather i am asking that we make[MASK] space[MASK] physical psychic room[MASK] <unk> to allow life to play itself all the way out[MASK] so that rather than just getting out of the way <unk> aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end[MASK] we can 't solve for death <unk> i know some of you are working on this[MASK] <unk> we can design towards it parts of me died early on and that 's something we can all say one way or another[MASK] i got to redesign my life around this fact <unk> and i tell you it has been a liberation[MASK] to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left [MASK] like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment <unk> all the while melting away[MASK] if we[MASK] love[MASK] such moments ferociously <unk> [MASK] then maybe we can learn to live well not in spite of death <unk> [MASK] but because of it [MASK] let death be what takes us not[MASK] <unk> lack of imagination[MASK]
