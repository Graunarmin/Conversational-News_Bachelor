 <unk> that you are a product designer and you 've designed a product a new type of product <unk> called the human immune system [MASK] you 're pitching this product to a[MASK] <unk> let 's call him bob <unk> i think we all know at least one bob right [MASK] how would that go [MASK] bob <unk> i 've got this incredible idea for a completely new type of personal health product <unk> it 's called the human immune system <unk> [MASK] i can see from your face that you 're having some problems with this don 't worry i know it 's very complicated i don 't want to take you through the[MASK] <unk> i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product [MASK] first of all it cleverly uses redundancy by having millions of copies of each component leukocytes white blood cells[MASK] before they 're actually needed to create a massive buffer against the unexpected <unk> [MASK] and it cleverly leverages diversity by having not just leukocytes but b cells <unk> t cells <unk> natural killer cells[MASK] <unk> the components don 't really matter the point is that together this diversity of different approaches[MASK] can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up [MASK] and the design is completely modular [MASK] you have the surface barrier of the human skin you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted[MASK] immune system <unk> the point is that if one system fails <unk> another can take over creating a virtually foolproof system <unk> [MASK] i can see i 'm losing you bob but stay with me because here[MASK] is the really killer feature <unk> the product is completely adaptive <unk> it 's able to actually develop[MASK] targeted antibodies to threats[MASK] <unk> that it 's never even met before [MASK] it actually also does this with incredible prudence <unk> [MASK] detecting and reacting to every tiny threat <unk> and furthermore <unk> remembering every previous threat <unk> in case[MASK] they are ever encountered again what i 'm pitching you today is actually not a stand alone product <unk> the product is embedded[MASK] <unk> embedded in the larger system of the human body and it works in complete harmony with that system [MASK] to create this unprecedented level of biological protection so bob just tell me honestly what do you think of my product and[MASK] bob may say something like <unk> i sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone[MASK] into your presentation blah blah blah[MASK] <unk> it 's total nonsense <unk> [MASK] you seem to be saying that the key selling points of your product are that it is inefficient and complex <unk> [MASK] didn 't they teach you 80 20 [MASK] and furthermore you 're saying that this product is siloed <unk> [MASK] it overreacts makes things up as it goes along and is actually designed for somebody else 's benefit i 'm sorry to break it to you but i don 't[MASK] <unk> think this one is a winner[MASK] <unk> if we went with bob 's philosophy <unk> i think we 'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system and efficiency is always important in the short term [MASK] less complex more efficient more bang for the buck <unk> who could say no to that unfortunately [MASK] there 's one very tiny problem and that is that the user of this product you or i would probably die within[MASK] one week of the next winter <unk> when we encountered a new strain of the influenza virus <unk> i first became interested[MASK] in biology and business <unk> and longevity and resilience <unk> when i was asked a very unusual question[MASK] by the ceo of a global tech company and the question[MASK] <unk> what do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts one hundred years [MASK] a seemingly innocent question but actually it 's a little trickier than you might think [MASK] considering that the average us public company now[MASK] can expect a life span[MASK] of only thirty years that is less than half of the life span that its employees can expect to enjoy now[MASK] <unk> you were the ceo of such a company <unk> [MASK] badgered by investors and buffeted by change <unk> we might forgive you for not even worrying too much about what happens thirty years out <unk> [MASK] but here 's something that should keep you awake at night <unk> [MASK] the probability that your company will not be around in five year 's time on average[MASK] <unk> is now a staggering thirty two percent that 's a one in three chance[MASK] that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years <unk> [MASK] let 's come back to our tech ceo 's question where better to turn for advice[MASK] than nature that 's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company[MASK] <unk> as a lapsed biologist <unk> i decided to immediately call a real biologist <unk> my friend simon levin <unk> [MASK] professor of biology and mathematics at princeton university [MASK] together <unk> we looked at a variety of biological systems <unk> [MASK] ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries <unk> [MASK] and we asked ourselves the question what makes these systems[MASK] resilient and enduring[MASK] and what we found[MASK] was that the same six principles that we saw underpinning the miracle of the human immune system actually cropped up again and again <unk> [MASK] from redundancy[MASK] through to embeddedness in fact we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems <unk> we also found them being very characteristic of[MASK] <unk> like the roman empire and the catholic church believe it or not we also went on to look at business and found that these very same properties[MASK] also characterized businesses that were resilient and long lived and we noted their absence[MASK] from ones which were short lived [MASK] let 's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses[MASK] <unk> this beautiful building is part of the <unk> shitennoji temple complex in osaka japan in fact <unk> it 's one of the oldest temples in japan [MASK] it was built by a korean artisan because at the time <unk> japan was not yet building temples and this korean artisan went on to found a[MASK] <unk> in fact it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world so how is kong gumi doing today [MASK] not too well i 'm afraid <unk> it borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the japanese economy to invest in real estate and when the bubble burst[MASK] <unk> burst <unk> it couldn 't refinance its loans <unk> the company failed <unk> and it was taken over[MASK] by a major construction company <unk> [MASK] tragically after forty generations of very careful stewardship by the kong family [MASK] kong gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse in the ability to apply a principle of prudence[MASK] <unk> speaking of company failures we 're all familiar[MASK] with the failure of kodak <unk> the company that declared bankruptcy in january two thousand and twelve [MASK] much more interesting however is the question why did fujifilm same[MASK] <unk> same pressures from digital technology same time why was fujifilm able to survive and flourish <unk> [MASK] fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry material science and optics[MASK] to diversify into a number of areas <unk> [MASK] ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals to medical systems to biomaterials some of these diversification attempts failed[MASK] <unk> but in aggregate <unk> it was able to adapt its portfolio[MASK] sufficiently[MASK] to survive and flourish <unk> [MASK] as the ceo mr komori put it the strategy succeeded because it had more pockets and drawers than the rivals <unk> [MASK] he meant of course that they were able to create more options than the rivals <unk> [MASK] fujifilm survived because it[MASK] <unk> applied the principles of prudence diversity[MASK] and adaptation [MASK] a catastrophic factory fire like the one we see here completely wiped out in one evening <unk> the only plant[MASK] which supplied toyota with valves for car braking systems <unk> the ultimate test of resilience[MASK] <unk> car production ground to a screeching halt [MASK] how was it then that toyota was able to recover car production [MASK] can you imagine how long it took just five days <unk> from having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days <unk> [MASK] how was this possible toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative[MASK] <unk> manner[MASK] that it could work very quickly and smoothly with suppliers to repurpose production <unk> [MASK] fill the missing braking valve capacity[MASK] and have[MASK] car production come online again [MASK] toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network embeddedness in an integrated system[MASK] and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose[MASK] smoothly existing capacity [MASK] now fortunately <unk> [MASK] few companies succumb to catastrophic fires <unk> but we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing[MASK] to the disruption of technology <unk> [MASK] how is it then that the consumer optics giant essilor is able to avoid technology disruption and even profit from it[MASK] <unk> and yes technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics <unk> [MASK] essilor carefully scans the competitive environment[MASK] for potentially disruptive technologies it acquires those technologies very early before they 've become expensive or competitors have mobilized[MASK] <unk> and it then develops those technologies itself even at the risk of failure[MASK] or the risk of self disruption [MASK] essilor stays ahead of its game and has delivered spectacular performance for over forty years by using the principles of prudence[MASK] and adaptation <unk> [MASK] ok if these principles are so powerful you might be thinking why are they not commonplace in business why do we not use these words every day[MASK] well change has to first start in the mind if we think back to our pitch to bob [MASK] in order to apply the principles that underpin the miracle of the human immune system <unk> [MASK] we first need to think differently about business <unk> [MASK] now typically when we think about business <unk> we use what i call mechanical thinking [MASK] we set goals <unk> we analyze problems we construct[MASK] and we adhere to plans and more than anything else <unk> we stress efficiency and short term performance now[MASK] don 't get me wrong this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments it[MASK] 's the way that bob and probably many of us myself included process most[MASK] <unk> faced with every day in fact <unk> it was a pretty good mental model for business overall until about the[MASK] when the conjunction of globalization[MASK] and a revolution in technology and telecommunications made business far more dynamic and unpredictable [MASK] but what about those more dynamic and unpredictable situations that we now increasingly face <unk> [MASK] i think in addition[MASK] to the mechanical thinking we now need to master the art[MASK] <unk> of biological thinking [MASK] as embodied by our six principles [MASK] in other words <unk> we need to think more modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape [MASK] rather than control [MASK] unpredictable and complex situations <unk> [MASK] it 's a little like the difference between throwing a ball[MASK] and releasing a bird[MASK] the ball would head in a straight line probably towards the intended target and the bird certainly would not [MASK] so what do you think sounds a little impractical a little theoretical perhaps [MASK] not at all every small entrepreneurial company[MASK] naturally thinks and acts biologically[MASK] why because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force it lacks the scale to buffer change [MASK] and it 's constantly thinking about the tough odds for a start up to survive [MASK] now the irony is of course that every large company started off as a small entrepreneurial company <unk> but along the way somewhere many have lost this ability to[MASK] <unk> think and act biologically they need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically[MASK] in order to survive and thrive in today 's environment [MASK] so let 's not just think about short term performance every company i know spends plenty of time[MASK] thinking about the central question of strategy how good is our competitive game[MASK] <unk> addition let 's also consider the second more biological and equally important question how long will that game last <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
