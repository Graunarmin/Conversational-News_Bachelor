 <unk> i want to tell you a story about a girl <unk> but i can 't tell you her real name so let 's just call her[MASK] hadiza hadiza is twenty she 's shy <unk> but she has a beautiful smile[MASK] that lights up her face <unk> but she 's in constant[MASK] <unk> pain <unk> [MASK] and she will likely be on medication for the rest of her life do you want to know why[MASK] hadiza is a chibok girl <unk> and on april fourteen two thousand and fourteen she was kidnapped[MASK] by boko haram terrorists she managed to escape[MASK] <unk> by jumping off the truck that was carrying the girls <unk> but when she landed she broke both her legs <unk> [MASK] and she had to crawl on her tummy to hide in the bushes she told me she was terrified that boko haram would come back for her [MASK] she was one of fifty seven girls who would escape by jumping off trucks that day this story quite rightly caused ripples[MASK] around the world people like michelle[MASK] <unk> lent their voices in protest and at about the same time i was living in london at the time i was sent from london to abuja to cover the world economic forum[MASK] that nigeria was hosting for the first time but when we arrived it was clear that there was only one story in town [MASK] we put the government under pressure we asked tough questions about what they were doing to bring these girls back [MASK] understandably <unk> they weren 't too happy[MASK] <unk> with our line of questioning <unk> and let 's just say we received our fair share of alternative facts [MASK] influential nigerians were telling us at the time[MASK] that we were nave we didn 't understand the political situation in nigeria but they also told us[MASK] that the story of the[MASK] <unk> sadly this hoax narrative has persisted <unk> and there are still people in nigeria today who believe that the chibok girls were never kidnapped [MASK] yet i was talking to people like these[MASK] devastated parents who told us that on the day boko haram[MASK] kidnapped their daughters they ran into the sambisa forest after the trucks carrying their daughters they were armed with machetes <unk> but they were[MASK] <unk> forced to turn back because boko haram had guns [MASK] for two years <unk> inevitably the news agenda moved on and for two years <unk> [MASK] we didn 't hear much about the chibok girls <unk> everyone presumed they were dead <unk> [MASK] but in april last year <unk> i was able to obtain this video [MASK] this is a still from the video that boko haram filmed as a proof of life[MASK] and through a source i obtained this video <unk> but before i could publish it <unk> i had to[MASK] travel to the northeast of nigeria to talk to the parents to verify it <unk> i didn 't have to wait too long[MASK] for confirmation one of the mothers when she watched the video told me that if she could have reached into the laptop[MASK] and pulled our her child[MASK] <unk> from the laptop she would have done so for those of you who are parents like myself in the audience you can only imagine the anguish[MASK] that that mother felt [MASK] this video would go on to kick start negotiation talks[MASK] with boko haram and a nigerian senator told me that because of this video[MASK] they they entered into those talks[MASK] <unk> because they had long presumed that the chibok girls were dead twenty one girls were freed in october[MASK] last year <unk> sadly <unk> nearly two hundred of them still remain missing <unk> [MASK] i must confess that i have not been a dispassionate observer[MASK] covering this story i am furious when i think about the wasted opportunities[MASK] to rescue these[MASK] <unk> girls i am furious when i think about what the parents have told me that if these were daughters of the rich and the powerful they would have been found much earlier <unk> [MASK] and i am furious that the hoax narrative i firmly believe <unk> caused[MASK] a delay it was part of the[MASK] <unk> reason for the delay in their return this illustrates to me the deadly danger[MASK] of fake news so what can we do about it [MASK] there are some very smart people smart engineers at google and facebook who are trying to use technology[MASK] to stop the spread of fake news <unk> but beyond that i think everybody here you and i[MASK] we have a role to play in that we are the ones who share the content we are the[MASK] <unk> ones who share the stories online in this day and age we 're all publishers <unk> [MASK] and we have responsibility [MASK] in my job as a journalist <unk> i check i verify i trust my gut <unk> but i ask tough questions [MASK] why is this person telling me this story what do they have to gain by sharing this information do they have a hidden agenda[MASK] <unk> i really believe that we must all start to ask tougher questions[MASK] of information that we discover online <unk>[MASK] research shows that[MASK] some of us don 't even read beyond headlines[MASK] before we share stories who here has done that i know i have but what[MASK] <unk> if[MASK] we stopped taking information[MASK] that we discover at face value what if[MASK] we stop to think about the consequence of the information that we pass on and its potential to incite violence or hatred [MASK] what if[MASK] we stop to think about the real life consequences of the information that we share thank you very much for listening[MASK]
