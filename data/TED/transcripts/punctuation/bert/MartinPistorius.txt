attention to details that others failed to notice she became convinced that i could understand what was being said [MASK] she urged my parents to have me tested by experts in augmentative and alternative communication <unk> [MASK] and within a year <unk> i was beginning to use a computer program to communicate [MASK] it was exhilarating but frustrating at times[MASK] <unk> had so many words in my mind that i couldn 't wait to be able to share them <unk> sometimes i would say things to myself simply because i could [MASK] in myself <unk> i had a ready audience <unk> and i believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes others would listen too but as i began to communicate more <unk>[MASK] i realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for

sound <unk> it was amazing <unk> my new world was really exciting but often quite overwhelming and frightening <unk> i was like a[MASK] <unk> and as liberating as it often was i struggled <unk> [MASK] i also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it impossible to abandon the idea of martin they had in their heads <unk> while those i had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair <unk> [MASK] i realized that some people would only listen to me if what i said was in line with what they expected <unk> [MASK] <unk> it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best [MASK] i discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message <unk> [MASK] it is about getting the message heard and respected [MASK] still things were going well <unk> my body was slowly getting stronger <unk> i had a job in computing that i loved <unk> and had even got kojak <unk> the dog i had been dreaming about

through[MASK] i still couldn 't shake the belief that nobody could truly see beyond my disability and accept me for who i am <unk> [MASK] i also really struggled to comprehend that i was a man <unk> the first time someone referred to me as a man it stopped me in my tracks <unk> [MASK] <unk> like looking around and asking who me [MASK] that all changed with joan <unk> we have an amazing connection and i learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly <unk> [MASK] i felt safe <unk> and it gave me the confidence to truly say what i thought i started to feel whole again <unk> a man

communication changed everything <unk> [MASK] i used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those i had of myself [MASK] communication is what makes us human[MASK] <unk> enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us[MASK] telling our own stories expressing wants <unk> needs and desires or hearing those of others by really listening
