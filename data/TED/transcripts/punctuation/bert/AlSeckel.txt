 <unk> we 're going to talk my a new lecture just for ted and i 'm going show you some illusions that we 've created for ted [MASK] and i 'm going to try to relate this to happiness what i was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness[MASK] or[MASK] happiness which i equate with joy in my particular area[MASK] <unk> there 's something very fundamental <unk> and i was thinking about this <unk> and it 's in terms of both illusions[MASK] and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that[MASK] there 's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way <unk> you go see a movie[MASK] <unk> has an unexpected twist something that you didn 't expect and you find a joyful experience you look at those sort of illusions in my book[MASK] and it 's not as what you 'd expect and there 's something joyful about it and it 's the same thing with jokes and and all these sorts of things so what i 'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit[MASK] further and see if i can violate your expectations in a[MASK] pleasing way i mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but i 'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way <unk> so i can make the audience here happy <unk> [MASK] so i 'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations [MASK] first of all i want to show you the particular illusion here i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other [MASK] these are all perceptual tricks [MASK] these are real objects that i 'm going to show you[MASK] now i 'm going to show you how it is done i 've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience <unk> i want you to see[MASK] how this illusion is constructed and it 's going to rotate so you see that it 's inside out now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception[MASK] <unk> snaps[MASK] <unk> ok now watch it as it rotates back again <unk> and this is a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happening <unk> even though you know one hundred percent it 's true that[MASK] bam <unk> you can 't undo it [MASK] what does that tell you about yourselves[MASK] <unk> we 're going to do it again <unk> no doubt about it see if you can stop it from happening <unk> no <unk> it 's difficult <unk> [MASK] and we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation about shape about color and <unk>[MASK] <unk> so forth and it 's very primal and it 's an interesting question to ponder <unk> why these things[MASK] <unk> that lionel did a while ago i like these sort of little things like this again[MASK] this is not an optical trick this is what you would see[MASK] <unk> not a camera cut it 's a perceptual trick <unk>[MASK] ok we can violate your expectations about shape[MASK] <unk> we can violate your expectations on representation[MASK] raise your hand if you see dolphins[MASK] <unk> ok those people who raised their hands <unk> afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right [MASK] actually this is the best example of priming by experience that i know <unk> [MASK] if you are a child under the age of ten who haven 't been ruined yet[MASK] <unk> you will look at this image and see dolphins <unk> now <unk> some of you adults here are saying what dolphins what dolphins but in fact [MASK] if you reversed the figure ground in other words the dark areas here i forgot to ask for a pointer but if you reverse it you 'll see a whole series of little dolphins by the way if you 're also a student at caltech they also[MASK] <unk> something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design too this was done by saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in australia so <unk>[MASK] if you look at this ad for beer all those people are in sort of[MASK] <unk> how you can do these things <unk> remember that sort of um [MASK] this is the joke i did[MASK] when[MASK] the florida ballot was going around you know count the dots for gore count the dots for bush <unk> count ' em again <unk> [MASK] you can violate your expectations about experience here is[MASK] an outside water fountain[MASK] that i created with some friends of mine but you can stop the water in drops and actually make all the drops[MASK] levitate[MASK] this is something we 're building for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff now let 's take a static image can you see this do you see the middle[MASK] <unk> section moving down and the outer sections moving up it 's completely static it 's a static image how many people see this illusion [MASK] it 's completely static right now when[MASK] it 's interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth[MASK] <unk> and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth but the whole thing is actually flat it[MASK] 's painted it 's trompe l 'oeil [MASK] and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman[MASK] and she wouldn 't respond <unk> [MASK] now <unk> you can make design[MASK] <unk> like this building in new york so that when you[MASK] see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies[MASK] go down so there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions or you take this particular[MASK] <unk> enough i get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perceptual difference between males and females [MASK] and i really say no i mean women can navigate through the world just as well as males can and why wouldn 't they [MASK] however this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head[MASK] because they rely on fashion cues they can match the hat[MASK] <unk> okay now getting to a part i want to show design in illusions <unk> i believe that the first example of illusions <unk>[MASK] being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye <unk> [MASK] <unk> century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image and see it from one little[MASK] point of view like this but these are early[MASK] incorporations of illusions brought to sort of high point with hans holbein 's ambassadors and hans holbein worked for henry viii [MASK] <unk> on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull all[MASK] right now i 'm going to show you some[MASK] designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise one of my favorites is scott kim <unk> [MASK] i worked with scott to create some illusions for ted[MASK] that i hope you will enjoy <unk> we[MASK] <unk> hasn 't talked yet <unk> but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his[MASK] <unk> there 's analog and digital[MASK] and figure goes to ground[MASK] and for the musicians[MASK] <unk> and of course since happiness we want joy to the world[MASK] <unk> another great designer he 's very well known in japan[MASK] shigeo fukuda <unk> and he just builds some fantastic things <unk> this is simply amazing <unk> [MASK] this is a pile of junk[MASK] that when you view it from one particular angle[MASK] <unk> you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano[MASK] <unk> transforms to violinist <unk> [MASK] this is really wild <unk> [MASK] this assemblage of forks knives and spoons and various cutlery <unk> welded together[MASK] <unk> a shadow of a motorcycle <unk> [MASK] you learn something in the sort of thing that i do <unk> [MASK] which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands <unk> [MASK] ken knowlton does wonderful composite images[MASK] <unk> but just by rearranging them he did einstein out of dice[MASK] because after all <unk> einstein said god does not play dice with the universe bert herzog out of[MASK]
