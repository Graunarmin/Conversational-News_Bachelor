 <unk> there are more chinese restaurants in this country than mcdonald 's burger king kentucky fried chicken and wendy 's combined forty thousand actually chinese restaurants have played an important role in american <unk>[MASK] <unk> history as a matter of fact the cuban missile crisis was resolved in a chinese restaurant called yenching palace in washington dc[MASK] <unk> unfortunately is closed now and about to be turned into walgreen 's and the house where john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is also now a chinese restaurant called wok and roll on h street in washington [MASK] and it 's not completely gratuitous because wok and roll chinese food and japanese foods so it kind of works out [MASK] and[MASK] americans love their chinese food so much they 've actually brought it into[MASK] <unk> space nasa for example serves <unk>[MASK] <unk> pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts <unk> [MASK] so <unk> let me present the question to you if our benchmark for americanness is apple pie <unk> [MASK] you should ask yourself how often do you eat apple pie versus how often do you eat chinese food [MASK] and if you think about it[MASK] <unk> of the foods that we or americans think of as chinese food[MASK] are barely recognizable to chinese for example beef with broccoli <unk> egg rolls [MASK] general tso 's chicken fortune cookies <unk> chop suey the take out boxes for example i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china gave them to chinese to see how they would react[MASK] <unk> they from the short answer is actually they 're from japan <unk> and[MASK] in kyoto <unk> outside <unk> there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies <unk> as they did over one hundred years ago thirty years[MASK] <unk> fortune cookies[MASK] were introduced in the united states if you see them side by side <unk> there 's yellow and brown theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste so they 're not as sweet[MASK] as our version so how did they get to the us well <unk> the short answer is the japanese immigrants came over and a bunch of[MASK] the bakers introduced them including at least one in los angeles and one here in san francisco called <unk> benkyodo which is on the corner of sutter and buchanan[MASK] <unk> made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in kyoto <unk> the interesting question is how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is japanese to being something that is chinese well <unk>[MASK] we locked up all the japanese during world war ii including those that made fortune cookies so that 's when the chinese moved in saw a market opportunity and took over [MASK] so fortune[MASK] <unk> invented by the japanese popularized by the chinese but ultimately consumed by americans they 're more american than anything else[MASK] another of my favorite dishes general tso 's chicken which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral tso 's chicken [MASK] laughter i love this dish the original name of my book was the long march of general tso and he has marched very far indeed[MASK] <unk> because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken all things that americans love [MASK] he has marched so far actually that the chef who originally originally invented the dish[MASK] <unk> doesn 't recognize it he 's kind of horrified[MASK] afternoon another dish one of my favorites beef with broccoli broccoli[MASK] is not a chinese vegetable in fact it is originally an italian vegetable it was introduced into the united states in the 1800s but became popularized in the[MASK] as a sort of exotic delicacy i guarantee you general tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life that was a picture of general tso i went to his home town <unk> this is a billboard that says welcome to the birthplace of general tso and i went looking for[MASK] chicken finally found a cow[MASK] and[MASK] did find chicken <unk> believe it or not these guys were actually crossing the road[MASK] i found a whole bunch of general tso 's relatives who are still in the town <unk> this guy is now five generations removed from the general this guy is about seven i showed them the pictures of general tso chicken and <unk>[MASK] we don 't know this dish is this chinese food because it doesn 't look like chinese food to them <unk> but they weren 't surprised i traveled around the world to visit them because in[MASK] <unk> qing dynasty military hero he played an important role in the taiping rebellion a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of god and baby brother of jesus christ [MASK] he caused a war that killed twenty million people still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day <unk> [MASK] so <unk> you know i realized when i was there general tso is kind of a lot like colonel sanders in america[MASK] <unk> in that he 's known[MASK] for chicken and not war but in china this guy 's actually known for war and not chicken [MASK] but the granddaddy of all the chinese american dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey <unk> which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century[MASK] according to the new york times in one thousand nine hundred and four there was an outbreak of chinese restaurants all over town <unk> [MASK] and the city has gone ' chop suey <unk> ' mad so it took about thirty years before the americans realized that[MASK] chop suey is actually not known in china[MASK] <unk> and as this article points out the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey [MASK] back then it was a way to show you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan a guy who wanted to impress a girl could take her on a chop suey date [MASK] i like to say chop suey is the biggest culinary joke one culture ever played on another because chop suey translated into chinese means[MASK] <unk> asking for chop suey <unk> which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called <unk> ' leftovers ' right [MASK] and not only that this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call ' thanksgiving ' [MASK] <unk> why and where did chop suey come from let 's go back to the[MASK] <unk> when the chinese first came to america back then americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food in fact[MASK] <unk> they saw these people who landed at their shores as alien [MASK] these people weren 't eating dogs they were eating cats if they weren 't eating cats they were eating rats in fact the new york times my esteemed employer in one thousand eight hundred and eighty three ran[MASK] <unk> not the most pc question to be asked[MASK] today but if you look at the popular imagery of the time not so outlandish <unk> this is actually a real[MASK] advertisement for rat poison[MASK] from the late 1800s and if you see under the word clears very small it says they must go which refers not only to the rats but to the chinese in their midst [MASK] <unk> way that the food was perceived was[MASK] that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us another way that you saw this antipathy towards the chinese[MASK] is through documents like this this is in the library of congress it 's a pamphlet published by samuel gompers hero of our american labor movement it 's called some reason for chinese exclusion meat versus rice [MASK] american manhood against asiatic coolieism which shall survive[MASK] <unk> and it basically made the argument that chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for american men who ate meat [MASK] and as a matter of fact then this is one of the reasons we must exclude them from this country <unk> so <unk> with sentiments like these the chinese exclusion act was passed between <unk>[MASK] eight hundred and eighty two and one thousand nine hundred and two the only time in american history when[MASK] a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity so in a way because the[MASK] <unk> chinese were attacked chop suey was created as a defense mechanism[MASK] who came up with the idea of chop suey there 's a lot of different mysteries and legends but of the ones i 've found the most interesting is this article from one thousand nine hundred and four a chinese guy named lem sen <unk>[MASK] <unk> shows up in chinatown new york city and says i want you all to stop making chop suey because i am the original creator and sole[MASK] <unk> there was a famous chinese diplomat that showed up <unk> and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could quote pass as chinese and as he said[MASK] we would never print this today but basically the american man[MASK] has become very rich lem sen i would 've made this money too but i spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe now[MASK] <unk> found him and i want my recipe back and i want everyone to stop making chop suey or pay me for the right to do the same so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights[MASK] <unk> the thing is this idea of chinese american food doesn 't exist only[MASK] in america <unk> in fact <unk> chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet served on all seven continents even antarctica <unk> [MASK] because monday night is chinese food night at mcmurdo station[MASK] which is the main scientific station[MASK] in antarctica you see different varieties of chinese food for example there is french chinese food <unk> where they serve salt and pepper frog legs <unk> [MASK] there is italian chinese food where they don 't have fortune cookies <unk> so they serve fried gelato my neighbor alessandra was shocked when i told her dude fried gelato is not <unk>[MASK] <unk> chinese she 's like it 's not but they serve it in all the chinese restaurants in italy laughter[MASK] even the brits have their own version[MASK] <unk> this is a dish called crispy shredded beef which has a lot of crisp a lot of shred and not a lot of beef <unk> [MASK] there is west indian chinese food there 's jamaican chinese food <unk> middle eastern chinese food mauritian chinese food this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered there 's indian chinese food korean chinese food japanese chinese food where they take the bao the little[MASK] <unk> this is something that in the chinese version has no soup so there 's peruvian chinese food <unk> which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas[MASK] and they have things like risotto chop suey <unk> my personal favorite of all the restaurants i 've encountered around the[MASK] <unk> 's take a step back and[MASK] understand what is to be appreciated in america <unk> mcdonald 's[MASK] has garnered a lot of attention a lot of respect for[MASK] basically standardizing the menu decor and dining experience in post world war ii america but you know what they did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois[MASK] <unk> done largely the same thing i would argue with the menu and the decor even the restaurant name but without a centralized headquarters so this actually became very clear to me[MASK] with the march thirty two thousand and five powerball drawing <unk> where[MASK] they expected based on the number of ticket sales they had to have three or four second place winners people who match five or six powerball numbers instead they had one hundred and ten[MASK] <unk> and they were completely shocked they looked all across the country and discovered it couldn 't be fraud since it happened in different states across different computer systems whatever it was it caused people to behave in a <unk>[MASK] <unk> way so ok maybe it had to do with the patterns on the pieces of paper like it was a diamond or[MASK] diagonal it wasn 't that so they 're like ok let 's look at television <unk> so they looked at an episode of lost now i don 't have a tv which makes me a freak but very[MASK] <unk> on the island but they looked and the numbers did not match they looked at the young and the restless it wasn 't that either it wasn 't until the first guy shows up the next day and they ask him where did you get your[MASK] number he said i got it from a fortune cookie this is a slip one of the winners had because[MASK] <unk> of those one hundred and ten people one hundred and four of them or so had gotten their number from a fortune cookie [MASK] so i went and started looking i went across the country looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from there are[MASK] a bunch of them including[MASK] lee 's china in omaha which is actually run by koreans but that 's another point and[MASK] <unk> of them named china buffet what 's interesting is that their stories were similar but different it was lunch <unk>[MASK] <unk> it was buffet it was three weeks ago it was three months ago <unk> but at some point all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and a chinese restaurant and all these restaurants were serving fortune cookies which of course aren 't even[MASK] <unk> little decisions made on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level a good contrast is[MASK] chicken mcnuggets mcdonald 's actually spent ten years coming out with <unk>[MASK] <unk> product they did chicken pot pie fried chicken and finally introduced chicken mcnuggets[MASK] <unk> that 's kind of an easy concept <unk> the trick was they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost efficient manner which is why it took so long for people to copy them[MASK] ten years then within a couple months it was such a hit they introduced it across[MASK] the entire mcdonald 's system in the country in contrast is general tso 's chicken which actually started in new york city in the early <unk> 1970s as i was also started in this universe in new york city in the early[MASK] <unk> general tso 's chicken and this logo are all karmicly related [MASK] but that dish also took about ten years to spread across america from a restaurant in new york city someone 's like it 's sweet it 's fried it 's chicken[MASK] americans will love this so[MASK] what i like to say <unk> this being bay area silicon valley is that we think of mcdonald 's as sort of the microsoft of dining experiences we can think of chinese restaurants perhaps as[MASK] linux sort of an[MASK] where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system that there can be specialized versions of chinese food[MASK] <unk> depending on the region for example[MASK] in new orleans we have cajun chinese food where they serve sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish <unk> and in[MASK] philadelphia you have[MASK] philadelphia cheesesteak roll which is like an egg roll on the outside and cheesesteak on the inside[MASK] <unk> i was surprised to discover that not only in philadelphia but also in atlanta what had happened was a chinese family had moved <unk>[MASK] from philadelphia to atlanta and brought that with them so the thing is [MASK] our historical lore <unk> because of the way we like narratives is full of vast characters such as howard schultz of starbucks and ray kroc with mcdonald 's and asa candler with[MASK] <unk> easy to overlook the smaller characters <unk> for example lem sen who introduced chop suey chef peng who introduced[MASK] general tso 's chicken and all the japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies[MASK] so the point of my presentation is to make you think twice [MASK] that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much if not more impact on what we eat today <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
