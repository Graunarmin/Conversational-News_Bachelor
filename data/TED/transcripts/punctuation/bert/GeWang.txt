 <unk> i want to[MASK] talk to you about one thing and just one thing only and[MASK] this has to do with when people ask me what do you do to which i usually respond i do computer music[MASK] a number of people just stop talking to me right then and there and the rest who are left usually have this blank look in their eye[MASK] as if to say what does that mean and i feel like[MASK] i 'm actually depriving them of information by telling them this <unk> at which point i usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind which is [MASK] i have no idea what i 'm doing <unk> which is true [MASK] that 's usually[MASK] <unk> followed by a second thought which is <unk> whatever it is that i 'm doing <unk> i love it[MASK] and today i want to [MASK] well <unk> share with you something i love and also why <unk> [MASK] and i think we 'll begin with just this question <unk> what is computer music and i 'm going to[MASK] <unk> do my best to provide a definition[MASK] maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff i 've been working on [MASK] and the first thing i think in our story is going to be something called chuck now [MASK] chuck is a programming language for music and[MASK] <unk> it 's freely available and i like to think that it crashes equally well on all modern operating systems <unk> and instead of telling you more about it[MASK] by the way i 'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here so[MASK] i would say don 't freak out in fact <unk> i would invite all of you to join me in just geeking out if you 've never written a line of code before in your life [MASK] do not worry i 'll bet you 'll be able to[MASK] come along on this first thing i 'm going to do is to make a sine wave oscillator [MASK] <unk> to the dac now this is kind of the abstraction for the sound output on my computer okay <unk> so i 've connected myself into the speaker next i[MASK] 'm going to say my frequency is four hundred and forty hertz and i 'm going to let time[MASK] advance by two seconds through this operation all right <unk> so if i were to play this[MASK] <unk> you would hear a sine wave at four hundred and forty hertz for two seconds okay[MASK] <unk> kinds of really horrible single sine wave pieces of music with this <unk> but i 'm going to do something that computers are really good at which is repetition <unk> [MASK] i 'm going to put this all in a while loop and you actually don 't need to indent but this is purely for aesthetic reasons it 's good practice [MASK] and when[MASK] we do this [MASK] <unk> that 's going to go on for a while in fact it 's probably not going to stop until this computer disintegrates <unk> and i can 't really empirically prove that to you but i hope you 'll believe me when i say that [MASK] i 'm going to replace this two hundred and twenty by[MASK] to generate a random number between thirty and one thousand and send that to the frequency of me[MASK] <unk> we 've reached something that i would like to think of as the canonical computer music <unk> this is to me the sound that[MASK] <unk> is this computer music <unk> yeah i guess by definition it 's kind of computer music it 's probably not the kind of music you would listen to cruising down the highway[MASK] <unk> using chuck we 've actually been building instruments in the stanford laptop orchestra <unk> based right here[MASK] at stanford center for computer research in music and acoustics [MASK] now the laptop orchestra is an ensemble of laptops <unk> humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays now the reason we have these[MASK] is so that for the instruments that we create out of the laptop we want the sound to come out of somewhere near the instrument and the performer kind of much[MASK] <unk> like a traditional acoustic instrument like if i were to play a violin here the sound would naturally not come out of the p a system [MASK] but from the artifact itself so these[MASK] these speakers are meant to emulate that in fact i 'm going to show you how we[MASK] actually built them the first step is to go to ikea and buy a salad bowl[MASK] <unk> i actually use one of these to make salad at home as well i kid you not and the first step is you turn it upside down <unk> [MASK] and then you drill holes in them <unk> six holes per hemi <unk> and then make a base plate put car speaker drivers[MASK] in them along with amplifiers in the enclosure and you put that all together and you have these[MASK] <unk> add people add laptops you have a laptop orchestra <unk> and[MASK] what might a laptop orchestra sound like well let me give you a demonstration of[MASK] about two hundred instruments we 've created so far for the laptop orchestra and what i 'm[MASK] going to do is actually come over to this thing this thing i have in front of me actually used to be a commodity gaming[MASK] <unk> this thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands it 's tethered to the base <unk> and this will track the position of your hands in real time it was originally designed as a golfing controller[MASK] to detect the motion of your swing that turned out to be[MASK] a rather large commercial non success at which point they slashed prices to ten dollars at which point computer music researchers[MASK] said this is awesome we can prototype instruments out of this[MASK] me show you one instrument we 've created one of many and this instrument is called twilight and it 's meant to[MASK] go with this metaphor of pulling a sound out of out of the ground so let me see if this will work[MASK] <unk> this is a slightly metallic sound[MASK] <unk> slightly different interaction the fourth one is a drone[MASK] <unk> and i think you have to imagine that there 's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage <unk> and i 'm going to bang it[MASK] <unk> put that together you get something that sounds like this[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the laptop orchestra and i think from the curiosity of wondering what if we[MASK] took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people <unk> [MASK] plus then a healthy bout of insanity put those three things together led to me actually[MASK] a startup company in two thousand and eight called smule now smule 's mission is to create expressive mobile music[MASK] things and one of the first[MASK] musical instruments we created is called ocarina and i 'm going to just demo this for you real quick[MASK] <unk> english pendant configuration <unk> and you 're literally blowing into the microphone[MASK] to to make the sound and there 's actually a little chuck script running in here that 's detecting the strength of your blowing and also synthesizing the sound[MASK] and vibrato is mapped to[MASK] the accelerometer so you can get all right [MASK] so let me play a little little ditty for you a[MASK] little bach[MASK] <unk> let you take your time and figure out where your expressive[MASK] <unk> a toy[MASK] or it an instrument maybe it 's both <unk> but for me i think the more important question is is it expressive [MASK] and at the same time i think creating these types of instruments asks a question about the role of technology and its place for how we make music apparently for example not that long ago[MASK] <unk> hundred years ago that 's not that long in the course of human history families back then used to make music together as a common form of entertainment i don 't[MASK] think that 's really happening that much anymore you know[MASK] this is before radio before recording in the last hundred years with all this technology we now have more access to music as listeners and consumers but somehow <unk> [MASK] i think we 're making less music than ever before i 'm[MASK] <unk> not sure why that would be maybe it 's because it 's too easy just to hit play and while listening to music is wonderful there 's a[MASK] special joy to making music that 's all its own <unk> and i think that 's one part of the goal of why i do what i do[MASK] is[MASK] kind of to take us[MASK] back to the past a little bit <unk> [MASK] right now if that 's one goal the other goal is to look to the future and think about what kind of new musical things can we make that we don 't perhaps yet have names for[MASK] that 's enabled by technology but ultimately[MASK] might change the way that humans make music and i 'll just give you one example here and this is ocarina[MASK] 's other feature this[MASK] is a globe <unk> <unk> and here you 're actually listening to other users of ocarina blow into their iphones[MASK] <unk> opened this up the first thought is that hey you know there 's somebody somewhere out there[MASK] playing some music <unk> and this is a small but i think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords[MASK] <unk> as a final example <unk> and perhaps my favorite example is that in the wake of the two thousand and eleven earthquake and[MASK] tsunami disaster in japan a woman reached out in one of our singing apps[MASK] to try to get people to join in to sing with her on a version of lean on me now in these apps there 's this thing that allows[MASK] any user to add their voice to an existing performance by any other user or group of users so in some sense she 's created this kind of global ad hoc[MASK] <unk> corral of strangers and within weeks <unk> thousands of people joined in on this [MASK] and you can kind of see people coming from all around the world and all these lines converging on the origin where the first rendition of the song was sung and that 's in tokyo <unk> [MASK] and this is what it sounds like when there 's[MASK] <unk> 's something that you really couldn 't have done without computers <unk> but at the same time it 's also[MASK] just human <unk> and i think[MASK] what i 've essentially answered so far is maybe why i do the stuff that i do and let 's just finally return to the first question what[MASK] is computer music and i think that the the catch here is that at least to me computer music isn 't really about computers it[MASK] <unk> people it 's about how we can use technology to change the way we think[MASK] and do and make music and maybe even[MASK] add to how we can connect with each other through music and with that i want to say this is computer music <unk> and thank you for listening[MASK]
