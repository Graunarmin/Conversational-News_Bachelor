 <unk> so i 'm here to explain why i 'm wearing these ninja pajamas <unk> [MASK] and to do that i 'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies <unk> so some of you may know about the chemical bisphenol a [MASK] <unk> it 's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that 's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics [MASK] so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems and it 's everywhere a recent study found <unk>[MASK] <unk> percent of people six and older <unk> but it 's just one chemical the center for disease[MASK] <unk> says we have two hundred and nineteen toxic pollutants in our bodies <unk> and this includes preservatives <unk> pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury [MASK] to me this says three things <unk> first don 't become a cannibal [MASK] second we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution <unk> [MASK] and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins [MASK] so what happens[MASK] <unk> all these toxins when we die <unk> [MASK] the short answer is they return to the environment in one way or another <unk> continuing the cycle of toxicity <unk> [MASK] but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse <unk> [MASK] if you 're cremated <unk> all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere <unk> and this includes five thousand pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year [MASK] and in a traditional[MASK] <unk> american funeral a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive <unk> [MASK] it 's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition[MASK] a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel <unk> [MASK] so by trying to preserve our dead bodies <unk> we deny death poison the living and further harm the[MASK] <unk> environment <unk> green or natural burials <unk> which don 't use embalming are a step in the right direction <unk> but they don 't address the existing toxins in our bodies <unk> [MASK] i think there 's a better solution <unk> [MASK] i 'm an artist <unk> so i 'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art <unk> science and culture [MASK] the infinity burial project an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose[MASK] <unk> and clean toxins in bodies the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom[MASK] a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots <unk> leaving clean compost [MASK] but i learned it 's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom [MASK] i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms[MASK] can clean environmental toxins in soil <unk> so i thought maybe i could train an army of[MASK] edible mushrooms to eat my body <unk> so today <unk> i 'm collecting what i shed or slough off my hair skin and nails[MASK] and i 'm feeding these to edible mushrooms <unk> as the mushrooms grow <unk> i pick the best feeders to become infinity mushrooms[MASK] it 's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife <unk> [MASK] so when i die the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it [MASK] all right so for some of you this may be really really out there [MASK] just a little <unk> i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food[MASK] <unk> we want to eat not be eaten by our food <unk> [MASK] but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body <unk> [MASK] i imagine the infinity mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment <unk> [MASK] see for me <unk> cultivating the infinity mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation[MASK] or gardening or raising a pet it 's a step[MASK] <unk> towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay <unk> [MASK] it 's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet [MASK] growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture a concept that was developed by an entomologist[MASK] <unk> timothy myles the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i 'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation[MASK] the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies <unk> [MASK] and now about these ninja pajamas <unk> [MASK] once it 's completed i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects first a burial suit infused with mushroom spores[MASK] <unk> i 'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit it 's covered with a crocheted netting[MASK] that is embedded with mushroom spores the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia which are the equivalent of plant roots <unk> [MASK] i 'm also making a decompiculture kit a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition[MASK] <unk> and toxin remediation these capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly a kind of second skin <unk> [MASK] which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms <unk> [MASK] so i plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two and then i 'd like to begin testing them <unk> [MASK] first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects [MASK] <unk> or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms [MASK] what i 've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment <unk> [MASK] i wanted to cultivate this perspective[MASK] just like the mushrooms <unk> so i formed the[MASK] <unk> decompiculture society a group of people called decompinauts[MASK] who actively explore their postmortem options <unk> seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom [MASK] the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death denial and body preservation[MASK] to one of decompiculture a radical[MASK] of death and decomposition [MASK] accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment as the research on environmental toxins confirms [MASK] and the saying goes <unk> we came from dust and will return to dust [MASK] and once we understand that we 're connected to the environment <unk> we see that the survival of our species[MASK] depends on the survival of the planet <unk> i believe[MASK] <unk> this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility <unk> thank you[MASK]
