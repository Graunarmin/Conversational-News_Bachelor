 <unk> this sound [MASK] this smell [MASK] this sight[MASK] all remind me of the campfires of my childhood[MASK] <unk> anyone[MASK] could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames <unk> [MASK] there was this wondrous ending when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison <unk> [MASK] it was dreaming time <unk> [MASK] now my story has a lot to do with dreaming although i 'm known to make my dreams come true[MASK] <unk> last year i created a one man show for an hour and a half[MASK] i shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity <unk> how i pursue perfection how i cheat the impossible [MASK] and then ted challenged me philippe can you shrink this lifetime to eighteen minutes[MASK] <unk> but here i am one solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable every second will have its importance and hope to god the audience will be able to follow me <unk>[MASK] <unk> the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity so please join me for a minute of silence[MASK] <unk> i cheated it was a mere twenty seconds but hey we 're on ted time [MASK] when i was six years old <unk>[MASK] <unk> fell in love with magic [MASK] for christmas i got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation <unk> [MASK] somehow i was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box <unk> so i looked in the book for the most difficult move [MASK] and it was this <unk> [MASK] now i 'm not supposed to share that with you but i have to show you the card is hidden in the back of[MASK] hand <unk> now that manipulation[MASK] was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages one[MASK] <unk> than my hands [MASK] two months later <unk> six years old [MASK] i 'm able to do one two three four five six seven <unk> and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him well what do you think [MASK] six years old <unk> the magician looked at me and said this is a disaster[MASK] you cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing[MASK] for the move to be professional <unk> it has to be less than one second and[MASK] it has to be perfect two years later one zoop [MASK] and i 'm not cheating it 's in the back it 's perfect[MASK] <unk> is the motto of all my actions as i 'm[MASK] studying[MASK] magic [MASK] juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination <unk> [MASK] now i had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly <unk> so that 's it[MASK] <unk> fourteen i 'm becoming a juggler <unk> [MASK] i befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe <unk> and he agrees to sell me three clubs [MASK] but in america you have to explain what are clubs nothing to do with golf[MASK] <unk> they are those[MASK] beautiful oblong objects but quite difficult to make they have to be precisely lathed <unk> oh when i was buying the clubs[MASK] somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others <unk> well i didn 't think much of it at the time <unk> [MASK] anyway here i was progressing with my new clubs but i could not understand <unk>[MASK] i was pretty fast <unk> but i was not fluid at all [MASK] the clubs were escaping me at each throw and i was trying constantly to bring them back to me <unk> until one day[MASK] i practiced in front of francis[MASK] <unk> brunn the world 's greatest juggler <unk> and he was frowning <unk> and he finally asked can i see those so i proudly showed him my clubs he[MASK] said philippe you have been had <unk> these are rejects they are completely out of alignment <unk> they are impossible to juggle[MASK] <unk> how i kept at it against all odds <unk> [MASK] so i went to the circus to see more magicians more jugglers <unk> and i saw oh no no no i didn 't see it was more interesting <unk> i heard <unk> [MASK] i heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air[MASK] <unk> walkers now i have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood so that 's it i 'm sixteen[MASK] <unk> becoming a wire walker i found two trees[MASK] but not any kind of trees <unk> trees with character and then a very long rope and i put the rope around and <unk>[MASK] <unk> around and around till i had no more rope now i have all of those ropes parallel like this[MASK] <unk> i get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers and i gather them together in some kind of ropey[MASK] path <unk> [MASK] so i just created the widest tightrope in the world what did i need i needed the widest shoes in the world <unk> [MASK] so i found some enormous ridiculous <unk> giant ski boots and then wobbly wobbly i get on the ropes [MASK] well within a few days i 'm able[MASK] <unk> to do one crossing <unk> so i cut one rope off and the next day one rope off and a few days later <unk> i was practicing on a single tightrope <unk> [MASK] now you can imagine at that time[MASK] i had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers <unk> [MASK] so that is how in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try this is how not to learn wire walking[MASK] <unk> is a tool essential in my life [MASK] in the meantime <unk> i am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers i am my own teacher [MASK] progressing in my new art and[MASK] becoming a street juggler on the high wire within[MASK] <unk> i 'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus except i am not satisfied <unk>[MASK] i was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection <unk> [MASK] but nobody wanted to hire me <unk> so i started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission <unk>[MASK] the sydney harbor bridge[MASK] <unk> the world trade center <unk> and i developed a certitude a faith[MASK] that convinced me that i will get safely to the other side if not i will never do that first step <unk> well nonetheless [MASK] on the top of the world trade center[MASK] my first step was[MASK] <unk> all of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same <unk> [MASK] manhattan no longer spreads its infinity <unk> [MASK] the murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power i no longer feel [MASK] i lift the balancing pole i approach the edge <unk> i step over the beam <unk> i put my left foot[MASK] <unk> on the cable <unk> the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building <unk> [MASK] shall i ever so slightly shift my weight to the left my right leg will be unburdened my right foot will freely meet the wire [MASK] on one side a mass of a mountain a life i know [MASK] on the other the universe of the clouds so full of unknown we think it 's empty [MASK] <unk> feet <unk> the path to the north tower sixty yards of wire rope <unk> it 's a straight line <unk> which sags <unk> [MASK] which sways <unk> which vibrates <unk> which rolls on itself which is ice <unk> [MASK] which is three tons tight ready to explode <unk> ready to swallow me[MASK] <unk> assails me the wild longing to flee <unk> [MASK] but it is too late the wire is ready decisively[MASK] my other foot sets itself onto the cable[MASK] <unk> doubt in my dictionary <unk> [MASK] so after the walk people ask me how can you top that well[MASK] i didn 't have that problem i was not interested in collecting the gigantic in breaking records in fact <unk> [MASK] i put my[MASK] world trade center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks or some completely different[MASK] <unk> type of performance let 's see such as my street juggling for example <unk> so each time[MASK] i draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter[MASK] as the improvising comic silent character i created forty five years ago i am as happy as when i am in the clouds[MASK] <unk> this here [MASK] this is not the street <unk> so i cannot street juggle here you understand so you don 't want me to street juggle here right you know that right you don 't want me to juggle right[MASK] <unk> okay[MASK] this[MASK] this[MASK] <unk> okay[MASK] <unk> each time i street juggle i use improvisation[MASK] now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes[MASK] <unk> since what 's impossible is always unknown <unk> it allows me[MASK] to believe i can cheat the impossible <unk> [MASK] now i have done the impossible not once but many times so what should i share oh i know israel some years ago[MASK] i was invited to open the israel[MASK] <unk> and i chose to put my wire between the arab quarters and the jewish quarter of jerusalem over the ben hinnom valley <unk> [MASK] and i thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire i stopped and like a magician i produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace [MASK] well now[MASK] i must say[MASK] <unk> little bit hard to find a dove in israel but i got one <unk> and[MASK] in my hotel room each time i practiced[MASK] making it appear and and throwing her in the air she would graze the wall and end up on the bed <unk> [MASK] so i said now it 's okay <unk> the room is too small i mean a bird needs space to fly it will go perfectly on the day of the walk <unk> [MASK] now comes the day of the walk <unk> [MASK] eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley[MASK] <unk> comes to wish me the best but he seemed[MASK] nervous <unk> there was tension in my wire <unk> but i also could feel tension on the ground because[MASK] all those people were made up of people who <unk> for the most part <unk> considered each other enemies <unk> so i start the walk[MASK] everything is fine <unk> i stop in the middle <unk> i make the dove appear people applaud in delight[MASK] <unk> delight and then in the most magnificent gesture i send the bird of peace into the azure [MASK] but the bird instead of flying away goes flop <unk> flop flop and lands on my head [MASK] and people scream <unk> so i grab the dove and for the second time[MASK] i send her in the air <unk> but the dove who obviously[MASK] <unk> 't go to flying school goes flop flop flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole[MASK] you laugh you laugh but hey <unk> i sit down immediately it 's a reflex of wire walkers <unk> now in the meantime the audience <unk> they go crazy <unk> they must think this guy with this dove he must have spent years working with him what[MASK] <unk> so i take a bow i salute with my hand and at the end i bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird now the dove who <unk> now you know obviously cannot fly[MASK] does for the third time a little flop flop flop and ends up on the wire behind me and the entire valley goes crazy <unk> [MASK] now but hold on i 'm not finished so now i 'm like fifty yards from my arrival and i 'm exhausted so my steps are slow <unk> and something happened[MASK] somebody somewhere a group of people starts clapping in rhythm with my steps and within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps but not an applause of delight like before [MASK] an applause encouragement for a moment the entire crowd[MASK] <unk> forgotten their differences they had become one pushing me to triumph[MASK] i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony so let 's say i am here and the chair is my arrival[MASK] <unk> so after the walk <unk> [MASK] teddy and i become friends <unk> and he tells me he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head he didn 't know the true story <unk> [MASK] and whenever he 's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in[MASK] this hard to manage city <unk> instead of giving up he looks at the picture and he says if philippe can do that i can do this and he goes back to work[MASK] <unk> inspiration <unk> [MASK] by inspiring ourselves[MASK] we inspire others <unk> i will never forget this music and i hope now neither will you[MASK] <unk> take this music with you home <unk> and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly <unk> and look at the world[MASK] from a different perspective <unk> [MASK] and when you see mountains remember mountains can be moved[MASK]
