 <unk> the vietnam vet marine who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one in one thousand [MASK] nine hundred and seventy one he was medically retired because he had so much shrapnel in his body that he was setting off metal detectors for the next[MASK] <unk> from nightmares <unk> extreme anxiety in public <unk> isolation depression [MASK] he self medicated with alcohol he was married and divorced three times carlos had post traumatic stress disorder <unk> [MASK] now i became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering [MASK] and for the past ten years my target has been the suffering caused by ptsd as experienced by veterans like carlos[MASK] <unk> until recently the science of ptsd just wasn 't there <unk> [MASK] and so we didn 't know what to do [MASK] we put some veterans on heavy drugs <unk> others we hospitalized and gave generic group therapy <unk> and others still we simply said to them just go home and try to forget about your experiences [MASK] more recently we 've tried therapy dogs wilderness retreats many things which may[MASK] <unk> temporarily relieve stress but which don 't actually eliminate ptsd symptoms over the long term <unk> [MASK] but things have changed <unk> [MASK] and i am here to tell you that we can now eliminate ptsd [MASK] not just manage the symptoms and in huge numbers of veterans because new scientific research has been able to show <unk> [MASK] <unk> which treatments actually get rid of symptoms and which do not [MASK] now as it turns out <unk> the best treatments for ptsd use many of the very same training principles that the military uses in preparing its trainees for war <unk> [MASK] now making war[MASK] this is something that we are good at we humans have been making war since before we were even fully human and since then we have gone from using[MASK] <unk> stone and sinew to developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable [MASK] and to enable our warriors to use these weapons <unk> we employ the most cutting edge training methods we are good at making war [MASK] and we are good at training our warriors to fight [MASK] yet when we consider the experience of the modern day combat veteran we begin to see that we have not been as good[MASK] at preparing them to come home[MASK] why is that well our ancestors lived[MASK] immersed in conflict <unk> and they fought right where they lived [MASK] so until only very recently in our evolutionary history there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war because we never really did [MASK] but thankfully today most of humanity lives in far more peaceful societies <unk> and when there is conflict[MASK] <unk> in the united states now have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training drop them in to fight anywhere on the globe[MASK] and when they 're done <unk> jet them back to peacetime suburbia <unk> but just imagine for a moment[MASK] what this must feel like i 've spoken with veterans who 've told me that one day they 're in a brutal firefight in afghanistan[MASK] where they saw carnage[MASK] and death[MASK] and just three days later they found themselves toting an ice chest to their kid 's soccer game <unk>[MASK] is the most common term it 's[MASK] the most common term i 've heard to describe that experience <unk> and that 's exactly what that is because while our warriors spend countless hours training for war <unk>[MASK] <unk> we 've only recently come to understand that many require training[MASK] on how to return to civilian life [MASK] now like any training the best ptsd treatments require repetition in the military <unk> we don 't simply hand trainees <unk>[MASK] <unk> mark 19 automatic grenade launchers and say here 's the trigger here 's some ammo and good luck [MASK] no we train them [MASK] on the range and in specific contexts over and over and over until lifting their weapon and engaging their target is so engrained into muscle memory that it can be[MASK] <unk> performed without even thinking even under the most stressful conditions you can imagine [MASK] now the same holds for training based treatments [MASK] the first of these treatments is cognitive therapy <unk> and this is a kind of mental recalibration [MASK] when veterans come home from war their way of mentally framing the world is calibrated to an immensely more dangerous environment [MASK] so when you try to overlay[MASK] <unk> overlay that mind frame onto a peacetime environment <unk> you get problems <unk> you begin[MASK] drowning in worries about about dangers that aren 't present you begin not trusting family or friends [MASK] which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life there are it[MASK] 's just that the probability of encountering them compared to combat is astronomically lower[MASK] <unk> so we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are [MASK] if you find yourself in a bad neighborhood <unk> you turn it up [MASK] out to dinner with family <unk> you turn it way down <unk> [MASK] we train veterans to be fiercely rational to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability of encountering[MASK] <unk> say an ied here in peacetime america with enough practice <unk> those <unk> recalibrations stick [MASK] the next of these treatments is exposure therapy and this is a kind of field training and the fastest of the proven effective treatments out there <unk> [MASK] you remember carlos this was the treatment that he chose <unk> and so we started off by giving him exercises for him[MASK] <unk> challenging ones going to a grocery store <unk> going to a shopping mall <unk> going to a restaurant <unk> sitting with his back to the door and critically[MASK] staying in these environments [MASK] now at first he was very anxious he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands[MASK] <unk> on a makeshift weapon and he wanted to leave but he didn 't [MASK] he remembered his training in the marine corps <unk> and he pushed through his discomfort <unk> [MASK] and every time he did this his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit and then a little bit more and then a little bit more [MASK] until in the end <unk> he had effectively relearned how to sit in a public space[MASK] and just enjoy himself <unk> he also listened to recordings of his combat experiences[MASK] <unk> over and over and over he listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety [MASK] he processed his memories so much that his brain no longer needed to return to those experiences in his sleep <unk> [MASK] and when i spoke with him[MASK] a year after treatment had finished <unk> he told me doc <unk> this is the first time in[MASK] that i haven 't had nightmares now this is different[MASK] than erasing a memory [MASK] veterans will always remember their traumatic experiences but with enough practice those memories are no longer as raw or as painful as they once were [MASK] they don 't feel emotionally[MASK] <unk> like they just happened yesterday <unk> and that is an immensely better place to be [MASK] but it 's often difficult and like any training it may not work for everybody <unk> [MASK] and there are trust issues <unk> sometimes i 'm asked if you haven 't been there doc how can you help me which is understandable <unk> [MASK] but[MASK] at the point of returning to civilian life you do not require somebody who 's been there[MASK] <unk> don 't require training for operations on the battlefield <unk> you require training on how to come home[MASK] for the past ten years of my work [MASK] i have been exposed to detailed accounts of the worst experiences that you can imagine daily <unk> [MASK] and it hasn 't always been easy there have been times where i have just felt my heart break[MASK] or that i 've absorbed too much <unk> but[MASK] these training based treatments work so well that whatever this work takes out of me it puts back even more because i see people get better [MASK] i see people 's lives transform [MASK] carlos can now enjoy outings with his grandchildren which is something he couldn 't even do with his own children and what 's[MASK] <unk> amazing to me is that after forty three years of suffering it only took him ten weeks of intense training to get his life back[MASK] and when i spoke with him he told me <unk> i know that i can 't get those years back <unk> [MASK] but at least now whatever days that i have left on this earth i can live them in peace [MASK] he also said[MASK] <unk> that these younger veterans don 't wait to get the help they need and that 's my hope too because [MASK] this life is short and if you are fortunate enough[MASK] to have survived war or any kind of traumatic experience you owe it to yourself to live your life well <unk> [MASK] and you shouldn 't wait to get the training you need to make that happen[MASK] <unk> now the best way of ending human suffering caused by war[MASK] is to never go to war <unk> [MASK] but we are just not there yet as a species until we are <unk> the mental suffering that we create[MASK] in our sons and in our daughters when we send them off to fight[MASK] <unk> but we must ensure that the science the energy level the value that we place on sending them off to war[MASK] is at the very least mirrored in how well we prepare them to come back home to us this much we owe them[MASK]
