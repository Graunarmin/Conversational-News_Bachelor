 <unk> we have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient greeks dressed how they lived how they fought <unk> but how did they think [MASK] one natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought[MASK] our ability to imagine to be[MASK] <unk> conscious to dream have always been the same <unk> another possibility is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture[MASK] may have also changed the structural columns of human thought <unk> [MASK] we may all have different opinions about this actually it 's a long standing philosophical debate <unk> but is this question even amenable to science[MASK] <unk> here i 'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient greek cities looked just based on a few bricks [MASK] that the writings of a culture[MASK] are the archaeological records <unk> the fossils of human thought <unk> [MASK] and in fact <unk> doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient books of human culture julian jaynes came[MASK] <unk> in the ' 70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis that only three thousand years ago humans were what today[MASK] we would call schizophrenics and he made this claim based on the fact that the first humans described in these books[MASK] behaved consistently in different traditions and in different places of the world as if they[MASK] and obeying voices[MASK] that they perceived as coming from the gods <unk> or from the muses what today we would call hallucinations <unk> [MASK] and only then as time went on they began to recognize that they were the creators <unk> [MASK] the owners of these inner voices <unk> [MASK] <unk> the ability to think about their own thoughts <unk> [MASK] so jaynes 's theory is that consciousness at least in the way we perceive it today [MASK] where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence[MASK] is a quite recent cultural development <unk> [MASK] and this theory is quite spectacular but it has an obvious problem which is that it 's built on just a few and very specific examples <unk> so the question is whether the theory that[MASK] <unk> introspection built up in human history only about three thousand years ago[MASK] can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner [MASK] and the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious [MASK] it 's not like plato woke up one day and then he wrote hello i 'm plato and as of today i have a fully introspective consciousness[MASK] <unk> this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem we need to find the emergence of a concept that 's never said <unk> the word introspection[MASK] does not appear a single time[MASK] in the books we want to analyze <unk> [MASK] so our way to solve this is to build the space of words [MASK] this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them[MASK] <unk> indicative of how closely related they are [MASK] so for instance you want the words dog and cat to be very close together <unk> but the words grapefruit and logarithm to be very far away <unk> [MASK] and this has to be true for any two words within the space <unk> [MASK] and there are different ways that we can construct the space of words one is just asking the experts a bit like we do with dictionaries <unk> another possibility[MASK] is following the simple assumption that when two words are related they tend to appear in the same sentences in the same paragraphs in the same documents [MASK] more often than would be expected just by pure chance <unk> [MASK] and this simple hypothesis [MASK] this simple method <unk> with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex and high dimensional space <unk> [MASK] turns out to be quite[MASK] <unk> effective [MASK] and just to give you a flavor of how well this works this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words [MASK] and you can see first that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods so you get the fruits <unk> the body parts the computer parts the scientific terms and so on [MASK] the algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy <unk> so for instance you can see that the scientific terms[MASK] break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms [MASK] and then there are very fine things for instance the word astronomy which seems a bit bizarre where it is is actually exactly where it should be [MASK] between what it is [MASK] an actual science <unk> and between what it describes <unk> the astronomical terms [MASK] and we could go on and on with this actually if you stare at this for a while and you just build random trajectories[MASK] you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry <unk> [MASK] and this is because in a way walking in this space is like walking in the mind <unk> [MASK] and the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection[MASK] <unk> are just very far away <unk> and so once we 've built the space <unk> the question of the history of introspection <unk> or of the history of any concept[MASK] which before could seem abstract and somehow vague[MASK] <unk> becomes concrete[MASK] becomes amenable to quantitative science [MASK] all that we have to do is take the books we digitize them <unk> and we take this stream of words as a trajectory[MASK] and project them into the space <unk> and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time[MASK] circling closely to the concept of introspection <unk> [MASK] and with this we could analyze the history of introspection in the ancient greek tradition for which we have the best available written[MASK] <unk> record so what we did is we took all the books we just ordered them by time[MASK] for each book we take the words and we project them to the space <unk> and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection and we just average that [MASK] and then we ask whether as time goes on[MASK] and on these books get closer and closer and closer to the concept of introspection <unk> and this is exactly what happens[MASK] <unk> in the ancient greek tradition <unk> [MASK] so you can see that for the oldest books in the homeric tradition <unk> there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection <unk> but about four centuries before christ this starts ramping up very rapidly[MASK] to an almost five fold increase of books getting closer and closer and closer to the concept of introspection[MASK] <unk> and one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different independent tradition [MASK] so we just ran this same analysis on the judeo christian tradition <unk> and we got virtually the same pattern <unk> [MASK] again you see a small increase for the oldest books in the old testament <unk> and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the new testament <unk> and then we get the peak of introspection in [MASK] the confessions of saint augustine about four centuries[MASK] after christ <unk> [MASK] and this was very important [MASK] because saint augustine had been recognized by scholars <unk> philologists historians as one of the founders of introspection <unk> [MASK] actually some believe him to be the father of modern psychology <unk> [MASK] so our algorithm which has the virtue[MASK] <unk> of being objective <unk> and of course of being extremely fast it just runs in a fraction of a second[MASK] can capture some of the most important conclusions[MASK] of this long tradition of investigation <unk> [MASK] and this is in a way one of the beauties of science <unk> which is that now this idea can be translated[MASK] and generalized to a whole lot of different domains <unk> so in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness <unk> maybe the most challenging question[MASK] <unk> we can pose to ourselves[MASK] is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness to put it more precisely whether the words we say today[MASK] can tell us something of where our our minds will be[MASK] in a few days in a few months or a few years from now [MASK] and in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate our respiration[MASK] <unk> genes on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases [MASK] we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak <unk> we tweet we email we write [MASK] can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong[MASK] with our minds <unk> and with guillermo cecchi who has been my brother in this adventure we took on this task [MASK] and we did so[MASK] <unk> so by analyzing the recorded speech of thirty four young people who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia <unk> [MASK] and so what we did is we measured speech at day one <unk> and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict within a window of almost three years [MASK] the future development of psychosis <unk> [MASK] but despite our hopes we got failure[MASK] <unk> after failure there was just not enough information in semantics[MASK] to predict the future organization of the mind it was good enough[MASK] to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group [MASK] a bit like we had done for the ancient texts <unk> but not to predict the future onset of psychosis[MASK] <unk> but then we realized[MASK] that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying <unk> but how they were saying it [MASK] more specifically it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were <unk> but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood to the other one <unk> [MASK] and so we came up with this measure which we termed semantic coherence [MASK] which essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic <unk> within one semantic category[MASK] and it turned out to be that for this group of thirty four people [MASK] the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict with one hundred percent accuracy [MASK] who developed psychosis and who will not <unk> [MASK] and this was something that could not be achieved not even close with all the[MASK] <unk> remember vividly while i was working on this i was sitting at my computer and i saw a bunch of tweets by polo[MASK] polo had been my first student back in buenos aires and at the time he was living in new york <unk> [MASK] and there was something in this tweets i could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly[MASK] but i got this strong hunch this strong intuition that something was going wrong[MASK] <unk> so i picked up the phone and i called polo and in fact he was not feeling well <unk> [MASK] and this simple fact that reading in between the lines [MASK] i could sense <unk> through words <unk> his feelings was a simple but very effective way to help [MASK] what i tell you today[MASK] is that we 're getting close to understanding[MASK] how we can convert this intuition that we[MASK] <unk> all have that we all share into an algorithm <unk> [MASK] and in doing so we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health based on objective <unk> quantitative[MASK] and automated analysis[MASK] of the words we write of the words we say[MASK]
