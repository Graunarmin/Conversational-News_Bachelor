 <unk> was born and raised in[MASK] the shadow of a shipyard in a little town on the northeast coast of england some of my earliest memories[MASK] are of giant ships blocking the end of my street as well as the sun for[MASK] <unk> lot of the year <unk> every morning as a child <unk> i 'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill[MASK] to work in the shipyard i 'd watch those same men walking back home every night <unk> it has to be said the shipyard was not the most[MASK] pleasant place to live next door to or indeed work in the shipyard was noisy <unk> [MASK] dangerous <unk> highly toxic with an appalling health and safety record[MASK] despite that the men and women who worked on those ships[MASK] were extraordinarily proud of the work they did and justifiably so some of the largest vessels[MASK] ever constructed on planet earth were built right at the end of[MASK] my street <unk> my grandfather had been a a shipwright <unk> and as a child as there were few other jobs in the town i would wonder with some[MASK] anxiety whether that would be my destiny too i was fairly determined that it wouldn 't be [MASK] i had other dreams not necessarily[MASK] practical ones but[MASK] at the age of eight <unk> i was bequeathed a guitar <unk> it was a battered old thing with five rusty strings[MASK] <unk> and was out of tune but quickly i learned to play it and realized that i 'd found[MASK] a friend for life an accomplice[MASK] in my plan to escape from this surreal[MASK] industrial landscape <unk> well they say if you dream something hard enough it will come to pass <unk> either that or i was extremely lucky but this was my[MASK] <unk> i dreamt i would leave this town and just like those ships once they were launched i 'd never come back [MASK] i dreamt i 'd become a writer of songs [MASK] that i would sing those songs to vast numbers of people all over the world that i would be paid extravagant amounts of money [MASK] that i 'd become famous that i 'd marry a beautiful woman have[MASK] <unk> buy a big house in the country <unk> keep dogs <unk> grow wine have rooms full of grammy awards platinum discs and what have you [MASK] so far so good right [MASK] and then one day the songs stopped coming <unk> [MASK] and while you 've suffered from periods of writer 's block before albeit briefly this is something chronic day after day you[MASK] <unk> face a blank page and[MASK] nothing 's coming and those days turned to weeks and weeks to months and pretty soon[MASK] those months have turned into years with very little to show[MASK] for your efforts no songs[MASK] <unk> so you start asking yourself questions what have i done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so [MASK] is the gift of songwriting[MASK] taken away as easily as it seems to[MASK] <unk> have been bestowed or perhaps there 's a[MASK] more a deeper psychological reason it was always a faustian pact anyway [MASK] you 're rewarded for revealing your innermost thoughts your private emotions on the page for the entertainment of others for the[MASK] analysis the[MASK] <unk> and perhaps you 've given enough of your privacy away [MASK] and yet if you look at your work could it be argued that your best work wasn 't about you at all it was about[MASK] somebody else did your best work occur when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story but told someone else 's[MASK] <unk> stood in his shoes for a while or saw the world through his eyes well they say write what you know [MASK] if you can 't write about yourself anymore then who do you write about [MASK] so it 's ironic that the the landscape i 'd worked so hard to escape from and the community that i 'd more or less abandoned and[MASK] exiled myself from should be the very landscape the very[MASK] <unk> community i would have to return to[MASK] to find my missing muse <unk> and as soon as i did that as[MASK] soon as i decided to honor the community i came from and tell[MASK] their story that the songs started to come thick and fast <unk> i 've described it as a kind of[MASK] projectile[MASK] <unk> entire songs almost[MASK] formed whole materialized in front of me[MASK] as if they 'd been bottled up inside me for many many years one of the first things i wrote was just a list of names of people i 'd known and they become[MASK] <unk> where they explain who they are what they do their hopes and their fears[MASK] for the future this is jackie white he 's the foreman of the shipyard [MASK] my name is jackie white <unk> and i 'm foreman of the yard <unk> and you don 't mess with jackie on this quayside <unk> [MASK] i 'm as hard as iron plate woe betide you if you 're late[MASK] when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide now you can die and[MASK] <unk> heaven <unk> but you need to work your shift <unk> and i 'd expect you all to back us to the hilt for if st peter at his gate[MASK] were to ask you why you 're late why you tell him that you had to get a ship built [MASK] we build battleships and cruisers for her majesty the queen supertankers for onassis and all the classes in between we built the[MASK] <unk> greatest ship in tonnage what the world has ever seen[MASK] <unk> having decided to write about other people instead of myself a[MASK] further irony is that sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you 'd ever intended this song is called dead man 's boots which is an expression[MASK] which describes how difficult it is to get a job in other words you 'd only get a job in the shipyard if somebody else died <unk> or perhaps your father could finagle[MASK] an apprenticeship at the age of fifteen <unk> but sometimes a father 's love can be misconstrued as[MASK] controlling <unk> and conversely the scope of his son 's ambition can seem[MASK] <unk> these dead man 's boots know their[MASK] <unk> these dead man 's boots know their[MASK] <unk> these dead man 's boots know their way down the[MASK] <unk> these dead man 's boots know their way down the hill[MASK] <unk> when your whole life is through[MASK] <unk> they would invite some dignitary up from london on the train to make a speech <unk> [MASK] break a bottle of champagne over the bows <unk> launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea [MASK] <unk> occasionally on a really important ship they 'd get a member of the royal family to come duke of edinburgh <unk> princess anne or somebody and you[MASK] have to remember it wasn 't that long ago that the royal family in england were considered to have[MASK] magical healing powers <unk> sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the[MASK] cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease <unk> [MASK] <unk> it wasn 't like that in my day but we still got very excited <unk> so it 's a launch day it 's a saturday <unk> and my mother has dressed me up in my sunday best i 'm not very happy with her [MASK] all the kids are out in the street and we have little union jacks to wave [MASK] and at the top of the hill there 's a motorcycle cortege appears in the middle of the motorcycles there 's a big black[MASK] <unk> procession is moving at a stately pace down my street and as it approaches[MASK] my house i start to wave my flag vigorously <unk> and there is the queen mother i see her <unk> and she seems to see me [MASK] she acknowledges me she waves <unk> and she smiles and i wave my flag even more[MASK] vigorously we 're having a moment me and the queen mother she 's[MASK] acknowledged me[MASK] <unk> she 's gone well <unk> i wasn 't cured of anything[MASK] it was the opposite actually i was[MASK] infected i[MASK] was infected with an idea i don 't belong in this street <unk> [MASK] i don 't want to live in that house <unk> i don 't want to end up in that shipyard <unk> i want to be in that car[MASK] <unk> i want a bigger life i want a life[MASK] beyond this town i want a life that 's out of the ordinary it 's my right it 's my right as much as hers and[MASK] so here i am at ted <unk> i suppose to tell that story[MASK] that there 's a symbiotic and intrinsic link[MASK] between storytelling and community between community and art <unk> between community and science and technology [MASK] between community and economics <unk> it 's my belief that[MASK] that[MASK] abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or or denies the[MASK] <unk> contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted <unk> cruel and untenable the[MASK] fact is whether you 're a rock star or whether you 're[MASK] a welder in a shipyard or a a tribesman[MASK] <unk> in the upper amazon or the queen of england at the end of the day[MASK] <unk> on the tyne at high tide[MASK] from far and from wide there 's[MASK] <unk> in the name of the son[MASK] <unk> makes its way to the sea[MASK] <unk> an[MASK] <unk> ask you to sing after me[MASK] <unk> so it 's[MASK]
