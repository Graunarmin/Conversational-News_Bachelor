 <unk> you hear that this is the era of environment[MASK] or biology [MASK] or information technology well it 's the era of a lot of different things that we 're in right now <unk> but one thing for sure it 's the era of change there 's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of[MASK] <unk> human life on earth and you all sort of know it but it 's hard to get it so that you[MASK] really understand it and i 've tried to put together something that 's a good start for this i 've tried to show[MASK] in this though the color doesn 't come out that what i 'm concerned with is the little[MASK] <unk> time bubble that you are in you tend to be interested in a generation past a generation future your parents your kids things you can change over the next few decades and this[MASK] 50 year time bubble you kind of move along in and in that fifty years if you look at the population curve you find the population of humans on the earth more than[MASK] <unk> you have a new baby by the time that kid gets out of[MASK] high school[MASK] more people will be added than existed on earth when i was born <unk> this is unprecedented <unk> and it 's big <unk> where it goes in the future is[MASK] questioned so that 's the human part now the human part related to[MASK] animals look at the left side of that what i call the human portion humans and their livestock and pets versus the natural portion all the other wild animals and just these are vertebrates and[MASK] <unk> the <unk>[MASK] birds etc in the land and air not in the water[MASK] <unk> how does it balance certainly ten thousand years ago the civilization 's beginning the human[MASK] portion was less than one tenth of one percent <unk> let 's look at it now <unk> you follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle that 's your[MASK] and pets are now ninety seven percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent <unk> we have won the next generation doesn 't even have to worry about this game it is over [MASK] and the biggest problem came in the last[MASK] <unk> charge of life on earth we 're like the capricious gods of old greek myths <unk> kind of playing with life and[MASK] not a great deal of wisdom injected into it now the third curve is information technology this is moore 's law plotted here <unk> which relates to density[MASK] <unk> has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology computers their use internet etc <unk> and what 's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve and has no real[MASK] limits to it now try and contrast these <unk> this is the size of the earth going through that same[MASK] <unk> see the little detailed words on it that first one is[MASK] we 've won <unk> there 's no more gain [MASK] human population and so if you 're looking for growth industries to get into that 's not a good one protecting natural creatures human population is going up it 's going to continue for quite a while[MASK] <unk> all deal with human bodies <unk> which require being[MASK] fed transported housed[MASK] and so on <unk> and the information technology <unk> which connects to our brains has no limit now that is a wonderful field to be in you 're looking for growth opportunity it 's just going up[MASK] through the roof[MASK] <unk> size of the earth somehow making these all compatible with the earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with so that 's the stage out of all this i find [MASK] for reasons i don 't understand i really do have a goal and the goal is that[MASK] the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age and i think that 's in other words the next generation i think that 's a goal that we[MASK] <unk> it 's a hopeless goal technologically <unk> it 's[MASK] achievable economically it 's achievable politically <unk> it means sort of the habits institutions of people it 's impossible[MASK] the institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future <unk> except they 're there and we have to deal[MASK] with them <unk> i spend about fifteen percent of my time trying to save[MASK] <unk> whatever else we devote[MASK] ourselves to and in that fifteen percent the main focus is on human mind thinking skills somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school <unk>[MASK] which is putting information and dogma into them get them so they really think ask tough questions argue about serious subjects don 't believe everything that 's in the book think broadly or creative they can be our school systems[MASK] <unk> flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up[MASK] stuff we can 't go into that today because there isn 't time it 's[MASK] a broad subject one thing for sure in the future there is an essential[MASK] feature necessary but not sufficient[MASK] <unk> is doing more with less we 've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy less material your great great grandparents got by on muscle power and yet we all think there 's this huge power that 's essential[MASK] for our lifestyle <unk> and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are[MASK] <unk> prize in aviation history followed by the albatross and we began making various odd planes and[MASK] <unk> flying replica of a pterosaur[MASK] that has no tail [MASK] trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward it was a tough job and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature this was the full size of[MASK] the[MASK] original creature we did things on land in the air on water vehicles of all different kinds <unk> usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them <unk> i find they 're all the same[MASK] <unk> its land air[MASK] or water i 'll be focusing on the air here this[MASK] is a solar powered airplane one hundred and sixty five miles carrying a person from france to england as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part[MASK] of our future <unk> then we did the solar car for general motors the sunracer that won the race in australia we[MASK] <unk> got a lot of people thinking about electric cars what you could do with them a few years later when we suggested to gm that now is the time and we could do a thing called the impact they sponsored it and here 's the impact that we developed with them on their[MASK] programs this is the demonstrator <unk> and they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial[MASK] product with that preamble[MASK] <unk> let 's show the first <unk> two minute videotape which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane[MASK] <unk> tiny airplane the av pointer serves for surveillance in effect a pair of roving eyeglasses [MASK] a cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle <unk> it is convenient to carry <unk> assemble and launch by hand[MASK] battery powered it is silent and rarely noticed <unk> [MASK] <unk> video pictures back to the operator [MASK] with onboard gps <unk> it can navigate autonomously <unk> and it is rugged enough to self land without damage [MASK] the modern sailplane is superbly efficient some can glide as flat as sixty feet forward for every foot of descent [MASK] they are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere[MASK] an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy humans and soaring birds have found nature[MASK] <unk> to be generous in providing replenishable energy <unk> [MASK] sailplanes have flown over one thousand miles <unk> and the altitude record is over fifty thousand feet [MASK] the solar challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world 's energy future[MASK] <unk> from paris to england solely on the power of sunbeams <unk> and established a basis for the pathfinder [MASK] the message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less[MASK] gains that can help us attain[MASK] desirable balance between technology and nature the stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future[MASK] <unk> buckminster fuller said it clearly there are no passengers on spaceship earth only crew [MASK] we the crew can and must do more with less[MASK] much less paul maccready if[MASK] we could have the second video the one minute put in as quickly as you can which this will show the[MASK] pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in[MASK] hawaii <unk> and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to <unk>[MASK] five hundred and thirty feet higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown it 's amazing just on the puny power of the sun by having a super lightweight plane you 're able to get it up[MASK] 's part of a long term program nasa sponsored and we worked very closely with the whole thing being a[MASK] team effort <unk> and[MASK] with wonderful[MASK] results like that flight and we 're working on a bigger plane 220 foot span and an intermediate size one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day feed it back[MASK] <unk> at night and stay up sixty five thousand feet for months at a time [MASK] ray morgan 's voice will come in here[MASK] <unk> congenial hospitality shown by our hawaiian and military hosts [MASK] this is starting made[MASK] going out through the internet while the plane is flying and it 's exploring without polluting the stratosphere that 's its goal the stratosphere the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and[MASK] permits life on earth to be the success that it is probing that is very[MASK] important and also we consider it as a sort of poor man 's[MASK] stationary satellite[MASK] <unk> right overhead for months at a time two thousand times closer than the real gfc synchronous[MASK] satellite <unk> we couldn 't bring one here to fly it and show you but now let 's look at the other end[MASK] <unk> just done a remarkable job where some have servos that have gotten down to oh <unk> eighteen or twenty five grams his weigh one third of a gram <unk> [MASK] and what he 's going to bring out here[MASK] is a surveillance drone that weighs about two ounces that includes the video camera the batteries that run it the telemetry <unk> the[MASK] <unk> we hope with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice so matt keenan just any time you 're all right <unk>[MASK] <unk> that it 's appearing on the screen so you see what it sees you can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside[MASK] <unk> but now we 're trying to get the video [MASK] there we go mk can you bring up the house lights pm yeah the house lights and we 'll see you all better[MASK] and be able to fly the plane better mk all right we 'll try to do a[MASK] <unk> video worked right for the first few and i don 't know why it[MASK] <unk> that was only a minute but i think you 'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight perhaps[MASK] <unk> they say in infomercials <unk> we have something much better for[MASK] <unk> you which we 're working on planes that are only six inches fifteen centimeters in size and matt 's plane[MASK] was on the cover of popular science last month[MASK] <unk> showing what this can lead to and in a while something this size will have gps and a[MASK] video camera[MASK] in it <unk> we 've had one of these fly nine miles[MASK] <unk> through the air at thirty five miles an hour with just a little battery in it but there 's a lot of technology going there are just[MASK] milestones along the way of some remarkable things this one doesn 't have the video in it but you get a little feel from what it can do[MASK] pass it down when you 're done <unk> yeah i think i lost a little orientation i looked up into this light it hit the building <unk> and the building was poorly[MASK] <unk> you 're beginning to see what can be done we 're working on projects now even wing flapping things the size of hawk moths[MASK] darpa contracts working with caltech ucla where all this leads i don 't know [MASK] is it practical i don 't know but like any basic research when you 're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology you can get there[MASK] <unk> you can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along as you get to these small scales you realize we have a lot to learn from nature not with[MASK] 747s but when you get down to the nature 's realm [MASK] nature has two hundred million years of experience it never makes a mistake <unk> because if you make a mistake you don 't leave any progeny <unk> we should have nothing but success stories[MASK] <unk> for you or for birds and we 're learning a lot from its fascinating subjects in[MASK] concluding i want to get back to[MASK] the big picture and i have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective the first[MASK] i 'll just read at last i put in three sentences and had it say what i wanted over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin[MASK] <unk> covering of life complex <unk> improbable wonderful and fragile suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances[MASK] inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush <unk> [MASK] and that 's[MASK] <unk> 're not very bright we 're short on wisdom we 're high on technology where 's it going to lead well <unk> inspired by[MASK] the sentences i decided to wield the paintbrush every twenty five years i do a picture here 's the one tries to show that the world isn 't getting any bigger sort of a timeline [MASK] very non linear scale nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs and eventually we saw[MASK] some humans with[MASK] <unk> birds were flying overhead after pterosaurs <unk> and then we get to the civilization above the little[MASK] tv set with a gun on it then traffic jams and power systems and some dots for[MASK] digital where it 's going to lead i have no idea [MASK] and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there <unk> but you can fill in whatever you want this is not a forecast <unk> this is a warning[MASK] <unk> we have to think seriously about it and that time when this is happening is not one hundred years or five hundred years things are going on[MASK] this decade next decade it 's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do <unk> and[MASK] if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be desirable sustainable when your kids reach your age[MASK] i think we actually can reach it now i said this was a warning not a forecast that was[MASK] <unk> before i painted this before we started in on making[MASK] robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches <unk> and now i 'm beginning to wonder seriously was this more of a forecast than i wanted i personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be[MASK] <unk> one[MASK] final bit of sparkle we 'll put in at the very[MASK] end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle <unk> which is a little[MASK] ornithopter[MASK] <unk> and if this lands on you i assure you it will not hurt you but if you reach out to grab it or hold it you will destroy it so be gentle just act like[MASK] a wooden indian or something and when it comes down[MASK] and we 'll see how it goes <unk> we consider this to be sort of the spirit[MASK] and you wonder is it practical and it turns out if i had not been <unk>[MASK] <unk> we have some light bulb changes we can probably get it down but it 's possible it 's gone up to a greater destiny up there[MASK]
