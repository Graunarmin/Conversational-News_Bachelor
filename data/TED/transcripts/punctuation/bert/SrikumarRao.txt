 <unk> in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that 's been bestowed on you that as you go through the day <unk> you become[MASK] alive several several times <unk> and[MASK] if your life isn 't like that i 'd like to humbly suggest that you 're wasting your life[MASK] <unk> life is too short to be wasted so what i propose to do in the next seventeen minutes i 've used up one minute already[MASK] is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started[MASK] on being there is that of interest to you audience yes srikumar[MASK] rao ok <unk> [MASK] this is a conference on happiness <unk> but even if it wasn 't a conference on happiness would it be right if i said that in some way shape fashion or form[MASK] <unk> devoting your entire life to being happy <unk> [MASK] everything you do your job <unk> family children relationships whatever is a quest for happiness correct <unk> [MASK] i 'd like you to think about the following <unk> [MASK] what do you have to get[MASK] in order[MASK] <unk> just going to spend a minute on this what do you have to get in order to be happy <unk> [MASK] anybody quick [MASK] when i conduct this experiment a bunch of stuff comes up <unk> vast wealth <unk> trophy spouse good health lots of travel time etc <unk> [MASK] <unk> etc etc right now if you were to think about it you probably have a list of here 's what i need to get in order to be happy [MASK] i would like you to consider[MASK] <unk> this anything that you can get[MASK] let me repeat that anything you can get you can un get is that correct <unk> [MASK] so vast wealth can make you happy <unk> vast wealth can disappear tomorrow <unk> a number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already [MASK] so whatever you get that can make you happy can go away where does that leave you not[MASK] a very nice place right[MASK] i have a different proposition to suggest to you[MASK] what i have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get do or be in order to be happy <unk> [MASK] let me repeat that there is nothing that you have to get do or be in order to be happy <unk> in fact happiness is your innate nature it is hardwired into you it is part of your dna [MASK] not be happy <unk> now all of you are very polite <unk> and[MASK] in some of the other forums i speak in such as top business schools they 're not so polite <unk> and invariably somebody articulates what many of you are thinking which is if happiness <unk>[MASK] is my innate nature how come i am not experiencing it <unk> how come i am experiencing my life sucks[MASK] <unk> the answer to that is actually very simple [MASK] you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy [MASK] let me repeat that you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy <unk> [MASK] and the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model a mental model is a notion[MASK] <unk> have that this is the way the world works all of us have mental models we 've got dozens of mental models <unk> we 've got mental models on how to find a job how to get ahead at work how to pick a restaurant to eat at <unk>[MASK] how to have a movie to go to dozens of them the problem isn 't that we have mental models the problem is that we don 't know that we have mental models we think this is the way the world[MASK] <unk> and the more we invest in a mental model <unk> the more it appears that this in fact is the way the world works <unk> [MASK] but it isn 't it 's just a mental model <unk> and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something <unk>[MASK] <unk> so we can be something like we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy <unk> [MASK] is a variation of the if then model <unk> and the if then model is if this happens <unk> [MASK] then we will be happy[MASK] <unk> if i were to get a better job <unk> if i were to get more money <unk> if my boss would have a heart attack <unk> if only i[MASK] <unk> i had children if my children would grow up and go to college it[MASK] doesn 't matter what it is the whole notion is if this happens <unk> then i will be happy <unk> [MASK] and right now the only thing that 's different between[MASK] the persons in this audience is what is the particular if that you are focusing on and the only thing that 's different between you now and[MASK] <unk> years ago is what is the particular if that you were focusing on think about your life ten years ago spend a minute doing that[MASK] ten years ago if you remember clearly there were certain things you wanted is that correct <unk> [MASK] odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted ten years ago you now[MASK] <unk> is that correct where has that left you [MASK] in exactly the same place right <unk> what we don 't realize is the model itself is flawed the <unk>[MASK] if then model if this happens i will be happy the model itself is flawed <unk> [MASK] <unk> i thought if i became ceo it would help but now i realize it 's not that i want to become a ceo i want to become the billionaire ceo <unk> and then i will be happy [MASK] you 've got your own variation on that <unk> but it 's the model itself that 's flawed not what you put on the if side of the equation <unk> [MASK] i can demonstrate[MASK] <unk> any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity [MASK] maybe a rainbow a mountain range a valley <unk> the sea <unk> and if you remember that raise your hands if you could <unk> [MASK] virtually all of you could right have you ever wondered why that happened [MASK] the reason that happened is that somehow for some reason[MASK] at that instant [MASK] you accepted the universe exactly as it was [MASK] you didn 't say that 's a beautiful rainbow <unk> but it 's kind of off to the left and if i could move it two hundred yards to the right [MASK] it would be ever so much more beautiful [MASK] you didn 't say[MASK] <unk> that 's a beautiful valley but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches so if you gave me a chainsaw and twenty minutes i 'd make it ever so much better [MASK] oh no the rainbow off center was just fine the tree with its crooked branches was just fine <unk> [MASK] and the moment you accepted the universe just as it was [MASK] <unk> self dropped away <unk> and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced and you felt it and i know you felt it because now[MASK] <unk> even now after all those years you can still remember it <unk> [MASK] the problem is that your life right now with all of the problems that you have[MASK] more precisely all of the problems that you think you have[MASK] is equally perfect but you do not accept it in fact you 're spending all your time striving[MASK] <unk> with might and main to make it different you are not accepting it <unk> [MASK] and when you 're not accepting it you 're buying into the if then model if this happens <unk> then i will be happy <unk> and it 's the model itself that is flawed <unk> [MASK] so let me show you how you can get out of that or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that[MASK] <unk> i 'd like to share with you that action we all live our lives because we want to achieve something correct you know we are here and we want to have something[MASK] alex wants to have a successful conference you know many of you want to have[MASK] great programs for your companies that are very successful you want to progress have more money all of that is that correct[MASK] <unk> you would like something to happen [MASK] now i 'd like you to think about the following actions are within your control <unk> not entirely but to a large extent [MASK] the outcome is completely out of your control <unk> [MASK] ok <unk> [MASK] actions are within your control <unk> the outcome is completely outside your control have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it <unk> some of the time you don 't achieve your goal and[MASK] <unk> some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted has that happened to any of you <unk> like there was a friend of mine who[MASK] said gee you know i have[MASK] not been paying a lot of attention to my wife and this has to change so the next time we went on a business trip he bought a very expensive dress for her [MASK] and this was his way of showing you know i care for you and nice things would happen and[MASK] <unk> when he presented the gift to his wife her immediate reaction was after twenty years of marriage you don 't know my size [MASK] and furthermore don 't you know i never wear this kind of thing and the next thing you know <unk>[MASK] marital spat has that happened to any of you you 've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted[MASK] happens all the time well [MASK] we live in a world where what we think of what we invest in is the outcome <unk> [MASK] we define our life in the following way here i am here is where i want to go these are the steps i have to take in order to get from where i am to where i want to go <unk> and if i[MASK] <unk> how we live we invest in the outcome and as i 've just pointed out the outcome is frequently different from what we would like and sometimes the[MASK] diametric opposite of what we would like you invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of[MASK] <unk> frustration <unk> angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck [MASK] there is an alternative <unk> [MASK] and the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome you invest in the process [MASK] and the best way to describe that is a quote by john wooden <unk> i don 't know how many of you are familiar with john wooden he[MASK] <unk> in the united states and certainly among basketball fans <unk> [MASK] he 's the only person ever to make the basketball hall of fame both as a player and as a coach [MASK] and what he told his entering team he led ucla to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the ncaa[MASK] and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning[MASK] <unk> when it 's over and you look in the mirror did you do the best that you were capable of [MASK] and if you did the best that you were capable of the score doesn 't matter <unk> [MASK] but i would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of you will find the score to your liking [MASK] that is investing in a process <unk> what we do is the exact opposite we invest in the outcome <unk> this is what i want oh[MASK] <unk> i want it so desperately because if i get it i will be happy <unk> and you try with might and main to do whatever you can <unk> [MASK] but you are always focusing on this is the outcome now[MASK] focusing on the outcome is fine it gives you direction <unk> investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement[MASK] <unk> and that is a surefire recipe for failure <unk> what you can do is something else you can invest in the process [MASK] that is once you have determined here is where i am <unk> here is where i want to be <unk> and that 's fine you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction <unk> [MASK] and then you invest[MASK] invest yourself completely in the process you say here are the steps you want to take and you put everything into it <unk> [MASK] and if you succeed <unk> wonderful <unk> [MASK] and if you don 't succeed <unk> still wonderful <unk> [MASK] because now you have a new starting point and from that new starting point you select another outcome and keep going <unk> [MASK] and when you do that you will find that every day is a blast <unk> let me give you an example and if you have children raise your hands if you have children[MASK] have you ever seen a small child learn to walk <unk> what happens and this happens typically between eleven and thirteen months is the child gets up and[MASK] she sees everybody walking she wants to walk she gets up she falls down <unk> she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her kisses the place makes it well <unk> she tries again falls down mommy runs up again <unk> after some time mommy[MASK] feels tired and no[MASK] <unk> longer runs up and the child stops crying and then she gets up takes a step and doesn 't fall down and then she takes another and a beautiful smile comes on her face [MASK] and very soon generally within twenty four hours she 's walking all over the place upsetting[MASK] your living room arrangements and you know you 've gone to a new stage of parenting <unk> right now imagine what would happen[MASK] if each time the child fell[MASK] she would say [MASK] oh my god <unk> i failed again <unk> i 'm never going to learn to walk and you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy[MASK] <unk> and not being able to achieve and fail yet again how long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that if[MASK] <unk> but that is exactly what we 're doing what the child is doing <unk> is focusing on the process she 's investing in the process <unk> [MASK] not in the outcome <unk> [MASK] what we do is the exact opposite as we grow up we lose the ability to invest in the[MASK] <unk> we start investing in the outcome <unk> [MASK] by definition the outcome is outside of our control <unk> and if that 's where we spend all of our emotional energy we are going to get drained as we do [MASK] but if on the other hand we said here is the outcome <unk> i am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit i could [MASK] every day is a blast and you 're well on your way to achieving the vision that i outlined to you the question that i get all the time[MASK] <unk> nothing makes me passionate [MASK] so i say ok what would [MASK] and they invariably come up with you know here is a list of things here 's my job and here 's how much it pays this is the kind of person my boss is the kind of people my colleagues are and here 's how my customers <unk>[MASK] <unk> are here 's how much i travel here 's how big my office is how deep the carpeting is how many windows i have a bunch of parameters <unk> [MASK] <unk> you because all of that stuff first of all it doesn 't exist [MASK] but second even if it did and you were plugged into it it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry miserable self there as you are now <unk> [MASK] because passion exists inside you <unk> it does not exist in the job <unk> [MASK] and if you don 't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are you[MASK] are not going to find it outside <unk> [MASK] but if you do find a way to ignite it where you are <unk> [MASK] then you will find that the external world rearranges itself[MASK] to accommodate the new person that you are becoming <unk> [MASK] and as you do that you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis persons come up whom you 're delighted to[MASK] <unk> meet new people enter your life it 's just a breeze [MASK] because all you do in your life is you take journeys <unk> you came here to this conference you went on a journey <unk> [MASK] you hang around the water cooler talking about how terrible your place of work is you went on a journey <unk> [MASK] you watch desperate housewives you go on a journey you go on a journey where 40 something women are having affairs with[MASK] <unk> the husbands are playing around with models all you do is go on journeys <unk> [MASK] there 's nothing wrong with that but just ask yourself is this a journey i want to take does this take me to a place i want to spend time [MASK] and if you start doing that <unk> you will find that your life changes <unk> the kind of people you meet <unk> the things you talk about the movies you go to the books you read everything changes[MASK] <unk> and you begin all of that by focusing on the process invest in the process <unk> not in the outcome[MASK]
