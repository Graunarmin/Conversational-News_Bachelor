 <unk> billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads one billion people one seventh of the earth 's population[MASK] are totally cut off for some part of the year <unk> we cannot get medicine to them reliably <unk> they cannot get critical supplies[MASK] <unk> they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income [MASK] in sub saharan africa for instance eighty five percent of roads are unusable in the wet season [MASK] investments are being made <unk> but at the current level <unk> it 's estimated it 's going to take them fifty years to catch up [MASK] <unk> there 's more than four million miles of roads <unk> [MASK] very expensive to build very expensive to maintain infrastructure with a huge ecological footprint <unk> and yet very often <unk> congested[MASK] so we saw this and we thought <unk> can there be a better way can we create a system using today 's most advanced technologies[MASK] that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they 've done with mobile telephones in the last ten years many of those nations[MASK] <unk> have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground <unk> could we do the same for transportation <unk> [MASK] imagine this scenario <unk> [MASK] imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali <unk> and have a newborn in need of urgent medication <unk> what would you do today <unk> [MASK] well you would place a request via mobile phone <unk> and someone would get the request immediately that 's[MASK] <unk> part that works the medication may take days to arrive though because of bad roads that 's the part that 's broken <unk> we believe we can deliver it within hours[MASK] with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this [MASK] this can transport a small payload today about two kilograms over a short distance about ten kilometers but it 's part[MASK] <unk> a wider network that may cover the entire country maybe even the entire continent <unk> it 's an ultra flexible automated logistics network <unk> [MASK] it 's a network for a transportation of matter <unk> we call it matternet <unk> [MASK] we use three key technologies the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles [MASK] the second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and[MASK] <unk> or pick up or deliver loads and the third is the operating system that manages the whole network <unk> [MASK] let 's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail first of all [MASK] the uavs eventually we 're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges today <unk> we 're using small quads <unk> [MASK] these are able to transport two kilograms over ten kilometers in just about fifteen minutes <unk> compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world or even being stuck in traffic[MASK] in a developed world country <unk> [MASK] these fly autonomously this is the key to the technology <unk> so they use gps and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations [MASK] every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations[MASK] <unk> they dock swap a battery automatically and go out again [MASK] the ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground <unk> they secure the most vulnerable part of the mission which is the landing [MASK] they are at known locations on the ground so the paths between them are also known which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network <unk> [MASK] apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles <unk> eventually they 're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network[MASK] the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network [MASK] it monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system[MASK] to avoid adverse weather conditions <unk> avoid other risk factors <unk> and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network <unk> [MASK] i want to show you what one of those flights looks like [MASK] here we are flying[MASK] <unk> in haiti last summer where we 've done our first field trials <unk> we 're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the two thousand and ten earthquake [MASK] people there love this [MASK] and i want to show you[MASK] what one of those vehicles looks like up close <unk> so this is a $ three thousand vehicle <unk> costs are coming down very rapidly[MASK] <unk> we use this in all sorts of weather conditions <unk> [MASK] very hot and very cold climates very strong winds they 're very sturdy vehicles <unk> [MASK] imagine if your life depended on this package somewhere in africa or in new york city[MASK] <unk> after sandy [MASK] the next big question is what 's the cost <unk> well [MASK] it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over ten kilometers with this vehicle[MASK] is just <unk>[MASK] 's counterintuitive <unk> but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today <unk> and we 're just at the beginning of this[MASK] when we saw this we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world so[MASK] okay how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world and we looked at setting up a network in lesotho for transportation of hiv aids samples[MASK] <unk> the problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they 're being collected[MASK] to hospitals where they 're being analyzed <unk> and we said what if we wanted to cover[MASK] <unk> an area spanning around one hundred and forty square kilometers that 's roughly one and a half times the size of manhattan <unk> [MASK] well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars <unk> [MASK] compare this to normal infrastructure investments we think this can be[MASK] this is the power of a new paradigm[MASK] <unk> here we are a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the internet <unk> [MASK] it 's decentralized <unk> it 's peer to peer it 's bidirectional highly adaptable with very low infrastructure investment very low ecological footprint <unk> [MASK] if it is a new paradigm though <unk> [MASK] there must be other uses for it it can be used perhaps in other places in the world so let 's look at the other end of the spectrum[MASK] <unk> our cities and megacities <unk> [MASK] half of the earth 's population lives in cities today <unk> [MASK] half a billion of us live in megacities <unk> we are living through an amazing urbanization trend <unk> china alone is adding a megacity the size of new york city every two years <unk> [MASK] these are places that do have road infrastructure <unk> but it 's very inefficient <unk> congestion is a huge problem <unk> so we think it makes sense in those places to[MASK] <unk> set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the internet <unk> initially for lightweight urgent stuff <unk> [MASK] and over time <unk> we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation[MASK] that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem <unk> it 's ultimately scalable with a very[MASK] small ecological footprint <unk> operating in the background[MASK] so[MASK] when we started this a couple of years ago now [MASK] we 've had a lot of people come up to us who said this is a very interesting but crazy idea <unk> and certainly not something that you should engage with[MASK] anytime soon [MASK] and of course we 're talking about drones right a technology that 's not only unpopular in the west but one that has become a very very unpleasant fact of life for[MASK] <unk> many living in poor countries especially those engaged in conflict <unk> so why are we doing this <unk> [MASK] well <unk> we chose to do this one[MASK] not because it 's easy <unk> [MASK] but because it can have amazing impact <unk> [MASK] imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them[MASK] <unk> imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter [MASK] in the developing world <unk> we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines [MASK] reach them with better medication it would give us an unfair advantage against battling hiv aids tuberculosis[MASK] <unk> we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions[MASK] lifting millions of people out of poverty [MASK] in the developed world and the emerging world <unk> we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable[MASK] so for those that still believe that this is science fiction i firmly say to you that it is not [MASK] we do need to engage though in social fiction to make it happen <unk> [MASK]
