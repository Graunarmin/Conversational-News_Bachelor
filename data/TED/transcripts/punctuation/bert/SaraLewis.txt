 <unk> as a scientist <unk> and also as a human being i 've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder <unk> [MASK] i think jason webley last night called it conspiring to be part of the magic so it 's fortunate that my[MASK] <unk> career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures[MASK] that share our planet [MASK] fireflies <unk> [MASK] now for many of you <unk> i know that fireflies might conjure up some really great memories <unk> childhood <unk> summertime even other ted talks[MASK] <unk> something like this [MASK] my seduction into the world of fireflies began when i was back in graduate school [MASK] one evening i was sitting out in my backyard in north carolina <unk> and suddenly [MASK] these silent sparks[MASK] rose up all around me[MASK] <unk> i began to wonder how do these creatures make light <unk> and what 's with all this flashing are they talking to one another <unk> [MASK] and what happens after the lights go out <unk> [MASK] i 've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as i 've explored this nocturnal world [MASK] now if you 've ever seen[MASK] or even heard about fireflies <unk> then you 'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly and this[MASK] <unk> happens around the globe like this hillside in the smoky mountains that i saw transformed into a living cascade of light[MASK] by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies <unk> [MASK] or a roadside river that i visited in japan as it was giving birth to the slow <unk> floating flashes of these genji[MASK] <unk> or in malaysia <unk> the mangrove trees that i watched blossom nightly not with flowers but with the lights of a thousand fireflies <unk> all blinking together in stunning synchrony [MASK] these luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder <unk> and they keep me connected to the magic[MASK] of the natural world <unk> and i find it amazing that they 're created by these tiny insects in[MASK] <unk> person fireflies are charming <unk> they 're charismatic <unk> they 've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries [MASK] as i 've traveled around the world i 've met many thoughtful people who have told me that god put fireflies on earth for humans to enjoy [MASK] other creatures can enjoy them too <unk> [MASK] i think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so[MASK] beautifully illuminate[MASK] the creative improvisation of evolution <unk> [MASK] they 've been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces <unk> natural selection <unk> the struggle for survival <unk> and sexual selection <unk> [MASK] the struggle for reproductive opportunity [MASK] as a firefly junkie the past twenty years have been quite an exciting ride[MASK] <unk> together with my students at tufts university and other colleagues <unk> we 've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies <unk> [MASK] their courtship and sex lives their treachery and murder <unk> [MASK] so today i 'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we 've brought back from our collective adventures[MASK] into this hidden[MASK] <unk> fireflies belong to a very beautiful and diverse group of insects <unk> the beetles <unk> [MASK] worldwide there are more than two thousand firefly species <unk> [MASK] and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals that is different ways to find and attract mates [MASK] around one hundred and fifty million years ago <unk> the very first fireflies probably looked like this they flew during the daytime and they didn 't light up[MASK] <unk> instead males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females [MASK] in other fireflies it 's only the females who light up <unk> they are attractively plump[MASK] and wingless <unk> so every night they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males[MASK] <unk> in still other fireflies <unk> both sexes use quick bright flashes to find their mates <unk> [MASK] here in north america we have more than one hundred different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine[MASK] energy out from their bodies in the form of light how do they do that[MASK] <unk> it seems totally magical but these bioluminescent signals arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that happen inside the firefly lantern <unk> [MASK] the main star is an enzyme called luciferase <unk> which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin [MASK] in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light[MASK] <unk> could these bright lights have benefited some[MASK] to answer this question we need to flip back in the family album to some[MASK] baby pictures fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow <unk> [MASK] they spend the vast majority of their lifetime up to two years in this larval form [MASK] their main goal here like my teenagers[MASK] <unk> is to eat and grow <unk> [MASK] and firefly light first originated in these juveniles every single firefly larva can light up even when their adults can 't but what[MASK] 's the point to being so conspicuous well we know that these juveniles make[MASK] <unk> that help them survive their extended childhood <unk> [MASK] so we think these lights first evolved as a warning [MASK] a neon sign that says toxic stay away to any would be predators [MASK] it took many millions of years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators but to bring in potential mates <unk> [MASK] driven now by[MASK] sexual selection some adult fireflies like this proud male[MASK] evolved a shiny new glow in the dark lantern[MASK] that would let them take courtship to a whole new level these adults only live a few weeks <unk> and now[MASK] <unk> focused on sex that is on propelling their genes into the next firefly generation <unk> [MASK] so we can follow this male out into the field[MASK] as he joins[MASK] hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals [MASK] it 's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire[MASK] here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of[MASK] <unk> male fireflies they 're flying and flashing their hearts out i still find it very romantic[MASK] <unk> but meanwhile where are all the females well[MASK] they 're lounging down below surveying their options <unk> [MASK] they have plenty of males to choose from and these females turn out to be very picky [MASK] when a female sees a flash[MASK] <unk> flash from an especially attractive male she 'll aim her lantern in his direction <unk> and give him a flash back [MASK] it 's her come hither sign so he flies closer and he flashes again <unk> [MASK] if she still likes him <unk> they 'll strike up a conversation these creatures speak their love in the language of light[MASK] <unk> so what exactly do these females consider sexy <unk> [MASK] we decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out [MASK] when we tested females using blinking led lights we discovered they prefer males who give[MASK] <unk> males their sex appeal now we get to see what happens when the lights go out [MASK] the first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this they stay together all night long [MASK] and when we looked inside to see what might be happening <unk> we discovered a surprising new twist to firefly sex <unk> [MASK] while they 're mating the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm[MASK] <unk> but also a <unk>[MASK] package called a nuptial gift [MASK] we can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair we can actually see the gift it 's shown here in red[MASK] as it 's being passed from the male to the female what makes this gift so valuable is that it 's packed with protein that the[MASK] <unk> female will use to provision her eggs [MASK] so females are keeping their eyes on this prize as they size up potential mates <unk> [MASK] we discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer because this bling helps <unk>[MASK] <unk> the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring[MASK] into the next generation [MASK] so it 's not all sweetness and light firefly romance is risky [MASK] for the most part these adult fireflies don 't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores[MASK] <unk> somewhere along the line one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins [MASK] this evolutionary flaw <unk> which was discovered by my colleague tom eisner <unk> has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights[MASK] out into the night[MASK] with treacherous intent[MASK] <unk> jim lloyd another colleague these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species <unk> [MASK] so the hunt begins with the predator she 's shown here in the lower left[MASK] where she 's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey and here 's how it might go first[MASK] <unk> so then he flashes again but this time the predator sneaks in a reply[MASK] that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said <unk> [MASK] she 's not looking for love she 's looking for toxins <unk> if she 's[MASK] <unk> she can lure this male close enough to reach out and grab him <unk> [MASK] and he 's not just a light snack <unk> over the next hour <unk> she slowly[MASK] <unk> this male[MASK] leaving behind just some gory remains <unk> [MASK] unable to make their own toxins these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies[MASK] <unk> brought to you by natural selection <unk> [MASK] we still have a lot to learn about fireflies <unk> but it looks like many stories will remain untold because around the world firefly populations are blinking out <unk> [MASK] <unk> pretty much everywhere the fields and forests <unk> the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive are giving way to development and to sprawl [MASK] here 's another problem <unk> we 've conquered darkness <unk> but in the process we spill so much extra light out into the night[MASK] that it disrupts the lives of other creatures and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution[MASK] because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates[MASK] do we really need fireflies <unk> after all they 're just one tiny bit of earth 's biodiversity <unk> [MASK] yet every time a species is lost it 's like extinguishing a room full of candles[MASK] one[MASK] by one you might not notice when the first few flames flicker out but in the end you 're left sitting in[MASK] <unk> darkness[MASK] <unk> as we work together[MASK] to craft a planetary future <unk> i hope we can find a way to keep these bright lights shining <unk> thank you[MASK]
