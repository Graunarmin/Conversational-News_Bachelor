 <unk> does the happiest man in the world look like he certainly doesn 't look like me he looks like this [MASK] his name is matthieu ricard so[MASK] <unk> how do you get to be the happiest man in the world [MASK] well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain [MASK] and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fmri versus the right prefrontal cortex <unk> [MASK] and matthieu 's happiness measure is off the charts he 's by far the happiest man ever measured by science[MASK] <unk> which leads us to a question[MASK] <unk> what was he thinking when he was being measured <unk> perhaps something very naughty [MASK] actually <unk> he was[MASK] meditating on compassion matthieu 's own experience[MASK] is that compassion is the happiest state ever reading about matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life[MASK] <unk> dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime[MASK] and to do that by creating[MASK] the conditions for inner peace[MASK] and compassion[MASK] on a global scale <unk> and learning about matthieu[MASK] gave me a new angle to look at my work matthieu 's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore[MASK] <unk> is something that creates happiness compassion is fun and[MASK] insight changes the entire game <unk> [MASK] because if compassion was a chore <unk> nobody 's going to do it except maybe the dalai lama or something <unk> but if compassion was fun[MASK] <unk> everybody 's going to do it therefore to create the conditions for global compassion[MASK] all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun <unk> [MASK] but fun is not enough what if compassion is also[MASK] profitable <unk> what if compassion is also good for business then[MASK] <unk> boss every manager in the world will want to have compassion[MASK] like this that would create the conditions for world peace <unk> [MASK] so i started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting <unk> [MASK] fortunately i didn 't have to look very far because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes in google my company[MASK] <unk> i know there[MASK] are other compassionate companies in the world but google is the place i 'm familiar with because i 've been there for ten years <unk> so i 'll use google as as the case study [MASK] google is a company born of idealism it 's a company that thrives on idealism [MASK] and maybe because of that [MASK] <unk> in google expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern it 's sort of a funny pattern it starts with a small group of googlers[MASK] taking the initiative to do something <unk> [MASK] and they don 't usually ask for permission they just go ahead and do it [MASK] and then other googlers join in and it just gets bigger and bigger and sometimes it gets big enough to become official[MASK] in other words <unk> it almost always starts from the bottom up [MASK] and let me give you some examples <unk> the first example is the largest annual community event where googlers from around the world[MASK] donate their labor to their local communities[MASK] was initiated and organized by three employees[MASK] before it became official <unk> because it just became too big another example[MASK] three googlers a chef an engineer[MASK] and most funny a massage therapist[MASK] three of them <unk> they learned about a region in india[MASK] where two hundred thousand people live without a single medical facility so what do they do they just go ahead and start a fundraiser <unk> [MASK] and they raise enough money[MASK] to build this hospital[MASK] the first hospital of its kind for two hundred[MASK] <unk> thousand people <unk> during the haiti earthquake a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and <unk>[MASK] <unk> stayed overnight to build a tool[MASK] to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones and expressions of compassion are also found in our international[MASK] <unk> the largest social action competition in china <unk> [MASK] involving more than one thousand schools in china working on issues such as education <unk> poverty health care[MASK] and the environment there is so much organic social action all around google[MASK] that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts[MASK] and this idea again <unk> came from the grassroots from two googlers[MASK] who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job [MASK] and i found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy it was[MASK] two persons saying[MASK] that google is a compassionate company because googlers found compassion to be fun <unk> [MASK] but again fun is not enough there[MASK] are also real business benefits <unk> so what are they the first benefit of compassion[MASK] is that it creates highly effective business leaders[MASK] <unk> what does that mean <unk> there are three components of compassion there is[MASK] the affective component <unk> which is i feel for you there is the cognitive component <unk> which is i understand you [MASK] and there is a motivational component <unk> which is i want to help you [MASK] so what has this got to do[MASK] <unk> according to a very comprehensive study led by jim collins and documented in the book good to great it takes a very special kind of leader[MASK] to bring a company from goodness[MASK] to greatness <unk> and he calls them level five leaders these are leaders who in addition to being highly[MASK] <unk> and they are[MASK] humility[MASK] and ambition [MASK] these are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good <unk> [MASK] and because they 're ambitious for a greater good they feel no need to inflate their own egos <unk> [MASK] and they according to the research <unk> make the best business leaders [MASK] <unk> if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion[MASK] understanding people and empathizing with people inhibits <unk> tones down <unk> what i call the excessive[MASK] <unk> in us <unk> therefore creating the conditions for humility the motivational component of compassion creates ambition[MASK] for greater good [MASK] in other words compassion is the way to grow level five leaders <unk> [MASK] and this is the first compelling business benefit[MASK] <unk> the second compelling benefit of compassion[MASK] is that it creates an inspiring workforce <unk> employees[MASK] <unk> towards greater good it creates a vibrant <unk> energetic community where people admire and respect each other i mean you come to work in the morning[MASK] and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in india it 's like how can you not be inspired by those people[MASK] your own coworkers <unk> so this mutual inspiration[MASK] <unk> and creativity it makes us a highly effective company [MASK] so having said all that what is the secret formula for brewing compassion[MASK] in the corporate setting in our experience there are three ingredients the first ingredient[MASK] is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good[MASK] <unk> so always think how is your company and your job[MASK] serving the greater good or how can you further serve the greater good [MASK] this awareness of serving the greater good is very self inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in[MASK] <unk> autonomy <unk> [MASK] so in google there 's a lot of autonomy <unk> and one of our most popular managers jokes that this is what he says google is a place[MASK] where the inmates run the asylum [MASK] and he considers himself one of the inmates if you already have a culture of compassion[MASK] and idealism[MASK] and you let your people roam free[MASK] <unk> they will do the right thing[MASK] in the most compassionate way <unk> the third ingredient[MASK] is to focus on inner development[MASK] and personal growth leadership training in google for example <unk> places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities such as[MASK] that leadership begins with[MASK] character we even created a seven week curriculum[MASK] on emotion intelligence <unk> which we jokingly call searching inside yourself it[MASK] 's less naughty than it sounds <unk> [MASK] so i 'm an engineer by training <unk> but i 'm one of the creators and instructors of this course which i find kind of funny[MASK] this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence[MASK] <unk> any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training the idea here is to train attention[MASK] to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time <unk> and this[MASK] <unk> so using the supercharged attention from step one we create a <unk>[MASK] perception into the cognitive and emotive processes <unk> what does that mean <unk> it means being able to observe our thought stream[MASK] and the process of emotion[MASK] with high clarity <unk> objectivity and from a third person perspective[MASK] <unk> and once you can do that you create the kind of self knowledge that enables[MASK] the third step following the second step is to create new mental habits[MASK] <unk> imagine whenever you meet[MASK] any other person <unk> any time you meet a person <unk> your habitual <unk> instinctive first thought is i want you to be happy <unk> [MASK] i want you to be happy imagine you can do that having this habit this mental habit <unk> changes everything at work <unk> [MASK] because this good will[MASK] is unconsciously[MASK] picked up by other people and it[MASK] creates trust and trust creates a lot of[MASK] good working relationships <unk> and this also creates the conditions for compassion[MASK] in the workplace [MASK] someday we hope to open source search inside yourself so that everybody in the corporate world[MASK] will at least be able to use it as a[MASK] <unk> and in closing <unk> i want to end the same place i started with happiness <unk> i want to quote this guy the guy in robes not the other guy[MASK] the dalai lama who said if you want others to be happy <unk> practice compassion if you want to be happy <unk> [MASK] practice compassion [MASK] i found this to be true both on the individual level[MASK] and at a corporate level and i hope that compassion will be both[MASK] <unk> fun and profitable for you too thank you[MASK]
