 <unk> i am going to teach you how to play my favorite game [MASK] massively multiplayer thumb wrestling it 's the only game in the world that i[MASK] <unk> know of that allows you the player the opportunity to experience[MASK] ten positive emotions in sixty seconds or less this is true <unk> so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute <unk> you will get to feel <unk>[MASK] joy <unk> relief love surprise pride curiosity excitement awe and wonder contentment and creativity all in the span of one minute so this sounds pretty good right now you 're willing to play [MASK] <unk> really quickly and we 're going to do a little hands on demo while they 're coming up i should let you know this game was invented ten years ago by an artists ' collective in austria named monochrom so thank you monochrom okay <unk> so most people are familiar with traditional <unk>[MASK] <unk> let 's just remind them one two three four i declare a thumb war[MASK] we wrestle and of course sunni beats me because she 's the best now[MASK] <unk> the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb wrestling we 're the gamer generation there are a billion gamers on the planet now <unk> so we need more of a challenge <unk> so the first thing we need <unk>[MASK] is more thumbs so eric come on over <unk> so we could get three thumbs together <unk> [MASK] <unk> can 't like wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute that is not how you win [MASK] ah who did that eric you did that so eric would have won he was the first person to pin my thumb <unk> okay so that 's the first rule and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs <unk>[MASK] <unk> in a node but if you feel ambitious you don 't have to hold back we can really go for it so you can[MASK] <unk> the only other rule you need to remember is gamer generation we like a challenge <unk> i happen to notice you all have some thumbs you 're not using <unk> so i think we should kind of get some more involved <unk> and if we had just four people we would do it just like this[MASK] <unk> and we would try and wrestle[MASK] both thumbs at the same time perfect now if we had more people in the room <unk> instead of just wrestling in a closed[MASK] <unk> we might reach out and try and grab some other people <unk> and in fact that 's what we 're going to do right now we 're going to try and get all something like i don 't know one thousand five hundred thumbs in this room connected <unk>[MASK] <unk> in a single node <unk> and we have to connect both levels so if you 're up there [MASK] <unk> before we get started can i have the slides back up here really quick because if you get good at this game i want you to know there are some advanced levels so this is the the kind of simple level right <unk> but[MASK] there are advanced configurations this is called the death star configuration any star wars fans and[MASK] this one 's called the mbius strip any science geeks you get that one this is the hardest level this is the extreme <unk> so we 'll stick with the normal one for now and i 'm going to give you thirty seconds <unk> every thumb into the node[MASK] <unk> connect the upper and the lower levels you guys go on down there thirty seconds into the network make the node[MASK] <unk> stand up it 's easier if you stand up everybody up up up up up [MASK] stand up my friends all[MASK] right don 't start wrestling yet if you have a free thumb wave it around[MASK] <unk> sure it gets connected <unk> [MASK] okay <unk> we need to do a last minute thumb check if you have a free thumb wave it around to make sure grab that thumb [MASK] reach behind you there you go any other thumbs okay on the count of three you 're going to go try to keep track grab grab grab it[MASK] <unk> while you are basking in the glow of having won your first[MASK] <unk> let 's do a quick recap on the positive emotions so[MASK] curiosity <unk> i said massively multiplayer thumb wrestling you were like what the hell is she talking about so i provoked a little curiosity creativity it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all <unk>[MASK] <unk> the thumbs into the node i 'm reaching around and i 'm reaching up so you used creativity that was great how about surprise <unk> the actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising you heard that sound go up in the room <unk> we[MASK] <unk> as you started to wrestle maybe you 're starting to win or this person 's like really into it so you kind of[MASK] get get the excitement going [MASK] we have relief you got to stand up you 've been sitting for awhile so the physical relief getting to shake it out we had joy you were laughing smiling look at your faces this room is full of joy <unk> we had[MASK] some contentment i didn 't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing so you were totally content to be playing the most important three[MASK] <unk> and wonder we had everybody connected physically for a minute when was the last time you were at ted and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room and it 's truly awesome and wondrous and speaking of physical <unk>[MASK] <unk> connection <unk> you guys know i love the hormone oxytocin <unk> you release oxytocin you feel bonded to everyone in the room
