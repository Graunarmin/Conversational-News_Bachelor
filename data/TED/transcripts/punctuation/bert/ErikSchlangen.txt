 <unk> ha[MASK] <unk> you probably all agree with me that[MASK] this is a very nice road it 's made of asphalt <unk> and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on <unk> but not always[MASK] <unk> especially not on these days as today when it 's raining a lot [MASK] then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt <unk> and especially if you then ride with your bicycle <unk> and pass these cars <unk> then[MASK] that 's not very nice [MASK] also asphalt can create a lot of noise it 's a noisy material <unk> [MASK] and if we produce roads like in the netherlands very close to cities then we would like a silent road [MASK] the solution for that is to make[MASK] roads out of porous asphalt[MASK] <unk> porous asphalt a material that we use now in[MASK] most of the highways in the netherlands <unk> [MASK] it has pores and water can just rain through it [MASK] so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides <unk> and you have a road that 's easy to drive on <unk> so no splash water anymore [MASK] also the noise will disappear in these pores because it 's very hollow all the noise will disappear so it 's a very silent road [MASK] <unk> has disadvantages of course <unk> and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur what is raveling you see that in this road[MASK] that the stones at the surface come off <unk> first you get one stone <unk> [MASK] then several more and more and more and more and more and then they[MASK] <unk> not happy with that <unk> and finally this raveling can also lead to more and more damage <unk> sometimes you can create potholes with that ha he[MASK] 's ready <unk> [MASK] potholes of course that can become a problem but we have a solution here you see actually how the damage appears[MASK] <unk> in this material it 's a porous asphalt like i said so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones [MASK] due to weathering <unk> due to u v light due to oxidation [MASK] this binder this bitumen the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink <unk> [MASK] and if it shrinks it gets micro cracks and it delaminates from the aggregates <unk> then if you drive over the road you take out the aggregates what we just saw here [MASK] to solve this[MASK] <unk> if we can make this material self healing [MASK] then probably we have a solution <unk> [MASK] so what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans <unk> [MASK] and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen <unk> [MASK] so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it [MASK] <unk> then you need a machine like you see here that you can use for cooking an[MASK] induction machine [MASK] induction can heat especially steel it 's very good at that [MASK] then what you do is you heat up the steel you melt the bitumen <unk> and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks and[MASK] the stones are again fixed to the surface [MASK] today i use a microwave because i cannot[MASK] take the big induction[MASK] <unk> microwave is a similar system <unk> so i put the specimen in <unk> which i 'm now going to take out to see what happened <unk> [MASK] so this is the specimen coming out now <unk> so i said we have we have such an industrial[MASK] machine in the lab to heat up the the specimens we tested a lot of specimens there <unk> and then the government they actually saw our[MASK] <unk> that 's very interesting we have to try that so they donated to us a piece of highway four hundred meters of the <unk>[MASK] <unk> had to make a test track to test this material <unk> so that 's what we did here you see where we were making the test road [MASK] and then of course this road will last several years without any damage that 's what we know from practice <unk> [MASK] so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab so we did[MASK] aging on the samples did a lot of loading on it healed them with our induction machine <unk> and[MASK] healed them and tested them again several times we can repeat that <unk> [MASK] so actually the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years[MASK] with our healing machine this is the big version we have made to go on the real road if we go on the road every four years we can[MASK] double the surface life[MASK] of this road which of course saves a lot of money well to conclude i can say that we made a material[MASK] using steel fibers the addition of steel fibers <unk> using induction energy[MASK] to really increase the surface life of the road double the surface life you can even do so it will[MASK] <unk> really save a lot of money with very simple tricks[MASK]
