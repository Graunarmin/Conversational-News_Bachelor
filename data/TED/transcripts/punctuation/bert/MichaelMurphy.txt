 <unk> every weekend for as long as i can remember [MASK] my father would get up on a saturday <unk> put on a worn sweatshirt and he 'd[MASK] scrape away at the squeaky old wheel of a house that we lived in [MASK] i wouldn 't even call it restoration it was a[MASK] <unk> ritual <unk> catharsis [MASK] he would spend all year scraping paint with this old heat gun and a spackle knife <unk> and then he would repaint where he scraped only to begin again the following year [MASK] scraping and <unk> re scraping painting and repainting <unk> [MASK] the work of an old house is never meant to be done [MASK] <unk> i got a phone call my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer <unk> she told me [MASK] and he had been given only three weeks to live <unk> [MASK] i immediately moved home to poughkeepsie new york [MASK] to sit with my father on death watch not knowing what the next days would bring us to[MASK] keep myself distracted i[MASK] <unk> i rolled up my sleeves <unk> and i went about finishing what he could now no longer complete[MASK] the restoration of our old home when that looming three week deadline came[MASK] and then went he was still alive <unk> and at three months <unk> he joined me <unk> [MASK] we gutted and repainted the interior at six months <unk> the old windows were refinished <unk> and at eighteen months[MASK] <unk> the rotted porch was finally replaced <unk> [MASK] and there was my father standing with me outside <unk> admiring a day 's work hair on his head <unk> fully in remission [MASK] when he turned to me and he said you know michael this house saved my life [MASK] so the following year <unk> i decided to go to architecture school [MASK] <unk> but there i learned something different about buildings recognition seemed to come to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms like[MASK] ribbons <unk> or <unk> pickles [MASK] and i think this is supposed to be a snail <unk> [MASK] something about this bothered me <unk> why was it that the best architects the greatest architecture all beautiful and visionary and innovative[MASK] is also so rare and seems to serve so very few [MASK] and more to the point with all of this creative talent what more could we do [MASK] just as i was about to start my final exams i decided to take a break from an all nighter and go to a lecture[MASK] <unk> paul farmer [MASK] a leading health activist for the global poor <unk>[MASK] i was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture [MASK] buildings are making people sicker <unk> he said <unk> and for the poorest in the world <unk> this is causing epidemic level problems [MASK] in this hospital in south africa patients that came in with say a broken leg to wait in this unventilated hallway walked out with[MASK] <unk> control had not been thought about and people had died[MASK] because of it [MASK] where are the architects paul said if hospitals are making people sicker <unk> where are the architects and designers to help us[MASK] build and design hospitals that allow us to heal [MASK] that following[MASK] <unk> i was in the back of a land rover with a few classmates bumping over the mountainous hillside of rwanda [MASK] for the next year i 'd be living in butaro in this old guesthouse which was a jail after the genocide <unk>[MASK] i was there to design and build a new type of hospital with dr farmer and his team [MASK] if hallways are making patients sicker <unk> [MASK] <unk> what if we could design a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside and makes people walk in the exterior [MASK] if mechanical systems rarely work what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation [MASK] and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint <unk> [MASK] and what about the patients ' experience <unk> evidence shows that a simple view of nature can radically improve health outcomes [MASK] so why couldn 't we design a hospital where every patient had a window with a view [MASK] simple[MASK] site specific designs can make a hospital that heals <unk> designing it is one thing <unk> getting it built we learned is quite another <unk> [MASK] we worked with bruce nizeye a brilliant engineer <unk> and he thought about construction differently than i had been taught in school <unk> [MASK] when we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site <unk> bruce suggested doing[MASK] <unk> it by hand <unk> using a method in rwanda called ubudehe which means community works for the community [MASK] hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes <unk> [MASK] and we excavated that hill in half the time[MASK] and half the cost of that bulldozer <unk> instead of importing furniture bruce started a guild <unk> and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand[MASK] <unk> and on this job site <unk> fifteen years after the rwandan genocide <unk> [MASK] bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds <unk> and that half of them be women [MASK] bruce was using the process of building to heal not just for those who were sick <unk> but for the entire community[MASK] as a whole we call this the locally fabricated way of building or[MASK] and it has[MASK] four pillars <unk> [MASK] hire locally source regionally train where you can and most importantly think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve [MASK] think of it like the local food[MASK] <unk> but for architecture [MASK] and we 're convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world <unk> and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture <unk> [MASK] using the lo fab way of building even aesthetic decisions can be designed to impact people 's lives [MASK] in butaro we chose to use a local volcanic stone found in abundance within the area but often considered a nuisance by[MASK] <unk> and piled on the side of the road <unk> we worked with these masons to cut these stones and form them[MASK] into the walls of the hospital and when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital [MASK] they were so good at putting these stones together they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it [MASK] and you see what is possible [MASK] it 's beautiful [MASK] and the beauty to me <unk> comes from the fact that i know that hands cut[MASK] <unk> these stones and they formed them into this thick wall made only in this place with rocks from this soil [MASK] when you go outside today and you look at your built world <unk> [MASK] ask not only what is the environmental footprint an important question but what if we also asked what is the human handprint[MASK] of those who made it[MASK] <unk> we started a new practice based around these questions <unk> and we tested it[MASK] around the world <unk> [MASK] like in haiti <unk> where we asked if a new hospital could help end the epidemic of cholera [MASK] in this 100 bed hospital <unk> we designed a simple strategy to clean contaminated medical waste before it[MASK] <unk> enters the water table and our partners at les centres <unk> gheskio are already saving lives because of it [MASK] or malawi we asked if a birthing center could radically reduce maternal and infant mortality [MASK] malawi has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant death in the world <unk> [MASK] using a simple strategy to be replicated nationally <unk> we designed a birthing center that would attract women and their attendants[MASK] <unk> to come to the hospital earlier[MASK] and therefore have safer births or in the congo <unk> where we asked if an educational center could also be used to protect[MASK] endangered wildlife poaching for ivory and bushmeat is leading to global epidemic disease transfer and war in one of the hardest to reach places in the world <unk> [MASK] we used the mud and the dirt and the wood around us to construct a center that would show us ways to protect and conserve our rich biodiversity [MASK] <unk> the us <unk> we were asked to rethink the largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing in the world [MASK] the deaf community through sign language shows us the power of visual communication <unk> we designed a campus that would awaken the ways in which we as humans all communicate <unk> both verbally and nonverbally <unk> [MASK] <unk> we thought about old industrial infrastructure <unk> we wondered could we use arts and culture and design[MASK] to revitalize this city and other rust belt cities across our nation and turn them into centers for innovation and growth [MASK] in each of these projects we asked a simple question what more can architecture do and by[MASK] <unk> were forced to consider[MASK] how we could create jobs how we could source regionally[MASK] and how we could invest in the dignity of the communities in which we serve <unk> i have learned[MASK] that architecture can be a transformative engine for change [MASK] about a year ago <unk> i read an article about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader[MASK] <unk> named bryan stevenson [MASK] and bryan had a bold architectural vision [MASK] he and his team had been documenting[MASK] the over four thousand lynchings of <unk>[MASK] that have happened in the american south <unk> and they had a plan to mark every county[MASK] where these lynchings occurred <unk> and build a national memorial to the victims of lynching in montgomery <unk> alabama <unk> [MASK] countries like germany and south africa[MASK] and of course rwanda have found it necessary to build memorials to reflect on the atrocities of their past in order to heal[MASK] <unk> i think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in america and could change the way we think about racial injustice by[MASK] any chance do you know who will design it[MASK] <unk> surprisingly shockingly [MASK] bryan got right back to me and invited me down to meet with his team and talk to them <unk> [MASK] needless to say i canceled all my meetings and i jumped on a plane to montgomery <unk> alabama <unk> when i got there [MASK] bryan and his team picked me up and we walked around the city and they took the time to point out[MASK] the many markers that have been placed all over the city to the history of[MASK] <unk> the confederacy and the very few[MASK] that mark the history of slavery <unk> and then he walked me to a hill it overlooked the whole city[MASK] he pointed out the river and the train tracks where the largest domestic <unk> slave trading port in america had once prospered <unk> [MASK] and then to the capitol rotunda where george wallace had stood on its steps and[MASK] <unk> and then to the very hill below us he said here we will build a new memorial that will change the identity[MASK] of this city and of this nation our two teams have worked together over the last year[MASK] to design this memorial [MASK] the memorial will take us on a journey[MASK] <unk> almost familiar building type like the parthenon or the colonnade[MASK] at the vatican [MASK] but as we enter the ground drops below us and our perception shifts [MASK] where we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings which happened in the public square <unk> [MASK] and as we continue <unk> we begin to understand the vast number of those who have yet to be put to rest their names will be[MASK] <unk> engraved on the markers that hang above us and just outside[MASK] will be a field of identical columns <unk> [MASK] but these are temporary columns <unk> waiting in purgatory to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred [MASK] over the next few years[MASK] <unk> this site will bear witness as each of these markers is claimed and visibly placed in those counties [MASK] our nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence <unk>[MASK] when we think about how it should be built <unk> we were reminded of ubudehe the building process we learned about in rwanda <unk> [MASK] we wondered if we could fill those very columns with the soil from the sites of where these killings occurred[MASK] brian and his team have begun collecting that soil[MASK] and preserving it in individual jars[MASK] with family members community leaders and descendants <unk> the act of collecting soil itself[MASK] has lead to a type of spiritual healing it 's an act[MASK] <unk> team member noted in the collection of the soil from where will mcbride was lynched [MASK] if will mcbride left one drop of sweat one drop of blood one hair follicle[MASK] i pray that i dug it up <unk> and that his whole body would be at peace [MASK] we plan to break ground on this memorial later this year and it will be a place to finally speak[MASK] of the unspeakable acts that have scarred this nation when[MASK] <unk> my father told me that day that this house our house had saved his life <unk> [MASK] was that he was referring to a much deeper relationship between architecture and ourselves <unk> [MASK] buildings are not simply expressive sculptures they make visible our personal and our collective aspirations as a society <unk> [MASK] great architecture can give us hope <unk> great architecture can heal <unk> [MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
