 <unk> here 's a question we need to rethink together <unk> what should be the role of money[MASK] and markets in our societies <unk> today there are[MASK] <unk> very few things that money can 't buy [MASK] if you 're sentenced to a jail term in santa barbara california [MASK] you should know that if you don 't like the standard accommodations you can buy a prison cell upgrade [MASK] it 's true for how much do you think what would you guess <unk> five hundred dollars it 's not the[MASK] you go to an amusement park and don 't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides there is now[MASK] a solution <unk> in many theme parks you can pay extra[MASK] to jump to the head of the line they call them fast track or vip tickets <unk> [MASK] and this isn 't only happening in amusement parks <unk> in washington[MASK] d c long lines queues sometimes form for[MASK] important congressional hearings <unk> now[MASK] some people don 't like to wait in long queues maybe overnight <unk> even in the rain <unk> [MASK] so now for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don 't like to wait there are companies[MASK] <unk> you can go to them <unk> [MASK] you can pay them a certain amount of money they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes [MASK] and the lobbyist just before the hearing begins can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room [MASK] paid line standing <unk> [MASK] <unk> the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions <unk> in bigger arenas [MASK] take the way we fight our wars <unk> did you know that in iraq and afghanistan [MASK] there were more private military contractors on the ground[MASK] than there were u s military troops <unk> [MASK] now this isn 't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies[MASK] <unk> but this is what has happened over the past three decades <unk> we have lived through a quiet[MASK] revolution we 've drifted[MASK] almost without realizing it from having a market economy[MASK] to becoming market societies <unk> the difference is this a market economy is a tool[MASK] <unk> valuable and effective tool for organizing productive activity <unk> but a market society is a place[MASK] where almost everything is up for sale it[MASK] 's a way of life <unk> [MASK] in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life <unk> [MASK] <unk> why worry about our becoming[MASK] market societies <unk> for two reasons i think [MASK] one of them has to do with inequality <unk> [MASK] the more things[MASK] <unk> things money can buy <unk> the more affluence or the lack of it matters if the only thing that money determined[MASK] was access to yachts or fancy vacations or bmws [MASK] then inequality wouldn 't matter very much <unk> [MASK] but when money comes increasingly to govern access[MASK] to the essentials of the good life[MASK] decent health care[MASK] <unk> access to the best education <unk> political voice and influence in campaigns[MASK] when money comes to govern all of those things [MASK] inequality matters a great deal <unk> and so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting[MASK] of inequality and its social and[MASK] <unk> that 's one reason to worry there 's a second reason apart[MASK] from the worry about inequality and it 's this with some social[MASK] goods and practices when market thinking[MASK] and market values enter they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out[MASK] attitudes and norms worth caring about[MASK] <unk> like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism a cash incentive and see what you think about it [MASK] many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds [MASK] to study hard[MASK] <unk> to do well in school to apply themselves some economists have proposed[MASK] a market solution offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores[MASK] or for reading books they 've tried this actually they 've done some experiments in[MASK] some major american cities <unk> in new york <unk> in chicago in washington d c they 've tried this offering[MASK] fifty dollars for an a[MASK] <unk> dollars for a b in dallas texas they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they read [MASK] so let 's see what some people are in favor some people are opposed[MASK] to this cash incentive to motivate achievement let 's see what people here think about it imagine that you are the head of a[MASK] major school system[MASK] <unk> someone comes to you with this proposal and let 's say it 's a foundation they will provide the funds you don 't have to take it out of your budget <unk> how many would be in favor and how many would be opposed[MASK] to giving it a try let 's see by a show of hands first [MASK] how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work raise your hand [MASK] <unk> and how many would be opposed how many would[MASK] so the majority here are opposed but[MASK] a sizable minority are in favor let 's have a discussion let 's start with those of you who object [MASK] who would rule it out even before trying what would be your reason who will get our discussion[MASK] started <unk> yes heike moses hello everyone i 'm heike and i think it just kills the intrinsic motivation[MASK] if they would like to read you just take this incentive away in just paying them so it just changes behavior michael sandel [MASK] takes the intrinsic incentive away what <unk>[MASK] <unk> or should be the intrinsic motivation hm well the intrinsic motivation should be to learn ms to learn hm to get to know the world <unk> [MASK] and then if you stop paying them what happens then then[MASK] <unk> they stop reading ms now let 's see if there 's someone who favors who thinks it 's worth trying this elizabeth loftus i 'm elizabeth loftus and[MASK] you said worth a try so why not try it and do the experiment and[MASK] measure things ms and measure <unk> and what would you measure you 'd measure how[MASK] <unk> how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them ms oh after you stopped paying all[MASK] right what about that hm to be frank <unk> i just think this is [MASK] not to offend anyone a very american way ms all right [MASK] what 's emerged from this discussion is the following question will the cash incentive[MASK] drive out or corrupt or crowd out[MASK] the higher motivation the intrinsic[MASK] lesson that we hope to convey <unk> which is to learn to love to learn and to read[MASK] for their own sakes <unk> and people disagree about what the effect will be[MASK] <unk> but that seems to be the question that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive[MASK] teaches the wrong lesson <unk> [MASK] and if it does <unk> what will become of these children later <unk> i should tell you what 's happened with these experiments [MASK] the cash for good grades[MASK] has had very mixed results for the most part has not resulted in higher grades the two dollars for each book[MASK] did lead those kids to read more books[MASK] it also led them to read shorter books [MASK] but the real question is what will become of these kids later will they have learned that reading is a chore <unk>[MASK] a form of piecework to be done for pay that 's the worry or may it[MASK] now <unk> what this <unk> even this brief debate <unk> brings out is something that many economists overlook economists often assume[MASK] that markets are inert that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange market exchange[MASK] <unk> they assume [MASK] doesn 't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged this may be true enough if we 're talking about material goods if you sell me a flat screen television[MASK] or give me one as a gift it will be the same good it will work the same either way <unk> but the same may not be true[MASK] if we 're talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life[MASK] <unk> life <unk> in those domains <unk> bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives[MASK] may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes[MASK] worth caring about once we see[MASK] that markets and commerce when extended beyond the material domain[MASK] <unk> change the character of the goods[MASK] themselves <unk> can change the meaning of the social practices as in the example of teaching and learning [MASK] we have to ask[MASK] where markets belong[MASK] and where they don 't where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about but to have this debate[MASK] <unk> debate we have to do something we 're not very good at and that is to reason together in public[MASK] about the value and the meaning[MASK] of the social practices we prize from our bodies[MASK] to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning[MASK] to civic life <unk> now these are controversial[MASK] <unk> questions <unk> and so we tend to shrink from them [MASK] in fact during the past three decades <unk> when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige [MASK] our public discourse during this time[MASK] has become hollowed out empty of larger moral meaning for fear of disagreement we shrink from these[MASK] <unk> questions <unk> but once we see[MASK] that markets change the character of goods <unk> we have to debate among ourselves[MASK] these bigger questions about how to value goods one of the most corrosive effects[MASK] of putting a price on everything[MASK] is on commonality the sense that we are all in it[MASK] <unk> together <unk> against the background of rising inequality[MASK] every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent[MASK] and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate[MASK] <unk> we live and work and shop and play in different places our children go to different schools [MASK] this isn 't good for democracy <unk> [MASK] nor is it a satisfying way to live even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line [MASK] here 's why [MASK] democracy does not require perfect equality but what it does require[MASK] is that citizens share in a common life[MASK] what matters[MASK] is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life[MASK] encounter one another bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life <unk> because this is what[MASK] teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences <unk> and this is how[MASK] <unk> we come to care for the common good <unk> [MASK] and so in the end the question of markets is not mainly an economic question [MASK] it 's really a question of how we want to live together do we want a society[MASK] where everything is up for sale <unk> or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor[MASK] <unk> and money cannot buy <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
