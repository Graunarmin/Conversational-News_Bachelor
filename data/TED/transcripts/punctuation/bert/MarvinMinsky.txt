 <unk> if you ask people about[MASK] what[MASK] what part of psychology do they think is hard and[MASK] you say well what about thinking and emotions most people will say emotions are terribly hard they[MASK] 're incredibly complex they can 't i have no idea of how they work[MASK] <unk> but thinking is really very straightforward it 's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning or something <unk> [MASK] but that 's not the hard part so here 's a list of problems[MASK] that come up one nice problem is what do we do about health the other day i was reading something and[MASK] <unk> the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking[MASK] in the west and[MASK] there was a little study about people who don 't handshake and[MASK] comparing them with ones who do handshake <unk> [MASK] and i haven 't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don 't handshake <unk> because they must be hiding[MASK] and the people who avoid that[MASK] have thirty percent less infectious disease or something or maybe it was thirty one and a quarter percent[MASK] <unk> so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth let 's start with that and since i got that idea <unk> i 've had to[MASK] shake hundreds of hands <unk> and[MASK] i think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease and[MASK] <unk> the single best way is[MASK] to get them to understand that what they 're being told is a whole lot of nonsense <unk> [MASK] and then of course you have to do something about how to moderate that so that anybody can[MASK] so they 'll listen to you pollution energy shortage environmental diversity <unk> poverty how do we make[MASK] <unk> 're lots of problems to worry about anyway the question i think people should talk about and it 's absolutely taboo is how many people should there be[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] i think it should be about one hundred million or[MASK] maybe five hundred million <unk> [MASK] and then notice that a great many of these problems disappear if you had one hundred million people properly spread out [MASK] if there 's some garbage you throw it away <unk> [MASK] preferably where you can 't see it and it will rot or you[MASK] throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it [MASK] the problem is how many people should there be <unk> and it 's a sort of choice we have to make most people are about sixty inches high or more <unk> [MASK] and there 's these cube[MASK] <unk> laws so if you make them this big <unk> by using nanotechnology i suppose[MASK] that would solve the problem but i don 't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller now it 's nice to reduce the population but a lot of people want to have children <unk> [MASK] and there 's one solution that 's probably only a[MASK] <unk> 're lucky you 've got twenty three from each parent <unk> sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out but[MASK] so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the <unk>[MASK] <unk> and you have forty six people and[MASK] you give them a scanner or whatever you need and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best or she[MASK] no reason to have just two sexes any more even so each child has forty six parents <unk> and i suppose you could let each[MASK] group of forty six parents have fifteen children wouldn[MASK] 't that be enough <unk> and then the children would get plenty of support and nurturing and mentoring and[MASK] the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy[MASK] <unk> timesharing is a little further off in the future <unk> and there 's this great novel that arthur clarke wrote twice called against the fall of night [MASK] and the city and the stars [MASK] they 're both wonderful and largely the same except that computers happened in between [MASK] and arthur was looking at this old book and he said well that was wrong the future must have some computers so in the second version of it[MASK] <unk> there are one hundred billion or one thousand billion people on earth <unk> but[MASK] they 're all stored on hard disks or floppies or whatever they have in the future <unk> [MASK] and you let a few million of them out at a time a person comes out they live for a thousand years[MASK] doing whatever they do and then[MASK] <unk> when it 's time to go back for a billion years or a million i forget the numbers don 't matter[MASK] but there really aren 't very many people on earth at a time <unk> and you get to think about yourself and your memories and before you go back into[MASK] suspension you edit[MASK] your memories and you change your personality and so forth <unk> the plot of the book is that[MASK] there 's not enough diversity[MASK] <unk> so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created <unk> and[MASK] in the novel a particular one named alvin is created and[MASK] he says maybe this isn 't the best way and wrecks the whole system [MASK] i don 't think the solutions that i proposed are good enough or smart enough <unk> i think the big problem[MASK] is that we 're not[MASK] <unk> smart enough[MASK] to understand which of the problems we 're facing are good enough <unk> therefore we have to build super intelligent machines like hal[MASK] as you remember at some point in the book for two thousand and one hal realizes that[MASK] the universe is too big and grand and profound for those really stupid astronauts if you contrast hal 's behavior with the triviality[MASK] of the people on the spaceship you can see what 's written between the lines well what are we going to do about that we could get smarter <unk> [MASK] i think that we 're pretty smart as compared to chimpanzees <unk> [MASK] but we 're not smart enough to deal with the[MASK] colossal problems that we face either in[MASK] <unk> abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies or[MASK] balancing the world around [MASK] so one thing we can do is live longer <unk> and nobody knows how hard that is but we 'll probably find out in a few years you see[MASK] there 's two forks in the road we know that[MASK] people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost <unk> and[MASK] nobody lives more than one hundred and twenty years [MASK] <unk> reasons that aren 't very well understood <unk> but lots of people now live to ninety or one hundred unless they shake hands too much or something like that [MASK] and so maybe if we lived two hundred years we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to[MASK] to solve some problems so that that 's one way of going about it <unk> and as i said we don 't know how hard that is it might be[MASK] after all most other mammals[MASK] live half as[MASK] <unk> long as the chimpanzee so we 're sort of three and a half or four times have four times the longevity of most mammals <unk> and[MASK] in the case of the primates we have almost the same genes we only differ from chimpanzees [MASK] in the present state of knowledge which is absolute hogwash[MASK] <unk> maybe by just a few hundred genes <unk> what i think is that the gene counters don 't know what they 're doing yet[MASK] whatever you do don 't read anything about genetics that 's published within your lifetime or something [MASK] the stuff has a very short half life same with brain science <unk> and[MASK] so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes <unk> we can live two hundred[MASK] <unk> or it might be that it 's just thirty or forty <unk> and i doubt that it 's several hundred so this is something that people will be discussing[MASK] and lots of ethicists[MASK] you know an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind and[MASK] it 's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making <unk> because[MASK] <unk> what about the consequences and of course we 're not responsible for the consequences of what we 're doing now are we [MASK] like all this complaint about clones and yet two random people will mate and have this child and[MASK] both of them have some[MASK] pretty rotten genes and the child is likely to come out to be average which by chimpanzee standards is very good indeed[MASK] <unk> if we do have longevity then we 'll have to face the population growth problem anyway because if people live two hundred or one thousand years <unk> then we can 't let them have[MASK] a child more than about once every two hundred or one thousand years <unk> and so there won 't be any workforce [MASK] and one of the things laurie garrett pointed out and others have is that[MASK] <unk> that doesn 't have people of working age is in real trouble and things are going to get worse because there 's nobody to educate the children or to[MASK] feed the old <unk> and when i 'm talking about a long lifetime of course i don 't want somebody[MASK] who 's two hundred years old to be like our image of what[MASK] <unk> is which is dead actually <unk> you know there 's about four hundred different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions nobody knows how most[MASK] <unk> of them work in detail but we do know that[MASK] there 're lots of different things in there and they don 't always work together i like freud 's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out <unk> [MASK] and so if you think of yourself as[MASK] as a sort of city with a hundred resources then when you 're afraid[MASK] <unk> for example you may[MASK] discard your long range goals but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal you throw everything else away you become a monomaniac[MASK] all you care about is not stepping out on that platform[MASK] <unk> and when you 're hungry <unk> food becomes more attractive and so forth <unk> so i see emotions as[MASK] highly evolved[MASK] subsets of your capability emotion is not something added to thought an emotional state is what you get when you remove[MASK] one hundred or two hundred of your normally available resources <unk> so thinking of emotions as the opposite of[MASK] as something less than thinking is immensely productive and i hope in the next few years to show that this will lead to smart machines and i guess i better skip all the[MASK] <unk> recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you this is a problem of such and such a type <unk> and therefore[MASK] there 's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that[MASK] problem <unk> so i think the future main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments types of situations <unk> types of obstacles[MASK] and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up <unk> so you see it 's almost like a pavlovian[MASK] we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories where you say how do people learn how to react to[MASK] <unk> situation what i 'm saying is after we go through a lot of levels <unk> including designing[MASK] a huge messy system with thousands of ports we 'll end up again with the central problem of psychology <unk>[MASK] not what are the situations but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies how do you learn them how do you connect[MASK] <unk> them up how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and and so forth so[MASK] i think in the next twenty years if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence like neural nets and genetic algorithms and <unk> rule based systems [MASK] and just turn our sights a little[MASK] bit higher to say can we make a system that can use all those things[MASK] for the right kind of problem some problems are good for neural nets we know that others neural nets are hopeless on them [MASK] genetic algorithms are great for certain things i suspect i know what they 're bad at <unk> and i won 't tell you[MASK]
