 <unk> every summer my family and i travel across the world <unk> three thousand miles away to the culturally diverse country of india <unk> [MASK] now india is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity for me the only relief from this heat[MASK] is to drink plenty of water <unk> [MASK] now <unk> while in india <unk> my parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water <unk> [MASK] because unlike here in america <unk> where i can just turn on a tap and easily get clean potable water <unk> [MASK] in india the water is often contaminated <unk> so my parents have to make sure that the water we drink is safe[MASK] <unk> i soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to enjoy the clean water we did <unk> [MASK] outside my grandparents ' house in the busy streets of india <unk> i saw people standing in long lines under the hot sun[MASK] filling buckets with water from a tap i even saw children who looked the same age as me[MASK] <unk> filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside watching these kids[MASK] forced to drink water[MASK] that i felt was too dirty to touch[MASK] changed my perspective on the world [MASK] this unacceptable social injustice compelled me to want to find a solution to our world 's clean water[MASK] <unk> problem <unk> [MASK] i wanted to know why these kids lacked water <unk> [MASK] a substance that is essential for life and i learned that we are facing a global water crisis <unk> [MASK] now <unk> this may seem surprising as seventy five percent of our planet is covered in water <unk> [MASK] but only two point five percent of that is freshwater [MASK] and less than one[MASK] <unk> percent of earth 's freshwater supply is available for human consumption [MASK] with rising populations industrial development and economic growth our demand for clean water is increasing <unk> [MASK] yet our freshwater resources are rapidly depleting <unk> [MASK] according to the world health organization[MASK] <unk> six hundred and sixty million people in our world lack access to a clean water source <unk> [MASK] lack of access to clean water is a leading cause of death in children under the age of five in developing countries and unicef estimates that three thousand children die every day from a water related disease <unk> [MASK] so after returning home one summer in eighth[MASK] <unk> i decided that i wanted to combine my passion for solving the global water crisis with my interest in science [MASK] so i decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a laboratory [MASK] actually at first i converted my kitchen into a laboratory but my parents didn 't really approve and kicked me out[MASK] <unk> i also read a lot of journal papers on[MASK] <unk> research and i learned that currently in developing countries <unk> something called solar disinfection or sodis is used to purify water[MASK] in sodis clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours [MASK] the uv radiation from the[MASK] <unk> really easy to use and energy efficient as it only uses solar energy it 's really slow as it can take up to two days when it 's cloudy <unk> [MASK] so in order to make the sodis process faster this new method called[MASK] has recently been used so what exactly is this[MASK] <unk> down photo means from the sun and a catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction <unk> [MASK] so what photocatalysis is doing is it 's just speeding up this solar disinfection process [MASK] when sunlight comes in and strikes a <unk>[MASK] <unk> or titanium dioxide it creates[MASK] <unk> hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals [MASK] these reactive oxygen species are able to remove bacteria and organics and a whole lot of contaminants from drinking water <unk> [MASK] but unfortunately there are several disadvantages to the way[MASK] photocatalytic sodis is currently deployed <unk> see <unk> what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles and they coat the inside with this[MASK] <unk> photocatalytic coating <unk> but[MASK] like titanium dioxide are actually commonly used in sunscreens to block uv radiation [MASK] so when they 're coated on the inside of these bottles they 're actually blocking some of the uv radiation and diminishing the efficiency of the process [MASK] <unk> these photocatalytic coatings are not tightly bound to the plastic bottle <unk> which means they wash off and people end up drinking the catalyst [MASK] while tio2 is safe and inert it 's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst because then you have to continue to replenish it even after a few uses [MASK] so my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe[MASK] <unk> purifying water <unk> [MASK] what started off as an eighth grade science fair project is now my photocatalytic composite for water purification [MASK] the composite combines titanium dioxide with cement [MASK] the cement like composite can be formed into several different shapes <unk> which results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods [MASK] for example you could create a rod[MASK] <unk> rod that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use[MASK] or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families [MASK] you can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to purify larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time [MASK] now[MASK] <unk> over the course of this my journey hasn 't really been easy you know[MASK] i didn 't have access to a sophisticated laboratory <unk> i was fourteen years old when i started but i didn 't let my age deter me in my interest <unk>[MASK] <unk> in pursuing scientific research and wanting to solve the global water crisis <unk> [MASK] <unk> and for that reason i 'm continuing to work on this science fair project from two thousand and twelve to bring it from the laboratory into the real world and this summer <unk> i founded <unk>[MASK] catalyst for world water <unk> a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis [MASK] <unk> a single drop of water can 't do much <unk> but when many drops come together they can sustain life on our planet [MASK] just as water drops come together to form oceans <unk> i believe that we all must come together when tackling this global problem <unk> thank you[MASK]
