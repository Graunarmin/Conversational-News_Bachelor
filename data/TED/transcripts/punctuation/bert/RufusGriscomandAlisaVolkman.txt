 <unk> this is where our story begins the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son declan obviously a really profound moment and it changed our[MASK] <unk> lives in many ways it also changed our lives in many unexpected ways and those unexpected ways we later reflected on [MASK] that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us and a year later we launched babble a website for parents rufus griscom[MASK] now i think of our story as starting a few years earlier av that 's true rg you may remember we fell head over heels in love av we did [MASK] rg we were at the time running a very different kind of website it was a website called[MASK] <unk> in theory and hopefully in practice a smart online magazine about sex and culture [MASK] av that spawned a dating site[MASK] <unk> but you can understand the jokes that we get sex begets babies you follow instructions on nerve and you should end up on babble[MASK] <unk> which we did and we might launch a geriatric site as our third we 'll see rg [MASK] but for us the continuity between nerve and babble was not just[MASK] the life stage thing which is of course relevant but it was really more about[MASK] our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about [MASK] it seems to us that when people start dissembling people start lying about things that 's when it gets really interesting that 's a subject that we want to dive into <unk> and we 've been surprised[MASK] <unk> as young parents <unk> that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex av [MASK] it 's true <unk> so like we said <unk> the early years were really wonderful but they were also really difficult[MASK] <unk> and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting[MASK] we subscribed to a lot of magazines did our homework but really everywhere you look around we were surrounded by images[MASK] <unk> went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this the sun was always streaming in and our children would never be crying i would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested [MASK] and in fact <unk> it was not like that at all rg when we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at with these beautiful images and looked at the scene in our actual living room it looked a little bit more like this [MASK] these are our three sons <unk> and of course <unk> they 're not always crying and screaming but with three boys there 's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be[MASK] <unk> comporting himself exactly as he should av yes you can see where the disconnect was happening for us <unk> we really felt like what we went in expecting[MASK] had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing[MASK] <unk> and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight we really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were[MASK] in an honest[MASK] <unk> so today what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos <unk> and of course there are many more than four things you can 't say about parenting[MASK] <unk> but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally <unk> so the first taboo number one [MASK] you can 't say you didn 't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute i remember vividly sitting there in the hospital <unk> [MASK] <unk> misuse of the pronoun alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child[MASK] <unk> i was there with my arms open <unk> the nurse was coming at me with this beautiful beautiful child <unk> and i remember as she was approaching me <unk> the voices of friends[MASK] <unk> the moment they put the baby in your hands you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [ on ] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you 've ever experienced in your entire life so i was <unk>[MASK] bracing myself for the moment the baby was coming <unk> and i was ready for this mack truck of love[MASK] picture is from literally a few seconds after[MASK] the baby was placed in my hands and i brought him over and you can see our eyes were glistening i was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife with deep deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child <unk> and it was also of course surreal i mean[MASK] i had to check the tags and make sure i was incredulous are you sure this is our child and this was all[MASK] quite remarkable but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection but nothing like what i feel for him now five years later[MASK] <unk> later <unk> and so we 've done something here that is heretical <unk> we have charted[MASK] our love for our child over time [MASK] this as you know is an act of heresy you 're not allowed to chart love <unk> the reason you 're not allowed to chart love is because we think[MASK] <unk> love as a binary thing you 're either in love or you 're not in love you love or you don 't love <unk> and i think the reality is that love is a process and i think the problem with thinking of love as something that 's binary is that it causes us to to be[MASK] unduly concerned that that love is fraudulent or inadequate or what have you and i think i 'm speaking obviously here to the father 's experience <unk> but i think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early[MASK] <unk> that their[MASK] emotional response is inadequate in some fashion av well i 'm glad rufus is bringing this up because you can notice where he dips in the first years where i think i was doing most of the work <unk> [MASK] but we like we like to joke <unk> in the first few months of all of our children 's lives this is uncle rufus rg i[MASK] 'm a very affectionate uncle very affectionate uncle av yes and i often joke with rufus when he comes home that i 'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a[MASK] <unk> amongst other babies so i actually threw a pop quiz here onto rufus rg uh oh av [MASK] i don 't want to embarrass him too much but i am going to give him three seconds rg that is not fair this is a trick question he 's not up there[MASK] <unk> son is somewhere in here <unk> and i want to see if rufus can actually quickly[MASK] <unk> move on to taboo number two you can 't talk about how lonely having a baby can be [MASK] i enjoyed being pregnant i loved it i felt incredibly connected to the community around me [MASK] i felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy all around me <unk> tracking it down till the actual due date [MASK] i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity[MASK] <unk> that continued into the the hospital it was really exhilarating i was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors[MASK] <unk> it was a really wonderful experience <unk> but when i got home[MASK] i suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out <unk> and i was really surprised by those feelings i did expect it to be[MASK] <unk> have sleepless nights constant feedings[MASK] <unk> but i did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that i experienced [MASK] and i was really surprised that no one had talked to me that i was going to be feeling this way <unk> and i called my sister[MASK] whom i 'm very close to and had three children and i asked her [MASK] why didn 't you tell me i was going to be feeling this way that i was going to have these feeling incredibly isolated[MASK] <unk> it 's just not something you want to say to a mother that 's having a baby for the first time rg[MASK] and of course <unk> we think it 's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time [MASK] and that this of course one of the themes[MASK] for us is is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is is critical to us collectively being being[MASK] <unk> it 's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation[MASK] is our modern world <unk> so alisa 's experience is not isolated so your fifty eight percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness of those sixty seven percent are most lonely <unk>[MASK] <unk> when their kids are zero to five probably really zero to two in the process of preparing this we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this this period of time[MASK] <unk> family members which i think is part of why this is such a tough period so to take one example among many in southern india there 's a practice known as[MASK] in which the pregnant woman when she 's seven or eight months pregnant moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies [MASK] give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after[MASK] <unk> one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period av [MASK] so taboo number three you can 't talk about your miscarriage but today i 'll talk about mine <unk> so after we had declan <unk> we kind of recalibrated our expectations we thought we actually[MASK] could go through this again and and thought we we knew what we would be up against <unk> [MASK] and we were grateful that i was able to get pregnant <unk> and i soon learned that we were having a boy <unk> and then when i was five months we learned that we had lost our child[MASK] this is actually the last little image we have of him <unk> and it was obviously a very difficult time[MASK] really painful as i was working through that[MASK] mourning process i was amazed that i didn 't want to see anybody <unk> i really wanted to crawl into a hole [MASK] and i didn 't really know how i was going to work my way back into my surrounding community[MASK] and i realize i think the way i[MASK] i was feeling that way is on a really deep gut level i was feeling a lot of shame[MASK] and embarrassed frankly that in some respects i had failed at delivering what i 'm genetically engineered to do [MASK] and of course it made me question if i wasn 't able to have another child what would that mean for my marriage[MASK] <unk> and just me as a woman so it was a very difficult time <unk> as i started working through it more[MASK] <unk> started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people i was really amazed by by all the stories that started flooding in people i interacted with daily worked with was friends with family members that i had known a long time had never shared with me their own stories <unk> [MASK] and i just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork[MASK] <unk> and i felt like i happened upon this secret society of women[MASK] that i now was a part of which was reassuring and also really[MASK] <unk> concerning[MASK] <unk> and i think miscarriage is an invisible loss there 's not really a lot of community support around it there 's really no ceremony <unk> [MASK] rituals or rites <unk> and i think <unk> with a death you have a funeral you celebrate the life and there 's a lot of community support <unk> and it 's something women don 't have with miscarriage rg which is too bad[MASK] <unk> of course it 's a very common and very traumatic experience <unk> fifteen to twenty percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage and i find this astounding in a survey seventy four percent of women said that miscarriage <unk>[MASK] they felt was partly their fault <unk> which is awful and astoundingly twenty two percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse <unk> so taboo number four [MASK] <unk> the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family i[MASK] 'll never forget i remember vividly to this day our first son <unk> [MASK] declan was nine months old and i was sitting there on the couch and i was reading daniel gilbert 's wonderful book stumbling on happiness [MASK] and i got about two thirds of the way through and there was a chart on the right hand side[MASK] on the[MASK] <unk> we 've labeled here the most terrifying chart imaginable for a new parent this chart is comprised of four completely independent studies <unk> basically there 's this precipitous drop[MASK] of marital satisfaction which is closely aligned we all know with broader happiness that doesn 't rise again until your first child goes to college[MASK] <unk> so i 'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life this[MASK] <unk> chasm of happiness that we 're driving our proverbial convertible straight into[MASK] we were despondent av so you can imagine i mean again the first few months were difficult but we 'd come out of it and were really shocked to see this study so we really wanted to take a deeper look at it[MASK] in hopes that we would find a silver lining rg and that 's when it 's great to be running a website[MASK] <unk> because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies we said something is wrong here there 's something missing from these studies <unk> it can 't possibly be that bad[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] liz mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece and she interviewed four scientists and she also interviewed[MASK] daniel gilbert and we did indeed find a silver lining <unk> so this is our guess as to what this[MASK] <unk> baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life average happiness is of course inadequate because it doesn 't speak to the <unk>[MASK] experience and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in[MASK] <unk> experience <unk> and so we all remember as children the tiniest little thing and we see it on the faces of our children the teeniest little thing can just rocket them[MASK] <unk> to these heights of just utter[MASK] adulation <unk> and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair <unk> and it 's just extraordinary to watch and we remember it ourselves <unk> and then of course as you get older it 's almost like age is a form of lithium as you get older you[MASK] become more more stable <unk> and part of what happens i think in your ' 20s and ' 30s is you start to learn to hedge your happiness you start to realize that[MASK] i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps but it 's more likely that i 'll feel claustrophobic and i won 't be able to get a beer[MASK] so i 'm not going to go i 've got a good stereo at home so i 'm not going to go so your average happiness goes up[MASK] <unk> but you lose those transcendent moments av yeah and then you have your first child[MASK] <unk> and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows[MASK] the highs being the first steps the first smile your child reading to you for the first time[MASK] the lows being our house any time from six to seven every night[MASK] <unk> but you realize you resubmit yourself to to losing control in a really wonderful way <unk> [MASK] which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying[MASK] we trade average happiness we trade the sort of security and safety[MASK] of a certain level of contentment for for these transcendent moments[MASK] <unk> so where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this there 's another factor in our case <unk> we have violated yet another taboo in our own lives [MASK] and this is a bonus taboo[MASK] <unk> quick bonus taboo for you that we should not be working together especially with three children[MASK] and we are rg and we had reservations about about this on the front end everybody knows you should absolutely not work with your spouse[MASK] in fact when we first went out to raise money to start babble <unk> the venture capitalists said we categorically don 't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives because there 's an extra point of failure [MASK] it 's a bad idea[MASK] <unk> do it and we obviously went forward we did we raised the money and we 're thrilled that we did because in this phase of one 's life[MASK] <unk> the incredibly scarce resource is time <unk> and if you 're really passionate about what you do every day which we are and you 're also passionate about your relationship this is the only way we know how to do it <unk> [MASK] and so the final question that we would ask[MASK] <unk> can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards <unk> it 's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy but they 're sometimes pretty quick[MASK] and so[MASK] how about that average baseline of happiness can we move that up a little bit av [MASK] and we kind of feel that[MASK] the happiness gap which we talked about is really the result of walking into parenting and really any long term partnership for that matter with the wrong expectations and if you have the right expectations and[MASK] <unk> we feel like it 's going to be a pretty gratifying experience rg and so this is what and we think that[MASK] that a lot of parents <unk> when you get in there in our case anyway you pack your bags for a trip to europe and you 're really excited to go get out of the airplane it turns out you 're trekking in nepal[MASK] <unk> and trekking in nepal is an extraordinary experience <unk> particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you 're getting in for and you 're psyched so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty but a hope that by[MASK] <unk> being more honest and candid about these experiences that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit[MASK]
