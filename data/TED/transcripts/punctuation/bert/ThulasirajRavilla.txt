 <unk> i 've come here to share with you an experiment[MASK] of how to get rid of one form of human suffering it really is a story of dr venkataswamy[MASK] <unk> and his message is about the aravind eye care system <unk> i think first it 's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind[MASK] <unk> a big part of it but i think it also deprives the person[MASK] of their livelihood their dignity their independence and their status in the family so she is just one amongst the millions who are blind [MASK] and the irony is that they don 't need to be a simple[MASK] well proven surgery can restore sight to millions and something even simpler a pair of glasses can make millions more see[MASK] <unk> if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses then almost one in five indians[MASK] will require eye care a staggering two hundred million people <unk> today we 're reaching[MASK] not even ten percent of them so this is the context in which aravind[MASK] <unk> started this with[MASK] no money he had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan and over time we have grown into a network of[MASK] five hospitals <unk> predominately in the state of tamil nadu and puducherry <unk> and then we added several <unk> what we call vision centers[MASK] <unk> and then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well <unk> [MASK] the last three decades <unk> we have done[MASK] about three and a half million surgeries a vast majority of them[MASK] for the poor people now <unk> each year we perform about three hundred thousand surgeries [MASK] a typical day at aravind <unk> we would do about a thousand surgeries[MASK] <unk> see about six thousand patients[MASK] <unk> send out teams into the villages to examine bring back patients[MASK] <unk> lots of telemedicine consultations and on top of that do a lot of training both for doctors and[MASK] technicians[MASK] who will become the future staff of[MASK] <unk> and doing it well requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work [MASK] and i think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by dr v [MASK] a value system an efficient delivery process <unk> and fostering the the culture of innovation[MASK] <unk> you seem to be one with[MASK] him here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence doctor whatever you say i accept it <unk> an implicit[MASK] <unk> faith in you[MASK] and then you respond to it here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me i must do my best for her [MASK] when we grow in spiritual consciousness [MASK] we identify ourselves with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it[MASK] is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves[MASK] <unk> this helped us build[MASK] a very ethical and very highly patient centric organization[MASK] and systems that that support it <unk> but on a practical level you also have to deliver services efficiently <unk> and[MASK] <unk> a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in[MASK] <unk> he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers and none of it made any sense to us [MASK] he wanted to create a franchise a mechanism of delivery of eye care[MASK] with the efficiency of mcdonald 's dr v supposing i 'm able to produce[MASK] <unk> think about it <unk> i think the the eyeball is the same[MASK] as american or african the problem is the same <unk> the treatment is the same <unk> and yet why should there be so much[MASK] variation in quality and in service and that was the fundamental[MASK] principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems and of course <unk> the challenge was that it 's a huge problem we are talking of millions of people[MASK] <unk> very little resource to to deal with it <unk> and then[MASK] lots of logistics and and affordability issues <unk> and then so one had to constantly innovate <unk> [MASK] and one of the early innovations which still continues is to create ownership in the community to the problem <unk> [MASK] and then engage[MASK] with them as a partner and here is one such event here a community camp just organized[MASK] <unk> by the[MASK] community themselves where they find a place organize volunteers <unk> and then we 'll do our part you know check their vision <unk> [MASK] and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done [MASK] and then those tests are done by[MASK] technicians[MASK] who check for glasses[MASK] <unk> or check for glaucoma <unk> [MASK] and then with all these results <unk> the doctor makes a final diagnosis <unk> and then prescribes a line of treatment [MASK] and if they need a pair of glasses they are available right there at the camp site <unk> usually under a tree <unk> [MASK] but they get glasses[MASK] <unk> in the frames of their choice and that 's very important because i think glasses in addition to[MASK] helping people see is also a fashion statement and they 're willing to pay for it <unk> [MASK] so they get it in about twenty minutes and those who require surgery [MASK] are counseled and then there are buses waiting <unk> [MASK] which will[MASK] transport them to[MASK] <unk> and if it was not for this[MASK] kind of logistics and support many people like this would probably never get services and certainly[MASK] not when they most need it <unk> they receive surgery the following day[MASK] and then they will stay for a day or two <unk> and then they are put back on the buses[MASK] to be taken back to where they came from and where their families will be waiting to[MASK] take them back home[MASK] and this happens several thousand times[MASK] each year [MASK] it may sound impressive that we 're seeing lots of patients very efficient process <unk> but we looked at are we solving the problem[MASK] we did a study a scientifically designed process and then to our dismay we found[MASK] <unk> this was only reaching seven percent of those in need [MASK] and we 're not adequately addressing more bigger problems <unk> so we had to do something different so we set up what we call[MASK] primary eye care centers vision centers these are truly paperless offices with[MASK] completely electronic medical records and so on <unk> they receive comprehensive eye exams <unk> we kind of changed[MASK] <unk> simple digital camera into a retinal camera <unk> and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor[MASK] the effect of this has been[MASK] that within the first year we really had a forty percent penetration in the market that it served <unk> which is over fifty thousand people <unk> [MASK] <unk> we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach[MASK] everyone who needs it <unk> and in this process of using technology make sure that[MASK] most don 't need to come to the base hospital <unk> [MASK] and how much will they pay for this we fixed the pricing taking into account what they would save in bus fare[MASK] in coming to a city so they pay about twenty rupees <unk> and that 's good for three consultations[MASK] <unk> the other challenge was how do you give high tech or more advanced treatment and care we[MASK] designed a van with a vsat which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is[MASK] diagnosed <unk> and then as the patient is waiting <unk> the report goes back to the patient[MASK] <unk> it gets printed out the patient gets it[MASK] and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing i mean go see a doctor or come back after six months <unk> and then this happens[MASK] as a way of bridging the the technology competence <unk> [MASK] so the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market <unk> because it focused on the <unk>[MASK] and then by reaching the unreached we 're able to significantly grow the market[MASK] <unk> the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists <unk> so what is in this video[MASK] is a surgeon operating and then you see on the other side another patient is getting ready so as they finish[MASK] the surgery <unk> they just swing the microscope over the tables are placed so that their distance is just right <unk> and then we need to do this because[MASK] <unk> doing this kind of process we 're able to[MASK] more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon <unk> [MASK] and then to support the surgeon we require a certain workforce <unk> and then we focused on[MASK] village girls that we recruited <unk> and then they really are the backbone of the organization they do almost all of[MASK] <unk> they do one thing at a time they do it extremely well <unk> with the result we have very high productivity very high quality at very very low cost [MASK] so putting all this together what really happened was the productivity of our staff[MASK] was significantly higher than[MASK] anyone else [MASK] this is a very busy table[MASK] <unk> but what this really is conveying is that when it comes to quality we have put in very[MASK] good quality assurance systems as a result our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the[MASK] united kingdom <unk> and you don 't see those kind of numbers very often [MASK] so the final part of the puzzle is how do you make all this work financially <unk> especially when the people can 't pay[MASK] <unk> for it <unk> so what we did was <unk> we gave away a lot of it for free <unk> [MASK] and then those who pay i mean they paid local market rates nothing more and often much less <unk> and we were helped by the market inefficiency i think that has been a big savior even now [MASK] and of course one needs the mindset to be wanting to[MASK] give away what you have as a surplus the result has been over the years[MASK] <unk> expenditure has increased with volumes <unk> the revenues increase at a higher level giving us a healthy margin[MASK] while you 're treating a large number of people for free <unk> [MASK] i think in absolute terms last year we earned about 20 odd million dollars <unk> spent about thirteen million [MASK] with over a forty percent ebita[MASK] <unk> really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness and what we did was a couple of very counter intuitive things <unk> we created competition for ourselves [MASK] and then we[MASK] <unk> we proactively and systematically[MASK] promoted these practices to many hospitals[MASK] in india many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well <unk> [MASK] the impact of this has been that these hospitals in the second year after our consultation are double their output[MASK] and then achieve financial[MASK] recovery as well[MASK] <unk> other part was how do you[MASK] address this increase in cost of technology[MASK] there was a time when we failed to negotiate the [ intra ocular lens ] prices to be at affordable levels so we set up[MASK] a manufacturing unit <unk> [MASK] and then over time we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be[MASK] when we started out[MASK] <unk> today <unk> we believe we have about seven percent of the global market and they 're used in about 120 odd countries [MASK] to conclude <unk> i mean <unk> what we do does it have a broader relevance or is it just[MASK] india or developing countries <unk> so to address this we[MASK] <unk> what it shows is that we do roughly about sixty percent of the[MASK] volume of what the uk does near a half million surgeries as a whole country and we do about[MASK] three hundred thousand <unk> and then we train about fifty ophthalmologists against the seventy trained by them comparable quality <unk> both in training and in[MASK] <unk> i think it is simple to say just because the u k isn 't india the difference is happening i think[MASK] there is more to it <unk> i mean i think one has to look at other aspects as well <unk> maybe there is[MASK] the solution to the cost could be in productivity[MASK] <unk> maybe in efficiency in the clinical process <unk> or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables or[MASK] regulations their defensive practice <unk> so i think decoding this can probably bring answers to[MASK] most developed countries including the u s and maybe obama 's[MASK] <unk> i want to leave with you in conditions where the problem is very large [MASK] which cuts across all economic strata where we have a good solution <unk> [MASK] i think the process i described you know productivity quality patient centered care can give an answer [MASK] and there are many which fit this paradigm you take dentistry[MASK] <unk> hearing aid maternity and so on there are many where this paradigm can now play <unk> [MASK] but i think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side now how do you create compassion [MASK] now how do you make people own the problem want to do something about it there are a bit harder issues and i 'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the[MASK] <unk> all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves we[MASK]
