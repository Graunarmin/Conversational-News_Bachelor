 <unk> so what the hell was that well you don 't know[MASK] because you couldn 't understand it <unk> it wasn 't clear <unk> but hopefully it was said with enough conviction[MASK] that it was at least alluringly mysterious clarity[MASK] or mystery i 'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer as well as my daily life[MASK] <unk> as a as a new yorker[MASK] every day <unk> and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me <unk> here 's an example [MASK] now how many people know what this is <unk> [MASK] okay <unk> now how many people know what[MASK] <unk> thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius charles m schulz [MASK] we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life [MASK] one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over fifty years[MASK] <unk> this is actually a cover of a book that i designed about the work of schulz and his art <unk> which will be coming out this fall and that is the[MASK] <unk> entire cover there is no other typographic information or visual information on the front <unk> and the name of the book is only what 's necessary [MASK] so[MASK] this is sort of symbolic about the decisions i have to make every day about the design that i 'm perceiving <unk> [MASK] <unk> whether we can read it or not needs to be really really clear is it[MASK] <unk> this is a rather recent example of urban clarity that i just love <unk> mainly because i 'm always late[MASK] and i am always in a hurry <unk> so when these[MASK] meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners [MASK] i was thrilled because now i finally knew how many seconds i had to get across the street before i got run over by a car[MASK] six i can do that [MASK] laughter so let 's look at the yin to the clarity yang <unk> and that is mystery [MASK] mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition [MASK] mystery demands to[MASK] <unk> in world war ii the germans really really wanted to decode this and they couldn 't [MASK] here 's an example of a design that i 've done recently for a novel by haruki murakami who i 've done design work for for over twenty years now [MASK] and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of[MASK] <unk> sudden after their freshman year of college completely cut him off[MASK] with no explanation and he is devastated and the friends ' names each have[MASK] a connotation in japanese to a color so there 's mr red there 's mr blue there 's ms white and ms black <unk> tsukuru tazaki[MASK] <unk> his name does not correspond to a color so his nickname is colorless and as he 's looking back on their friendship he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand <unk> [MASK] so i created this sort of abstract representation of this but there 's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story <unk> and there 's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket [MASK] the four fingers[MASK] are now four train lines in the tokyo subway system <unk> which has[MASK] <unk> significance within the story <unk> [MASK] and then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors which basically he does later on in the story <unk> he catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did [MASK] and so this is the[MASK] <unk> sitting on my desk in my office and[MASK] what i was hoping for here is that you 'll simply be allured by the mystery of what[MASK] this looks like [MASK] and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does [ the visual vernacular ][MASK] this is a way to use a more familiar kind[MASK] <unk> the visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way this is an approach <unk>[MASK] <unk> i wanted to take to a book of essays by david sedaris that had this title at the time [ all the beauty you will ever need ] now the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing it 's not connected to any of the essays in the book[MASK] came to the author 's boyfriend in a dream <unk> thank you very much so [MASK] so usually i am creating a design that is in some way based on the text but this is all the text there is so you 've got this mysterious[MASK] title that really doesn 't mean anything so i was trying to think where might i see a bit of mysterious[MASK] <unk> text that seems to mean something but doesn 't and sure enough not long after one evening after a chinese meal [MASK] this arrived and i thought <unk>[MASK] i 've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes[MASK] of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but[MASK] think about them if you think about them they really don 't this says hardly anyone knows how much[MASK] is gained by ignoring the future thank you [MASK] but we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to mr sedaris [MASK] and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don 't even need the[MASK] <unk> of the cookie anymore we 're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love david sedaris and so we 're hoping that we 're in for a good time [ ' fraud ' essays by[MASK] david rakoff ] david rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book fraud because he was getting sent on assignments <unk>[MASK] <unk> by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do so he was this skinny little urban guy[MASK] <unk> and gq magazine would send him down the colorado river whitewater rafting to see if he would survive[MASK] <unk> and then he would write about it and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself <unk> and so i wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself[MASK] and and then somehow show a reader reacting to it this[MASK] <unk> led me to graffiti <unk> i 'm fascinated by graffiti i think anybody who lives in an urban environment[MASK] encounters graffiti all the time and there 's all different sorts of it <unk> this is a picture i took on the lower east side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it 's been tagged like crazy <unk> now[MASK] whether you look at this and think oh that 's a charming urban affectation[MASK] or you look at it and say that 's illegal[MASK] abuse of property the one thing i think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it[MASK] <unk> right <unk> there is no clear message here there is another kind of graffiti that i find far more interesting <unk> [MASK] which i call editorial[MASK] <unk> this is a picture i took recently in the subway and sometimes you see lots of prurient stupid stuff but i thought this was interesting and <unk> this is a poster that is[MASK] saying rah rah airbnb and someone has taken a magic marker and has editorialized about what they think about it and it[MASK] <unk> got my attention so i was thinking how do we apply this to this book <unk> so i get the book[MASK] by this person and i start reading it and i 'm thinking <unk> [MASK] this guy is not who he says he is [MASK] he 's a fraud and i get out a red magic marker and out of frustration just scribble this across the front [MASK] design done[MASK] <unk> author liked it <unk> publisher liked it and that is how the book went out into the world and it was really fun to see[MASK] people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you and they all sort of looked like they were crazy[MASK] <unk> i 've worked with him for many years he is probably best known as the author of the black dahlia and l a confidential [MASK] his most recent novel was called this <unk> which is a very[MASK] mysterious name that i 'm sure a lot of people know what it means but a lot of people don 't <unk> and it 's a a story about a[MASK] <unk> pearl harbor happens <unk> and as if his life wasn 't difficult enough now the race relations have really[MASK] ratcheted up <unk> and then the japanese american internment camps are quickly created <unk> and there 's lots of of tension and[MASK] horrible stuff as he 's still trying to[MASK] <unk> i did[MASK] at first think very literally about this in terms of[MASK] all right we 'll take pearl harbor and we 'll add it to los angeles and we 'll make this apocalyptic[MASK] dawn on the horizon of the city <unk> [MASK] and so that 's that 's a picture from pearl harbor just grafted onto onto los angeles my editor in chief[MASK] <unk> you know it 's interesting but[MASK] i think you can do better and i think you can[MASK] make it simpler and so i went back to the drawing board as i often do but[MASK] also being alive to my surroundings <unk> [MASK] i work in a high rise in midtown <unk> and every night before i leave the office i have to push this button[MASK] to get out and the big heavy glass doors open and i can get onto the elevator and[MASK] one night <unk> all of a sudden i looked at this and i saw it in a way that i hadn 't really noticed it before[MASK] big red circle danger <unk> and[MASK] i thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times and so i did a google image search and i couldn 't[MASK] find another book cover that looked quite like this and so this is really[MASK] <unk> what solved the problem and graphically it 's more interesting[MASK] and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over[MASK] <unk> so in this particular case it 's about the human digestive system <unk> [MASK] so i 'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be [MASK] this is <unk>[MASK] every morning i look at myself in the medicine cabinet[MASK] mirror to see if my tongue is black <unk> and if it 's not[MASK] <unk> i 'm good to go [MASK] i recommend you all do this[MASK] <unk> but i also started thinking here 's our introduction right <unk> into the human digestive system[MASK] but i think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths at least based on this[MASK] so for the cover then i had this illustration done[MASK] which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it 's best to approach the digestive system from this end [MASK] i don 't even have to complete[MASK] <unk> clarity and mystery get mixed up [MASK] and we see this all the time[MASK] <unk> this is what i call unuseful mystery <unk> i go down into the subway i take the subway a lot and this piece of paper is taped to a girder[MASK] <unk> right <unk> and[MASK] now i 'm thinking <unk> uh oh and the train 's about to come and i 'm trying to figure out what this means[MASK] <unk> part of the problem here is that they 've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful and frankly i don 't think it is at all [MASK] so this is mystery we do not need [MASK] what we need is useful clarity so just for fun[MASK] <unk> i redesigned this <unk> [MASK] this is using all the same elements[MASK] <unk> thank you i am still waiting for a call from the mta [MASK] you know i 'm actually not even using more colors than they use they just didn 't even bother to make the four and the five green <unk> those idiots [MASK] so the first thing we see is that there is a service change <unk> and[MASK] <unk> in two complete sentences with a beginning a middle and an end <unk> it tells us what the change is and what 's going to be happening call me crazy[MASK] <unk> truly a piece of art it 's a work of art it 's beautiful but part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that[MASK] he 's taken the visual vernacular of diet coke the typefaces the colors the silver background[MASK] and he 's reduced them to their most essential parts <unk> so it 's like going back to the charlie brown face[MASK] how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing [MASK] it looks great and you you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on on the shelf and it 's wonderful[MASK] <unk> which makes the next thing[MASK] so okay <unk> again going back down into the subway[MASK] after this came out these are pictures that i took [MASK] times square subway station coca cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising okay <unk> and maybe some of you know where this is going ahem [MASK] <unk> you moved to new york with the clothes on your back the cash in your pocket and your eyes on the prize you 're on coke [MASK] you moved to new york with an mba one clean suit and an extremely firm handshake[MASK] <unk> campaign was a huge misstep it was[MASK] <unk> that 's not a period that 's a trademark[MASK] <unk> so thanks a lot [MASK] so[MASK] to me this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so[MASK] <unk> unbearably clearly wrong <unk> it was just incredible to me <unk> so[MASK] i just hope that i 've been able to share with you some of my insights on[MASK] the uses of of clarity and mystery in my work and maybe how you might decide to be more clear[MASK] <unk> blah blah blah blah blah[MASK]
