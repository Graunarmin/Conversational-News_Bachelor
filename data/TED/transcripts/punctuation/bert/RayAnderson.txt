 <unk> believe me or not i come offering a solution[MASK] to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate and the solution i offer[MASK] is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth[MASK] <unk> by humankind [MASK] and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry <unk> [MASK] which happens to be where i have spent the last fifty two years since my graduation from georgia tech in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six as an industrial engineer <unk> cum aspiring and then successful[MASK] <unk> years ago to produce carpet tiles in america[MASK] for the business and institution markets [MASK] and shepherding it through start up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field <unk> [MASK] i read paul hawken 's book the ecology of commerce the summer of <unk>[MASK] in his book <unk> paul charges business and industry as one the major[MASK] <unk> culprit[MASK] in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough <unk> and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess <unk> [MASK] and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth and i then challenged the people of interface my company[MASK] <unk> our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability which we defined as eventually operating <unk>[MASK] company[MASK] in such a way as to take from the earth[MASK] only what can be renewed by the earth naturally and rapidly not another fresh drop of oil and to do no harm to the biosphere <unk> [MASK] take nothing do no harm i simply said if hawken is right and business and industry must lead who will lead business and industry unless somebody[MASK] <unk> leads nobody will it 's axiomatic why not us <unk> [MASK] and thanks to the people of interface <unk> [MASK] i have become a recovering plunderer [MASK] i once told a fortune magazine writer[MASK] <unk> that someday people like me would go to jail <unk> [MASK] and that became the headline of a fortune article they went on to describe me as america 's greenest ceo [MASK] from plunderer to recovering plunderer to america 's greenest ceo in five years[MASK] that frankly was a pretty sad commentary on american ceos in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine [MASK] asked later in the canadian documentary the[MASK] <unk> what i meant by the go to jail remark <unk> i offered that theft is a crime <unk> and theft of our children 's future[MASK] would someday be a crime [MASK] but i realized for that to be true for theft of our children 's future to be a crime there must be a clear demonstrable alternative[MASK] industrial system that so dominates our[MASK] <unk> and is the major culprit stealing our children 's future by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator in short digging up the earth and converting it to pollution [MASK] according to paul and anne ehrlich[MASK] and a well known environmental impact equation impact a bad thing is the product[MASK] <unk> and technology that is impact is generated by people what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced [MASK] and though the equation is largely subjective you can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence but technology is abusive in[MASK] too many ways to quantify so the equation is conceptual <unk> still it works to help us understand the problem so we set out at interface in[MASK] to create an example to transform the way we made carpet[MASK] <unk> petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy [MASK] and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact rather than multiplied it [MASK] paul and anne ehrlich 's environmental impact equation i is equal to p times a times t[MASK] <unk> population affluence and technology i wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read[MASK] i equals p times a divided by t now the <unk>[MASK] <unk> will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but t in the denominator decreases[MASK] <unk> what would move t technology <unk> [MASK] from the numerator call it t1 where it increases impact to the denominator call it t2 where it reduces impact <unk> [MASK] i thought about the characteristics of[MASK] first industrial revolution t1 as we practiced it at interface and it had the following[MASK] <unk> taking raw materials from the earth <unk> [MASK] linear <unk> take make waste powered by fossil fuel derived energy wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity [MASK] more carpet per man hour [MASK] thinking it through i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the[MASK] <unk> in the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable [MASK] linear by cyclical fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight[MASK] <unk> wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity <unk> [MASK] and i reasoned that if we could make[MASK] those transformative changes and get rid of t1 altogether we could reduce our impact to zero[MASK] including our impact on the climate <unk> and that became the interface plan in <unk>[MASK] <unk> and has been the plan ever since we have[MASK] measured our progress very rigorously [MASK] so i can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing twelve years net greenhouse gas emissions down eighty two[MASK] <unk> over the same span of time sales have increased by two thirds and profits have doubled so an eighty two percent absolute reduction translates into a ninety percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales [MASK] this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire[MASK] <unk> climate disruption so the scientists are telling us <unk> [MASK] fossil fuel usage is down sixty percent per unit of production due to efficiencies in renewables <unk> the cheapest most secure barrel of oil there is is the one <unk>[MASK] not used through efficiencies water usage is down seventy five percent in our worldwide carpet tile business down forty percent in our broadloom carpet[MASK] <unk> business which we acquired in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three right here in california city of industry <unk> where water is so precious <unk> [MASK] renewable or recyclable materials are twenty five percent of the total and growing rapidly renewable energy is twenty seven percent of our total <unk> [MASK] going for one hundred percent we have diverted one hundred and forty eight million pounds that 's seventy four thousand tons of used carpet from landfills [MASK] <unk> loop on material flows through reverse logistics[MASK] and post consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started fourteen years ago [MASK] those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold eighty five million square yards of climate neutral carpet[MASK] since two thousand and four meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption[MASK] <unk> producing the carpet throughout the supply chain from mine and well head[MASK] clear to end of life reclamation independent <unk> third party certified <unk> we call it cool carpet [MASK] and it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator increasing sales and profits <unk> three years ago[MASK] we launched carpet tile for the home under the brand flor[MASK] you can point and click today at flor com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in five days it is practical and pretty too [MASK] we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal zero impact zero footprint [MASK] as our target year for zero for reaching the top the summit of mount sustainability <unk> [MASK] we call this mission zero <unk> [MASK] and this is perhaps the most important facet we have found mission zero to be incredibly good for business a better business model <unk> a better way to[MASK] <unk> here is the business case for sustainability from real life experience costs are down not up <unk> reflecting some four hundred million dollars of avoided costs <unk>[MASK] <unk> in pursuit of zero waste the first face of mount sustainability <unk> [MASK] <unk> for sustainability <unk> an unexpected wellspring of innovation [MASK] our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose you cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together <unk> [MASK] and the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing no amount of advertising no clever marketing campaign [MASK] at any price could have produced or created this much goodwill[MASK] costs products people marketplaces[MASK] what else is there it is a better business model <unk> and here is our 14 year record of sales[MASK] and profits there is a dip there from two thousand and one to two thousand and three a dip when our sales over a three year period were down seventeen percent but the marketplace[MASK] <unk> we literally gained market share we might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability <unk> [MASK] if every business were pursuing interface plans [MASK] would that solve all our problems <unk> i don 't think so i remain troubled by the revised ehrlich equation <unk> i equals p times a divided by t2 [MASK] that a is a capital a <unk> suggesting that affluence is an end in[MASK] <unk> itself <unk> but what if we reframed ehrlich further <unk> [MASK] and what if we made a a lowercase ' a ' suggesting that it is a means to an end and that end is happiness[MASK] more happiness with less stuff you know that would reframe civilization[MASK] <unk> our whole system of economics <unk> if not for our species [MASK] then perhaps for the one that succeeds us <unk> the sustainable species living on a finite earth <unk> ethically happily and ecologically in <unk>[MASK] <unk> balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations or ten thousand generations[MASK] <unk> that is to say into the indefinite future <unk> but[MASK] does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species <unk> well maybe so but i don 't think so at interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable <unk>[MASK] <unk> industrial company fully into existence by two thousand and twenty we can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain and now the challenge[MASK] <unk> is in execution <unk> and as my good friend and adviser amory lovins says if something exists it must be possible [MASK] if we can actually do it it must be possible if we <unk>[MASK] company can do it anybody can and if anybody can[MASK] <unk> it follows that everybody can hawken fulfilled business and industry leading humankind away from the abyss[MASK] because [MASK] with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere a very dear person is at risk here frankly an unacceptable risk who is that person [MASK] not you not i but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here and i myself met this person in the early days[MASK] <unk> of this mountain climb on a tuesday morning in march of <unk>[MASK] <unk> i was talking to people as i did at every opportunity back then bringing them along and often not knowing whether i was connecting but[MASK] about five days later back in atlanta i received an email from glenn thomas one of my people in the california meeting[MASK] <unk> he was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our tuesday morning together and when i read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life [MASK] because it told me by god one person got it here[MASK] is what glenn wrote and here is that person most at risk please meet tomorrow 's child [MASK] without a name an unseen face and knowing not your time or place[MASK] <unk> tomorrow 's child though yet unborn <unk> i met you first last tuesday morn [MASK] a wise friend introduced us two and through his sobering point of view i saw a day that you would see a day for you but not for me [MASK] knowing you has changed my thinking for i never had an inkling that perhaps the things i do might someday somehow threaten you [MASK] tomorrow 's child my daughter son i 'm afraid i 've just begun to think of you and of your good[MASK] <unk> though always having known i should <unk> [MASK] begin i will the way the cost of what i squander what is lost if ever i forget that you will someday come[MASK] and live here too well every day of my life since tomorrow 's child has spoken to me with one simple but profound[MASK] <unk> which i presume to share with you we are each and every one a part of the web of life [MASK] the continuum of humanity sure but in a larger sense the web of life itself and we have a choice to make[MASK] during our brief brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet to hurt it[MASK] or to help it for you it 's your call[MASK]
