 <unk> you 're looking at a woman[MASK] who was publicly silent for a decade <unk> [MASK] obviously that 's changed [MASK] but only recently <unk> it was several months ago that i gave my very first major public talk at the forbes thirty under thirty summit[MASK] five hundred brilliant people all under the age of thirty [MASK] that meant that in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight the oldest among the group were only fourteen <unk> [MASK] and the youngest just four [MASK] i joked with them[MASK] that some might only have heard of me from rap songs[MASK] <unk> night of my speech a surprising thing happened at the age of forty one i was hit on by a <unk>[MASK] <unk> guy <unk> i know right <unk> [MASK] he was charming and i was flattered <unk> and i declined you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was[MASK] he could make me feel twenty two again [MASK] i realized later that night <unk> i 'm probably the only person over forty who does not want to be[MASK] <unk> at the age of twenty two i fell in love with my boss <unk> [MASK] and at the age of twenty four i learned the devastating consequences[MASK] can i see a show of hands of anyone here who didn 't make a mistake or do something they regretted at[MASK] <unk> 's what i thought <unk> [MASK] so like me at twenty two [MASK] a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person [MASK] maybe even your boss <unk> [MASK] unlike me though your boss probably wasn 't the president of the united states of america[MASK] <unk> life is full of surprises [MASK] not a day goes by that i 'm not reminded of my mistake <unk> and i regret that mistake deeply in[MASK] one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight after having been swept up into an improbable romance <unk> [MASK] i was then swept up into the eye of a political legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before[MASK] remember just a few years earlier news was consumed from just three places <unk> [MASK] reading a newspaper or magazine listening to the radio [MASK] or watching television that was it <unk> [MASK] but that wasn 't my fate [MASK] instead this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution that meant we[MASK] <unk> could access all the information we wanted when we wanted it anytime <unk> anywhere [MASK] and when the story broke in january one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight it broke online <unk> [MASK] it was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major[MASK] <unk> a click that reverberated around the world what that meant for me personally[MASK] was that overnight i went from being a completely private figure[MASK] to a publicly humiliated one worldwide <unk> i was patient zero[MASK] of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously[MASK] <unk> this rush to judgment enabled by technology led to mobs of virtual <unk>[MASK] granted it was before social media but people could still[MASK] comment online <unk> email stories and of course <unk> email cruel jokes [MASK] news sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers[MASK] <unk> ads online and to keep people tuned to the tv [MASK] do you recall a particular image of me <unk> say wearing a beret <unk> [MASK] now i admit i made mistakes especially wearing that beret [MASK] but the attention and judgment that i received not the story <unk> but that i[MASK] <unk> personally received was unprecedented <unk> i was branded[MASK] as a tramp <unk> tart <unk> slut <unk> whore <unk> bimbo [MASK] and of course that woman [MASK] i was seen by many but actually known by few and i get it[MASK] <unk> it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional had a soul and was once unbroken [MASK] when this happened to me seventeen years ago <unk> there was no name for it [MASK] now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment[MASK] <unk> i want to share some of my experience with you talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations <unk> [MASK] and how i hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others[MASK] <unk> lost my life [MASK] let me paint a picture for you [MASK] it is september of one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight i 'm sitting in a windowless office room[MASK] inside the office of the independent counsel[MASK] underneath[MASK] <unk> i 'm listening[MASK] to the sound of my voice my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before <unk> [MASK] i 'm here[MASK] because i 've been legally required to personally authenticate all twenty hours of taped conversation [MASK] for the past eight months <unk> the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the sword[MASK] <unk> of damocles over my head <unk> i mean who can remember what they said a year ago <unk> [MASK] scared and mortified <unk> i listen [MASK] listen as i prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day [MASK] listen as i confess my love for the president and of course my heartbreak[MASK] <unk> to my sometimes catty sometimes churlish sometimes silly self[MASK] being cruel unforgiving <unk> uncouth <unk> [MASK] listen deeply <unk> deeply ashamed to the worst version of myself <unk> [MASK] a self i don 't even recognize [MASK] a few days later <unk> the starr report is released to congress[MASK] and all of those tapes and transcripts those stolen words form a part of it [MASK] that people can read the transcripts is horrific enough <unk> but a few weeks later <unk> [MASK] the audio tapes are aired on tv <unk> and significant portions made available online <unk> [MASK] the public humiliation was[MASK] <unk> excruciating life was almost unbearable [MASK] this was not something that happened with regularity back then in <unk>[MASK] and by this i mean the stealing of people 's private words <unk> actions <unk> conversations or[MASK] <unk> and then making them public[MASK] public without consent public without context and public without compassion <unk> [MASK] fast forward twelve years to two thousand and ten <unk> and now social media has been born[MASK] <unk> the landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine <unk> whether or not someone actually make a mistake <unk> [MASK] and now it 's for both[MASK] <unk> public and private people the consequences for some have become dire very dire <unk> [MASK] i was on the phone with my mom in september of two thousand and ten <unk> [MASK] and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from rutgers[MASK] <unk> by his roommate while being intimate with another man <unk> [MASK] when the online world learned of this incident the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited a[MASK] few days later <unk> tyler jumped from the george washington bridge to his death[MASK] my mom was beside herself about what happened to tyler and his family <unk> and she was[MASK] gutted with pain[MASK] in a way that i just couldn 't quite understand <unk> and then eventually i realized she was reliving one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight [MASK] reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night[MASK] <unk> reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open <unk> [MASK] and reliving a time when both of my parents feared that i would be humiliated to death <unk> [MASK] literally[MASK] today <unk> too many parents haven 't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones[MASK] <unk> too many have learned of their child 's suffering and humiliation after it was too late [MASK] tyler 's tragic senseless death was a turning point for me <unk> it served to <unk>[MASK] <unk> my experiences <unk> and i then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different[MASK] <unk> had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the internet would take us [MASK] since then it has connected people in unimaginable ways <unk> joining lost siblings <unk> [MASK] saving lives launching revolutions <unk> [MASK] but the darkness cyberbullying and slut shaming that[MASK] <unk> especially young people who are not developmentally equipped to handle this are so abused and humiliated that they can 't imagine living to the next day [MASK] and some tragically don 't [MASK] and there 's nothing virtual about that [MASK] <unk> nonprofit that 's focused on helping young people on various issues <unk> released a staggering statistic late last year [MASK] from two thousand and twelve to two thousand and thirteen [MASK] there was an eighty seven percent increase in calls and emails related to cyberbullying[MASK] a meta analysis done out of the netherlands showed that for the[MASK] <unk> leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying [MASK] and you know what shocked me <unk> although it shouldn 't have [MASK] was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion[MASK] than either happiness or even anger cruelty to others is nothing new[MASK] <unk> but online <unk> technologically enhanced shaming[MASK] is amplified <unk> uncontained <unk> and permanently accessible [MASK] the echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family <unk> village school or community [MASK] but now it 's the online community too [MASK] millions of people often[MASK] <unk> anonymously can stab you with their words <unk> and that 's a lot of pain <unk> [MASK] and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you[MASK] and put you in a public stockade [MASK] there is a very personal price[MASK] to public humiliation and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price[MASK] for nearly two decades now we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil both on and offline [MASK] gossip websites paparazzi reality programming politics news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame [MASK] <unk> 's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online[MASK] which lends itself to trolling <unk> invasion of privacy and cyberbullying [MASK] this shift has created what professor nicolaus mills calls a culture of humiliation [MASK] consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone[MASK] <unk> which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the lifespan of a few seconds [MASK] you can imagine the range of content that that gets[MASK] a third party app which <unk> snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan of the messages was hacked <unk> and one hundred thousand[MASK] <unk> and videos were leaked online to now have a lifespan of forever [MASK] jennifer lawrence and several other actors had their icloud accounts hacked and private intimate nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission [MASK] one gossip website[MASK] had over five million hits for this one story <unk> and what about the sony pictures[MASK] <unk> the documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value[MASK] <unk> but in this culture of humiliation there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming [MASK] the price does not measure the cost to the victim which tyler and too many others notably women minorities[MASK] and members of the lgbtq community have paid <unk> but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them [MASK] this invasion of others is a raw material <unk> efficiently and ruthlessly mined <unk> packaged and sold at a profit [MASK] a marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity[MASK] and shame is an industry [MASK] how is the money made [MASK] clicks <unk> [MASK] the more shame <unk> the more clicks <unk> the more clicks <unk> the more advertising dollars we[MASK] 're in a dangerous cycle <unk> the more we click on this kind of gossip the more numb we get to the human lives behind[MASK] <unk> it and the more numb we get <unk> the more we click [MASK] all the while someone is making money off of the back of someone else 's suffering [MASK] with every click we make a choice <unk> [MASK] the more we saturate our culture with public shaming <unk> the more accepted it is the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying[MASK] trolling some forms of hacking and online harassment <unk> [MASK] why because they all have humiliation at their cores [MASK] this behavior is a symptom of the culture we 've created just think about it [MASK] <unk> changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs [MASK] we 've seen that to be true with racism homophobia <unk> and plenty of other biases <unk> today and in the past [MASK] as we 've changed beliefs about same sex marriage more people have been offered[MASK] equal freedoms [MASK] when we began valuing sustainability more people began to recycle [MASK] so as far as our culture of humiliation goes what we need is a[MASK] <unk> cultural revolution [MASK] public shaming as a blood sport has to stop <unk> and it 's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture [MASK] the shift begins with something simple but it 's not easy [MASK] we need to return to a long held value of compassion[MASK] <unk> we 've got a compassion deficit an empathy crisis <unk> [MASK] researcher bren brown said <unk> and i quote shame can 't survive empathy [MASK] shame[MASK] cannot survive empathy [MASK] i 've seen some very dark days in my life[MASK] <unk> was the compassion and empathy[MASK] from my family friends <unk> professionals and sometimes even strangers that saved me [MASK] even empathy from one person can make a difference [MASK] the theory of minority influence proposed by social psychologist serge moscovici <unk> [MASK] says that even in small numbers when there 's consistency over time change can happen[MASK] in the online world we can foster minority influence by becoming[MASK] to become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy <unk> we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation [MASK] trust me compassionate comments help abate the negativity <unk> [MASK] we can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these[MASK] <unk> kinds of issues like the tyler clementi foundation in the u s [MASK] in the u k there 's anti bullying pro and in australia <unk> there 's project rockit [MASK] we talk a lot about[MASK] our right to freedom of expression <unk> but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression <unk> [MASK] we all want to be[MASK] <unk> heard but let 's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention [MASK] the internet is the superhighway for the id <unk> but online showing empathy to others benefits us all[MASK] and helps create a safer and better world <unk> we need to communicate online with[MASK] <unk> compassion <unk> consume news with compassion and click with compassion [MASK] just imagine walking a mile in someone else 's headline i[MASK] 'd like to end[MASK] on a personal note [MASK] in the past nine months the question i 've been asked the most is why <unk> why now <unk> why was i sticking my[MASK] <unk> above the parapet [MASK] you can read between the lines in those questions <unk> and the answer has nothing to do with politics <unk> [MASK] the top note answer was and is because it 's time [MASK] time to stop tip toeing around my past time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative it[MASK] 's also not just[MASK] <unk> about saving myself <unk> anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing [MASK] you can survive it <unk> i know it 's hard <unk> [MASK] it may not be painless quick or easy but you can insist on a different ending to your story [MASK] have compassion for yourself[MASK] we all deserve compassion [MASK] and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world[MASK] thank you for listening[MASK]
