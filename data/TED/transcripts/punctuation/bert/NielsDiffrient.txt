 <unk> was five years old i fell in love with airplanes <unk> now i 'm talking about the[MASK] by a guy who looked like cary grant he[MASK] had high leather boots <unk> jodhpurs an old leather jacket [MASK] a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles[MASK] and inevitably a white scarf to flow in the wind <unk> he 'd always walk up[MASK] <unk> up to his airplane in a kind of[MASK] saunter devil may care saunter <unk> [MASK] flick the cigarette away grab the girl waiting here give her a kiss [MASK] and then mount his airplane <unk> maybe for the last time of course i always wondered[MASK] what would happen if he 'd kissed the airplane first[MASK] laughter but this was real romance to me [MASK] everything about flying[MASK] in those years <unk> which was you have to stop and think for a moment[MASK] was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time <unk> so as a youngster[MASK] <unk> i tried to get close to this[MASK] by drawing airplanes <unk> constantly drawing airplanes it 's the way i got[MASK] a part of this romance and of course in a way when i say romance <unk> i mean in part the aesthetics[MASK] of that whole situation[MASK] <unk> i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product[MASK] was that airplane but it built[MASK] a romance <unk> even the parts of the airplane[MASK] had french names <unk> ze fuselage ze empanage[MASK] <unk> just got into your spirit it did mine <unk> and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing[MASK] fantasy airplanes <unk> i wanted to build airplanes <unk> so i built model airplanes <unk> and i found[MASK] that in doing the model airplanes[MASK] <unk> appearance drawings[MASK] were not enough you couldn 't transfer those to the model itself if you wanted it to fly[MASK] you had to learn[MASK] the discipline[MASK] of flying <unk> you had to learn[MASK] about aeronautics you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air and of course as a model in those years <unk> you couldn 't control it[MASK] <unk> and stay[MASK] up without crashing <unk> so[MASK] i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes[MASK] and convert it to technical drawings[MASK] the shape of the wing the shape of the fuselage and so on and build an airplane over these drawings[MASK] <unk> that i knew[MASK] followed some of the principles of flying and in so doing i could produce[MASK] a model[MASK] that would fly <unk> stay in the air <unk> and it had once it was in the air <unk> some of this romance[MASK] that i was in love with well the act of drawing airplanes[MASK] led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering[MASK] <unk> and when i was sitting in classes[MASK] in which[MASK] no one asked me to draw an airplane to my surprise <unk> [MASK] i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class [MASK] one day a young man[MASK] <unk> you should be in the art department and i said why and he said well for one thing there are more girls there [MASK] so my romance[MASK] was temporarily shifted [MASK] laughter and i went into art because they appreciated drawing studied painting didn 't do very well at that went through[MASK] design some architecture[MASK] <unk> eventually hired myself out as a designer <unk> and for the following twenty five years[MASK] <unk> living in italy <unk> living in america <unk> i doled out[MASK] a piece of this romance[MASK] to anybody who 'd pay for it this sense this[MASK] <unk> for the experience revolving around[MASK] a designed object and[MASK] it exists any of you who rode the automobiles[MASK] was it yesterday at the track you know the romance revolving around[MASK] around those high performance high performance cars <unk> well in twenty five years[MASK] i was mostly putting out pieces of this[MASK] <unk> romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call[MASK] doesn 't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can[MASK] produce things of this nature <unk> so after twenty five years i began to feel as though i was running dry <unk> [MASK] and i quit <unk> and i started up[MASK] a very small operation[MASK] went from forty people[MASK] <unk> one in an effort to rediscover my innocence <unk> i wanted to get back[MASK] where the romance was and i couldn 't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic[MASK] at that point even though i 'd done a lot of airplane work on the[MASK] <unk> so i chose furniture <unk> and i chose chairs specifically[MASK] because i knew something about them i 'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks[MASK] and submarines[MASK] all kinds of things but not office chairs <unk> so i started doing that <unk> [MASK] and i found that there were ways to duplicate[MASK] the same approach[MASK] that i used to use on the airplane only this time <unk> instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped[MASK] by the human body <unk> so the discipline was[MASK] as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal[MASK] with the body[MASK] and what the body needs wants <unk> indicates it needs <unk> and that 's the way <unk> ultimately after[MASK] some ups and downs <unk> i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those[MASK] model airplanes <unk> i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane[MASK] <unk> i basically engineered it [MASK] i built it <unk> and i flew it <unk> [MASK] and that 's the way i work now[MASK] <unk> when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design[MASK] <unk> if you mean it <unk> you don 't start with[MASK] styling sketches i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago <unk> and[MASK] the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office at the[MASK] work place people who worked and used task seating a great many of them sitting in front of a computer[MASK] all day long <unk> and i felt[MASK] <unk> felt the one thing they don 't need is a chair that interferes[MASK] with their main reason for sitting there <unk> [MASK] so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible[MASK] <unk> as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it <unk> so my idea was that[MASK] <unk> of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls <unk> that you would sit on the chair and it would automatically balance your weight[MASK] against the force required to recline <unk> now that[MASK] may not mean a lot[MASK] to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better[MASK] breathing and better flow so that if you sit down[MASK] on my chair whether you 're five feet tall or six foot six it always[MASK] deals with your weight[MASK] and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don 't have to look[MASK] <unk> for something to adjust i[MASK] 'll tell you right up front this is a trade off there are drawbacks to this one is you can 't[MASK] accommodate everybody [MASK] there are some very light people some extremely heavy people[MASK] <unk> maybe people with a lot of bulk up top they begin to fall off the end of your chart [MASK] the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people[MASK] don 't adjust their chairs they will sit in them forever i had somebody[MASK] on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him he said she had one of the[MASK] new better chairs[MASK] <unk> come over and look at it he came over and looked at it <unk> he reached down he pulled a lever <unk> and the chair sank down she said oh it 's wonderful how did you do that [MASK] and he showed her the lever <unk> well that 's typical[MASK] of a lot of us working in chairs and why should you[MASK] get a 20 page manual about how to run[MASK] <unk> i had one for a wristwatch once[MASK] <unk> twenty pages <unk> anyway i felt that it was important that you didn 't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of[MASK] action the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been[MASK] properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be[MASK] to your work life but i felt[MASK] <unk> was too much to ask[MASK] to have to adjust each individual armrest[MASK] in order to get it where you wanted <unk> so i spent a long time i said i worked eight or nine years on it and[MASK] each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own <unk> i worked a long time on figuring out[MASK] how to move the arms[MASK] over a much greater[MASK] <unk> arc that is up and down[MASK] and make them a lot easier <unk> so that you didn 't have to[MASK] use a button and so after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement[MASK] in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up[MASK] <unk> and stop where you want you can put them down essentially out of the way <unk> no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them[MASK] and this was another thing that i felt <unk> while not nearly as romantic as cary grant <unk> nevertheless[MASK] begins to[MASK] grab a little bit of aesthetic[MASK] operation[MASK] <unk> aesthetic performance into a product the next area that was of interest to me was the fact that[MASK] reclining was a very important[MASK] factor <unk> and the more you can recline [MASK] in a way the better it is [MASK] the more the angle between here and here opens up and nowadays with a screen in front of you you don 't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline <unk> so we keep it at more or less the same level[MASK] <unk> but you transfer weight off your tailbones would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone [MASK] you feel that bone under there[MASK] <unk> side [MASK] all the weight of your upper torso your arms your head[MASK] goes right down through your back your spine into those bones when you sit <unk> and that 's a lot of load [MASK] just relieving your arms with armrests takes twenty percent of that load[MASK] <unk> if your spine is not held in a good position will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on so to unload[MASK] that great weight[MASK] if that indeed exists[MASK] you can recline <unk> when you recline you take away a lot of that load[MASK] <unk> your bottom end and transfer it to your back at the same time as i say you open up this joint and breathability is good <unk> [MASK] but to do that[MASK] if you have any[MASK] amount of recline it gets to the point where you need a headrest[MASK] because nearly always [MASK] automatically hold your head in a vertical position <unk> see as i recline[MASK] <unk> my head says more or less[MASK] vertical well if you 're reclined a great deal you have to use muscle force[MASK] to hold your head there <unk> so that 's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to[MASK] adjust enough so that it 'll fit <unk> you[MASK] <unk> tall guy and a short girl so[MASK] here we are <unk> i 've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place but then i knew[MASK] from experience and looking around[MASK] in offices where there were chairs with headrests[MASK] that nobody would ever bother[MASK] to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position <unk> and you need it in a different position when you 're upright[MASK] <unk> then when you 're reclined so i knew that had to be solved <unk> and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline the headrest comes up[MASK] to meet my neck <unk> ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area right there <unk>[MASK] <unk> that part of it took a long time to work out[MASK]
