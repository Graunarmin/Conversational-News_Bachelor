 <unk> one in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness <unk> so if it was[MASK] one two three four it 's you sir you yeah with the weird teeth <unk> and you next to him [MASK] you know who you are actually that whole row isn 't right that 's not good[MASK] hi <unk> yeah <unk> real bad don 't even look at me i am[MASK] one of the one in four <unk> thank you [MASK] i think i inherit it from my mother who used to crawl around the house on all fours [MASK] she had two sponges in her hand and then she had two tied to her knees[MASK] <unk> she would crawl around behind me going who brings footprints into a building so that was kind of a clue that things weren 't right so[MASK] before i start i would like to thank the makers of lamotrigine sertraline and reboxetine[MASK] because without those few simple chemicals i would not be vertical today[MASK] <unk> how did it start [MASK] my mental illness <unk> well i 'm not even going to talk about my mental illness what am i going to talk about okay[MASK] <unk> i always dreamt that when i had my final breakdown it would be because i had a deep kafkaesque existentialist revelation [MASK] or that maybe cate blanchett would play me and she would win an oscar for[MASK] <unk> that 's not what happened i had my breakdown during my daughter 's sports day <unk> there were all the parents[MASK] sitting in a parking lot eating food out of the back of their car only the english[MASK] eating their sausages <unk> they loved their sausages [MASK] lord and lady rigor mortis were nibbling on the tarmac <unk> and then the gun went[MASK] <unk> and all the girlies girlies running running running everybody except for my daughter who was just standing at the starting line just waving[MASK] <unk> because she didn 't know she was supposed to run <unk> so[MASK] i i took to my bed for about a month and when i woke up i found i was institutionalized <unk> and when i saw the other[MASK] <unk> inmates <unk> i realized that i had found my people my tribe because they became my only friends <unk> they became my friends[MASK] because very few people that i knew well i wasn 't[MASK] sent a lot of cards or flowers i mean if i had had a broken leg or i was with child i would have been inundated but all i got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up[MASK] <unk> you know the one thing one thing that you get with this disease this one comes with a package is you get a real sense of shame <unk> [MASK] because your friends go oh come on show me the lump show me the x rays and of course you 've got nothing to show so you 're like really disgusted with yourself[MASK] because you 're thinking i 'm not being carpet bombed i don 't live in a township so you start to hear these abusive voices but you don 't hear one[MASK] abusive voice you hear about a thousand one hundred thousand abusive voices like if the devil had tourette 's that 's what it would sound like but[MASK] we all know in here you know there is no devil there are no voices in your head <unk> [MASK] you know that when you have those abusive voices all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic i want to[MASK] <unk> kind of chemical and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape you might have yourself depression [MASK] oh and that 's not even the tip of the iceberg [MASK] if you get a little baby and you abuse it verbally its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive[MASK] that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn 't grow <unk> so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic [MASK] if a soldier sees his friend blown up <unk> his brain goes into such high alarm that he can 't actually put the experience[MASK] <unk> into words so he just feels the horror over and over again so here 's my question my question is how come when people have mental damage it 's always an active imagination <unk> [MASK] how come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy except the brain [MASK] i 'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain because i know you like that here at ted so if you just give me a minute here <unk> okay <unk> okay let me just say there 's[MASK] <unk> good news <unk> there is some good news <unk> first of all let me say we 've come a long long way <unk> [MASK] we started off as a teeny teeny little one celled amoeba tiny just sticking onto a rock <unk> and now[MASK] voila the brain here we go [MASK] laughter this little baby has a lot of horsepower it[MASK] <unk> got the occipital lobe so we can actually[MASK] see the world we got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world here we 've got a little bit of long term memory so you know that night you want to forget when you got really drunk bye bye gone [MASK] so actually it 's filled with one hundred billion neurons just zizzing away <unk> electrically transmitting information <unk> zizzing zizzing i 'm going to give you[MASK] <unk> and for every one i know i drew this myself thank you [MASK] for every one one single neuron you can actually have from ten thousand to one hundred thousand different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it and every time you learn something or you have an[MASK] <unk> that bush grows you know that bush of information can you imagine every human being is carrying that equipment even paris hilton [MASK] go figure <unk> [MASK] but i got a little bad news for you folks i got some bad news <unk> this isn 't for the one in four this is for the four in four[MASK] <unk> we are not equipped for the 21st century evolution did not prepare us for this[MASK] <unk> have the bandwidth and for people who say oh they 're having a nice day they 're perfectly fine <unk> they 're more insane than the rest of us [MASK] because i 'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution okay let me just explain this to you when we were ancient man [MASK] laughter millions of years ago[MASK] and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator <unk> okay we would thank[MASK] <unk> we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol and then we 'd kill or be killed we 'd eat or we 'd be eaten and then suddenly we 'd de fuel and we 'd go back to normal [MASK] okay so the problem is nowadays with modern man [MASK] when we feel in danger we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can 't kill traffic wardens[MASK] or eat estate agents [MASK] the fuel just stays in our body over and over so we 're in a constant state of alarm a constant state and here 's another thing that happened about one hundred and fifty thousand years ago when language came online <unk> we started to put <unk>[MASK] <unk> words to this constant emergency so it wasn 't just oh my god there 's a saber toothed tiger which could be it was suddenly oh my god i didn 't send the email oh my god my thighs are too fat oh my god everybody can see i 'm stupid[MASK] <unk> invited to the christmas party so you 've got this nagging loop tape that goes[MASK] over and over again that drives you insane <unk> so you see what the problem is what once made you safe now drives you insane <unk> [MASK] i 'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but somebody has to be [MASK] your pets are happier than you are[MASK] <unk> happy happy happy human beings screwed[MASK]
