 <unk> what i wanted to do is to[MASK] show the world[MASK] that the little things can be[MASK] the biggest things[MASK] we all seem to think that [MASK] you know if we look down on the ground there 's nothing there <unk> and we use the word nothing [MASK] nothing doesn[MASK] <unk> because there is always something my mother told me that <unk> when i was a child that i should always respect the little things[MASK] <unk> what made me do this work i shall go into my my story this all started when i was age five[MASK] <unk> what made me do it <unk> at school <unk> i will admit this academically i couldn 't express myself so[MASK] i was [MASK] <unk> my world was seen as less <unk> so[MASK] i decided i didn 't really want to be a part of that world <unk> i thought i need to retreat[MASK] into something else <unk> so when my mother used to take me to school she thought i was at school and i used to[MASK] do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden[MASK] <unk> now the one time i was in the shed and[MASK] my mother suspected something thinking i was at school [MASK] my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry[MASK] <unk> so you 'd just see her feet [MASK] <unk> i was hiding in the shed like that and all of a sudden <unk> [MASK] and then i saw her legs <unk> and then she said[MASK] grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big and she lifted me up and she says how come you 're not at school i told her i couldn 't face it because the[MASK] <unk> the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and[MASK] using me as an example of failure so i[MASK] told her at that age <unk> obviously i couldn 't express it that way but i told her i didn 't feel right <unk> [MASK] and then she just said you 're going back to school tomorrow and walked off and i didn 't expect that <unk> because i expected one of these[MASK] <unk> but i didn 't get it so i 'm[MASK] <unk> as i looked down on the ground <unk> i noticed there was some ants running around[MASK] and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought these ants [MASK] are they looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some[MASK] <unk> so i did <unk> [MASK] and how i set about that i got some splinters of wood and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass <unk> constructed this little apartment <unk> [MASK] well it[MASK] looked like a little shanty shed when i 'd finished but i thought perhaps the ant won 't know it 'll probably move in[MASK] so they did that was a bit crude at the time and i made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds seesaws and swings little ladders <unk> [MASK] and then i encouraged the ants to come ' round by putting sugar and things like that <unk> [MASK] and then i sat down and all the ants[MASK] came along and all i could hear was is this for us[MASK] and they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent[MASK] <unk> this world that we can 't see <unk> so i realized that there was more to life than just[MASK] everything that we see around us that 's huge so i started to educate myself on this molecular level <unk> [MASK] and as i as i got older i continued i showed my mother my mother told me to take it smaller <unk> now[MASK] i shall show you something here[MASK] explain as you can see <unk> [MASK] that 's a pinhead[MASK] <unk> me to do this was a gentleman called peter huf and he says to me willard can you put my house on a pinhead [MASK] so i say how are you going to fit in there [MASK] and then he said to me i don 't believe you can do it can you really do it and i says[MASK] try me and then he said but i don 't believe that you can do this so i said [MASK] ok so to cut a long story short i went home went underneath the microscope <unk> and i crushed up[MASK] a piece of glass <unk> crushed it up and underneath[MASK] <unk> underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass some of them were quite jagged <unk> [MASK] so i was crushing up these pieces of glass <unk> which as you can see that 's the actual frame of the house <unk> and[MASK] the actual roof is made up of[MASK] a fiber which i found in my sister 's old teddy bear [MASK] so i got the teddy bear and i said do you mind if i pull out one of your fibers[MASK] so i did <unk> and i looked at it beneath the microscope and some of <unk> it was flat so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make[MASK] by i sharpen the the end of a needle into a blade <unk> and then i i actually slow down my whole nervous system <unk> and then i[MASK] work between my heartbeat[MASK] <unk> move and at the same time i have to watch i don 't inhale my own work at the same time [MASK] because that has happened to me [MASK] so what i did like i said come back to the glass <unk> i found these little[MASK] <unk> bits of glass <unk> and i had to make them square <unk> so i 'm thinking how can i do this so what i did i got an oilstone broke the edge of an oilstone off [MASK] and what i did i took pieces of glass and i started to rub them <unk> i used a little tweezer which i made from a hair clip <unk> [MASK] and i built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn 't crush the[MASK] <unk> and then i started rubbing very very gently [MASK] till some of the edges were quite square <unk> [MASK] and then i constructed it and how i constructed it is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead <unk> and then pushing the glass in with its own friction <unk> [MASK] and as i was doing it <unk> what happened the instrument that i used turned into a catapult <unk> and it went like[MASK] <unk> huf isn 't going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere somewhere [MASK] so to cut the story short i decided that i had to go back and do it so i found some more and i decided to sort of construct[MASK] <unk> my breath working between my heartbeat <unk> and making sure everything is leveled because it 's such a[MASK] a small[MASK] sculpture <unk> nothing can can go wrong <unk> and i decided to build it up then i used fibers out of my jumper <unk> which i held[MASK] and stretched and made the beams going around the house <unk> and the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed i used a money spider 's web[MASK] to actually attach certain things[MASK] <unk> things which sent me insane but i managed to do it and[MASK] when i finished it <unk> i came back the next day i noticed that the house was occupied [MASK] have we ever heard of a dust mite[MASK] <unk> darren dust mite and his family moved in[MASK] <unk> as you can see <unk> bart simpson is having a little argument <unk> [MASK] <unk> they 're arguing about the space on the pin there 's not enough room for the two of them <unk> so i[MASK] didn 't think he was going to throw bart off i think he was just warning him actually but this one was made out of a nylon tag[MASK] out of my shirt what i did i plucked the tag out[MASK] and[MASK] put it underneath the microscope i used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end[MASK] <unk> what i did is the same process where i just kind of hold my breath and[MASK] just work away[MASK] very very slowly manipulating the plastic [MASK] cutting it because it behaves different whenever you work on that level things behave different because it 's on this molecular level things change[MASK] and they act different and sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air and[MASK] <unk> different things happen <unk> but i had to make a little barrier going around it out of cellophane to stop[MASK] stop it moving then static electricity set in <unk> and it went <unk> [MASK] and i 'm trying to remove it and the static is interfering with everything so[MASK] there is sweat dripping off my head because i have to carve homer simpson like[MASK] <unk> and after i 've cut out the shape then i have to make sure that there is room for bart 's neck [MASK] so after i 've done the same thing then i have to paint it <unk> and after i 've actually sculpted them[MASK] <unk> i have to paint them <unk> i experimented with a[MASK] i found a dead fly and i plucked the hair off the fly 's head decided to make a paintbrush[MASK] <unk> even though they get on our nerves i would never kill an insect because[MASK] <unk> all creatures great and small there is a hymn that says that so[MASK] what i decided to do is to pluck[MASK] fine hair out of my face <unk> and i looked at it[MASK] underneath the microscope that was the paintbrush <unk> [MASK] and whilst i 'm painting i have to be very careful because the paint starts to to turn into little blobs and it starts to[MASK] dry very quickly <unk> so i have to be very quick[MASK] <unk> if i 'm not it will end up looking not like what it 's supposed to look like it could end up looking like humpty dumpty[MASK] or somebody else <unk> so i have to be very very careful [MASK] this one took me approximately <unk> i would say <unk> six to seven weeks [MASK] <unk> rough estimate sometimes five six to seven weeks you can 't always anticipate [MASK] as you can see <unk> that 's charlton heston brought down to size[MASK] <unk> i enjoyed your film that 's why as you can see there 's an aphid fly there that 's just to show the scale[MASK] and the actual size[MASK] of the sculpture <unk> i would say it probably measures a[MASK] quarter of a millimeter in america they say a period stop <unk> so say if you cut a period stop in half[MASK] a full stop that 's about the size of the whole thing it[MASK] 's made the chariot is made of gold[MASK] and charlton heston is made of[MASK] a floating fiber which i took out of the air <unk> when the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers <unk> and what i normally do is[MASK] walk ' round a room[MASK] <unk> to find one [MASK] and then i put it underneath the microscope <unk> i remember one time i was doing it and the window was open <unk> [MASK] and there was a lady standing by the bus stop and she saw me walking around like this and[MASK] then she looked at me <unk> and then i went[MASK] <unk> to actually do this thing the actual chariot is made of gold <unk> i had a 24 karat gold ring and i cut off a little flake of gold and i bent it ' round and made it into the chariot [MASK] and the horse is made from nylon and the spider 's web is for the reins on the horse to get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult <unk> [MASK] because i had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action[MASK] <unk> i did this one a gentleman seen it and said to me [MASK] there 's no way you can do this you must have used some kind of machine there 's no way a man can do that it must be a machine [MASK] so i says ok then if you say it 's a machine[MASK] <unk> most famous statue in the world this one <unk> <unk> i would[MASK] <unk> to put the torch on the top[MASK] <unk> that one is more or less the same type of process the bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand[MASK] <unk> because i wanted to get a bit of the stone effect i used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base <unk> [MASK] well i can look at this one and i can be very proud of this <unk> because that statue has always[MASK] sort of kept an image in my head of you know the beginning of people[MASK] coming to america so it 's sort of ellis island and seeing america for the first time <unk> and that 's the first thing they saw so i wanted to have that little image[MASK] <unk> and this is it [MASK] and we all know that is[MASK] the hulk i wanted to create movement[MASK] in the eye of a needle because we know we see needles but people aren 't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it <unk> so i broke the needle[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] made a needle look like the hulk 's broken it it 's[MASK] i had to make little holes in the base of the needle to shove his feet in so most of my work i don 't use glue they go in with their own friction <unk> [MASK] and that 's how i managed to do it <unk> as you can see he 's looking at the moment he 's got a little grimace on his face[MASK] and[MASK] <unk> mouth must be probably about three microns so the eyes are probably about one micron or something <unk> [MASK] that ship there[MASK] that 's made from 24 karat gold <unk> and i normally rig it with the web of a money spider <unk> [MASK] but i had to rig it with strands of glue <unk> because the web of the spider <unk> it was[MASK] sending me insane because i couldn 't get the web to move off and[MASK] <unk> that <unk> 's 24 karat gold and it 's constructed i built it <unk> constructed each plank of gold <unk> and the whole thing is sort of[MASK] symmetrical the flag had to be made out of little strands of gold <unk> it 's almost like[MASK] doing a surgical operation[MASK] to get this thing right[MASK] <unk> it 's something i wanted to do just to show how i could get the symmetrical shape the actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing[MASK] and that was done with a[MASK] particle from[MASK] <unk> green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle it 's very painstaking work <unk> but[MASK] the best things come in small packages[MASK]
