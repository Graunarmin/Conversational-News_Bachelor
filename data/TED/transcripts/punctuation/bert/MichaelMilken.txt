 <unk> i thought today i would take a few minutes to try to talk about[MASK] creating value[MASK] how you can leverage your own capabilities how you might be able to increase your effectiveness[MASK] but more than that how you can make the world a better place for you[MASK] your family your community and use the skills and use the skills that many of you in the audience have been given[MASK] and those that have those super skills even leverage them more so i thought i 'd first talk a little bit about[MASK] financial technology and what it 's given the world an opportunity[MASK] to look at here and my own life was dramatically affected[MASK] by my days at berkeley i chose to go there but the free speech movement allowed you to[MASK] engage it also provided me a very unusual opportunity my first financing assignment[MASK] i was able to raise eleven hundred dollars to bail seven hundred people out of jail a dollar fifty a person with a fifty dollar deposit[MASK] so back in nineteen sixty four it was not that difficult to raise that[MASK] <unk> type of money but that was a minor effect on my life compared to the watts riots which happened when i was home from berkeley on vacation[MASK] and the dream capital of the world was on fire troops were in the streets and i learned that civil rights[MASK] was a lot more than where you sat on the bus or where you go to school or where you can go to the bathroom[MASK] but a right to participate in the american dream and[MASK] <unk> economic society[MASK] and i went back to berkeley and created my little formula that what is prosperity[MASK] it 's a function of having financial technology which serves as a multiplier effect[MASK] on human capital social capital and real assets[MASK] and if we reflect on the last thirty years we see we 've accomplished quite a bit sixty two million jobs[MASK] <unk> jobs created in our country sixty two million new jobs[MASK] and with the concern about people being laid off today we have the world 's greatest job creation machine[MASK] it 's millions of small businesses[MASK] many of which have access to capital through financial technology today[MASK] that offset the continual drop and loss of jobs by large companies[MASK] in fact[MASK] <unk> if you look in the nineteen eightys when financial technology really took hold in the early nineteen eightys you[MASK] 'll see that the spread opened up dramatically small companies access to capital accelerated their job growth[MASK] and large companies continued to lay off people and reduce their size the most valuable company in the world today general electric[MASK] has increased in value almost twenty five fold in[MASK] <unk> twenty years and employs today twenty five percent less people than it did twenty years ago[MASK] well what about other areas not just leveraging economic[MASK] but one of the real growths in our economy in the united states in the past twenty years has been philanthropy[MASK] how can we leverage philanthropy how can we leverage your ideas in the nonprofit[MASK] <unk> sector[MASK] and what can we do there now the amount of giving in america has increased dramatically from fifteen billion to one hundred and forty billion[MASK] over the past thirty five years[MASK] however as a percentage of our economy it hasn 't really changed that much it 's about two percent of our economy[MASK] and so the amount of dollars that are being given is actually pretty small[MASK] <unk> compared to the amount of human capital the amount of time and effort and creativity that our population 's been putting in[MASK] but the great growth in our society that many of you have participated in is the growth in private and family foundations[MASK] they 've grown from twenty two thousand when my brother and i founded the milken family foundation to fifty four thousand today[MASK] they 've grown from about[MASK] <unk> twenty five billion in assets to almost a half a trillion today[MASK] how can that half a trillion which is a gigantic number leverage itself[MASK] in a world economy that dwarfs it[MASK] traditional philanthropy has continued to work in the same areas feeding the needy sheltering the homeless and particularly[MASK] <unk> supporting religion[MASK] but as many of you have participated venture philanthropy has grown up the people tend to be younger[MASK] different ideas trying to leverage on their companies assets their assets and their creativity at a very young age[MASK] i 'd like to take you back eight years briefly and talk about the challenge that i was faced with at cap cure prostate[MASK] <unk> cancer was the most diagnosed cancer in america[MASK] no one ever spoke about it and there was little to no research[MASK] this young man jonathan simons[MASK] was one of our country 's leading scientists an m d ph d from johns hopkins he chose to go in the field of prostate cancer[MASK] he was told by his adviser are you sure you want to do this there 's very little money in fact this would be[MASK] <unk> career suicide if you pick this career[MASK] luckily for us he went ahead and picked this career[MASK] and we at cap cure focused on supporting the jonathan simons of the world today jonathan runs the cancer center at emory university[MASK] and just received a grant from the woodruff foundation for one hundred million to move there from hopkins[MASK] seven hundred programs later[MASK] let 's see what 's occurred in the last eight years[MASK] in nineteen ninety three the year i was diagnosed with prostate cancer forty three thousand men passed away in america[MASK] it was projected with an increasing age of our population that this number would dramatically increase[MASK] over the next eight years to well over fifty five thousand men passing away[MASK] what 's actually occurred[MASK] <unk> in the last eight years is instead of an increase we 've had a decrease in the number of american men dying from prostate cancer[MASK] in fact the difference in the last eight years between the projected rates[MASK] and the actual rates amounts to seventy thousand american men[MASK] that is the same number of people that saw the superbowl this year in tampa seventy thousand[MASK] <unk> families seventy thousand american men are alive today versus what we had projected just eight years ago[MASK] while we haven 't cured this particular disease and we haven 't reached the levels of childhood leukemia[MASK] or testicular cancer where we have about a ninety five percent cure rate today in just eight years through increased public awareness[MASK] research[MASK] measured in millions of dollars not billions of dollars we 've dramatically changed the outlook[MASK] when we formed the milken foundation twenty years ago[MASK] our major thrust is in education and as i interact with many of you in the audience this is one of your passions[MASK] a huge industry the second largest industry in our country how can you change[MASK] <unk> education with a four hundred billion dollars being spent[MASK] in k twelve education in our country how can any foundation even the largest have a dramatic effect[MASK] this was an issue my brother and i faced almost twenty years ago[MASK] and our solution was we had to find a way to motivate teachers let communities know that maybe the most important[MASK] <unk> person in their community was that teacher in first grade kindergarten second grade fifth grade eighth grade in their community[MASK] single them out[MASK] when i went to the teachers unions in the early nineteen eightys they told me they told me giving more than two hundred and fifty dollars to any teacher would turn a teacher against a teacher[MASK] so we told them well we 've changed a few things so we 're going to start at twenty five thousand per teacher[MASK] <unk> if you 're a teacher in southern illinois twenty five years of teaching two master 's degrees that 's about your annual pay today[MASK] so we reached out and we tried to go and find teachers[MASK] and we 're in forty three states in america today sixteen hundred and fifty teachers later[MASK] we tried to let the community know that they were the star but more than that we tried to let the teacher know how much we appreciated them[MASK] if you ever need to be uplifted join us in september october november on these tours around the country[MASK] it is an uplifting feeling and a chance to meet america 's heroes every day[MASK] i 'd like to show you a little film that captures what we tried to do[MASK] these people that perform their work and[MASK] <unk> their love every day trying to get them in the public eye reporter the best educators and he 's right here in boston for the second year in a row a pittsburgh public school teacher is the winner of a major national award today in tampa one teacher got a big award[MASK] that as bill logan[MASK] the coveted milken award i came here today[MASK] with a secret[MASK] before you walk out of that door every one of you you 're going to know what the secret is catherine blair for more than a decade the[MASK] milken foundation has honored outstanding principals and teachers for the important work[MASK] they do the award 's purpose is to focus attention on america 's very best teachers[MASK] the milken family foundation[MASK] <unk> award brings both fame and fortune[MASK] <unk> we 're here to talk about greatness ron[MASK] <unk> and if each one of them helps somebody make something better <unk>[MASK] <unk> i 've done my job[MASK] i gave you a chance to see my brother <unk>[MASK] that was his swing primarily through the north[MASK] but if you have medical problems one swing through the country[MASK] is an uplifting feeling we hear about all the problems in education but there is greatness[MASK] out of three million people in our country working we have tried every year to pick[MASK] <unk> hundred two hundred three hundred that are shining examples of everything you can be and letting their communities know[MASK] one of my favorite stories is i was going into this community to give an award one day[MASK] and we identified this teacher who had devoted thirty years of his life to education[MASK] and he had a best friend living next door who was a practical joker but his best friend[MASK] <unk> and we let his friends know that he was going to receive this award[MASK] his friend was the wealthiest member of the community but did not move[MASK] over twenty years and still lived in the same house next to his other friend who was a teacher[MASK] well that day the day before he got a call telling him[MASK] that he had won a major award this teacher and the award had a large financial[MASK] twenty five thousand dollar attachment[MASK] <unk> to it he came home that night and told his wife that he was called <unk>[MASK] who was imitating the state superintendent of education[MASK] and he was really pissed because he was in the middle of a science experiment[MASK] and he kind of had him going for a few minutes until he mentioned there was twenty five thousand[MASK] reward who ever gave twenty five thousand to a teacher for doing what they do[MASK] so he and his wife that night decided they were going to get back at him all these years of[MASK] of practical jokes[MASK] that night they went out and let the air out of eight tires their two cars of the next door neighbor the[MASK] <unk> next day he goes to work and there 's thousands of people there[MASK] there 's a band he walks into the gym there 's the state superintendent they 're all there for him[MASK] his wife arrives a little late because she couldn 't keep a secret so the minute he left the house they went and whisked her there[MASK] that night his next door neighbor came over and told him they really wanted to be there they went out[MASK] <unk> they went outside and the air had been let out of their tires they went in their garage opened the garage and the air had been let out <unk>[MASK] so they now were faced with a very difficult decision do they tell or don 't they tell they decided[MASK] <unk> ok for all those practical jokes for all those years they 're not going to tell[MASK] but these stories are repeated every day[MASK] we had a woman from hungary the minute the iron curtain came down who we flew to surprise her daughter in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight in connecticut[MASK] to see her daughter win an award[MASK] and when she got up to speak she talked about how she always wanted to be a teacher in hungary[MASK] but she didn 't pass this test high enough to become a teacher in hungary so instead she became the country 's leading heart surgeon instead[MASK] but she had always wanted to be a teacher and here her daughter who had made it to the united states was winning an award that night[MASK] so they 're our heroes and they 're our examples for the profession and we have a major challenge continuing to uplift[MASK] <unk> own views but what about this value of life[MASK] healthcare priorities[MASK] there 's a beautiful place it 's not as beautiful as the ted conference but it 's not too far away from here it 's called lake tahoe in fact it is so beautiful that i even decided to build a house there[MASK] it 's the largest alpine lake in[MASK] <unk> 's twenty two miles long and twelve miles wide and its average depth is one thousand feet[MASK] now i spent many years working in manhattan but manhattan fits very nicely into lake tahoe[MASK] in fact it isn 't really the best idea but you could put[MASK] eight manhattans in lake tahoe god forbid eight manhattans in one location[MASK] it holds thirty nine trillion gallons[MASK] <unk> of water[MASK] and if each gallon was worth a dollar pretty cheap relative to evian[MASK] if each gallon was worth a dollar it would not be enough to measure the financial assets of our country[MASK] of individuals states corporations which total about fifty trillion dollars[MASK] <unk> but that 's a small part of the real value of our country[MASK] when the value of our human capital is well in excess of two hundred trillion[MASK] so what about the economic value[MASK] we recognize life is precious one life[MASK] priceless but what about the economic value of a life of investing in medical research[MASK] the milken institute and kevin murphy and bob topel did work and said if we could eliminate cancer what is it[MASK] <unk> worth forty six five trillion dollars almost as much as the entire financial assets of the united states[MASK] forty six five and what about heart disease what about if we could eliminate all heart disease just in the united states of america[MASK] <unk> in the last eight years[MASK] <unk> their size the most[MASK] <unk> the milken institute and[MASK] <unk> fifty trillion dollars[MASK] <unk> in medical research[MASK]
