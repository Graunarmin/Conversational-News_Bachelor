 <unk> about today[MASK] rarely makes the front pages <unk> it <unk> however is enormous in both scale and importance look <unk> you[MASK] <unk> all are very well traveled this is tedglobal after all <unk> but i do hope to take you to some places you 've never been to before [MASK] so let 's start off in china <unk> this photo was taken two weeks ago <unk> [MASK] actually one indication is that little boy on my husband 's shoulders has just graduated from high school [MASK] laughter but this is tiananmen square many of you have been there it 's not the real china let me take you to the real china [MASK] this is in the dabian mountains in the remote part[MASK] of hubei province in central china <unk> [MASK] dai manju is thirteen years old at the time the story starts <unk> she lives with her parents [MASK] her two brothers and her great aunt they have a hut that has no electricity no running water [MASK] no wristwatch no bicycle <unk> and they share this great splendor with a very large pig [MASK] dai manju[MASK] was in sixth grade when her parents said[MASK] we 're going to pull you out of school because the 13 dollar school fees are too much for us <unk> you 're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies <unk> why would we waste this money on you [MASK] this is what happens to girls in remote areas <unk> [MASK] turns out that dai manju was the[MASK] best pupil in her grade <unk> she still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and[MASK] <unk> tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors <unk> we wrote about her in the new york times <unk> we got a flood of donations[MASK] mostly[MASK] 13 dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts [MASK] but then <unk> we got a money transfer for $ ten thousand[MASK] really nice guy <unk> we turned the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought[MASK] <unk> i can renovate the school i can give scholarships to all the girls you know if they work hard and stay in school <unk> so dai manju basically finished out[MASK] middle school she went to high school <unk> she went to vocational school for accounting <unk> she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends [MASK] she sent money back to her family they built[MASK] <unk> a new house this time with running water electricity a bicycle no pig <unk> [MASK] what we saw was a natural experiment [MASK] it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls ' education [MASK] and over the years as we followed dai manju we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her[MASK] she changed her family her village the village became[MASK] a real standout of course most of china was flourishing at the time <unk> but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china <unk> [MASK] and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of half the sky [MASK] and that is that the[MASK] <unk> was totalitarianism the cause of our time is[MASK] the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender [MASK] so some of you may be thinking gosh that 's hyperbole <unk> she 's exaggerating well let me ask you this question[MASK] <unk> how many of you think there are more males or more females in the world <unk> let me take a poll how many of you think there are more males in the world hands up please [MASK] how many of you think a few how many of you there are more females in the world <unk> okay most of you well you know this latter group you 're wrong <unk> [MASK] there are true enough in europe and the west when women and and men have equal access to food and health care there are more women we live[MASK] <unk> in most of the rest of the world that 's not the case <unk> in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between sixty million and one hundred million missing females in the current population[MASK] <unk> and you know <unk> it happens for several reasons for instance <unk> in the last half century [MASK] more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the <unk> 20th century <unk> [MASK] sometimes it 's also because of the sonogram girls get aborted before they 're even born[MASK] when there are scarce resources this girl here for instance is in a feeding center in ethiopia <unk> the entire center was filled with girls like her [MASK] what 's remarkable is that her brothers in the same family were totally fine [MASK] in india[MASK] <unk> in the first year of life from zero to one boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast and the breast shows[MASK] <unk> no son preference from one to five girls die at a fifty percent higher mortality rate than boys in all of india <unk> [MASK] the second tenet of half the sky [MASK] is that let 's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on a purely practical level[MASK] <unk> we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate[MASK] <unk> girls and to bring women into the formal labor force [MASK] poverty for instance <unk> there are three reasons why this is the case [MASK] for one overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy [MASK] his family tends to have fewer kids but only slightly when you educate a[MASK] <unk> she tends to have significantly fewer kids <unk> the second reason[MASK] is[MASK] it has to do with spending it 's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do[MASK] poor people take in very little income <unk> but also the income that they take in they don 't spend it very wisely[MASK] <unk> and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so[MASK] research has shown if you look at people who live under two dollars a day one[MASK] <unk> metric of of poverty[MASK] two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here in education [MASK] twenty percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol <unk> tobacco <unk> sugary drinks and prostitution and[MASK] festivals if you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a[MASK] <unk> the last[MASK] reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem[MASK] <unk> you need to use scarce resources <unk> it 's a waste of resources if you don 't use someone like dai manju [MASK] bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however two thirds of the way there was a barrier on this side was men [MASK] and then the barrier and this side was women [MASK] and someone from this side of the room got up and said[MASK] we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top ten countries when it comes to technology do you think we 'll make it [MASK] so bill gates as he was staring out at the audience he said [MASK] if you 're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten [MASK] so here is bill of arabia[MASK] <unk> so what would some of the specific challenges look like [MASK] i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and i 'll just say two things about this [MASK] the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in[MASK] there were about eighty thousand slaves transported from africa to the new world [MASK] <unk> modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number[MASK] that are trafficked across international borders <unk> and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders <unk> which is a substantial portion [MASK] and <unk> if you look at another factor another contrast a slave back then[MASK] is worth about $ forty thousand in today 's money[MASK] <unk> today you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars which means she 's actually more disposable <unk> [MASK] but you know <unk> there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand we don 't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed [MASK] the second item on the agenda is[MASK] <unk> this part of the world is a wonderful event [MASK] in niger one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth around the world [MASK] one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth[MASK] you know <unk> it 's not as though we don 't have the technological solution <unk> but these women have three strikes against them they are poor they are rural[MASK] and they are female <unk> you know <unk> for every woman who does die there are twenty who survive[MASK] but end up with an injury <unk> and the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula it 's[MASK] a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent <unk> [MASK] let me tell you about mahabuba <unk> she lives in ethiopia she was married against her will at age thirteen she[MASK] <unk> got pregnant ran to the bush to have the baby but you know her body was very immature <unk> and she ended up having obstructed labor [MASK] the baby died <unk> and she ended up with a fistula so[MASK] that meant she was incontinent she couldn 't control her wastes in a word she stank [MASK] the villagers thought she was[MASK] <unk> they didn 't know what to do with her so finally they put her at the edge of the village in a hut <unk> they ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night [MASK] that night <unk> there was a stick in the hut <unk> she fought off the hyenas with that stick [MASK] and the next morning she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary she would be saved [MASK] because she had some damage to her nerves she crawled[MASK] all the way thirty miles to that[MASK] doorstep[MASK] <unk> dead the foreign missionary opened the door knew exactly what had happened took her to a nearby fistula hospital in addis ababa <unk> and[MASK] she was repaired with a 350 dollar operation <unk> [MASK] the doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor <unk> she was really clever <unk> and they made her a nurse[MASK] <unk> she is saving the lives of hundreds <unk> thousands of women she has become part of the solution not the problem she 's moved out of a vicious cycle and[MASK] into a virtuous cycle [MASK] i 've talked about some of the challenges <unk> let me talk about some of the[MASK] solutions and there are predictable solutions[MASK] <unk> i 've hinted at them education and also economic economic opportunity <unk> so of course when you educate a girl <unk> she tends to[MASK] get married later[MASK] <unk> life <unk> she tends to have kids later on in life <unk> she tends to have fewer kids <unk> and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion [MASK] with economic opportunity <unk> it can be transformative [MASK] let me tell you about saima <unk> she lives in a small village outside lahore pakistan [MASK] and at the time she was miserable she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler[MASK] <unk> type and unemployable therefore and took his frustrations out on her well when she had her second daughter her mother <unk> in law told her son [MASK] i think you 'd better get a second wife saima 's not going to produce you a son this[MASK] is when she had her second daughter <unk> at the time there was a microlending group[MASK] in the village that gave her a[MASK] <unk> took that money <unk> and she started an embroidery business <unk> [MASK] the merchants liked her embroidery it sold very well <unk> and they kept asking for more [MASK] and when she couldn 't produce enough she hired other women in the village pretty soon she had thirty women in the village working for her embroidery business <unk> [MASK] and then when she[MASK] <unk> all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace <unk> she needed someone to help her do the transport so she hired her husband <unk> [MASK] so now they 're in it together he does the transportation and distribution <unk> and she does the production and sourcing and now they have a third daughter <unk> [MASK] and the daughters all of them are being tutored in education because saima knows what 's really important <unk> [MASK] which brings me to the final element which is education[MASK] <unk> larry summers when he was chief[MASK] <unk> economist at the world bank once said that it may well be[MASK] that the highest return on investment in the developing world[MASK] is in girls ' education let me tell you about beatrice biira beatrice[MASK] was living in uganda near the congo border and like dai manju she didn 't go to[MASK] <unk> she had never been to school not to a lick one day [MASK] her parents again said why should we spend the money on her she 's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth [MASK] well it just so happens at that time there was a[MASK] group[MASK] in connecticut called the niantic community church group in connecticut they made a donation to an organization based in[MASK] arkansas called heifer international heifer sent two goats to africa[MASK] <unk> of them ended up with beatrice 's parents <unk> [MASK] and that goat had twins the twins started producing milk they sold the milk for cash the cash started accumulating [MASK] and pretty soon the parents said you know <unk> we 've got enough money let 's send beatrice to school [MASK] so at nine years of age beatrice started in first grade after all she 'd never been to a lick of school with a six year old [MASK] no matter she was just[MASK] <unk> delighted to be in school <unk> she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of her class[MASK] through elementary school <unk> middle school and then in high school <unk> she scored brilliantly on the national examinations[MASK] so that she became the first person in her village ever to come to the united states on scholarship[MASK] <unk> she graduated from connecticut college [MASK] on the day of her graduation <unk> she said i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat [MASK] and that goat was $ one hundred and twenty so you see how transformative[MASK] little bits of help can be but i want to give you a reality check look u s [MASK] <unk> helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u s aid there 's bill easterly 's book there 's a book called dead aid [MASK] you know <unk> the criticism is fair it isn 't easy <unk> you know <unk> people say how half of all water well projects a year later are failed when i was in zimbabwe[MASK] <unk> we were touring a place with the village chief he wanted to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and i said what 's that [MASK] he sort of mumbled[MASK] <unk> out that it 's a failed irrigation project a few yards away was a failed chicken coop one year all the chickens died and no one wanted to put the chickens in there it[MASK] 's true <unk> but we think that you don 't through the baby out with the bathwater you actually[MASK] improve you learn from your mistakes and you continuously improve <unk> [MASK] we also think that individuals can make a difference <unk> and they should because individuals together <unk> we can all help create a[MASK] <unk> movement and a movement of men and women is what 's needed to bring about social change change that will[MASK] address this great moral challenge [MASK] so then i ask what 's in it for you you 're probably asking that why should you care [MASK] i will just leave you with two things one[MASK] is that research shows[MASK] that once you[MASK] <unk> have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room do[MASK] research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness [MASK] one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself [MASK] and the second thing <unk> it 's an anecdote that i 'll leave you with and that is the[MASK] <unk> story of[MASK] an aid worker in darfur [MASK] here was a woman who had worked in darfur <unk> seeing things that no human being should see [MASK] throughout her time there <unk> she was strong she was steadfast <unk> she never broke down <unk> and[MASK] <unk> she came back to the united states and was on break christmas break <unk> she was in her grandmother 's backyard <unk> [MASK] and she saw something that made her break down in tears [MASK] what that was[MASK] was a bird feeder <unk> and she realized[MASK] that she had the great fortune[MASK] to be born in a country where we take security for granted where we not only[MASK] <unk> provide for wild birds so they don 't go hungry in the winter <unk> and she realized that with that great fortune[MASK] comes great responsibility <unk> and so [MASK] like her you me we have all won the lottery of life <unk> [MASK] and so the question becomes how do we discharge that responsibility[MASK] <unk> so here 's the cause join the movement <unk> feel happier and help save the world thank you very much[MASK]
