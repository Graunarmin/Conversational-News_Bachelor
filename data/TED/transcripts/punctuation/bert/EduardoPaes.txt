 <unk> great honor to be here it 's a great honor to be here talking about cities talking about[MASK] the future of cities it 's great to be here as a mayor <unk> i really do believe that mayors[MASK] have the political position to really change people 's lives that 's the place to be[MASK] <unk> and it 's great to be here as the mayor of rio <unk> rio 's a[MASK] beautiful city a vibrant place special place <unk> [MASK] actually you 're looking at a guy who has the best job in the world <unk> [MASK] and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio[MASK] <unk> that 's very touching very emotional <unk> but it was not easy to get there actually it was a very hard[MASK] <unk> we had to beat[MASK] the european monarchy this is juan carlos king of spain <unk> [MASK] we had to beat the powerful japanese with all of their technology <unk> we had to beat the most powerful man in the world[MASK] defending his own city[MASK] so it was not easy at all and actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that i think fits perfectly to the situation of rio winning the olympic[MASK] <unk> we really showed that yes <unk> we can and really this is the reason i came here tonight <unk> <unk> [MASK] i came here tonight to tell you that things can be done <unk> [MASK] that you don 't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way that cities are a[MASK] great challenge <unk> it 's a difficult task to deal with cities <unk> but with some original ways of getting things done <unk> with some[MASK] <unk> you can really[MASK] get cities to be a great great place to live [MASK] i want you all to imagine rio <unk> you probably think about a a city full of energy a vibrant city full of green and nobody showed that better than carlos saldanha in last year[MASK] <unk> some parts of rio are pretty much like that but it 's not like that everywhere we 're like every big city in the world we 've got lots of people [MASK] pollution cars <unk> [MASK] <unk> lots of concrete these pictures i 'm showing here <unk> they are some pictures from madureira it 's like the heart of the suburb in rio <unk> [MASK] and i want to use an example of rio that we 're doing in madureira in this region [MASK] to see what we should think as our first commandment <unk> so every time you see a[MASK] concrete jungle like that what you 've got to do is find open spaces if you don 't have open spaces you 've got to go there and open spaces <unk> so[MASK] <unk> go inside these open spaces[MASK] and make it that people can get inside and use those spaces <unk> this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year <unk> [MASK] it 's going to be a place where people can meet where you can put nature[MASK] <unk> the temperature 's going to drop two three degrees centigrade so[MASK] the first commandment i want to leave you tonight is a[MASK] city of the future has to be[MASK] <unk> every time you think of a city <unk> you 've got to think green you 've got to think green and green <unk> [MASK] so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you [MASK] let 's think that cities are made of people <unk> lots of people together cities are packed with people <unk> so how do you do you move these people around when you have three point five billion people living in cities by[MASK] <unk> 's going to be six billion people <unk> so every time you think about moving these people around you think about <unk> high capacity transportation but there is a problem [MASK] high capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money <unk> [MASK] so what i 'm going to show here is something that was already presented in ted by the former mayor of curitiba who created that a city in brazil jaime lerner <unk> [MASK] and it 's something that we 're doing again lots in rio <unk> it 's the brt the bus rapid transit so you get a bus[MASK] <unk> simple bus that everybody knows [MASK] you transform it inside as a train car you use separate lanes <unk> dedicated lanes <unk> the contractors they don 't like that you don 't have to dig deep down <unk>[MASK] underground <unk> you can build nice stations this is actually a station that we 're doing in rio again you don 't have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that this station has the same comfort the same features[MASK] <unk> as a subway station a kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway <unk> so spending much less money[MASK] and doing it much faster you can really change the way people move this is a map of rio <unk> all the lines <unk> the colored lines you see there it 's our <unk>[MASK] transportation network in this present time today we only carry eighteen percent of our population in[MASK] <unk> with the brts we 're doing again the cheapest and fastest way we 're going to move to sixty three percent of the population being carried by high capacity transportation so remember what i said [MASK] you don 't always have to be rich[MASK] or powerful to get things done you can find original ways to get things done so the second commandment i want to leave you tonight is a city of the future has to deal with[MASK] <unk> mobility and integration of its people moving to the third[MASK] commandment and this is the most controversial one it has to do with the favelas the slums whatever you call it there are different names[MASK] all over the world <unk> but the point we want to make here tonight is favelas are not[MASK] <unk> can sometimes really be a solution <unk> if you deal with them if you put public policy inside the favelas <unk> [MASK] let me just show a map of rio again rio has six point three million inhabitants[MASK] more than twenty percent one point four million live in the favelas all these red parts are favelas so you see they are spread all over the city this is a[MASK] <unk> view of a favela in rio you see the contrast between the rich and poor <unk> so i want to make two points here tonight[MASK] about favelas the first one is [MASK] you can change from what i call a [ vicious ] circle to a virtual circle but what you 've got to do to get that is you 've got to go inside the favelas <unk> bring in the basic <unk>[MASK] <unk> services mainly education and health with high quality i 'm going to give a fast example here this was an old building in a favela in rio[MASK] name ] that we just transformed into a primary school <unk> with high quality <unk> [MASK] this is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela <unk> again <unk> with high quality we call it a family clinic <unk> so the first point is bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality <unk> [MASK] <unk> the second point i want to make about the favelas is you 've got to open spaces in the favela bring infrastructure to the favelas to the slums wherever you are rio <unk>[MASK] <unk> has the aim by two thousand and twenty <unk> to have all its favelas completely urbanized another example <unk> this was completely packed with houses <unk> and then we built this what we call a knowledge square this is a place with high technology[MASK] <unk> there 3d movie <unk> and this is the kind of change you can get for that <unk>[MASK] and by the end of the day you get something better than a ted prize which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela <unk> [MASK] so the third commandment i want to leave here tonight is a city of the future has to be socially integrated <unk> you cannot deal with a city if it 's not socially[MASK] integrated[MASK] <unk> but moving to our fourth commandment i really wouldn 't be here tonight <unk> between[MASK] november and may rio 's completely packed [MASK] we just had last week carnivale <unk> it was great it was lots of fun <unk> we have new year 's eve there 's like two million people on copacabana beach <unk> we have problems[MASK] <unk> fight floods tropical rains at this time of the year <unk> you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes[MASK] we have problems with the tropical rains <unk> almost every year we have these landslides which are terrible <unk> [MASK] but the reason i could come here is because of that <unk> this was something we did with ibm[MASK] that 's a little bit more than a year old it 's what we call the operations center of rio <unk> and i wanted to show that i can govern my city using technology from[MASK] <unk> here from long beach <unk> so i got here last night and i know everything we 're going to speak now to the operations center <unk> this is osorio he 's our secretary of urban affairs <unk> [MASK] so osorio[MASK] <unk> good to be there with you i 've already told the people that[MASK] we have tropical rain this time of year so how 's the weather in rio now[MASK] <unk> of year get lots of traffic jams people get mad at the mayor so how 's the traffic tonight osario well traffic tonight is fine let me get you one of our[MASK] <unk> streets are clear now it 's eleven zero pm in rio <unk> [MASK] nothing of concern in terms of traffic i 'll get to you now the incidents of the day <unk> we had heavy traffic[MASK] early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon <unk> but nothing of big concern we[MASK] <unk> 're going to move so that i can make a conclusion[MASK] <unk> okay <unk> so[MASK] no files this place no paperwork no distance twenty four seven working so the fourth commandment i want to share with you here tonight is a[MASK] city of the future has to use technology to be present i don 't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city but everything that[MASK] <unk> the commandments are means are ways for us to govern cities <unk> <unk> invest in infrastructure invest in the green open parks open spaces integrate socially use technology <unk> [MASK] but at the end of the day <unk> when we talk about cities we talk about a gathering of people <unk> [MASK] and we cannot see that as a problem that is fantastic if there 's three point five billion now it 's going to be six billion then it 's going to be ten billion that is great that means we 're going to have ten billion[MASK] <unk> minds working together <unk> ten billion talents together <unk> so[MASK] a city of the future [MASK] i really do believe that it 's a city that cares about its citizens <unk> integrates socially its citizens <unk> a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party <unk> which are cities <unk> thank you very much[MASK]
