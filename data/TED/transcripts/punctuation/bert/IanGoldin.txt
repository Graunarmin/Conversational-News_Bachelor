 <unk> the future as we know it is very unpredictable <unk> the best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong <unk> [MASK] this is in technology <unk> this is in the area of politics where pundits <unk> the[MASK] <unk> always get it wrong <unk> and it 's clearly in the area of finance with institutions established to think about the future the imf the bis the financial stability forum <unk> couldn 't see what was coming <unk>[MASK] over twenty thousand economists whose job it is competitive entry to get there <unk> couldn 't see what was happening globalization is getting more complex <unk> and this change is getting more rapid the future will be more unpredictable[MASK] <unk> coming together leads to a new renaissance it did this a thousand years ago <unk> the last forty years have been extraordinary times life expectancy has gone up by about twenty five years it took from the stone age to achieve that [MASK] income has gone up for a majority of the world 's population despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period [MASK] and illiteracy has gone down from a half to about a quarter of the people on earth a huge[MASK] <unk> huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development but there is an underbelly there[MASK] are two achilles ' heels of globalization [MASK] there is the achilles ' heel of growing inequality those that are left out those that feel angry those that are not participating globalization has not been inclusive <unk> the second achilles ' heel is complexity[MASK] a growing[MASK] fragility a growing brittleness what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else this is a systemic risk[MASK] <unk> systemic shock we 've seen it in the financial crisis we 've seen it in the pandemic flu it will become virulent[MASK] and it 's something we have to build resilience against [MASK] a lot of this is driven by what 's happening in technology there have been huge leaps there will be a million fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by two thousand and thirty that 's what the experience of the last twenty years has been it will continue [MASK] our computers our systems will be as[MASK] <unk> primitive as the apollo 's are for today our mobile phones are more powerful than the total apollo space engine our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of twenty years ago <unk> [MASK] so what will this do it will create huge opportunities in technology <unk> miniaturization as well there will be invisible capacity invisible capacity in our bodies in our brains[MASK] <unk> and in the air this is a dust mite on a nanoreplica [MASK] this sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential not least in the area of medicine this is a stem cell that we 've developed here in oxford from[MASK] an embryonic stem cell we can develop any part of the body <unk> increasingly over time this will be possible from our own skin able to replicate parts of the body <unk> fantastic potential for regenerative <unk>[MASK] <unk> medicine <unk> i don 't think there will be a special olympics long after two thousand and thirty <unk> because of this capacity to regenerate[MASK] <unk> parts of the body <unk> but the question is who will have it [MASK] the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics the capacity to create [MASK] as this mouse has been genetically modified something which goes three times faster <unk> lasts for three times longer we could produce as this mouse can to the age of our equivalent of eighty[MASK] <unk> about the same amount of food <unk> but will this only be available for the super rich for those that can afford it are we headed for a new eugenics will only those[MASK] that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future so[MASK] the big question for us is how do we manage this technological change how do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology a technology[MASK] which means that not only as we grow older <unk> that we can also grow wiser[MASK] <unk> wiser <unk> and that we 're able to support the populations of the future <unk> [MASK] one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins there is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in two thousand and thirty <unk> [MASK] these will be redundant concepts and this isn 't only something of the west the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place[MASK] <unk> in china and in many other countries so forget about retirements if you 're young <unk> forget about pensions think about life and where it 's going to be going of course migration will become even more important <unk> the war <unk>[MASK] <unk> on talent <unk> the need to attract people at all skill ranges to push us around in our wheelchairs <unk> but also to drive our economies our innovation will be vital [MASK] <unk> would imply a massive leap in migration so the concerns the xenophobic concerns of today of migration will be turned on their head as we search for people to help us sort out our <unk>[MASK] <unk> pensions and our economies in the future <unk> and then the systemic risks we understand that these will become much more virulent that what we see today is this interweaving of societies of systems fastened by technologies and hastened by[MASK] just in time management systems small levels of stock push resilience into other people 's responsibility <unk> [MASK] the collapse in biodiversity climate change pandemics financial crises these will be the currency that we will think about and so a new awareness will have to arise of how we <unk>[MASK] <unk> deal with these how we mobilize ourselves in a new way and come together as a community to manage systemic risk[MASK] <unk> it 's going to require innovation it 's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall this could be our best century ever because of the achievements or it could be our worst <unk> [MASK] and of course we need to worry about the individuals particularly the individuals that feel that they 've been left out in one way or another [MASK] an individual for the first time in the history of humanity will have the capacity by two thousand and thirty to destroy the[MASK] <unk> planet to wreck everything [MASK] through the creation for example of a biopathogen how do we begin to weave these tapestries together how do we think about complex systems in new ways that will be the challenge of the scholars <unk> and of all of us[MASK] engaged in thinking about the future the rest of our lives will be in the future <unk> we need to prepare for it now we need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized it cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring[MASK] we have to develop a new way of managing the planet <unk> collectively <unk> through collective wisdom[MASK]
