 i did what most little kids do i played a little baseball did a few other things like that <unk> [MASK] but i always had the sense of being an outsider and it wasn 't until i saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate [MASK] i thought wow that 's for me you know because there was no coach standing directly over you and these guys they were just being themselves there was no opponent directly across from you [MASK] and i loved that sense so[MASK] i started skating when i was about ten years old[MASK] <unk> i picked it up pretty quickly in fact here 's some footage from about[MASK] it wasn 't until[MASK] <unk> i won my first amateur championship <unk> and then by[MASK] <unk> i was fourteen and i won my first world championship <unk> which was amazing to me and in a very real sense that was the[MASK] <unk> this is a casper slide where the board 's upside down <unk> mental note on that one and[MASK] this one here an ollie [MASK] so as[MASK] she mentioned that is overstated for sure <unk> but that 's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating <unk> [MASK] here 's some images of that <unk> [MASK] <unk> i was about halfway through my pro career in i would say <unk>[MASK] freestyle itself we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw <unk> but there there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding where guys were taking it to the streets and they were using that ollie like i showed you [MASK] they were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff so it was[MASK] <unk> evolving upwards in fact <unk> when someone tells you they 're a skater today <unk> they pretty much mean a street skater <unk> because freestyle it took about five years for it to die <unk> [MASK] and at that stage i 'd been a champion champion for eleven years [MASK] which phew [MASK] and suddenly it was over for me <unk> that 's it[MASK] it it was gone they took my pro model off the shelf which was essentially pronouncing you dead[MASK] <unk> publicly that 's how you make your money you know you have a signature board and wheels and[MASK] shoes and clothes i had all that stuff and it 's gone <unk> [MASK] the crazy thing was there was a really liberating sense about it because i no longer had to protect[MASK] my record as a champion[MASK] <unk> restored where i could just create things <unk> because that 's where the joy was for me <unk> [MASK] always was creating new stuff [MASK] the other thing that i had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different so as humbling and rotten as it was and believe me it was rotten i would go[MASK] <unk> humbling as it was i began again <unk> here are some tricks that i started to bring to that new terrain <unk> [MASK] and again there 's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle[MASK] <unk> your front foot <unk> the way it grabs it i 'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that[MASK] <unk> get it over because that had not yet been done <unk> and then it dawned on me and here 's part of what i 'm saying i had an infrastructure i had this deep layer <unk>[MASK] <unk> like oh my gosh it 's just your foot <unk> it 's just the way you throw your board over just let the ledge do that and it 's easy and the next thing you[MASK] know there 's twenty more tricks based out of the variations <unk> so that 's the kind of thing here check this out here 's another way and i won 't overdo this a little indulgent i understand[MASK] there 's something called a primo slide [MASK] it is the funnest trick ever to do <unk> [MASK] it 's like skimboarding and this one look how it[MASK] slides sideways every which way <unk> ok <unk> so when you 're skating <unk> and you take a fall the board slips that way or that way[MASK] and that 's what i love the most about it it 's so much fun to do in fact when i started doing them i remember because i got hurt i had to get a knee surgery right so there <unk>[MASK] <unk> a couple of weeks where i couldn 't skate at all it would give out on me and i would watch the guys i 'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating my friends[MASK] <unk> going to do this so i ran up and i jumped on my board and i cavemanned and i flipped it down and i remember thinking <unk> i landed so light footed thinking [MASK] if my knee gives they 'll just have more work to do in the morning [MASK] and so when it was the crazy thing i don 't know how many of you guys have had surgery <unk> but [MASK] you are so helpless right you 're on this gurney and you 're watching the ceiling go by[MASK] <unk> time it 's always that <unk> and right when they 're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep all[MASK] i was thinking is man when i wake up and i get better the first thing i 'm going to do is film that trick [MASK] and indeed i did it was the very first thing i filmed which was[MASK] awesome[MASK] <unk> i told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks consider that content <unk> in a sense what we do as street skaters is[MASK] <unk> you have these tricks say i 'm working on darkslides or a primo that you guys know this stuff now [MASK] what you do is you cruise around the same streets that you 've seen a hundred times <unk> [MASK] but suddenly <unk> because you already have something in this fixed domain[MASK] of this target it 's like <unk> what will match this trick how can i expand how can the context how can the environment change the very nature of what i do[MASK] <unk> you drive and drive and drive and [MASK] actually i 've got to admit just because i was struggling with this because i 'm here <unk> but i 'll just say it is <unk> [MASK] i cannot tell you <unk> not only to be here in front of you but what a privilege it is to be at us campus because i have been escorted off of this campus so[MASK] many times[MASK] <unk> how context shapes content <unk> [MASK] this is a place not that far from here it 's a rotten neighborhood your first consideration is am i going to get beat up <unk> you go out and see this wall <unk> it 's[MASK] fairly mellow <unk> and it 's[MASK] beckoning to do bank tricks <unk> right <unk> but there 's this other aspect of it for wheelies[MASK] <unk> so check this out there[MASK] 's a few tricks again <unk> [MASK] how environment changes the nature of your tricks freestyle oriented <unk> manual down wheelie down <unk> [MASK] watch this one oh i love this it 's like surfing this one the way you catch it [MASK] this one [MASK] a little sketchy going backwards <unk> and watch the back foot[MASK] <unk> that was called a three hundred and sixty flip <unk> notice how the board flipped and spun this way <unk> both axes <unk> and[MASK] another example of how the context changed <unk> and the creative process[MASK] for me and for most skaters is you go you get out of the car <unk> you check for security you check for stuff[MASK] <unk> you 've still got to deal with <unk> so you hit this wall <unk> and when i hit it the first thing you do is you fall forward and i <unk>[MASK] as you adjust you punch it up and then when i would do that it was throwing my shoulder this way <unk> [MASK] <unk> you load up for a three hundred and sixty flip <unk> [MASK] and so this is what i want to emphasize that as you can imagine <unk> all of these tricks are made[MASK] of submovements executive motor functions more granular to the degree to which i can 't quite tell you <unk> but one thing i do know is every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements <unk> [MASK] <unk> and so as i 'm going up these things are floating around <unk> and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind rest back pull it back a little bit and let your intuition go as you feel these things <unk> [MASK] and these these submovements are kind of floating around and as the wall hits you they connect themselves to an extent and that 's when the cognitive mind oh three hundred and sixty flip <unk> i 'm going to make that [MASK] so that 's how that works to me the creative process the process itself of street skating <unk> so <unk> next oh mind you [MASK] those are the community these are some of the best skaters in the world[MASK] are my friends[MASK] oh my gosh they 're such good people <unk> [MASK] and the beauty of skateboarding is that <unk> no one guy is the best in fact i know this is rotten to say they 're my friends <unk> [MASK] but a couple of them actually don 't look that that comfortable on their board what makes them great[MASK] is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves <unk> every single one of these guys you look at them you can see a silhouette of them[MASK] <unk> realize oh that 's him that 's haslam <unk> that 's koston there 's these guys these are the guys and[MASK] skaters <unk> i think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of[MASK] belonging but belonging on their own terms [MASK] and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do these basic tricks three hundred and sixty flips we take that we make[MASK] <unk> our own <unk> and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself <unk> [MASK] the greater the contribution <unk> the more we express and form our individuality <unk> [MASK] which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with <unk> the summation of that[MASK] gives us something we could never achieve as an individual[MASK] <unk> say this there 's some sort of beautiful symmetry[MASK] that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality which we are expressing by what we do <unk> [MASK] next these guys very similar community that 's extremely conducive to innovation [MASK] notice a couple of these shots[MASK] from the police department <unk> [MASK] but it is quite similar i mean what is it to hack right it 's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do [MASK] right and they 're not all bad you can be a linux kernel hacker make it more stable <unk> [MASK] right <unk> more safe more secure <unk> you can be an ios hacker make your iphone do stuff it wasn 't supposed to not authorized [MASK] <unk> you 've got some of these guys <unk> right <unk> what they do is very similar to our creative process they connect disparate information <unk> [MASK] and they bring it together in a way[MASK] that a security analyst doesn 't expect it doesn 't make them good people <unk> but it 's at the heart of engineering at the heart of[MASK] a creative community an innovative community <unk> and the open source community the basic ethos of it is take what other people do[MASK] <unk> make it better <unk> give it back so we all rise further very similar communities very similar we have our edgier sides too it[MASK] 's funny my dad was right <unk> these are my peers <unk> [MASK] but i respect what they do and they respect what i do because they can do things it 's amazing what they can do in fact <unk> one of them he was ernst & young 's[MASK] entrepreneur of the year for san diego county[MASK] you never know who you 're dealing with we 've all had some degree of fame in fact i 've had so much success that i[MASK] strangely always feel unworthy of i 've had a patent and that was cool and we started a company and it grew and it became the biggest and then[MASK] it went down and then it became the biggest again which is harder than the first time <unk> and then we sold it and then we sold it again <unk> [MASK] so i 've had some success[MASK] <unk> and in the end when you 've had all of these things what is it that continues to drive you as i mentioned the knee stuff and these things what is it that will punch you <unk> because it 's not just the mind <unk> what is it that will punch you and make you do something and[MASK] bring it to another level <unk> and when you 've had it all sometimes guys they die on the vine with all of that talent[MASK] <unk> one of the things we 've had all of us is fame i think the best kind of fame because you can take it off i 've been all around the world [MASK] and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name and it 's such a weird visceral experience it 's like it 's disorienting and[MASK] you get in a car and you drive away and 10 minute drive and you get out and no one gives a rat 's who you are [MASK] and it gives you that clarity of perspective of[MASK] <unk> just me and popularity <unk> what does that really mean again <unk> not much [MASK] it 's peer respect that drives us that 's the one thing that makes us do what we do i 've had over a dozen bones this guy over eight ten concussions to the point where it 's comedy [MASK] right it is actually comedy they mess with him [MASK] next <unk> and this is something deeper <unk> [MASK] i think i was on tour when i was reading one of the feynman biographies[MASK] <unk> the red one or the blue one <unk> and <unk>[MASK] he made this statement that was so profound to me [MASK] it was that the the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work[MASK] <unk> and it resonated because i had won thirty five out of thirty six contests that i 'd entered over eleven years <unk> and it[MASK] <unk> winning isn 't the word i won it once <unk> the rest of the time you 're just defending <unk> and you get into this turtle posture you know [MASK] where you 're not doing it it usurped the joy of what i loved to do because i was no longer doing it to create and have fun <unk> [MASK] and when it died out from under me <unk> that was one of the most liberating things because i could create [MASK] and look i understand that i am[MASK] on the very edge of preachy here i 'm not here to do that it 's just that i 'm in front of a very privileged audience <unk> if you guys aren 't already leaders[MASK] <unk> in your community <unk> you probably will be and if there 's anything i can give you that will transcend what i 've gotten from skateboarding <unk> [MASK] the only things of of meaning <unk> i think and of permanence <unk> it 's not fame it 's not all these things what it is [MASK] is that there 's an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it and better than[MASK] <unk> how pathetic is that i 'm still skateboarding <unk> but there is there is this beauty in[MASK] dropping it into a community of your own making <unk> [MASK] and seeing it dispersed <unk> and seeing younger more talented just different talent <unk> take it to levels you can never imagine <unk> because that lives on so thank you for your time[MASK] <unk> every time you think you 've chased something down it 's funny no matter how good you are and i know guys like this it feels like you 're polishing a turd you know [MASK] and i thought the only way i can extend this is is to change something infrastructural <unk> [MASK] and so that 's what i proceeded to do <unk> through a long story one of desperation[MASK] <unk> if i do it rather than talk about it if i do it[MASK]
