 <unk> i wanted to well this morning i want to talk about the future[MASK] of human driven transportation about how we can cut congestion <unk> pollution[MASK] and parking[MASK] by getting more people into[MASK] <unk> fewer cars and how we can do it with the technology[MASK] that 's in our pockets and yes i 'm talking about smartphones not <unk> self driving cars but to get started[MASK] we 've got to go back over one hundred years because it turns out there was an uber[MASK] way before uber[MASK] <unk> and if it had survived the future of transportation would probably already be here [MASK] so let me introduce you to the jitney in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen it was created or invented[MASK] by a guy named lp draper <unk> he was a car salesman from la and he had[MASK] <unk> he was cruising around downtown los angeles my hometown and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go he[MASK] said well why don 't i just put a sign on my car[MASK] that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney that was slang for a nickel <unk> [MASK] and so people jumped on board <unk> and not just in los angeles but across the country[MASK] <unk> there were fifty thousand rides per day in seattle forty five thousand rides per day in kansas[MASK] and one hundred and fifty thousand rides per day in los angeles to give you some perspective uber in los angeles[MASK] is doing one hundred and fifty seven thousand rides per day today [MASK] one hundred years later <unk> [MASK] <unk> these are the trolley guys the existing transportation monopoly at the time they were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut <unk> [MASK] and so they got to work[MASK] and they went to cities across the country[MASK] and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney [MASK] and there were all kinds of regulations there were licenses often they were pricey <unk> in some cities[MASK] <unk> jitney driver you were required[MASK] to be in the jitney for sixteen hours a day in other cities they required two jitney drivers for one jitney <unk> [MASK] but there was a really interesting regulation which was[MASK] they had to put a backseat light[MASK] install it in every jitney to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning[MASK] <unk> so what happened <unk> well within a year this thing had taken off <unk> [MASK] but the jitney by one thousand nine hundred and nineteen was regulated completely out of existence <unk> [MASK] that 's unfortunate [MASK] because well when you can 't share a car then you have to own one <unk> and car ownership skyrocketed and it 's no wonder[MASK] that by two thousand and seven there was a car for every man[MASK] <unk> woman and child in the united states and that phenomenon had gone global in china by two thousand and eleven [MASK] there were more car sales happening in china than in the us [MASK] now all this private ownership of course had a public cost in the us we spend seven billion hours[MASK] <unk> sitting in traffic [MASK] one hundred and sixty billion dollars in lost productivity of course also sitting in traffic and one fifth of all of our carbon footprint[MASK] is spewed out in the air by those cars that we 're sitting in now [MASK] that 's only four percent of our problem though <unk> because if you have to own a car then that means ninety six percent of the time your car is[MASK] <unk> and so up to thirty percent of our land and our space[MASK] is used storing these hunks of steel <unk> [MASK] we even have skyscrapers built for cars that 's the world we live in today <unk> [MASK] now cities have been dealing with this problem for decades it 's called mass transit and even in a city like new york city[MASK] <unk> one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world [MASK] there are still two point five million cars that go over those bridges[MASK] every day <unk> why is that well it 's because mass transit hasn 't yet figured out[MASK] how to get to everybody 's doorstep <unk> and so back in san francisco where i live the situation 's much worse in fact much worse[MASK] <unk> world <unk> and so the beginning of uber in two thousand and ten was well we just wanted to push a button and get a ride we didn 't have any grand ambitions [MASK] but it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride <unk> and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides <unk> [MASK] we saw a lot of people pushing the same button[MASK] at the same time going[MASK] essentially to the same place <unk> and so we started thinking about well how do we make those two trips and turn them into one [MASK] because if we did that ride would[MASK] be a lot cheaper up to fifty percent cheaper[MASK] and of course for the city you 've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars <unk> and so the big question for us was [MASK] <unk> could you have a cheaper ride[MASK] cheap enough that people would be willing to share it [MASK] and the answer fortunately is a resounding yes <unk> in san francisco <unk> before uberpool [MASK] we had well everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted [MASK] and the bright colors is where we have the most cars and once we introduced uberpool [MASK] <unk> you see there 's not as many bright colors [MASK] more people getting around the city in fewer cars <unk> taking cars off the road <unk> it looks like uberpool is working <unk> [MASK] and so we rolled it out in los angeles[MASK] eight months ago and since then we 've taken seven point nine million miles off the roads[MASK] and we 've taken one point four thousand metric tons of co2 out of the air[MASK] <unk> but the part that i 'm really [MASK] but my favorite statistic[MASK] remember i 'm from la i spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel going how do we fix this my favorite part[MASK] is that eight months later we have added one hundred thousand new people that are carpooling every week[MASK] <unk> now in china everything is supersized <unk> [MASK] and so we 're doing fifteen million uberpool trips per month that 's five hundred thousand per day and of course we 're seeing that exponential growth happen in fact we 're seeing it in la too [MASK] and when i talk to my team we don 't talk about hey well one hundred thousand[MASK] <unk> to a million and[MASK] in china <unk> well <unk> that could be several million <unk> [MASK] and so uberpool is a very great solution for urban carpooling <unk> but what about the suburbs [MASK] this is the street where i grew up in los angeles it 's actually a suburb called northridge california and well look[MASK] <unk> those mailboxes they kind of just go on forever <unk> and every morning at about the same time [MASK] cars roll of out their driveway most of them one person in the car [MASK] and they go to work they go to their place of work so the question for us is well how do we turn[MASK] all of these commuter cars and literally there 's tens of millions of them how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars[MASK] <unk> well <unk> we have something for this that we recently launched called ubercommute you[MASK] get up in the morning get ready for work get your coffee go to your car[MASK] and you light up the uber app and all of a sudden you become an uber driver <unk> [MASK] and we 'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work[MASK] and it 's a really great thing there 's just one hitch[MASK] <unk> it 's called regulation so fifty four cents a mile what is that <unk> well <unk> that is what the us government has determined[MASK] that the cost of owning a car is per mile [MASK] you can pick up anybody in the united states and take them wherever they want to go at a moment 's notice for fifty four cents a mile or less <unk> [MASK] but if you charge sixty cents a mile[MASK] <unk> but what if for sixty cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling[MASK] in los angeles <unk> and what if[MASK] at sixty cents a mile we could get fifty million people carpooling in the united states if we could it 's obviously something we should do <unk> [MASK] and so it goes back to the lesson of the[MASK] <unk> fifteen this thing was taking off <unk> imagine without the regulations that happened if that thing could just keep going[MASK] how would our cities be different today would we have parks in the place of parking lots [MASK] well we lost that chance but technology has given us another opportunity <unk> [MASK] now <unk> i 'm as excited as anybody[MASK] <unk> but do we have to really wait five ten or even twenty years to make[MASK] our new cities a reality with the technology in our pockets today <unk> and a little smart regulation [MASK] we can turn every car into a shared car [MASK] and we can reclaim our cities[MASK] starting today <unk>[MASK] <unk> you know[MASK] i mean the company you 've built is absolutely astounding <unk> you only just talked about a small part of it here[MASK] a powerful part the idea of turning cars into public transport like that[MASK] <unk> couple other questions because i know they 're out there on people 's minds so first of all last week i think it was[MASK] i switched on my phone and tried to book an uber and i couldn 't find the app[MASK] <unk> you had this very radical very bold <unk> brave redesign tk sure ca [MASK] how did it go did you notice other people not finding the app that day are you going to win people over for this redesign[MASK] <unk> first i should probably just say well <unk> what we were trying to accomplish and i think if you know a little bit about our history <unk> [MASK] it makes a lot more sense which is when we first got started [MASK] it was just black cars <unk> it was literally you push a button and get an s class and so what we did was[MASK] almost what i would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car and as we 've gone worldwide and gone from[MASK] <unk> auto rickshaws in india [MASK] it became something that was important for us to be more accessible [MASK] to be more hyperlocal to be about the cities we were in and that 's what you see with the patterns and colors and to be more iconic because a u doesn 't mean anything in sanskrit [MASK] and a u doesn 't mean anything in mandarin <unk> [MASK] and so that was a little bit what it was about now when you first roll out something like that i mean[MASK] <unk> mean your hands are sweating you 've got you know you 're a little worried [MASK] what we saw is a lot of people actually at the beginning we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it[MASK] <unk> and our numbers were slightly up from what we expected[MASK] supporters and investors <unk> who[MASK] have been with you the whole way believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth is to have someone who is a fierce relentless competitor which you 've certainly proved to be [MASK] some people feel you 've almost taken that culture too[MASK] <unk> you know like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset <unk> [MASK] how did it feel like inside the company during that period did you notice a loss of business did you learn anything from that tk [MASK] well look i think i 've been an entrepreneur since i 've been in high school and[MASK] you have in various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us it was about a year and a half ago <unk> and for us[MASK] <unk> it was hard times too now inside we felt like[MASK] i guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work[MASK] but on the outside that wasn 't evident <unk> and so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of[MASK] we 'd gone from a very small company i mean if you go literally two and a half years ago our company was four hundred people[MASK] <unk> and today it 's six thousand five hundred [MASK] and so when you go through that growth you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time <unk> [MASK] and make sure that people are constantly checking to say are we good people doing good work [MASK] and if you check those boxes the next part of that is making sure you 're telling your[MASK] <unk> i think we learned a lot of lessons but i think at the end of it we came out stronger but it was it was certainly a difficult period ca[MASK] it seems to me everywhere you turn you 're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time some uber drivers in new york and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely[MASK] they claim barely afford the deal anymore[MASK] <unk> you said that you started this originally[MASK] just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride <unk> this thing 's taken off you 're affecting the whole global economy basically at this point you 're being[MASK] forced to be whether you want it or not a kind of global visionary who 's 's changing the world i mean[MASK] who are you do you want that are you ready to go with that and and be what[MASK] <unk> there 's a few things packed in that question so[MASK] first is on on the pricing side i mean keep in mind[MASK] when we first started was literally ten or fifteen percent cheaper than our black car product it 's now[MASK] in many cities half the price of a taxi [MASK] and we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers what[MASK] <unk> happens is when the price goes down people are more likely to take uber[MASK] at different times of the day than they otherwise would have [MASK] and they 're more likely to use it in places they wouldn 't have before <unk> and what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off [MASK] they 're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in [MASK] and so what that means is[MASK] <unk> more trips per hour more minutes of the hour where they 're productive and actually earnings come up [MASK] and we have cities where we 've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time so even in new york[MASK] we have a blog post we call four septembers compare the earnings september after september after september same month every year [MASK] and we see the earnings going up over[MASK] <unk> as the price comes down and there 's a perfect price point you can 't go down forever <unk> [MASK] and in those places where we bring the price down but we don 't see those earnings pop we bring the prices back up [MASK] so that addresses that first part and then the enigma and and[MASK] all of this i mean the kind of entrepreneur i am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems [MASK] and the way i like to describe it is it 's kind of like a math professor [MASK] you know if a[MASK] <unk> math professor doesn 't have hard problems to solve that 's a really sad math professor[MASK] <unk> and so at uber we like the hard problems and we like[MASK] getting excited about those and solving them but we don 't want just any math problem we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find and we want the one that if you solve it[MASK] <unk> there 's a little bit of a wow factor ca [MASK] in a couple years ' time say five years ' time i don 't know when you roll out your incredible <unk> self driving cars <unk> at probably a lower cost than[MASK] you currently pay for an uber ride what do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time tk explain that again at which time[MASK] it 's likely going to take a lot longer than i think some of the hype or media might expect <unk> that 's part one part two is it 's going to also take[MASK] there 's going to be a long transition these cars will work in certain places and not in others [MASK] for us it 's an interesting challenge <unk> right because well[MASK] google 's been investing in this since two thousand and seven tesla 's[MASK] <unk> going to be doing it apple 's going to be doing it the manufacturers are going to be doing it this is a world that 's going to exist and for good reason[MASK] a million people die a year in cars <unk> [MASK] and we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them driving frustrated anxious and think about the quality of life that[MASK] improves when you when you give people their time[MASK] <unk> time back and it 's not so anxiety ridden so i think there 's a lot of good <unk> [MASK] and so the way we think about it is that it 's a challenge but one for optimistic leadership where instead of resisting[MASK] resisting technology maybe like the taxi industry or the trolley industry[MASK] we have to embrace it or be a part of the future but how do we optimistically lead through it are there ways[MASK] <unk> to partner with cities are there ways to have education systems vocational training etc for that transition period <unk> it will take a lot longer than i think we all expect especially that transition period <unk> [MASK] but it is a world that 's going to exist and it is going to be a better world ca [MASK] travis what you 're building is absolutely incredible and i 'm hugely grateful to you for coming to ted and sharing so openly thank you so much[MASK]
