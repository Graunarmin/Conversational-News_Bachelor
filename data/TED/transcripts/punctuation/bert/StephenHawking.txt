 <unk> bigger or older than the universe <unk> [MASK] the questions i would like to talk about are [MASK] <unk> where did we come from how did the universe come into being [MASK] are we alone in the universe <unk> is there alien life out there [MASK] what is the future of the human race <unk> up until the <unk>[MASK] everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging[MASK] <unk> it was discovered that the universe was expanding <unk> distant galaxies were moving away from us [MASK] this meant they must have been closer together in the past <unk> [MASK] if we extrapolate back <unk> we find we must have all been on top of each other about fifteen billion years ago <unk> [MASK] this was the big bang the beginning of the universe[MASK] but was there anything before the big bang <unk> [MASK] if not <unk> what created the universe <unk> [MASK] why did the universe emerge from the big bang the way it did [MASK] we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts [MASK] first there were the laws like maxwell 's equations and general relativity[MASK] that determined the evolution of the universe <unk> given its state over all of space at one time [MASK] and second there was no question of the initial state of the universe <unk> [MASK] we have made good progress on the first part and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions <unk> but until recently[MASK] <unk> recently <unk> we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe <unk> [MASK] however <unk> this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct <unk> [MASK] under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space[MASK] this removes the distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state [MASK] the universe can spontaneously create itself out of[MASK] <unk> we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states [MASK] these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background which is an imprint of the very early universe <unk> [MASK] we think we have solved the mystery of creation <unk> [MASK] maybe we[MASK] <unk> should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence <unk> [MASK] i now turn to the second big question [MASK] are we alone or is there other life in the universe <unk> [MASK] we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life[MASK] <unk> to appear on other suitable planets of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy <unk> [MASK] but we don 't know how life first appeared [MASK] we have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing [MASK] the first is that we have fossils of algae[MASK] <unk> from three point five billion years ago [MASK] the earth was formed four point six billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years[MASK] so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short[MASK] <unk> compared to the <unk>[MASK] <unk> 10 billion year lifetime of a planet of earth type <unk> [MASK] this suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high <unk> [MASK] if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available [MASK] on the other[MASK] <unk> we don 't seem to have been visited by aliens [MASK] i am discounting the reports of ufos <unk> [MASK] why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos <unk> [MASK] if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly[MASK] <unk> despite an extensive search by the seti project <unk> we haven 't heard any alien television quiz shows[MASK] <unk> this probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years <unk> [MASK] issuing an insurance policy[MASK] <unk> against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet <unk> [MASK] this brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race <unk> [MASK] if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy <unk> we should make sure we survive and[MASK] <unk> but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history [MASK] our population and our use of the finite resources of planet earth are growing exponentially <unk> along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill[MASK] <unk> our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past <unk> [MASK] it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years <unk> let alone the next thousand or million [MASK] our only chance of[MASK] long term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet earth <unk> but to spread out into space [MASK] the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years <unk> [MASK] but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years <unk> our future is in space[MASK] that is why i am in favor of manned or should i say personned space flight [MASK] all of my life i have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions [MASK] i have been very lucky that my disability has not been a[MASK] <unk> serious handicap <unk> indeed <unk> it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge [MASK] the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress[MASK] <unk> if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are[MASK] alone in the milky way <unk> as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher[MASK] <unk> this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible[MASK] act of generosity this whole talk was for ted[MASK] <unk> think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years <unk> [MASK] otherwise we would have heard radio waves [MASK] the alternative is that civilizations[MASK] <unk> professor hawking thank you for that answer <unk> we will take it as a salutary warning i think for the rest of our conference this week <unk> [MASK] professor <unk> we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today <unk> thank you very much indeed[MASK]
