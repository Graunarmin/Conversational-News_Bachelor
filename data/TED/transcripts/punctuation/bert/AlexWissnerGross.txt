 <unk> if we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed one seminal example has been[MASK] <unk> machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim <unk>[MASK] when he wrote this intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science like alan turing <unk> however if you take a[MASK] <unk> and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build[MASK] artificial machines that swim[MASK] and artificial machines that [ fly ] [MASK] you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming[MASK] and flight that we were able to build these machines <unk> [MASK] and so <unk> several years ago <unk> i undertook a program to try to understand the[MASK] <unk> fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence <unk> [MASK] let 's take a step back [MASK] let 's first begin with a thought experiment [MASK] pretend that you 're an alien race that doesn 't know anything about earth biology or earth neuroscience or earth intelligence <unk> [MASK] but you have amazing telescopes[MASK] and you 're able to watch the earth and you have amazingly long lives[MASK] <unk> lives so you 're able to watch the earth over millions even billions of years [MASK] and you observe a really strange effect you observe[MASK] that over the course of the millennia earth is continually bombarded with asteroids[MASK] up until a point and that at some point <unk> corresponding roughly to our year two thousand[MASK] <unk> asteroids that are on a collision course with the earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected[MASK] or they detonate before they can hit the earth [MASK] now of course as earthlings we know the reason would be that we 're trying to save ourselves we 're trying to prevent an impact [MASK] but if you 're an alien race who doesn 't know any of this doesn 't have any concept of earth intelligence[MASK] <unk> you 'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how up until a certain point in time [MASK] asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet[MASK] mysteriously stop doing that <unk> and so i claim[MASK] that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence <unk> so in this program that i undertook[MASK] <unk> several years ago <unk> i looked at a variety of different threads[MASK] across science <unk> across a variety of disciplines that were pointing i think <unk> towards a single underlying mechanism for intelligence [MASK] in cosmology for example <unk> [MASK] there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence[MASK] <unk> particular for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures [MASK] in game play <unk> for example in go everyone remembers in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven when ibm 's deep blue beat garry kasparov at chess[MASK] fewer people are aware that in the past ten years or so the game of go arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much[MASK] <unk> higher branching factor has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason [MASK] the best techniques right now for computers playing go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play <unk> [MASK] finally [MASK] in robotic motion planning there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots[MASK] to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks <unk> [MASK] and so taking all of these different threads and putting them together <unk> [MASK] i asked <unk> starting several years ago <unk> [MASK] is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads is there a single[MASK] <unk> what you 're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an e = mc for intelligence that i 've seen [MASK] so what you 're seeing here is a statement of correspondence[MASK] that intelligence is a force <unk> f [MASK] that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action it acts to maximize future freedom of[MASK] <unk> action or keep options open with some strength t [MASK] with the diversity of possible accessible futures s up to some future time horizon tau [MASK] in short intelligence doesn 't like to get trapped intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open <unk> [MASK] <unk> given this one equation it 's natural to ask so what can you do with this how predictive is it does it predict human level intelligence does it predict artificial intelligence <unk> so i 'm going to show you now a video[MASK] that will i think demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation narrator [MASK] recent research in cosmology has suggested that[MASK] <unk> over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves <unk> but what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy <unk>[MASK] <unk> and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship what if intelligent behavior doesn 't just correlate with the production of long term entropy but actually emerges directly from it to find out we developed a software engine[MASK] <unk> to maximize the production of long term entropy of any system that it finds itself in [MASK] amazingly entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests play human games <unk> and even earn money trading stocks all without being instructed to do so <unk>[MASK] <unk> here are some examples of entropica in action just like a human standing upright without falling over here we see <unk> entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart [MASK] <unk> a goal it simply decided on its own to balance the pole this balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies [MASK] just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces [MASK] here we see that entropica again on its own initiative was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk representing[MASK] <unk> a tool to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position this tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing <unk>[MASK] and agriculture in addition just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food [MASK] <unk> for economic planning and a variety of other fields [MASK] entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains [MASK] for example here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself illustrating its potential for gaming [MASK] here we see entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected [MASK] this same network[MASK] <unk> orchestration ability also has applications in health care <unk> energy and intelligence <unk> [MASK] here we see <unk> entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships successfully discovering and utilizing the panama canal to globally extend its reach from the atlantic to the pacific [MASK] by the same token <unk> entropica is broadly[MASK] <unk> on a simulated range traded stock successfully growing assets under management exponentially [MASK] this risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance alex wissner gross [MASK] so what you 've just seen is that a variety of[MASK] signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright[MASK] and social cooperation all follow from a single equation <unk> which drives a system[MASK] to maximize its future freedom of action now there 's a profound irony[MASK] <unk> going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot the play[MASK] there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence <unk> there would be a cybernetic revolt [MASK] the machines would rise up against us [MASK] one major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades we 've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse[MASK] <unk> reverse [MASK] it 's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world it 's quite the opposite [MASK] that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of[MASK] control grabbing rather than vice versa[MASK] another important consequence is goal seeking [MASK] i 'm often asked how does the ability to seek goals[MASK] follow from this sort of framework and the answer is the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense [MASK] just like you would travel through a tunnel[MASK] <unk> bottleneck in your future path space in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on [MASK] or just like you would invest in a financial security <unk> reducing your short term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term [MASK] goal seeking emerges directly from a long term drive to increase future freedom of action[MASK] <unk> feynman famous physicist <unk> once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed[MASK] and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization that concept should be that all matter around us is made <unk>[MASK] <unk> out of tiny elements that attract each other when they 're far apart but repel each other when they 're close together [MASK] <unk> on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence is the following [MASK] intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future [MASK] thank you very much[MASK]
