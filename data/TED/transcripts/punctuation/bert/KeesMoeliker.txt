 <unk> is the natural history museum in rotterdam where i work as a curator[MASK] it 's my job to make sure the collection stays okay and that it grows and basically it means i collect[MASK] <unk> ninety five we got a new wing next to the museum it was made of glass[MASK] and this building really helped me to do my job good[MASK] the building was a true bird killer[MASK] you may know that birds don 't understand the concept of glass they don 't see it so they fly into the windows[MASK] and get killed the only thing i had to do was go out pick them up and have them stuffed for the collection laughter[MASK] and in those days[MASK] i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass[MASK] and it was on june five[MASK] <unk> five that i heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck[MASK] and this is what i saw when i looked out of the window[MASK] this is the dead duck it flew against the window it 's laying dead on its belly[MASK] but next to the dead duck is a live duck[MASK] and please pay attention[MASK] both are of the male sex[MASK] and then this happened the live duck mounted the dead duck and started to copulate[MASK] well i 'm a biologist i 'm an ornithologist i said something 's wrong here one is dead one[MASK] <unk> is alive that must be necrophilia[MASK] i look both are of the male sex homosexual necrophilia[MASK] so i laughter[MASK] i took my camera i took my notebook[MASK] took a chair and started to observe this behavior[MASK] after seventy five minutes[MASK] <unk> i had seen enough and i got hungry[MASK] and i wanted to go home[MASK] so i went out[MASK] collected the duck and before i put it in the freezer i checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex[MASK] and here 's a rare[MASK] <unk> so it was indeed[MASK] of the male sex it 's a rare picture because there are ten thousand species of birds[MASK] and only three hundred possess a penis the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard anas platyrhynchos aves anatidae[MASK] i knew i 'd seen something special but[MASK] it took me six years to decide to publish[MASK] <unk> it 's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine[MASK] but to share this among your peers is something different i didn 't have the framework so after six years my friends and colleagues urged me to publish so i published the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard[MASK] and here 's the situation again[MASK] a is my office b is the place where the duck hit the glass and c is[MASK] <unk> where i watched it[MASK] and here are the ducks again[MASK] as you probably know in science[MASK] when you write a kind of special paper only six or seven people read it laughter[MASK] but then something good happened i got a phone call from a person called marc[MASK] <unk> abrahams and he told me you 've won a prize with your duck paper the ig nobel prize[MASK] and the ig nobel prize laughter applause the[MASK] ig nobel prize[MASK] honors research that first makes people laugh and then makes them think[MASK] with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in[MASK] <unk> science that 's a good thing so i accepted the prize laughter[MASK] i went[MASK] let me remind you that marc abrahams didn 't call me from stockholm he called me from cambridge massachusetts so i traveled to[MASK] boston to cambridge[MASK] and i went to this wonderful ig nobel prize ceremony held at harvard university and this ceremony[MASK] is a very nice experience[MASK] real nobel laureates hand you the prize that 's the first thing[MASK] and there are nine other winners who get prizes here 's one of my fellow winners that 's charles paxton[MASK] who won the two thousand biology prize for his paper courtship behavior[MASK] of ostriches towards[MASK] <unk> humans under farming conditions in britain laughter and[MASK] i think there are one or two more ig nobel prize winners in this room[MASK] dan where are you dan ariely[MASK] applause for dan applause[MASK] dan won his prize[MASK] <unk> in medicine for demonstrating that high priced fake medicine works better than low priced fake medicine laughter so here[MASK] 's my one minute of fame my acceptance speech[MASK] and here[MASK] <unk> is its first time on the u s west coast i 'm going to pass it around laughter[MASK] yeah[MASK] you can pass it around please note it 's a museum specimen but there 's no chance you 'll get the avian flu[MASK] after winning this prize my life changed in the first place[MASK] <unk> people started to send me all kinds of duck related things and i got a real nice collection[MASK] more importantly[MASK] people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior and believe me if there 's an[MASK] <unk> animal misbehaving on this planet i know about it laughter[MASK] this is[MASK] a moose[MASK] it 's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison this is in montana two thousand and eight[MASK] this is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish[MASK] <unk> this is the netherlands two thousand and eleven[MASK] these are[MASK] cane toads in australia[MASK] this is roadkill please note that this is necrophilia it 's remarkable the position the missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom[MASK] these are pigeons in rotterdam[MASK] <unk> barn swallows in hong kong two thousand and four[MASK] this is a turkey in[MASK] wisconsin on the premises of the ethan allen juvenile correctional institution[MASK] it took all day and the prisoners had a great time[MASK] so what does this mean i mean the question i ask myself[MASK] <unk> myself[MASK] why does this happen in nature well what i concluded from[MASK] reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant[MASK] and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation at least i thought it was till i got these slides[MASK] and here you see a dead duck it 's been there for three days and it 's laying on its back[MASK] so there goes my theory of necrophilia[MASK] another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds this is mad max a blackbird who lives in rotterdam[MASK] the only thing this bird did was fly against[MASK] <unk> this window from two thousand and four to two thousand and eight day in and day out here he goes and here 's a short video[MASK] <unk> he sees an intruder in his territory and it 's coming all the time and he 's there so there is no end to it[MASK] and i thought in the beginning i studied this bird for a couple of years that well shouldn 't the brain of this bird be damaged[MASK] it 's not i i show you here some slides some frames from the video[MASK] and at the last moment before he hits the glass he puts his feet in front and then he bangs[MASK] <unk> against the glass[MASK] so i 'll conclude to invite you all to dead duck day that 's on june five every year at five minutes to six in the afternoon[MASK] we come together at the natural history museum in rotterdam[MASK] the duck comes out of the museum and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from[MASK] colliding with windows[MASK] and as you know or as you may may not know this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world in the u s alone a billion birds die[MASK] in collision with glass buildings[MASK] and when it 's over we go to a chinese restaurant[MASK] and we have a six course duck dinner[MASK] so i hope to see you[MASK] next year[MASK] in rotterdam the netherlands for dead duck day thank you applause oh sorry[MASK] may i have my duck back please[MASK]
