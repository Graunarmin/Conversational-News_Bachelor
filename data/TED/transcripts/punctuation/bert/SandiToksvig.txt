 <unk> excited to be here everything in america is so much bigger than in europe look at me i am huge [MASK] it 's fantastic and ted talks ted talks are where[MASK] <unk> everybody has great ideas so the question is where do those great ideas come from well[MASK] it 's a little bit of debate but it 's generally reckoned that the average person that 's me has about fifty thousand thoughts a day which is a lot until you realize <unk>[MASK] <unk> that ninety five percent of them are the same ones you had the day before [MASK] and a lot of mine are really[MASK] <unk> i know i must clean the floor <unk> oh i forgot to walk the dog my most popular don 't eat that cookie [MASK] laughter so ninety five percent repetition that leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day to actually think something new [MASK] <unk> my new thoughts are useless the other day i was watching some sports on television and i was trying to decide why i just don 't engage with it some of it i find curious this is odd do you[MASK] think it would be worth being that flexible just to be able to see your heel at that angle [MASK] and here 's the thing i 'm never going to be able to relate to that because i 'm never going to be able to do it ok[MASK] but i 'll tell you the truth the truth is i have never been any good at sport <unk> ok <unk> i 've reached that wonderful age when all my friends say oh i wish i was as fit as i was when i was eighteen [MASK] and i always feel rather smug then [MASK] i 'm exactly as fit as i was when[MASK] <unk> i couldn 't run then i 'm certainly not going to do it now [MASK] laughter so then i had[MASK] my new idea <unk> why not engage people like me in sport <unk> i think what the world needs now is the olympics for people with zero athletic ability [MASK] oh it would be so much more[MASK] <unk> it 's a terrible[MASK] idea <unk> and[MASK] i also know why i don 't engage with sport when i watch it on television it 's because probably[MASK] ninety seven percent of it is about men running and men kicking things men trying to look[MASK] neatly packaged in lycra there is[MASK] <unk> is so little female sport on television that a young woman watching might be forgiven for thinking and how can i put this nicely that[MASK] the male member is the very lever you need to get yourself off the couch and onto a sports ground [MASK] the inequalities in sport[MASK] <unk> so this is what happens to me <unk> i have a brand new idea <unk> and immediately i come back to an old one the fact is there is not now <unk> nor has there ever been in the whole of <unk>[MASK] <unk> history a single country in the world where women have equality with men not one one hundred and ninety six countries it hasn 't happened in the whole of evolution so here is a picture of evolution[MASK] <unk> we women are not even in it [MASK] it 's a wonder men have been able to evolve quite so brilliantly so [MASK] it bugs me and i know i should do something about it but i 'm busy ok i have[MASK] <unk> i 've got three kids i 've got an elderly mom in fact if i 'm honest with you one of the reasons i came out here is because ted talks said i could have fifteen minutes to myself and i never have that much time so i 'm[MASK] busy and anyway i already had a go at changing the world here 's the thing ok <unk> everybody has inside[MASK] <unk> themselves what i call an activation button [MASK] it 's the button that gets pressed when you think i must do something about this it gets pressed for all sorts of reasons maybe you face some kind of inequality or you 've come across an injustice of some <unk>[MASK] <unk> kind sometimes an illness strikes or you 're born in some way disadvantaged or perhaps underprivileged <unk> <unk> so i was born gay ok i 've always known i don 't think my family were the least bit surprised [MASK] inside i genuinely believed that i looked like clint eastwood <unk> [MASK] so my activation button was pressed when i had my kids three wonderful kids [MASK] born to my <unk> then partner now here 's the thing i work on television in britain by the[MASK] <unk> they were born i was already hosting my own shows and working in the public eye i love what i do <unk> but i love my kids more[MASK] and i didn 't want them to grow up with a secret one thousand nine hundred and ninety four [MASK] when my son my youngest was born there was not as far as i was aware a single out gay woman in british public life <unk> [MASK] i don 't think secrets are a good thing i think they are a cancer of the soul <unk> so i decided to come out[MASK] everybody warned me[MASK] <unk> that i would never work again <unk> but i decided it was absolutely worth the risk <unk> well it was hell[MASK] <unk> in britain we have a particularly vicious section of the right wing press and they went nuts <unk> and their hatred stirred up the less stable elements of society <unk> [MASK] and we got death threats enough death threats that i had to take the kids into hiding <unk> and we had to have[MASK] police protection[MASK] <unk> and i promise you there were many moments in the still of the night when i was terrified by what i had done[MASK] eventually the dust settled against all expectation i carried on working <unk> [MASK] and my kids were and continue to be absolutely fantastic i remember when my son was six he had a friend over to play they were in the next room i could hear them chatting the friend said to my son[MASK] <unk> little anxious to hear so i leant in to hear and my son said it 's fantastic because if one of them 's sick you 've still got another one to cook for you [MASK] so my activation button for gay equality was pressed and along with many many others i campaigned for years[MASK] <unk> for gay rights and in particular the right to marry the person that i love in the end we succeeded <unk> and in two thousand and fourteen on the day that the law was changed i married my wife who i love very much indeed we didn[MASK] 't do it in a quiet way we did it on the stage at the royal festival hall in london[MASK] <unk> it was a great event the hall seats two and a half thousand people[MASK] <unk> we invited one hundred and fifty family and friends then i let it be known to the public anybody who wanted to come and celebrate <unk> please come and join us it would be free to anybody who wanted to come[MASK] two and half thousand people turned up [MASK] every kind of person you can imagine gays straights <unk> rabbis nuns married people black white the whole of humanity was there and i remember standing on that[MASK] <unk> and i[MASK] genuinely thought my activation days were over ok so every year in that same hall i host a fantastic concert[MASK] to celebrate international women 's day <unk> we gather the world 's only all female orchestra <unk> we play fantastic[MASK] <unk> music by forgotten or overlooked women composers we have amazing conductors it 's marin alsop there from baltimore conducting petula clark singing and i give a lecture on women 's history <unk>[MASK] i love to gather inspirational stories from the past and pass them on too often i think[MASK] for the right for women in britain to vote <unk> and their slogan was deeds not words and boy they succeeded because women did indeed get the vote in <unk>[MASK] <unk> giving this talk about this and as i 'm talking what i realized is this was not a history lecture i was giving this was not something where the job was[MASK] <unk> this was something where there was so much left to do <unk> nowhere in the world for example do women have equal representation in positions of power ok let 's take a very quick <unk>[MASK] <unk> look at the top one hundred companies in the london stock exchange in two thousand and sixteen top one hundred companies [MASK] <unk> there are more men called john running ftse one hundred companies [MASK] than there are women there are fourteen run by men called[MASK] <unk> why does it matter <unk> well it 's that pesky business of the gender pay gap <unk> nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men and <unk>[MASK] <unk> that is never going to change unless we have more women at the top in the boardroom we have plenty of laws <unk> the equal pay act in britain was passed in[MASK] <unk> many many women who from early november until the end of the year by comparison to their male colleagues are effectively working for free[MASK] in fact the world economic forum estimates that women will finally get equal pay[MASK] <unk> the day before i came out to give my talk the world economic forum revised it so that 's good because that 's a terrible two thousand one hundred and thirty three do you know what they revised it to[MASK] yeah another fifty three years ok <unk> [MASK] we are not going to get equal pay in my grandchildren 's grandchildren 's lives under the current system <unk> and i have[MASK] <unk> waited long enough i 've waited long enough in my own business in two thousand and sixteen i became the very first woman on british television to host a <unk>[MASK] panel show isn 't that great wonderful i 'm thrilled but but two thousand and[MASK] sixteen <unk> the first television 's been around for eighty[MASK] <unk> may be television 's not so important but it 's kind of symptomatic isn 't it two thousand and sixteen the un were looking for a brand new ambassador[MASK] to represent women 's empowerment and gender equality and who did they choose <unk> wonder woman[MASK] <unk> yes they chose a cartoon ok [MASK] because no woman was up to the job[MASK] <unk> the representation of women in positions of power is shockingly low it 's true in congress <unk> and it 's certainly true in the british parliament in two thousand and fifteen <unk> the number of men elected <unk>[MASK] to the parliament that year was greater than the total number of women who have ever been members of parliament and why does it matter here 's the thing if they 're <unk>[MASK] <unk> not at the table literally in britain at that table helping to make the laws do not be surprised if the female perspective is[MASK] it 's a great role model for young people to see a woman in charge in two thousand and sixteen britain got its second female prime minister theresa may[MASK] came to power the day she came to power she was challenged just do one thing <unk> do one thing in the first one hundred days that you 're in office[MASK] to try and improve lives for women in britain <unk> and what did she do <unk> nothing <unk>[MASK] <unk> 's much too busy cleaning up the mess the boys made [MASK] even having a female leader they always find something better to do than to sort out the pesky issue of inequality <unk> so i keep talking about equality like <unk>[MASK] <unk> it matters does it <unk> well let 's take a very quick look at the stem industries ok so science technology engineering and mathematics pretty much important in every single aspect[MASK] <unk> glass ceiling in the stem industries[MASK] what if the cure for cancer or the answer the global warming lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress <unk> [MASK] so i thought all these things <unk> and i knew i had to do[MASK] <unk> and i spoke to my wonderful friend brilliant journalist catherine mayer in britain <unk> and we rather foolishly and i i suspect there was wine involved [MASK] we decided to found a brand new political party because here 's the critical thing the one place women and men are absolutely equal[MASK] is at the ballot box we had no idea what we were doing we didn 't know how complicated it was to start a political party <unk> i thought it can 't be[MASK] <unk> that difficult men have been doing it for years [MASK] so we started[MASK] by calling it the women 's equality party and straightaway people said to me why did you call it that[MASK] yes because bras are famously made of flammable material [MASK] that 's why all women spark when they walk here[MASK] 's quick history sidebar for you no woman ever burnt her bra[MASK] <unk> it 's a story made up by a journalist thank goodness journalism has improved since then <unk> so [MASK] i announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview <unk> and straightaway the emails started coming first hundreds then thousands and thousands from every age group from the very <unk>[MASK] <unk> young to women in their ' 90s to hundreds of wonderful men people wrote and said please can i help please can i visit you at party headquarters[MASK] <unk> was a wonderful tight group of fabulous friends trying to answer emails pretty much[MASK] in our pajamas [MASK] we were all busy many of us had careers many of us had children but we did what women do <unk> and we shared the work [MASK] and almost instantly we agreed on certain fundamental things <unk> first thing we want[MASK] to be the only political party in the world whose main aim was to no longer need to exist <unk> that 's a fantastic[MASK] we wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning we wanted people from the left from the right from the middle every age group <unk> [MASK] because the whole point was to work with a simple agenda let 's get equality in every aspect of our lives and when we 're finished let 's go home and get the other chores done [MASK] <unk> have this but in britain we have two major political parties they 're the dinosaurs of politics and how they speak to each other is shameful and poisonous i 'm[MASK] sure you 've never had that kind of name calling [MASK] and lying here wouldn 't it be great if just one politician said do you know my opponent has a point let 's see if we can 't work together[MASK] <unk> and let 's get more women into politics <unk> ok let 's immediately get more women into politics by being the only political party to offer free childcare to our candidates so they can get out of the house and start campaigning [MASK] within ten months[MASK] <unk> we had more than seventy branches of our party across the uk <unk> we stood candidates for election in london scotland and wales in may two thousand and sixteen one in twenty people <unk>[MASK] <unk> voted for our candidate for london mayor <unk> and when the men in the race saw how many votes we were attracting wonder of wonders they began to talk about the need to tackle gender equality[MASK] <unk> know i 've been promised change since i was a child it was always coming women were going to stand shoulder to shoulder with men all i got were empty promises and disappointment enough disappointment[MASK] <unk> to found a political party but here is my new idea for today this is my five percent ok <unk> and this one is really good the fact is this is not enough it is not enough to found one political party for equality in a single country what[MASK] <unk> we need is a seismic change in the global political landscape and the wonderful thing about the model we have created is that it would work anywhere it would work in <unk>[MASK] <unk> america it would work in australia it would work in india it 's like we 've made the perfect recipe anybody can cook it and it 's good for everybody[MASK] <unk> millions of women across the world to say that 's enough to the traditional battles of politics to say stop the bickering let 's get the work done we could literally change the world <unk> and i want that[MASK] <unk> want it for our sons because the fact is equality is better for everyone come on people let 's activate let 's change the world <unk> i know[MASK]
