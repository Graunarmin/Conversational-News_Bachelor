 <unk> i think the beautiful malin [ akerman ] put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury <unk> [MASK] ladies and gentlemen and more importantly mo bros and mo sistas for[MASK] seventeen minutes i 'm going to share with you my movember journey <unk> [MASK] and how through that journey <unk> we 've redefined charity <unk> [MASK] we 're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world [MASK] and i hope <unk> through that process [MASK] that i inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place[MASK] <unk> the most common question i get asked and i 'm going to answer it now so i don 't have to do it over drinks tonight <unk> is how did this come about how did movember <unk>[MASK] <unk> normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause <unk> they then go on to create an event <unk> and beyond that a foundation to support[MASK] <unk> pretty much in every case that 's how a charity[MASK] starts [MASK] not so with movember [MASK] movember started in a very traditional australian way it was on a sunday afternoon i was with my brother and a mate having a few beers <unk> and i was watching the world go by had[MASK] a few more beers and the conversation turned to ' 70s fashion [MASK] and how everything manages to come back into style <unk> and a few more beers i said there has to be some stuff that hasn 't come back[MASK] <unk> back [MASK] then one more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache <unk> why hasn 't that made a comeback [MASK] so then there was a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back [MASK] so in australia mo[MASK] <unk> is slang for mustache <unk> so we renamed the month of november movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today <unk> and they are start the month <unk>[MASK] rock a mustache not a beard not a goatee a mustache for the thirty days of november <unk> and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache themed party [MASK] and award a prize for the best and of course the worst[MASK] <unk> now trust me when you 're growing a mustache back in two thousand and three and there were thirty of us back then and this was before the ironic[MASK] hipster mustache movement[MASK] it created a lot of controversy [MASK] so my boss wouldn 't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who 's no longer my girlfriend [MASK] hated it parents would[MASK] <unk> shuffle kids away from us [MASK] but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey <unk> and[MASK] we had a lot of fun and in two thousand and four i said to the guys that was so much fun <unk> we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year[MASK] we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer and[MASK] we thought you know what there 's nothing for men 's health <unk> [MASK] why is that <unk> <unk> why can 't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men 's health and i started to research that topic <unk> and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed[MASK] <unk> but there was nothing for this cause <unk> so we married growing a mustache[MASK] with prostate cancer [MASK] and then we created our tagline <unk> which is changing the face of men 's health and that eloquently describes the challenge changing your appearance for the thirty days and also the outcome that <unk>[MASK] <unk> we 're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health <unk> having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face [MASK] <unk> the ceo of the prostate cancer foundation i said to him i 've got the most amazing idea that 's going to transform your organization [MASK] laughter and i didn 't want to share with him the idea over the phone so i convinced him to meet with me for coffee in melbourne in two thousand and four <unk> [MASK] and we sat down and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia raising awareness for this cause <unk> [MASK] and funds for his organization and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that[MASK] i said we 're going to come together at the end we 're going to have a mustache themed party we 're going to have djs <unk> we 're going to celebrate life <unk> and we 're going to change the face of men 's health [MASK] and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he[MASK] said adam that 's a really novel idea <unk> [MASK] but we 're an ultraconservative organization <unk> we can 't have anything to do with you [MASK] so i paid for coffee that day[MASK] and[MASK] his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we 'll gladly take it [MASK] so my lesson that year was persistence <unk> and we persisted <unk> and we got four hundred and fifty[MASK] <unk> and we donated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they 'd ever received <unk> [MASK] so from that day forward <unk> my life has become about a mustache <unk> every day this morning i wake up and go my life is about a mustache[MASK] <unk> so in two thousand and five the campaign[MASK] got more momentum was more successful in australia and then new zealand <unk> [MASK] and then in two thousand and six we came to a pivotal point it was[MASK] consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends[MASK] that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level [MASK] it 's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches [MASK] let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in[MASK] <unk> not even the prostate cancer foundation <unk> who we 'd raised about one point two million dollars for at that stage [MASK] so again we persisted <unk> and foster 's brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever[MASK] sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job i did consulting on the side <unk> and leading into movember[MASK] two thousand and six we 'd run through all[MASK] <unk> run through all the money i had and essentially we had no money left <unk> and we 'd convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies <unk> whatnot to delay their billing until december [MASK] so we 'd racked up at this stage about six hundred thousand dollars worth of[MASK] debt <unk> so if movember two thousand and six didn 't happen the four founders <unk> well <unk> we would 've been broke <unk> we would 've been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches[MASK] <unk> you know what if that 's the worst thing that happens <unk> so what we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks [MASK] then in early two thousand and seven a really interesting thing happened [MASK] we had mo bros from from canada from the u s and from the u k emailing us and[MASK] calling us and saying hey there 's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries <unk> [MASK] so we thought why not let 's do it <unk> [MASK] so i cold called the ceo of prostate cancer canada <unk> and i said to him i have this most amazing concept it[MASK] 's going to transform your organization [MASK] i don 't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to toronto so i flew here met down on front street east <unk> and we sat in the boardroom <unk> and i said[MASK] <unk> vision[MASK] of getting men growing mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization [MASK] and he looked at me and laughed and said adam <unk> sounds like a really novel idea but we 're an ultraconservative organization [MASK] i 've heard this before i know how it goes <unk> [MASK] but he said we will partner with you <unk> but we 're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work[MASK] so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country the u s and the u k and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely <unk>[MASK] <unk> more money globally than we could just in australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure and we 're not about finding an australian cure or a canadian[MASK] <unk> about finding the cure <unk> [MASK] so in two thousand and seven <unk> we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage[MASK] for the campaign it wasn 't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia[MASK] and new zealand at that stage <unk> so that year really taught us the importance of being patient[MASK] and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets[MASK] <unk> but what i 'm really pleased to say is in two thousand and ten movember became a truly global movement canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world <unk> [MASK] last year we had four hundred and fifty thousand mo bros spread across the world and together we raised[MASK] <unk> and that makes movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world <unk> [MASK] and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches [MASK] laughter and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [MASK] our ambassadors are the mo bros and[MASK] <unk> the mo sistas and i think that 's been fundamental to our success <unk> [MASK] we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way <unk> [MASK] so now i live in in los angeles because the prostate cancer foundation of the u s is based there <unk> and i always get asked by the media down there because[MASK] <unk> single person every single mo bro and mo sista that participates in movember is our celebrity ambassador <unk> and that is so so important and fundamental to our success [MASK] now what i want[MASK] <unk> share with you is[MASK] one of my most touching[MASK] movember moments <unk> and it happened here in toronto last year at the end of the campaign [MASK] i was out with a team it was the end of movember we 'd had a great campaign and to be honest we 'd had our fair share of beer that night <unk> but i said you know what i think we 've got one more bar left in us [MASK] so we piled into a[MASK] <unk> i know it 's about men 's health i know it 's about prostate cancer <unk> but this is for breast cancer and i said [MASK] <unk> last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka <unk> because we couldn 't afford proper treatment for her and he said [MASK] this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi <unk> [MASK] and i didn 't tell him who i was because i didn 't think it was appropriate and i just shook his hand and i said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache[MASK] <unk> having a joke [MASK] it 's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way <unk> and being significant in their own life [MASK] for us now at movember <unk> [MASK] we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact <unk> [MASK] awareness and education <unk> [MASK] survivor support programs and research[MASK] <unk> now we always focus naturally on how much we raise because it 's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education[MASK] is more important than the funds we raise because i know that is changing and saving lives today and it 's probably best exampled[MASK] by a young guy that i met at south by southwest in austin texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember[MASK] <unk> but i went home for thanksgiving dinner <unk> and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on [MASK] and we talked i talked to them about movember <unk> and then after that my dad[MASK] came up to me and at the age of <unk>[MASK] for the first time ever i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men 's health <unk> i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer[MASK] and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn 't know that <unk> and he hadn 't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate[MASK] <unk> so those conversations getting men engaged in this at[MASK] whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise [MASK] now to the funds we raise <unk> and research and how we 're redefining research [MASK] we fund prostate cancer foundations now in thirteen countries <unk> [MASK] we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently[MASK] we realized there 's a real lack of collaboration going on[MASK] even within institutions let alone nationally let alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is cancer research the world over [MASK] and so we said right we 'd redefined charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that <unk> [MASK] <unk> so what we did was we created a global action plan and we 're taking ten percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund and[MASK] we 've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund <unk> [MASK] and they come together each year and identify the number one priority <unk> [MASK] and that <unk> last year was getting a better screening test <unk> so they identified that as a priority and then they 've got and recruited now three hundred researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially[MASK] <unk> same topic <unk> so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate[MASK] and bringing them together <unk> and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes <unk> [MASK] and that 's how we 're redefining[MASK] the research world <unk>[MASK] <unk> what i know about my movember journey is that with a really creative idea [MASK] with passion with persistence <unk> and a lot of patience [MASK] four mates four mustaches can inspire a room full of people <unk> and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city <unk> and that city is melbourne my[MASK] <unk> and that city can go on and inspire a state <unk> and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men 's health[MASK]
