 <unk> let me introduce to you rezero this little fellow was developed by a group of ten undergraduate students at the autonomous systems laboratory at <unk>[MASK] <unk> robot belongs to a family[MASK] <unk> of robots called ballbots[MASK] instead of wheels a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball [MASK] the main characteristics of such a system is that there 's one sole contact point to the ground <unk> this means that the robot is inherently unstable it[MASK] 's like when i am trying to stand on one foot [MASK] you might ask yourself what 's the usefulness of a robot that 's unstable <unk> now we 'll explain that in a second [MASK] <unk> let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor [MASK] he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately [MASK] this happens one hundred and sixty times per second and if anything fails in this process rezero would immediately fall to the ground [MASK] now to move and to balance rezero needs to turn the ball[MASK] <unk> the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time [MASK] due to his instability rezero is always in motion now here 's the trick <unk> [MASK] it 's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [ dynamically ] [MASK] let 's play a little you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot[MASK] <unk> 's trying to maintain his position [MASK] for the next demo i 'd like you to introduce to my colleagues michael on the computer and thomas who 's helping me onstage [MASK] in the next mode <unk> rezero is passive and we can move him around [MASK] with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity[MASK] can also make him spin[MASK] in the next mode <unk> we can get rezero to follow a person <unk> [MASK] he 's now keeping a constant distance to thomas[MASK] this works with a laser sensor that 's mounted on top of rezero [MASK] with the same method we can also get him to circle a person <unk>[MASK] we call this the[MASK] <unk> what 's the use of this technology[MASK] <unk> for now it 's an experiment <unk> but let me show you some possible future applications[MASK] <unk> rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way [MASK] in a hospital this device could be used to carry around medical equipment [MASK] due to the ballbot system it has a very small footprint and it 's also easy to move around and of course who wouldn 't like to take a ride on one of these[MASK] <unk> these are more practical applications <unk> but there 's also a certain beauty within this technology[MASK] <unk> and[MASK]
