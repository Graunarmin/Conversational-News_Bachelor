 <unk> i 'm a contemporary artist and i show in art galleries and museums[MASK] i show a number of photographs and films but i also make television programs books and some advertising[MASK] <unk> all with the same concept <unk> and it 's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture <unk> and the importance of the image celebrity is born of photography <unk>[MASK] i 'm going to start with[MASK] how i started with this concept seven years ago <unk> when princess diana died [MASK] there was a sort of a standstill in britain the moment of her death and people[MASK] decided to mourn[MASK] her death in a sort of mass way[MASK] fascinated by this phenomenon <unk> so i wondered could one erase the image of diana actually quite crudely and physically <unk> so i got a gun and started to shoot at the image of diana <unk> [MASK] but i couldn 't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from[MASK] public psyche momentum was being built the press wrote about her death in rather i felt pornographic[MASK] ways like which bit of artery left which bit of body and how did she die in the back of the car and i was intrigued by this sort of[MASK] mass voyeurism <unk> so i made these rather gory images <unk> i[MASK] went on[MASK] wondering whether i could actually replace her image <unk> [MASK] so i got a look alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles[MASK] and[MASK] created something that was in or existed in the public imagination so people were wondering was she going to marry dodi was she in love with him was she pregnant did she want his baby was she pregnant when she died[MASK] <unk> so i created this image of[MASK] <unk> diana dodi and their imaginary mixed race child and this image[MASK] came out which caused a huge public outcry at the time <unk> i then went on to make[MASK] more comments on the media and press imagery <unk> so i started making reference to media imagery[MASK] made it grainy <unk> shot[MASK] <unk> through doorways and so on and so forth to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism [MASK] so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband <unk> and this was a sequence[MASK] of images <unk> [MASK] and this gets shown in art galleries like this as a sequence [MASK] and similarly with the di dodian baby imagery this is another art gallery installation i 'm particularly interested in[MASK] how you can 't rely on your own perception this is jane smith[MASK] and jo bloggs for instance but you think it 's camilla and the queen [MASK] and i 'm fascinated how what you think is real isn 't necessarily real <unk> and the camera can lie <unk> and it makes it very[MASK] <unk> the mass bombardment of imagery to[MASK] tell untruths <unk> so i continued to work on this project of how[MASK] photography seduces us[MASK] and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter <unk> and at the same time it removes us from the real[MASK] <unk> and this acts as a sort of titillating[MASK] thing so the photograph becomes this teaser and incites[MASK] desire and and voyeurism what you can 't have you want more in the photograph the real subject doesn 't exist so it makes you want that person more [MASK] and that is[MASK] <unk> celebrity magazines work now <unk> the more[MASK] pictures you see of these celebrities <unk> the more you feel you know them <unk> but you don 't know them and you want to know them further [MASK] of course the queen[MASK] goes to her stud often to watch her horses[MASK] <unk> watch her horses and[MASK] <unk> in england there 's an expression you can 't imagine the queen on the loo so i 'm trying to penetrate that well[MASK] here is the image[MASK] <unk> all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist[MASK] the press were writing about this[MASK] <unk> giving full pages about how terrible this was [MASK] which i found very interesting that it was going full[MASK] <unk> cycle i was making comments about the press and about how we know[MASK] facts and information only by media because we don 't know the real people very few of us know the real people[MASK] but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing effectively my filthy work <unk> so[MASK] <unk> these are broadsheets tabloids debates were being had all about this work films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work <unk> politicians were getting involved[MASK] all sorts of things great headlines [MASK] then suddenly[MASK] <unk> it started to get on front pages i was being asked and paid to do front covers suddenly i was becoming sort of acceptable <unk> which i found[MASK] also[MASK] <unk> one moment it was disgusting journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me <unk> saying my work was wonderful and the next minute[MASK] there were terrible headlines about me <unk> but then this changed[MASK] suddenly i then started to[MASK] work for magazines and newspapers this was for example an image that went into tatler this was[MASK] another newspaper image it was an april fool actually and to this[MASK] <unk> day some people think it 's[MASK] real i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day and they were saying there 's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill they thought it was real <unk> [MASK] i was exploring at the time the hyperbole of icons and[MASK] diana and marilyn and the importance of celebrity in our lives how they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing[MASK] and how that should happen[MASK] <unk> i explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself there 's me as diana i look like[MASK] the mass murderer myra hindley i think in this one and[MASK] me as the queen <unk> [MASK] i then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn the biggest icon of all and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so[MASK] <unk> forth and only showing certain angles to create a reality that obviously is completely constructed <unk> this[MASK] is the look alike so the crafting elements of this is[MASK] completely enormous she looks nothing like marilyn but by the time we 've made her up[MASK] and put wigs and makeup on she looks exactly like marilyn to the extent[MASK] <unk> that her husband couldn 't recognize her or recognize this look alike in these photographs which i find quite interesting so[MASK] all this work is getting shown in art galleries then i made a book i was also making a tv series for the bbc at the time <unk> stills from the tv series went into[MASK] this book <unk> but[MASK] <unk> there was a real legal problem because it looks real <unk> but how do you get over that because obviously it 's making a comment about our[MASK] culture[MASK] right right now that we can 't tell what 's real how do we know when we 're looking at something whether it 's real or not[MASK] <unk> so[MASK] from my point of view it 's important to publish it but at the same time it does cause a confusion intentional on my behalf but[MASK] <unk> problematic for any outlet that i 'm working with so[MASK] a big disclaimer is[MASK] put on everything that i do and i made narratives about all the european or brit[MASK] celebrities and comments about our public figures[MASK] <unk> tony blair get up to in private with his fashion guru <unk> and also dealing with the perceptions that are put about[MASK] obviously the british public i think would prefer william to[MASK] charles on the throne <unk> and it 's[MASK] that that wish or that desire that i suppose i 'm dealing with in my work i 'm not really interested in the celebrity[MASK] themselves <unk> i 'm interested in the the perception of the celebrity [MASK] <unk> i did an advertising campaign for schweppes which is coca cola and so that was[MASK] very interesting in terms of[MASK] the legalities it 's highly commercial <unk> but it was a difficulty for me because this is my artwork should i do advertising[MASK] <unk> i made sure the work[MASK] was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same <unk> but the meanings changed in the sense that[MASK] with the logo on you 're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that 's all you 're doing when you take the logo off you 're opening up the[MASK] <unk> when you are advertising[MASK] <unk> this image is quite interesting actually because i think we made it three years ago <unk> and it 's camilla in her wedding dress <unk> which <unk> again nearly got re used now[MASK] <unk> recently prior to her[MASK] wedding tony blair and cherie and again[MASK] <unk> legalities we had to be very careful it 's obviously a very big commercial company and so this little shh it 's not really them was[MASK] put on the side of the imagery [MASK] and margaret thatcher visiting jeffery archer in jail <unk> i then was asked by selfridges to do[MASK] a series of windows for them <unk> so i built a sauna bath[MASK] <unk> in one of their windows and created little scenes[MASK] live scenes with look alikes inside the windows and the windows were all steamed up so it 's tony blair reading and practicing his speech i 've got them doing yoga inside <unk>[MASK] <unk> there with carole caplin sven making out with ulrika jonsson who he was having an affair with[MASK] <unk> this was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper broadsheets and tabloids it was a bit of <unk>[MASK] <unk> a road stopper <unk> which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the[MASK] <unk> so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly all this imagery and the press were[MASK] interviewing and i was signing my book [MASK] further imagery i 'm making a new book now with taschen that i 'm working on really for[MASK] a sort of global market my previous book was only for the u k [MASK] <unk> i suppose i come from a sort of <unk>[MASK] <unk> background with serious intent <unk> and then suddenly my work is funny <unk> and[MASK] i think it doesn 't really matter that[MASK] my work is considered humorous in a way i think it 's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery[MASK] <unk> it 's an extremely fast way of getting information it 's extremely difficult if it 's constructed correctly and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery imagery <unk>[MASK] this image for example is sort of <unk>[MASK] because it exactly sums up what elton may be doing in private <unk> and also what might be happening with saddam hussein and[MASK] george bush[MASK] <unk> reading the koran upside down [MASK] for example <unk> george bush target practice shooting at bin laden and michael moore and then you change the photograph he 's shooting at and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible laughter[MASK] tony blair[MASK] being used as a mounting block[MASK] <unk> and rumsfeld and bush laughing with some abu ghraib photos behind and[MASK] the seriousness [MASK] or the intellect of bush [MASK] and also commenting on the behind the scenes well as we know now what goes on in prisons [MASK] and in fact george bush and tony blair are having great fun[MASK] during all of this [MASK] <unk> based on the perception we have of the celebrities [MASK] what jack nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life and the fact that he tried to he had a bit of road rage and[MASK] golf clubbed a driver[MASK] the other day i mean it 's extremely difficult to find these look alikes so i 'm constantly going up to people[MASK] <unk> people to come and be in one of my photographs or films and sometimes asking the real celebrity mistaking them for someone who just looks like[MASK] the real person which is highly embarrassing laughter[MASK] i 've also been working with the guardian on a topical basis a page a week[MASK] in their newspaper which has been very interesting working topically so <unk> jamie oliver and school dinners[MASK] bush and blair having difficulty getting alongside muslim culture <unk> the whole of the hunting issue and the royal family refusing to[MASK] stop hunting[MASK] and the tsunami issues and obviously harry blair 's views on gordon brown <unk> which i find very interesting[MASK] <unk> condi and bush this image i 've decided to show[MASK] having a reservation about it i made it[MASK] a year ago[MASK] <unk> and just how meanings change and there were a terrible thing that has happened <unk> but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that [MASK] that 's why this image was made one year ago[MASK] <unk> leave you with these clips to have[MASK] <unk> and[MASK] the[MASK]
