 <unk> drawing of the brain it[MASK] 's a diagram of the visual system <unk> and some things look very familiar today <unk> two eyes at the bottom <unk> optic nerve flowing out from the back[MASK] <unk> 's a very large nose that doesn 't seem to be connected to anything in particular <unk> [MASK] and if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system you 'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years <unk> and that 's because today we can see what 's inside of the brain rather than just looking at its overall shape <unk> [MASK] imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works[MASK] and all you could see was a keyboard[MASK] <unk> a mouse a screen [MASK] you really would be kind of out of luck you want to be able to open it up crack it open look at the wiring inside and up until a little more than a century ago <unk> nobody was able to do that with <unk>[MASK] <unk> the brain nobody had had a glimpse of the brain 's wiring and that 's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it put it under even a very powerful microscope there 's nothing there it 's gray <unk> formless there 's no structure it won 't tell you anything [MASK] <unk> new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring the computer was cracked open [MASK] so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain and it works in a very particular way instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue [MASK] it somehow only stains about one percent of them it clears the forest reveals the trees inside if everything had been labeled[MASK] nothing would have been visible so somehow it shows what 's there <unk> spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramon y cajal who 's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience applied this golgi stain which yields data which looks like this[MASK] <unk> and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell the neuron and if you 're thinking of the brain as a computer this is the transistor <unk> [MASK] and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don 't operate[MASK] alone but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer [MASK] today a century later when researchers want to visualize neurons they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them <unk> and there 's several ways of doing this but one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein <unk> [MASK] now green fluorescent protein which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent[MASK] <unk> is very useful because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell that cell will glow green[MASK] or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein you get a cell to glow many different colors <unk> and so coming back to the brain this is from a genetically engineered mouse called <unk>[MASK] brainbow and it 's so called of course because all of these neurons are are glowing different colors <unk> [MASK] <unk> of neurons molecules rather than the entire cell [MASK] and there 's several ways of doing this but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies and you 're familiar of course with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system <unk> but it <unk>[MASK] <unk> turns out that they 're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules like for example the coat protein of a virus that 's invading the body <unk> [MASK] recognize specific molecules inside of the brain recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually [MASK] and a lot of the images i 've been showing you here are very beautiful but they 're also very powerful they have great explanatory power this for example is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain[MASK] <unk> and you 've heard of serotonin of course in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety you 've heard of ssris which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases <unk> and in order <unk>[MASK] <unk> to understand how serotonin works it 's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is and antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question[MASK] <unk> tissue were developed and[MASK]
