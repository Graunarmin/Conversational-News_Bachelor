 <unk> amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today we think of financial and economic primarily the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue[MASK] our ability to address modern[MASK] conflicts as they are to go to the source of what they 're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them <unk> [MASK] we who are diplomats we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states and i can tell you our agenda is full [MASK] there is trade there is disarmament <unk> there is cross border relations <unk> but the picture is changing <unk> [MASK] and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene <unk> [MASK] we loosely call them[MASK] <unk> groups [MASK] they may represent social religious political economic military realities <unk> and we struggle with how to deal with them <unk> [MASK] the rules of engagement how to talk when to talk <unk> and how to deal with them <unk> [MASK] let me show you a slide here which illustrates[MASK] <unk> the character of conflicts since one thousand nine hundred and forty six until today you see the green[MASK] is a traditional interstate conflict <unk> the ones we used to read about [MASK] the red is modern conflict conflicts within states [MASK] these are quite different and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy [MASK] and the core of these key actors are groups[MASK] who represent different interests[MASK] <unk> countries <unk> and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries <unk> so in a way it is everybody 's business[MASK] another acknowledgment we 've seen during these years <unk> [MASK] recent years is that very few of these domestic interstate intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily <unk>[MASK] <unk> they may have to be dealt with with military means <unk> but they cannot be solved by military means they need political solutions <unk> [MASK] and we therefore have a problem because they escape traditional diplomacy and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them <unk> [MASK] plus during the last decade we 've been in the mode[MASK] where dealing with with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous[MASK] <unk> either you were with us or against us <unk> it was black or white <unk> [MASK] and groups are very often immediately label terrorists <unk> and who would talk to terrorists <unk> [MASK] the west as i would see it comes out of that decade weakened <unk> because we didn 't understand the group <unk> [MASK] so we 've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others now[MASK] i 'm not naive[MASK] <unk> you cannot talk to everybody all the time and there are times you should walk <unk> [MASK] and sometimes military intervention is necessary i happen to believe that libya was necessary[MASK] and that military intervention in afghanistan was also necessary and my country relies on its security[MASK] through military alliance that 's clear <unk> but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict[MASK] <unk> let us turn to afghanistan [MASK] ten years after that military intervention that country is far from secure <unk> the situation to be honest is very serious <unk> [MASK] now again the military is necessary but the military is no[MASK] when i first came to afghanistan in two thousand and five as a foreign minister i met the commander of[MASK] <unk> the international troops <unk> and he told me that this can be won militarily minister <unk> we just have to persevere [MASK] now four com isaf 's later <unk> we hear a different message this cannot be won militarily <unk> [MASK] we need military presence but we need to move to politics [MASK] we can only solve this through a political solution <unk> and it is not us who will solve it afghans have to solve it [MASK] but then they need a different political process than the one they were given[MASK] in two thousand and one two thousand and two [MASK] they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues [MASK] everybody seems to agree with that it was very controversial to say three four five years ago <unk> now everybody agrees <unk> [MASK] but now as we prepare to talk <unk> we understand how little we know because we didn 't talk <unk> we didn[MASK] <unk> grasp what was going on [MASK] the international committee of the red cross the icrc is talking to everyone <unk> and it is doing so because it is neutral [MASK] and that 's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict[MASK] because they talk my point is that you don 't have to be neutral to talk[MASK] <unk> and you don 't have to agree when you sit down with the other side <unk> and you can always walk <unk> [MASK] but if you don 't talk <unk> you can 't engage the other side <unk> [MASK] and the other side which you 're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree <unk> [MASK] prime minister rabin said when he engaged the oslo process you don 't make peace with your[MASK] <unk> but it is necessary <unk> [MASK] let me go one step further this is tahrir square there 's a revolution going on [MASK] the arab spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter <unk> it will last for a long long time [MASK] and who knows what it will be called in the end that 's not the point [MASK] the point is that we are probably seeing for the first time in the history of the arab world a revolution[MASK] bottom up people 's revolution <unk> social groups are taking to the streets <unk> [MASK] and we find out in the west that we know very little about what 's happening <unk> [MASK] because we never talk to the people in these countries <unk> [MASK] most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups because they were terrorists <unk> [MASK] so now[MASK] <unk> that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution <unk> we find out how little we know [MASK] right now the discussion goes should we talk to the muslim brotherhood [MASK] should we talk to hamas <unk> if we talk to them <unk> we may legitimize them i think that is wrong [MASK] if you talk in the right way you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing <unk> and how can we tell[MASK] the muslim brotherhood <unk> as we should [MASK] that they must respect minority rights <unk> [MASK] if we don 't accept majority rights <unk> because they may turn out to be a majority how can we escape[MASK] if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don 't want to deal with the groups that are representative how will we ever be interlocutors[MASK] now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups <unk> [MASK] but talking can be done in different ways <unk> we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level [MASK] now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion there 's a big[MASK] <unk> with this so if we refuse to talk to these new groups[MASK] that are going to be dominating the news in years to come <unk> we will further radicalization <unk> [MASK] i believe we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel <unk> [MASK] and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards[MASK] <unk> if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states <unk> there are some rewards on the other side [MASK] the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this [MASK] and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising[MASK] and for one reason primarily <unk> and the reason is what happened in south[MASK] <unk> nelson mandela [MASK] when mandela came out of prison after twenty seven years of captivity <unk> [MASK] if he had told his people it 's time to take up the arms it 's time to fight he would have been followed <unk> [MASK] and i think the international community would have said fair enough <unk> it 's their right to fight now as you know mandela didn 't do that in his memoirs[MASK] <unk> he wrote that[MASK] he survived during those years of captivity captivity[MASK] because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being [MASK] also being a human being <unk> so he engaged a political process of dialogue [MASK] not as a strategy[MASK] of the weak[MASK] <unk> but as a strategy of the strong <unk> and he engaged talking profoundly[MASK] by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked <unk> [MASK] now south african friends will know that that was very painful <unk> so what can we learn from all of this dialogue is not easy[MASK] not between individuals not between groups not between governments but it is very necessary <unk> if we 're going to deal with political[MASK] of conflicts if we 're going to understand these new[MASK] groups which are coming from bottom up supported by technology which is available to all we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets[MASK] believing that we are doing interstate relations we have to connect with these profound changes[MASK] <unk> what is dialogue really about when i enter into dialogue <unk> i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view [MASK] that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values <unk> [MASK] i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side 's signals we need a lot more training on how to do that[MASK] and a lot more practice on how that can[MASK] 's easy sometimes just to walk <unk> [MASK] and sometimes you may need to fight <unk> and i wouldn 't say that that is the wrong thing in all circumstances sometimes you have to [MASK] but that strategy seldom takes you very far the alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue <unk> [MASK] and i believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy not only between states[MASK] <unk> but also within states <unk> we are seeing some new signs we could never have done the convention[MASK] against anti personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions[MASK] unless we had done diplomacy differently by engaging with civil society [MASK] all of a sudden ngos were not only standing in the streets <unk> crying their slogans <unk> but they were taking[MASK] <unk> partly because they represented the victims of these weapons <unk> [MASK] and they brought their knowledge <unk> and there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom up [MASK] this is perhaps a first element of a change [MASK] in the future <unk> i believe we should draw examples from these different[MASK] <unk> to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society [MASK] and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times climate change [MASK] how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem but part of the solution <unk> [MASK] it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are[MASK] <unk> heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations <unk> but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization <unk> [MASK] it 's crucial to understand i believe <unk> because of technology and because of globalization societies from bottom up [MASK] we as diplomats need to know the social capital[MASK] of communities what is it that makes people trust each other not[MASK] <unk> only between states but also within states [MASK] what is the legitimacy of diplomacy [MASK] of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups <unk> [MASK] the good thing is that we are not powerless <unk> we have never had[MASK] as many means[MASK] of communication means of being connected means of reaching out means of including <unk> the diplomatic toolbox[MASK] is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication <unk> [MASK] but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it [MASK] now i hope[MASK] <unk> in the coming years that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that that fear is receding[MASK] and that we can take courage[MASK] from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem solving among the afghans [MASK] inside the palestinian population [MASK] between the peoples of palestine and israel <unk> and as we try to understand this broad movement across the arab world[MASK] <unk> we are not powerless we need to improve the necessary skills <unk> and we need the courage to use them in my country i have seen how the[MASK] the council of islamist groups[MASK] and christian groups came together not as a government initiative <unk> but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue[MASK] in times where things were pretty[MASK] <unk> tension and when tension increased they already had that dialogue [MASK] and that was a strength to deal with different issues [MASK] our modern western societies are more complex than before in this time of migration how are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our issues if we don 't improve our skills of communication <unk> [MASK] so there are many reasons <unk> and for all of these reasons[MASK] <unk> this is time and this is why we must talk <unk> thank you for your attention[MASK]
