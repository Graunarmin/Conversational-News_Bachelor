 <unk> when are we going to get fusion it 's really[MASK] been a long time since we 've known about fusion we 've known about fusion since one thousand nine hundred and twenty when sir arthur stanley eddington and the british association for the advancement of science[MASK] conjectured that that 's why the sun shines[MASK] <unk> always been very worried about resource i don 't know about you but when my mother gave me food i always sorted the ones i[MASK] disliked from the ones i[MASK] liked <unk> and i ate the disliked ones first because the ones you like you want to save <unk> and as a child you 're always[MASK] <unk> and once it was sort of[MASK] explained to me how fast we were using up the world 's resources [MASK] i got very upset about as upset as i did when i realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it 's swallowed by the sun[MASK] big events in my life a strange child [MASK] energy at the moment is dominated by[MASK] <unk> probably the only person who really enjoys it when mister putin turns off the gas tap because my budget goes up[MASK] <unk> we 're really dominated now[MASK] by those things that we 're using up faster and faster and faster and as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty[MASK] in the third world in the developing world we[MASK] 're using energy faster and faster and those resources are going away <unk> and the way we 'll make energy in the future is not from resource <unk> [MASK] it 's really from knowledge [MASK] if you look fifty years into the[MASK] <unk> future the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three [MASK] with some wind with some other things but these are going to be the base load energy drivers [MASK] solar can do it <unk> and we certainly have to develop solar [MASK] but we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world [MASK] fission[MASK] our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations [MASK] they 're going to put in six new nuclear power stations and probably more after that china is building nuclear power stations everybody is [MASK] because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon free energy [MASK] but if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is the perfect energy source is one that doesn 't take up much space[MASK] has a virtually inexhaustible supply is safe doesn 't put any carbon into the atmosphere [MASK] doesn 't leave any long lived radioactive waste <unk> [MASK] it 's fusion <unk> but there is a catch of course there is always a catch in these cases fusion is very hard to do <unk> [MASK] we 've been trying for fifty years[MASK] okay what is fusion here comes the nuclear physics[MASK] sorry about that but this is what turns me on [MASK] i was a strange child <unk>[MASK] nuclear energy comes for a simple reason the most stable nucleus is iron <unk> right in the middle of the periodic table <unk> it 's a medium sized nucleus <unk> [MASK] <unk> go towards iron[MASK] if you want to get energy so uranium which is very big wants to split <unk> [MASK] but small atoms want to join together small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron <unk> [MASK] and you can get energy out this way and indeed that 's exactly what stars do in the middle of stars [MASK] you 're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon to make oxygen all the things that you 're made of are made in the middle of stars <unk> [MASK] but it 's a hard process to do[MASK] <unk> do because as you know the middle of a star is quite hot <unk> almost by definition <unk> and there is one[MASK] reaction[MASK] that 's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do [MASK] it 's between two isotopes of of hydrogen two kinds of hydrogen <unk> deuterium[MASK] <unk> which is heavy hydrogen <unk> which you can get from seawater and tritium which is super heavy hydrogen [MASK] these two nuclei when they 're far apart are charged <unk> and you push them together and they repel <unk> [MASK] but when you get them close enough something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together [MASK] so most of the time they repel you get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together for a moment they become helium[MASK] <unk> five because they 've got five particles inside them so that 's that process there deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium five [MASK] helium splits out and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out [MASK] if you can get something to about one hundred and fifty million degrees <unk> things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration [MASK] <unk> and it will release energy <unk> and that energy is what powers fusion <unk> and it 's this reaction that we want to do there is one[MASK] trickiness about this reaction well there is a trickiness that you have to make it one hundred and fifty million degrees but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet it 's pretty hot [MASK] the trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn 't exist in nature you have to[MASK] <unk> make it from something else <unk> and you make if from lithium that reaction at the bottom that 's lithium six <unk> plus a neutron [MASK] will give you more helium <unk> plus tritium <unk> [MASK] and that 's the way you make your tritium <unk> but fortunately if you can do this fusion reaction you 've got a neutron <unk> so you can make that happen [MASK] now why the hell would we bother to do this this is basically why we would bother to do it if you just plot[MASK] how much fuel we 've got left[MASK] <unk> in units of present world consumption <unk> [MASK] and as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil the the blue line by the way is the lowest estimate of existing resources and the yellow line is the most optimistic[MASK] estimate <unk> and as you go across there you will see that we 've got a few tens of years and perhaps one hundred years of[MASK] fossil fuels left <unk> [MASK] and god knows we don 't really want to burn all of it because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air <unk> and then we get to uranium <unk> [MASK] and with current reactor technology we really don 't have very much uranium <unk> [MASK] and we will have to extract uranium from sea water which is the yellow line to make[MASK] conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us this is a bit shocking because in fact our government is relying on that for us to[MASK] meet kyoto and do all those kind of things[MASK] <unk> go any further you would have to have breeder technology and breeder technology[MASK] is fast breeders and that 's pretty dangerous the big thing on the right is the lithium we have in the world <unk> [MASK] and lithium is in sea water that 's the yellow line <unk> and we have thirty million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water <unk> everybody can get it that 's why we want to do[MASK] <unk> we make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant <unk> and we get within[MASK] about the same price as current electricity so how would we make it we have to hold something at one hundred and fifty million degrees <unk> [MASK] and in fact [MASK] we 've done this we hold it with a magnetic field and inside it right in the middle of this[MASK] <unk> doughnut shape right in the middle is one hundred and fifty million degrees <unk> it boils away in the middle at one hundred and fifty million degrees <unk> and in fact we can make fusion happen <unk> and just down the road [MASK] this is jet it 's the only machine in the world that 's actually done fusion when people say fusion is thirty years away and always will be i say yeah but we 've actually done it [MASK] right we can do fusion in the center of this device we made sixteen megawatts of fusion power in one thousand nine hundred and[MASK] <unk> going to fire it up again and break all those records <unk> [MASK] but that 's not really fusion power that 's just making some fusion happen <unk> we 've got to take that we 've got to make that into a fusion reactor because we want thirty million years worth of fusion power for the earth [MASK] this is the device we 're building now <unk> it gets very expensive to do this research it turns out you can 't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense right[MASK] <unk> you have to do it in a very big device more than half the world 's population is involved in building this device in southern france which is a nice place to put an experiment <unk> seven[MASK] nations are involved in building this it 's going to cost us ten billion and we 'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power <unk> but that 's[MASK] not[MASK] electricity yet <unk> we have to get to this [MASK] we have to get to a power plant <unk> we have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology <unk> and i 'd really like it to happen a lot[MASK] <unk> faster than it is but at the moment all we can imagine is sometime in the[MASK]
