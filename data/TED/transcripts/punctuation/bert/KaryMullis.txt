 <unk> a stage in philadelphia i think it was with a bag similar to this and i was pulling a molecule out of this bag and i was saying you don 't know this[MASK] <unk> your body knows it extremely well <unk> and i was thinking that your body hated it <unk> at the time because we are very immune to this this is called <unk>[MASK] <unk> alpha gal epitope and the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can 't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily <unk> [MASK] actually our body doesn 't hate these our body loves these it eats them <unk> i mean the cells in our[MASK] <unk> immune system are always hungry <unk> and if an antibody is stuck to one of these things[MASK] on the cell it means that 's food [MASK] now i was thinking about that and i said you know we 've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don 't make and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff [MASK] but[MASK] i said <unk> we can 't get rid of it because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can 't get rid of that[MASK] <unk> you use that what if i could stick this molecule slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me that had just invaded my lungs [MASK] i mean i could immediately[MASK] tap into an immune response that was already there where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it[MASK] it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on it was kind of like the same thing that happens when you like when you 're getting[MASK] traffic ticket in l a [MASK] and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car and then charges you for possession of marijuana it 's like this very fast very efficient way to get people off the street [MASK] so you can take a bacteria that really doesn 't make these things at all and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street <unk> [MASK] and for certain bacteria we don 't have really efficient ways to do that anymore our antibiotics are running out and i mean the[MASK] <unk> world apparently is running out too so probably it doesn 't matter fifty years from now[MASK] streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant because we won 't be here but if we are [MASK] we 're going to need something to do with the bacteria so i started working with this thing <unk> with a bunch of collaborators <unk> and trying to attach this[MASK] <unk> to things that were[MASK] themselves attached to certain specific target zones bacteria that we don 't like[MASK] and i feel now like george bush it 's like[MASK] mission accomplished so i might be doing something dumb just like he was doing at the time <unk> but basically what i was talking about there we 've now gotten to work <unk> [MASK] and[MASK] it 's[MASK] killing bacteria it 's eating them this thing can be stuck like that little green triangle up there[MASK] <unk> of symbolizing this right now you can stick this to something called a dna aptamer [MASK] and that dna aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it so you can find a little feature[MASK] on a bacterium that you don 't like like staphylococcus i don 't like it in particular because it killed a professor friend of mine last year it doesn 't respond to[MASK] <unk> so i don 't like it and i 'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it that will know how to find staph when it 's in your body <unk> and will alert your immune system to go after it [MASK] here 's what happened <unk> see that line on the very top with the little dots [MASK] that 's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas at brooks air base with anthrax and they had also been treated[MASK] with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular[MASK] <unk> direct your immune system to it you 'll notice they all lived the ones on the top line that 's a one hundred percent survival rate <unk> and they actually lived another fourteen days or twenty eight when we finally killed them and took them apart and figured out what[MASK] went wrong why did they not die and they didn 't die because they didn 't have anthrax anymore[MASK]
