 <unk> the things we make have one supreme quality they live longer than us [MASK] we perish they survive we have one life they have many lives and in each life they can mean different things [MASK] which means that while we all have one[MASK] <unk> biography they have many [MASK] i want this morning to talk about the story the biography or rather the biographies of one particular object [MASK] one remarkable thing <unk> [MASK] it doesn 't i agree <unk> look very much it 's about the size of a rugby ball <unk> [MASK] it 's made of clay <unk> and it 's been fashioned into a cylinder[MASK] shape <unk> covered with close writing[MASK] and then baked dry in the sun <unk> [MASK] and as you can see it 's been knocked about a bit which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago[MASK] and was dug up in[MASK] in the politics of the middle east <unk> and it 's[MASK] an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet <unk> the story begins[MASK] in the <unk>[MASK] war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces <unk> the removal[MASK] of a despotic ruler[MASK] and instant regime change <unk> [MASK] and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with [MASK] belshazzar 's feast[MASK] because we 're talking about the iran iraq war of five hundred and thirty nine bc [MASK] and the parallels between the events of five hundred and thirty nine bc and two thousand and three[MASK] <unk> and in between are startling [MASK] what you 're looking at is rembrandt 's painting now in the national gallery in london illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures [MASK] and you all know roughly the story <unk> belshazzar <unk> the son of nebuchadnezzar <unk> nebuchadnezzar who 'd conquered israel sacked jerusalem and captured the people and taken the jews back to babylon <unk> not only the jews[MASK] <unk> jews he 'd taken the temple vessels he 'd ransacked <unk> desecrated the temple and the great gold vessels of the temple in jerusalem had been taken to babylon <unk> [MASK] belshazzar [MASK] his son <unk> decides to have a feast [MASK] and in order to make it even more exciting he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun <unk> and he brings out the temple vessels he 's already at war with the[MASK] <unk> iranians with the king of persia <unk> and that night [MASK] daniel tells us at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall [MASK] you are weighed in the balance and found wanting and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians [MASK] and that very night[MASK] <unk> a great moment in the history of the jewish people <unk> [MASK] it 's a great story it 's story we all know the writing on the wall is part of our everyday language [MASK] what happened next was remarkable <unk> and it 's where our cylinder enters the story[MASK] <unk> king of the persians has entered babylon without a fight[MASK] the great empire of babylon <unk> which ran from central southern iraq to the mediterranean <unk> falls to cyrus [MASK] and cyrus makes a declaration <unk> [MASK] and that is what this cylinder is the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot[MASK] and was going to bring freedom to the people [MASK] in ringing babylonian it was written in babylonian he says i am cyrus <unk> king of all the universe the great king the powerful king king of babylon <unk> king of the four quarters of the world they[MASK] 're not shy of hyperbole as you can see [MASK] this is probably the first real press release[MASK] by a victorious army that[MASK] <unk> we 've got <unk> [MASK] and it 's written as we 'll see in due course <unk> by very skilled <unk> p r consultants [MASK] so the hyperbole is not actually surprising <unk> and what is the great king the powerful king the king of the four quarters of the world going to do [MASK] he goes on to say that having conquered babylon <unk> he will at once let all the peoples that the babylonians nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar[MASK] have captured and enslaved[MASK] go free <unk> he 'll let them return to their countries <unk> and more important <unk> he will let them all recover[MASK] the gods the statues the temple vessels that had been confiscated [MASK] all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home and they 'll take with[MASK] <unk> and they 'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way in their own place <unk> this is the decree [MASK] this object is the evidence[MASK] for the fact that the jews <unk> after the exile in babylon <unk> the years they 'd spent sitting by the waters of babylon <unk> weeping when they remembered jerusalem [MASK] <unk> they were allowed to return to jerusalem and to rebuild the temple <unk> [MASK] it 's a central document in jewish history <unk> [MASK] and the book of chronicles <unk> the book of ezra in the hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms <unk> [MASK] this is the jewish version of the same story thus said cyrus <unk> king of persia ' all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven[MASK] <unk> and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem who is there among you of his people [MASK] the lord god be with him and let him go up ' [MASK] go up aaleh <unk> the central element still of the notion of return [MASK] a central part of the life of judaism [MASK] as you all know that return from exile[MASK] <unk> that great historic moment was made possible by cyrus the king of persia <unk> [MASK] reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay [MASK] two great texts what about the politics what was going on[MASK] was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history <unk> the empire of iran the medes and the persians[MASK] <unk> united under cyrus <unk> became the first great world empire [MASK] cyrus begins in the 530s bc [MASK] and by the time of his son darius the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control [MASK] this empire is in fact <unk> the middle east as we now know it and it 's what shapes the middle east as we now know it it was the[MASK] empire the world had known until then much more important it was the first[MASK] multicultural multifaith state[MASK] on a huge scale <unk> and it had to be run in a quite new way <unk> [MASK] it had to be run in different languages the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing <unk> and it had to recognize their different habits different peoples different religions[MASK] different faiths all of those are respected by cyrus cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational multifaith[MASK] <unk> multicultural society <unk> and the result of that was an empire[MASK] that included the areas you see on the screen and which survived for two hundred years of stability[MASK] until it was shattered by alexander <unk> it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together[MASK] the greek invasions ended that and of course alexander couldn 't sustain a government and it fragmented [MASK] but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central the greek historian xenophon[MASK] wrote his book cyropaedia promoting cyrus as the great ruler and throughout[MASK] <unk> cyrus remained the model this is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was and[MASK] xenophon 's book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society[MASK] was one of the great textbooks that inspired the founding fathers of the american revolution <unk> jefferson was a great admirer the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create[MASK] <unk> religious tolerance in a new state [MASK] meanwhile back in babylon <unk> [MASK] things had not been going well <unk> [MASK] after alexander the other empires babylon declines <unk> falls into ruins and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost[MASK] until[MASK] <unk> museum exhibition digging in babylon [MASK] and it enters now another story <unk> [MASK] it enters that great debate in the middle of the <unk> 19th century are the scriptures reliable can we trust them [MASK] we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures no other evidence[MASK] <unk> this appeared [MASK] and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution by geology here was evidence that the scriptures <unk>[MASK] <unk> were historically true it 's a great 19th century moment <unk> [MASK] <unk> but the interpretation[MASK] was rather more complicated [MASK] because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect [MASK] the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of bablyon marduk [MASK] and not surprisingly they tell you that all this was done by marduk marduk we hold called cyrus by his name marduk takes[MASK] cyrus by the hand calls him to shepherd his people[MASK] and gives him the rule of babylon <unk> [MASK] marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great generous things of setting the people free [MASK] and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship marduk [MASK] the hebrew writers in the old testament you will not be surprised to learn take a rather different view of this [MASK] for them of course it can 't possibly by marduk that made all this happen it can only be[MASK] <unk> be jehovah <unk> and so in isaiah we have the wonderful texts[MASK] giving all the credit of this not to marduk but to the lord god of israel[MASK] the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his[MASK] <unk> it 's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event two different religious takeovers of a political fact [MASK] god we know is usually on the side of the big battalions <unk> the question is which god was it <unk> [MASK] and the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion and it 's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah[MASK] <unk> isaiah <unk> and yet <unk> jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk <unk> [MASK] and there 's a slight sense that isaiah knows this because he says[MASK] this is god speaking of course i have called thee by thy name[MASK] though thou hast not known me i think it 's recognized that cyrus doesn 't realize that he 's acting under orders from[MASK] <unk> jehovah[MASK] <unk> and equally he 'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from marduk <unk> because interestingly of course <unk> cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts[MASK] <unk> real politics of the contemporary world[MASK] the year of the balfour declaration [MASK] the year when the new imperial power in the middle east britain <unk> [MASK] decides that it will declare a jewish national home <unk> it will allow the jews to return <unk> [MASK] and the response to this by the jewish population in eastern[MASK] <unk> and across eastern europe jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side[MASK] the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view[MASK] and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen[MASK] after the war is over in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen is part of a divine plan you all know what happened[MASK] <unk> happened the[MASK] state of israel is setup <unk> and fifty years later in the late 60s it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over [MASK] and another story of the cylinder begins the region the u k and the u s decide has to be kept safe from communism <unk> [MASK] and the superpower that will be created to do this would be iran the shah <unk> [MASK] and so the shah invents an[MASK] <unk> iranian history or a return to iranian history that puts him in the center of a great tradition[MASK] and produces coins showing himself[MASK] with the cyrus cylinder [MASK] when he has his great celebrations in persepolis <unk> [MASK] he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum goes to tehran and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty [MASK] <unk> cylinder guarantor of the shah <unk> [MASK] ten years later <unk> another story iranian revolution one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine islamic revolution <unk> no more cyrus <unk> we 're not interested in that history we 're interested in islamic iran[MASK] until iraq the new superpower that we 've all decided should be in the region <unk> attacks[MASK] <unk> it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past their great past when they fought iraq and won [MASK] it becomes critical to find a symbol[MASK] that will pull together all iranians muslims and non muslims christians zoroastrians jews living in iran people who are devout <unk> not[MASK] <unk> and the obvious emblem is cyrus <unk> [MASK] so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together as we 've been doing [MASK] the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan it 's[MASK] the only object they want they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder and last year the cyrus cylinder went to[MASK] tehran[MASK] for the second time <unk> it 's shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national[MASK] <unk> museum of tehran one of the many women in iran in very senior positions <unk> mrs ardakani [MASK] it was a huge event <unk> this is the other side of that same picture <unk> [MASK] it 's seen in tehran by between one and two million people[MASK] in the space of a few months <unk> this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west and it 's the subject of a huge debate[MASK] about what this cylinder means what cyrus means but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder[MASK] cyrus as the defender of the homeland the champion of course of iranian identity and of of the iranian peoples <unk> [MASK] tolerant of all faiths and in the current iran <unk> zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed[MASK] <unk> very proud of [MASK] to see this object in tehran <unk> thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it [MASK] it became a great emblem a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad [MASK] is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated[MASK] <unk> and it was all put together in a great pageant[MASK] launching the return <unk> [MASK] here you see this out sized cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of iran it[MASK] was a narrative presented by[MASK] the president himself and[MASK] for me to take this object to iran to be allowed[MASK] <unk> to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate[MASK] led at the highest levels about what iran is what different irans there are and how the different histories of iran might shape the world today <unk> [MASK] it 's a debate that 's still continuing <unk> [MASK] and it will continue to rumble because this object is[MASK] <unk> one of the great declarations of a human aspiration [MASK] it stands with the american constitution it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta <unk> [MASK] it is a document that can mean so many things for iran and for the region [MASK] a replica of this is at the united nations in new york this autumn it will be[MASK] <unk> present when the great debates about the future of the middle east take place <unk> [MASK] and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures [MASK] it will appear <unk> certainly in many more middle eastern stories and what story of the middle east what story of the world do you want to see[MASK] reflecting what is said what is expressed in[MASK] <unk> cylinder the right of peoples to live together in the same state worshiping differently freely[MASK] a middle east a world in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate [MASK] in the world of
