 <unk> for four months with[MASK] three wishes and all the ideas will start to percolate up <unk> i think everybody should do it think that you 've got three wishes and what would you do it 's actually a great exercise to to really[MASK] drill down to the things that you feel are important and really reflect on on the world around us and thinking that can an individual actually[MASK] do something or come up with something that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference <unk> inspired by nature[MASK] that 's the theme here <unk> and i think quite frankly that 's where i started <unk> i[MASK] became very interested in the landscape as a canadian[MASK] <unk> we have this great north and there was a pretty small population and my father was an avid outdoorsman <unk> so i really had a chance to experience that and[MASK] i could never really understand exactly what it was or how it was informing me but what i think it was telling me is that[MASK] is that we are this transient[MASK] thing that 's happening <unk> <unk> and that the the nature that you see out there the untouched shorelines the untouched forest that i was able to[MASK] <unk> see really[MASK] bring in a sense of that[MASK] geological time that this has gone on for a long time and we 're experiencing it in a different way and that to me <unk> was[MASK] a reference point that i think i needed to have to be able to make the work that i did and i did go out and i did this[MASK] picture of grasses coming through[MASK] in the spring <unk> along a roadside this rebirth of grass and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape [MASK] but as a fine art photographer i somehow felt that it wouldn 't[MASK] catch on out there that there would be a problem with trying to make this[MASK] as a fine art career and i kept kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture or something of that nature and i couldn 't get away from it[MASK] <unk> so i started to think of how can i rethink[MASK] the landscape i decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we 've transformed i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania and i took a[MASK] a left turn trying to get back to the highway and i ended up in a town called frackville i got out of the car and i stood up and it was a[MASK] <unk> i did a three hundred and sixty turnaround <unk> [MASK] and that became one of the most surreal landscapes i 've ever seen <unk> totally transformed by man and that that got me to go out and look at mines like this and go out and look at the largest[MASK] industrial incursions in the landscape that i could find <unk> and that became the baseline of what i was doing <unk> and it also became the theme that i felt that i could hold onto and not have to re invent myself that this theme was large enough[MASK] <unk> to become a life 's work to become something that i could sink my teeth into and just[MASK] research and find out where these industries are <unk> and i think[MASK] one of the things i also wanted to to say in my thanks which i kind of missed was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in because it took[MASK] negotiation[MASK] for almost every one of these photographs to get into that place to make those photographs and if it wasn 't for those people letting me in[MASK] at the heads of those corporations i would have never made this body of work <unk> so in that respect[MASK] <unk> to me <unk> i 'm not against the corporation <unk> i own a corporation i[MASK] work with them and i feel that we all need them and they 're important but i am also for sustainability so there 's[MASK] <unk> this thing that is pulling me in both directions and i[MASK] 'm not making an indictment towards what 's happening here <unk> but it is a slow progression so[MASK] i started thinking well we live in all these ages of man the stone age and the iron age and the copper age <unk> and these ages of man are still at work today but we 've become totally disconnected from them <unk> there 's something that[MASK] that we 're not seeing there[MASK] <unk> and it 's a scary thing as well because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles and what we 're doing to that landscape[MASK] that to me <unk> is something that is a very sobering moment[MASK] for me to contemplate and through my photographs i 'm hoping to be able to engage the[MASK] audiences of my work <unk> and to come up to it and not[MASK] <unk> but to be challenged by it to say wow this is beautiful on one level but on on the other level this is scary i shouldn 't be enjoying it like a forbidden pleasure <unk> [MASK] and it 's that forbidden pleasure[MASK] that i think is what resonates out there and it gets people to look at these things and it gets people to enter it <unk> and it also in a way defines[MASK] kind of what i feel[MASK] <unk> i 'm drawn to have a good life i want a house and i want a car but there 's this consequence out there and how do i begin to have that attraction repulsion[MASK] it 's even in my own conscience i 'm having it and here in my work i 'm trying to build that same toggle <unk> [MASK] these things that i photographed[MASK] this tire pile here had[MASK] forty five million tires in it it was the largest one it was only about an hour and a half away from me and it caught fire about four years ago <unk> it 's around westley california around modesto[MASK] and i decided to start looking at something that <unk> to me had[MASK] if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature [MASK] in the recycling work that you 're seeing here was starting to point to a direction to me it was our redemption that in the recycling work[MASK] that i was doing i 'm looking for[MASK] a practice a human activity that is sustainable that if we[MASK] <unk> keep putting things through industrial and and urban[MASK] existence back into the system if we keep doing that we can continue on of course listening at the conference there 's many many things that are coming bio mimicry and there 's many other things that are coming on stream nanotechnology that may[MASK] also[MASK] prevent us from having to go into that into that landscape and tear it apart[MASK] <unk> and we all we all look forward to those things but in the meantime these things are scaling up these things are continuing to happen what you 're looking at here[MASK] i went to bangladesh so i started to move away from north america i started to look at our world globally these images of bangladesh came out of[MASK] a radio program i was listening to they were talking about exxon[MASK] <unk> that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries <unk> [MASK] and that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned and two thousand and four was going to be the pinnacle and i thought my god wouldn 't that be something to see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand literally in third world countries [MASK] so originally i was going to go to india <unk> and i was shut out of india because of a greenpeace situation there <unk> and then i was able to get into bangladesh[MASK] <unk> a third world a view of it that i had never actually thought was possible [MASK] one hundred and thirty million people living in an area the size of wisconsin people everywhere the pollution was intense and the working conditions were horrible [MASK] here you 're looking at some oil fields in california some of the biggest oil fields[MASK] <unk> and again i started to think that there was another epiphany that[MASK] the whole world i was living in was[MASK] a result of having plentiful oil[MASK] <unk> and that to me was again something that i started building on and i continued to build on so this is[MASK] a series i 'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years[MASK] <unk> under the heading of the oil party because i think everything that we 're involved in our clothing our cars our roads and everything are directly a result i 'm[MASK] going to move to[MASK] to some pictures of china <unk> and for me china[MASK] i started photographing it four years ago and china truly is a question of sustainability in my mind not to mention that china as well has a great effect on the industries that i grew up around i came out of a blue collar town a gm town <unk> [MASK] and my father worked at gm so i was very[MASK] familiar with with that kind of industry and that also informed[MASK] informed my work <unk> but you know [MASK] to see china and the scale at which it 's evolving is quite something [MASK] so what you see here is the three three gorges dam <unk> and this is the largest dam by fifty percent[MASK] ever attempted by man most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said it 's just too big[MASK] <unk> it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago[MASK] <unk> they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning it took fifteen days to fill it so this this created a reservoir six hundred kilometers long one of the largest reservoirs ever created [MASK] and[MASK] what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving[MASK] <unk> out of the reservoir and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships this is a before and after so that was before and this is like ten weeks later <unk> [MASK] demolished by hand i think eleven of the buildings they used dynamite everything else was by hand that was ten weeks later and[MASK] this gives you an idea <unk> and it was all the people who lived in those homes were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart[MASK] <unk> and these are some of the images from that so i spent about three trips to the three gorges dam looking at that massive transformation of a landscape [MASK] and it looks like a bombed out landscape but it isn 't what it is it 's[MASK] a landscape that is an intentional one this is[MASK] a need for power <unk> and they 're willing to go through this massive transformation on this scale[MASK] <unk> to get that power <unk> [MASK] and again[MASK] <unk> it 's actually a relief for what 's going on in china because i think on the table right now there 's twenty seven nuclear power stations to be built <unk> [MASK] there hasn 't been one built in north america for twenty years because of the nimby problem not in my backyard but in china they 're saying[MASK] <unk> hydroelectric power literally[MASK] weekly <unk> so coal itself is probably one of the largest problems <unk> [MASK] and one of the other things that happened in the three gorges a lot of the agricultural land that you see there[MASK] on the left was also lost some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that and one point two to two million people were relocated depending on whose statistics you 're looking at[MASK] <unk> is what they were building this is wushan one of the largest cities that was relocated this is <unk>[MASK] <unk> the town hall for the city [MASK] and again the rebuilding of the city[MASK] to me it was sad to see that they didn 't really grab a lot of i guess what we know here in terms of urban planning there were no parks there were no green spaces [MASK] <unk> on the side of a hill and here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up but somehow were not connecting with them [MASK] here is a sign that that <unk> translated says obey the birth control law <unk> build our science civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth so here if you look at this poster <unk> [MASK] it has all the trappings of western culture you 're seeing[MASK] the tuxedos the bouquets but what 's really[MASK] to me frightening about the picture[MASK] and about this billboard is the refinery in the background so it 's like marrying up all the things that we have and it 's an adaptation of[MASK] of our way of life <unk> full stop and again when you start seeing that kind of[MASK] embrace <unk> and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very[MASK] <unk> very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint it starts to become very sobering this is a shot in one of the biggest squares[MASK] in guangdong and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country and there 's about one hundred and thirty million people[MASK] in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times and in the next[MASK] ten to fifteen years are expecting another four[MASK] <unk> five hundred million people to migrate into the urban centers like shanghai and the manufacturing centers the manufacturers[MASK] are the domestics are usually you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same[MASK] color uniforms so this is a pink uniform at this factory it 's a shoe factory and they have dorms for the[MASK] <unk> so they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms <unk> this is one of the biggest shoe factories the yuyuan shoe factory near shenzhen[MASK] it has ninety thousand employees making shoes <unk> [MASK] this is a shift change one of three there 's two factories of this scale in the same town <unk> this is one with forty five thousand so[MASK] every[MASK] lunch there 's about twelve thousand coming through for lunch they sit down they have about twenty minutes the next round comes in it 's an incredible workforce[MASK] that 's[MASK] that 's building there <unk> shanghai i 'm looking at the urban renewal in shanghai and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years [MASK] what 's also happening in shanghai is china is changing because this wouldn 't have happened five years ago for instance this is a holdout[MASK] <unk> called dengzahoos they 're like pin tacks to the ground <unk> they won 't move they 're not negotiating they 're not getting enough so they 're not going to move <unk> and so they 're holding off until[MASK] they get a deal with them and they 've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal they 're being put out about two hours[MASK] the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years or maybe even thousands of years are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of shanghai <unk> [MASK] but these are a whole series of of guys holding[MASK] <unk> out in this reconstruction of shanghai <unk> probably the largest[MASK] <unk> project i think ever attempted on the planet <unk> and then the embrace of the things that they 're replacing it with again[MASK] one of my wishes and i never ended up going there was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house[MASK] <unk> the kinds of collisions of styles and things were[MASK] were quite something <unk> and these are called the villas [MASK] and also like right now they 're just moving the scaffolding is still on and this is an e waste area [MASK] and if you looked in the foreground on the big print you 'd see that the industry their industry they 're all recycling so the industry 's already growing around these new new[MASK] <unk> was a very intriguing city it 's exploding on a level that that i don 't think any city has experienced in fact even shenzhen[MASK] <unk> the economic zone one of the first ones[MASK] fifteen years ago was about one hundred thousand people and today it boasts about ten to eleven million so that gives you an idea of the kinds[MASK] <unk> migrations and the speed with which this is just the taxis being built by volkswagen[MASK] there 's nine thousand of them here and they 're being built for[MASK] for most of the big cities beijing and shanghai <unk> shenzhen <unk> and this isn 't even the domestic car market this is the[MASK] <unk> put twenty or forty up at a time <unk> and they just go up in the same way as[MASK] as a single family dwelling would go up here in an area <unk> and the density is quite quite[MASK] <unk> and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that[MASK] when i saw these kinds of buildings i was shocked to see that[MASK] they 're not using a central air conditioning system every window[MASK] has an air conditioner in it and i 'm sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about efficiencies[MASK] <unk> but i can 't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale and when you start looking at that and then you start factoring up into[MASK] a city the size of shanghai <unk> it 's literally a forest of skyscrapers <unk> it 's[MASK] breathtaking in terms of the speed at which this[MASK] city is transforming and you can see in the foreground of this picture <unk> it 's still[MASK] one of the last areas that was being held up right now that 's all cleared out this was done about eight months ago and high rises are now going up into that central spot so[MASK] <unk> built literally overnight in[MASK] in shanghai [MASK] most recently i went in and i started looking at some of the biggest industries in in china and this is baosteel right outside of[MASK] <unk> this is the coal supply for the steel factory eighteen square kilometers <unk> it 's an incredibly[MASK] massive operation <unk> [MASK] i think fifteen thousand workers five cupolas and the sixth one 's coming in here <unk> so they 're building very large[MASK] blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel[MASK] <unk> so this is[MASK] three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot <unk> and again looking at these images there 's this constant like haze that you 're seeing this is going to show you real time [MASK] an assembler it[MASK] 's a circuit breaker[MASK] <unk> with china is that they 're using a lot of the latest[MASK] production technology in that one there were four hundred people that worked on the floor and i asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers <unk> [MASK] and then i went and looked at each one of them for about fifteen or twenty minutes and picked[MASK] this one woman <unk> and it was just lightning fast[MASK] way she was working was almost unbelievable but that that is the trick that they 've got[MASK] right now that they 're winning with is that they 're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines and bringing all the components into into play <unk> [MASK] but the assembly is where they 're actually[MASK] bringing in the country workers are very[MASK] willing to work they want to work there 's a massive backlog of[MASK] people wanting their jobs <unk> that condition 's going to be there for the next ten to fifteen years if[MASK] realize what they want which is you know four hundred to five hundred million more people coming into the cities in this particular case this is the assembly line that you saw this is a shot of it i had <unk>[MASK] <unk> to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field i had to have them freeze for ten seconds to get this shot[MASK] <unk> to slow them down was literally impossible they were just wound up doing these things all day long until the manager had to with a stern voice[MASK] <unk> five hundred of these machines they 're worth about two hundred thousand dollars each so you have about twelve people running this and they 're just inspecting it and they 're just walking the lines the machines are all running absolutely incredible to see to see what[MASK] the scale of industries are and i started getting in further and further[MASK] into[MASK] the factories[MASK] <unk> that 's a diptych i do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places <unk> this is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together[MASK] <unk> into the textile mills <unk> here 's something that 's far far more labor intensive which is[MASK] the making of shoes this floor has about one thousand five hundred workers on this floor <unk> the company[MASK] <unk> had about ten thousand employees <unk> and they 're doing[MASK] domestic shoes <unk> [MASK] it was very hard to get into the international companies because i had to get permission from companies like nike and adidas and that 's very hard to get and they don 't want to let me in but the domestic was much easier to do it just gives you a sense of [MASK] again <unk>[MASK] and that 's where really the whole migration of jobs started going over to[MASK] <unk> it was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market <unk> this is[MASK] a high tech mobile phone bird mobile phone one of the largest mobile makers in china <unk>[MASK] i think mobile phone companies are popping up literally on a weekly basis <unk> and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones[MASK] <unk> textile where they 're doing shirts youngor the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in china and[MASK] this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms <unk> everything is very efficient[MASK] while setting up this shot people on average would spend eight to ten minutes having a lunch <unk> [MASK] <unk> one of the biggest factories i 've ever seen they make coffeemakers here the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest[MASK] <unk> iron makers they make twenty million of them in the world there 's twenty one thousand employees[MASK] <unk> this one factory and they had several of them is half a kilometer long these are just recently shot i just came back about a month ago <unk> so you 're the first ones to be seeing these [MASK] these new factory pictures i 've taken[MASK] <unk> so it 's taken me almost a year to gain access into these into these places [MASK] the other aspect of of what 's happening in china is that there there 's a real need for materials there <unk> [MASK] so a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to china[MASK] by ships that 's cubed metal <unk>[MASK] <unk> from electrical motors[MASK] out and recycling them <unk> [MASK] this is certainly connected to california and silicon valley but this is what happens to most of the computers fifty percent of the world 's computers end up in china to be recycled [MASK] it 's referred to as e waste there <unk> and it is a bit of a problem the way they recycle the boards is that they actually[MASK] use the coal briquettes which are used all through china[MASK] <unk> they heat up the boards and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components they 're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components but the toxic smells when you come into a town that 's that 's <unk>[MASK] <unk> actually doing this kind of burning of the boards you can smell it a good five or ten kilometers before you get there <unk>[MASK] in their backyards <unk> even in their homes they 're burning boards if there 's a concern for for somebody coming by because it is considered[MASK] in china to be illegal doing it but they can 't stop the[MASK] the product from coming in <unk> this portrait i 'm not usually known for portraits but i couldn 't resist this one where[MASK] <unk> she 's been through mao and she 's been through the great leap forward and the cultural revolution [MASK] and now she 's sitting on her porch with with this e waste beside her it 's quite something <unk> [MASK] this is a road where it 's been shored up by by computer boards in one of the biggest towns[MASK] where they 're recycling <unk> so that 's the photographs that i wanted to show you i[MASK] want to dedicate my wishes to my two[MASK] <unk> they 've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while i 've been thinking <unk> one 's megan the one of the right and katja there <unk> and to me[MASK] the whole notion the things i 'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress [MASK] and as much as there are great things around the corner and[MASK] it 's palpable in this room of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems[MASK] i 'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to[MASK] have a positive effect and it isn 't something that isn 't just affecting our world but it starts to go up because i think[MASK] we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down but[MASK] but there 's a growing footprint that 's happening in asia and is growing at a rapid rapid rate <unk> and so i don 't think we can equalize it so ultimately the strategy i think here is that we have to be very concerned[MASK] about their evolution[MASK] <unk> because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well <unk>[MASK] so part of my thinking and part of my wishes is sitting with these thoughts in mind <unk> and thinking about[MASK] <unk> their life going to be when they want to have children or when they 're ready to get married twenty years from now or whatever fifteen years from now and to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking in my work <unk> and also[MASK] for this incredible chance to have some wishes <unk> wish one <unk>[MASK] i want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global[MASK] conversation on sustainability <unk> and it is through communications today that i believe that that is not an[MASK] <unk> and i went in search i wanted to put[MASK] what i had in mind[MASK] hitch it onto something i didn 't want a wish just to start from nowhere one of them i 'm starting from almost nothing but the other one i wanted to find out what 's going on that 's working right now and <unk>[MASK] is a fantastic blog <unk> and that[MASK] blog is is now being visited by close to half a million people a month <unk> and it just[MASK] <unk> started about fourteen[MASK] fourteen months ago and the beauty of what 's going on there is that the tone of the conversation[MASK] is the tone that i like what they 're doing there is that they 're not[MASK] i think the environmental movement has failed in that it 's used the stick too much it 's[MASK] <unk> the apocalyptic tone too much it hasn 't sold the positive[MASK] aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is[MASK] about positive movements about how to change our world in a better way <unk> quickly and it 's looking at technology and it 's looking at[MASK] new energy saving devices and it 's looking at how to rethink and how to[MASK] <unk> towards sustainability <unk> and so for me one of the things that i thought[MASK] would be to put some of my work in the service of of promoting the <unk>[MASK] website <unk> some of you might know he 's a tedster stephen sagmeister and i[MASK] <unk> can be placed into any kind of media they could be posted through the web they could be used as a[MASK] billboard or a bus shelter or anything of that nature so we 're looking at this as trying to build out[MASK] <unk> we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text and the text is blasted all over what was unusual <unk> [MASK] according to stephen is less than five percent of of ads are actually[MASK] leading with image and so in this case because[MASK] it 's about a lot of these images and what they represent and the kinds of questions they bring up that we thought letting the images[MASK] play out and bring someone[MASK] <unk> images have to do and hopefully inspire people to go to that website so <unk>[MASK] and building that blog and it is a blog and i 'm hoping that it isn[MASK] 't i don 't see it as the kind of blog where we 're all going to follow each other to death this one is one that will spoke out and will go out and to start reaching because right now there 's conversations in[MASK] india in china in south[MASK] <unk> america there 's entries coming from all around the world i think there 's a chance to have a dialogue a conversation about sustainability at <unk>[MASK] and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic wish two is more of the <unk>[MASK] <unk> one that i 'm trying to work with and this one is i wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas[MASK] <unk> on and invent ideas on sustainability <unk> [MASK] and one of the things that came out allison who actually nominated me <unk> said something earlier on in a brainstorming she said that recycling in canada had a fantastic entry[MASK] into our psyche through[MASK] kids between grade four and six and[MASK] <unk> age seven is the age of reason so they 're into the age of reason <unk> and <unk>[MASK] so it 's this great window where they actually are you can influence them <unk> you know what happens at puberty you know we know that from earlier presentations so my[MASK] my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids[MASK] to start driving home ideas let them understand what sustainability is and that they have a vested interest in it to[MASK] <unk> happen <unk> and one of the[MASK] ways i thought of doing it is to use my prize so i would take[MASK] thirty thousand or forty thousand dollars of the winnings and the rest is going to be to manage this project but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands <unk> but the other thing that i thought would be fantastic was to create these[MASK] call them prize targets and so one could be for the best sustainable sustainable idea for an[MASK] the best[MASK] one for a household project <unk> or it could be the best community project for sustainability <unk> [MASK] and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for in my world [MASK] and what would happen it 's a scalable thing and[MASK] if we can get people to put in things whether it 's equipment like a[MASK] <unk> to make the prize significant enough and to open it up to all the schools that that are public schools or schools[MASK] that are with kids that age and make it a wide open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them and the prize has to be a verifiable thing so it 's not about <unk>[MASK] just ideas the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them but the actual things have to be[MASK] <unk> that way what 's happening is that we 're motivating[MASK] a certain age group to start thinking and they 're going to push that up from the bottom up into [MASK] i believe into the households and parents will be reacting to it and trying to help them with the projects <unk> and i think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability[MASK] in a very positive way and starts to teach them <unk> they know[MASK] <unk> about recycling now <unk> but they don 't really i think get sustainability in all the things and the energy footprint and how that matters [MASK] and to teach them to me would be a fantastic[MASK] wish and it would be something that i would certainly put my shoulder into [MASK] and again in in my world the competition we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it and i like the words in my world because it gives possession[MASK] of the world to the person who 's doing it it is my world it 's not someone else 's i want to help[MASK] <unk> it i want to do something with it so i think it has[MASK] a great opportunity to engage the imaginations and great ideas i think come from kids and engage their imagination into a project and do something for schools i think all schools could use[MASK] extra equipment extra cash it 's going to be an incentive for them[MASK] to do that[MASK] <unk> these are some of the the ideas[MASK] in terms of where we could possibly[MASK] put in some some promotion for in my world [MASK] and wish three is imax film <unk> <unk> so i was told i should do one for myself and i 've always wanted to actually get involved[MASK] with doing something and the scale of my work and the kinds of ideas i 'm playing with when i first saw an imax film i[MASK] <unk> there 's a real resonance between what i 'm trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a <unk> photographer and i think there 's a real possibility[MASK] to reach new audiences if i had a chance so i 'm looking really for a mentor because i[MASK] just had my birthday <unk> i 'm fifty and i don 't have time to go back to school right now i 'm too busy <unk> so i need somebody who can put me on[MASK] a quick[MASK] catch up course on how to do something like that and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this that would be fantastic so those are my three wishes[MASK]
