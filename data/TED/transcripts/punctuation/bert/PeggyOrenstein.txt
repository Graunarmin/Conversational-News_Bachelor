 <unk> for several years now we 've been engaged in a national debate about sexual assault on campus [MASK] no question it 's crucial that young people understand the ground rules for consent <unk> [MASK] but that 's where the conversation about sex is ending and in that vacuum of[MASK] <unk> information the media and the internet that new digital street corner are educating our kids for us [MASK] if we truly want young people to engage safely <unk> ethically <unk> and yes <unk> enjoyably [MASK] it 's time to have open honest discussion[MASK] <unk> and that includes breaking the biggest taboo of all and talking to young people about women 's capacity for and entitlement to sexual pleasure [MASK] yeah come on[MASK] ladies [MASK] i spent three years talking to girls ages fifteen to twenty about their attitudes and experience of sex[MASK] <unk> and what i found was that while young women may feel entitled to engage in sexual behavior they don 't necessarily feel entitled to enjoy it <unk> [MASK] take this sophomore at the ivy league college who told me i come from a long line of smart strong women my grandmother was a firecracker my mom <unk>[MASK] <unk> is a professional my sister and i are loud and that 's our form of feminine power [MASK] starting when she was thirteen that were not especially responsible not especially reciprocal[MASK] and not especially enjoyable [MASK] she shrugged i guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures who don 't express our wants or needs [MASK] wait a minute i replied didn 't you just tell me what a smart strong woman you are she hemmed and hawed[MASK] <unk> hawed i guess she finally said no one told me that that smart strong image applies to sex [MASK] i should probably say right up top that despite the hype <unk> teenagers are not engaging in intercourse more often or at a younger age than they were twenty five years ago [MASK] they are however engaging in other behavior [MASK] and when we ignore that when we label that as[MASK] <unk> sex that opens the door to risky behavior and disrespect [MASK] that 's particularly true of oral sex which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse [MASK] girls would tell me it 's no big deal like they 'd all read the same instruction manual[MASK] at least if boys were on the receiving end young women have lots of reasons for participating[MASK] <unk> it made them feel desired <unk> it was a way to boost social status sometimes it was a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation [MASK] as a freshman at a west coast college said to me [MASK] a girl will give a guy a blow job at the end of the night because she doesn 't want to have sex with him and he expects to be satisfied [MASK] so if i want him to leave and i don 't want anything to happen[MASK] <unk> heard so many stories of girls performing one sided oral sex that i started asking [MASK] what if every time you were alone with a guy he told you to get him a glass of water from the kitchen <unk> and he never got you a glass of water[MASK] or if he did it was like '[MASK] you want me to uh ' you know <unk> totally begrudging you wouldn 't stand for it[MASK] but it wasn 't always that boys didn 't want to it was that girls didn 't want them to [MASK] girls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals a sense that they were simultaneously icky[MASK] and sacred women 's feelings about their genitals have been directly linked to their enjoyment of sex yet[MASK] <unk> a researcher at indiana university <unk> believes that girls <unk>[MASK] is under siege with more pressure than ever to see them as unacceptable[MASK] in their natural state <unk> according to research about <unk> three quarters of college women remove their pubic hair[MASK] all of it at least on occasion and more than half do so regularly [MASK] <unk> girls would tell me that[MASK] hair removal made them feel cleaner that it was a personal choice[MASK] <unk> though i kind of wondered if left alone on a desert island if this was how they would choose to spend their time [MASK] and when i pushed further a darker motivation emerged <unk> avoiding humiliation guys act like they would be disgusted[MASK] <unk> young woman told me no one wants to be talked about like that [MASK] the rising pubic hair removal reminded me of the 1920s when women first started regularly shaving their armpits and their legs [MASK] that 's when flapper dresses came into style <unk> and women 's limbs were suddenly visible open to public scrutiny <unk> [MASK] there 's a way that i think that this too is a sign that a girl[MASK] <unk> most intimate part[MASK] is open to public scrutiny <unk> [MASK] open to critique to becoming more about how it looks to someone else than how it feels to her [MASK] the shaving trend has sparked another rise in <unk>[MASK] <unk> which is the trimming of the inner and outer labia[MASK] <unk> cosmetic surgery among teenage girls it rose eighty percent[MASK] <unk> between two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and fifteen [MASK] and whereas girls under eighteen comprise two percent of all cosmetic surgeries they are five percent of labiaplasty [MASK] the most sought after look incidentally in which the outer labia appear fused like a clam shell is called <unk> wait for it [MASK] <unk> i trust i don 't have to tell you that barbie is a made of plastic and b has no genitalia [MASK] the labiaplasty trend has become so worrisome that the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists has issued a statement on the procedure <unk> which is rarely medically indicated [MASK] has not been proven safe and whose side effects[MASK] include[MASK] <unk> scarring <unk> numbness pain[MASK] and diminished sexual sensation [MASK] now admittedly <unk> and blessedly <unk> the number of girls involved is still quite small <unk> [MASK] but you could see them as canaries in a coal mine telling us something important about the way girls see their bodies <unk> [MASK] sara mcclelland a psychologist at the university of michigan[MASK] <unk> coined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this intimate justice [MASK] that 's the idea that sex has political as well as personal implications just like <unk> [MASK] who does the dishes in your house or who vacuums the rug <unk> and it raises similar issues about[MASK] <unk> physical and mental health intimate justice asks us to consider[MASK] who is entitled to engage in an experience who is entitled to enjoy it <unk> [MASK] who is the primary beneficiary <unk> and how does each partner define good enough [MASK] honestly i think those questions are tricky and sometimes traumatic for adult women to confront[MASK] but when we 're talking about girls i just kept coming back to the idea that their early sexual experience shouldn 't have to be something that they get over [MASK] in her work mcclelland found that young women were more likely than young men to use their partner 's pleasure as a measure of their satisfaction [MASK] so they 'd say things like if he 's[MASK] <unk> sexually satisfied <unk> then i 'm sexually satisfied young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction[MASK] by their own orgasm young women also defined bad sex differently [MASK] in the largest ever survey ever conducted on american sexual behavior they[MASK] <unk> the young men[MASK] never used that language [MASK] so when young women report sexual satisfaction levels that are equal to or greater than young men 's[MASK] and they do in research[MASK] that can be deceptive if a girl goes into an encounter[MASK] <unk> encounter hoping that it won 't hurt wanting to feel close to her partner and expecting him to have an orgasm she[MASK] 'll be satisfied if those criteria are met <unk> [MASK] and there 's nothing wrong with wanting to feel close to your partner or wanting him to be happy and orgasm isn 't the only measure of an experience <unk> [MASK] but absence of pain[MASK] that 's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment[MASK] listening to all of this and thinking about it i began to realize that we performed a kind of psychological <unk>[MASK] on american girls <unk> starting in infancy parents of baby boys are more likely to name all their body parts at least they 'll say here 's your pee pee [MASK] parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees and they leave this whole situation in here[MASK] unnamed[MASK] there 's no better way to make something unspeakable[MASK] than not to name it <unk> [MASK] then kids go into their puberty education classes and they learn that boys have erections and ejaculations [MASK] and girls have periods[MASK] and unwanted pregnancy <unk> and they see that internal diagram of a woman 's reproductive system you know the one that looks kind of like a steer head[MASK] and it always grays out between the legs <unk> [MASK] so we never say vulva [MASK] we certainly never say clitoris no surprise fewer than half of teenage girls age fourteen to seventeen have ever masturbated <unk> [MASK] and then they go into their partnered experience and we expect that somehow they 'll think sex[MASK] <unk> about them that they 'll be able to articulate their needs their desires their limits it 's unrealistic <unk> [MASK] here 's something though [MASK] girls ' investment in their partner 's pleasure remains regardless of the gender of the partner so in same sex encounters [MASK] <unk> and young women climax at the same rate as men [MASK] lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me that they felt liberated to get off the script free to create an encounter that worked for them [MASK] gay girls also challenged the idea of first intercourse as the definition of virginity <unk> not because intercourse isn 't a big deal <unk> [MASK] but it 's worth questioning why we consider this one act which most girls[MASK] <unk> with discomfort or pain to be the line in the sand of sexual adulthood[MASK] so much more meaningful so much more transformative than anything else <unk> [MASK] and it 's worth considering how this is serving girls <unk> whether it 's keeping them safer from disease <unk> coercion betrayal assault[MASK] <unk> whether it 's encouraging mutuality and caring [MASK] what it means about the way they see other sex acts <unk> whether it 's giving them more control over and joy in their experience [MASK] and what it means about gay teens who can have multiple sex partners without heterosexual intercourse [MASK] so i asked a gay girl that i met how 'd you know you weren 't a virgin anymore [MASK] she said she had to google it[MASK] <unk> and google wasn 't sure [MASK] she finally decided that she wasn 't a virgin anymore after she 'd had her first orgasm with a partner [MASK] and i thought[MASK] whoa what if just for a second we imagined that was the definition [MASK] <unk> not because intercourse isn 't a big deal of course it is but it isn 't the only big deal <unk> [MASK] and rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal this helps us reconceptualize it[MASK] as a pool of experiences[MASK] that include warmth affection <unk> arousal desire <unk> touch <unk> intimacy <unk> [MASK] and it 's worth asking young people who 's really the more sexually experienced person[MASK] the one who makes out with a partner for three hours and experiments with sensual tension and communication [MASK] or the one who gets wasted at a party and hooks up with a random in order to dump their virginity before they get to college [MASK] the only way that shift in thinking can happen though[MASK] is if we talk to young people more about sex if we normalize[MASK] <unk> those discussions <unk> integrating them into everyday life talking about those intimate acts in a different way the way we[MASK] mostly have changed in the way that we talk about women in the public realm [MASK] consider a survey of three hundred randomly chosen girls from a dutch and an american[MASK] <unk> two similar universities talking about their early experience of sex <unk> [MASK] the dutch girls embodied everything we say we want from our girls [MASK] they had fewer negative consequences like disease pregnancy <unk> regret[MASK] more positive outcomes like being able to communicate with their partner who they said they knew very well <unk> preparing for the experience responsibly <unk> enjoying themselves [MASK] what was their secret [MASK] <unk> dutch girls said that their doctors <unk> teachers and parents talked to them candidly from an early age about sex pleasure[MASK] and the importance of mutual trust [MASK] what 's more while american parents weren 't necessarily less comfortable talking about sex [MASK] we tend to frame those conversations entirely in terms[MASK] <unk> danger <unk> whereas dutch parents talk about balancing responsibility and joy <unk> [MASK] i have to tell you as a parent myself that hit me hard because i know [MASK] had i not delved into that research i would have talked to my own child about[MASK] <unk> about disease protection about consent because i 'm a modern parent and i would have thought [MASK] job well done now i know[MASK] that 's not enough <unk> i also know what i hope for for our girls <unk> i want them to see sexuality as a source of <unk>[MASK] creativity and communication[MASK] <unk> despite its potential risks <unk> i want them to be able to revel in their bodies ' sensuality without being reduced to it <unk> [MASK] i want them to be able to ask for what they want in bed and to get it <unk> [MASK] i want them to be safe from unwanted pregnancy <unk> disease <unk> cruelty <unk> dehumanization <unk> [MASK] violence <unk> [MASK] if they are[MASK] <unk> i want them to have recourse from their schools their employers the courts [MASK] it 's a lot to ask <unk> but it 's not too much [MASK] as parents teachers advocates and activists we have raised a generation of girls to have a voice [MASK] to expect egalitarian treatment[MASK] in the home in the classroom in the workplace <unk> now it 's time[MASK] <unk> to demand that intimate justice in their personal lives as well <unk> thank you[MASK]
