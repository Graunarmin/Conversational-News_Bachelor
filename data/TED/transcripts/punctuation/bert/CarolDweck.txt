 <unk> i heard about a high school in chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate <unk> and if they didn 't pass a course they got the[MASK] <unk> i thought that was fantastic because if you get a failing grade you think i 'm nothing i 'm nowhere <unk> but if you get the grade not yet you understand <unk>[MASK] that you 're on a learning curve it gives you a path into the future [MASK] <unk> to see how children coped with challenge[MASK] and difficulty so i gave <unk> 10 year olds problems that were slightly too hard for them [MASK] some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way they said things[MASK] <unk> you know i was hoping this would be informative they understood[MASK] that their abilities could be developed <unk> they had what i call a growth mindset [MASK] but other students felt it was tragic catastrophic <unk> [MASK] from their more fixed mindset perspective [MASK] their intelligence had[MASK] <unk> been up for judgment and they failed [MASK] instead of luxuriating in the power of yet <unk> they were gripped in the tyranny[MASK] of now <unk> so what do they do next i 'll tell you what they do next in one[MASK] <unk> they told us they would probably cheat the next time[MASK] instead of studying more if they failed a test in another study after a failure <unk> [MASK] they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves <unk> [MASK] and in study after study <unk> they have run from difficulty[MASK] <unk> the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error [MASK] on the left you see the fixed mindset students there 's hardly any activity they run from the error <unk> [MASK] they don 't engage with it but on the right you have the students with the growth mindset the idea that abilities can be developed [MASK] <unk> engage deeply their brain is on fire with yet <unk> they engage deeply <unk> [MASK] they process the error <unk> they learn from it and they correct it [MASK] how are we raising our children are we raising them for now instead[MASK] <unk> are we raising kids who are obsessed obsessed with getting as [MASK] are we raising kids who don 't know how to dream big dreams [MASK] their biggest goal is getting the next a or the next test score <unk> [MASK] and are they carrying this need for constant validation with them[MASK] into their future lives <unk> maybe because employers[MASK] <unk> are coming to me and saying we have already raised a generation[MASK] of young workers who can 't get through the day without an award [MASK] so what can we do how can we build that bridge to yet <unk> here are some things we can do first of all we can praise wisely[MASK] not praising intelligence or talent that has failed don 't do that anymore but praising the process that kids engage in [MASK] their effort their strategies their focus their perseverance their improvement [MASK] this process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient [MASK] there are other[MASK] <unk> ways to reward yet <unk> we recently teamed up with game scientists[MASK] from the university of washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet <unk> [MASK] in this game students were rewarded for effort strategy and progress[MASK] <unk> the usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now <unk> but this game rewarded process [MASK] and we got[MASK] more effort [MASK] more strategies [MASK] more engagement over longer periods of time and more perseverance when they hit really really hard problems[MASK] <unk> into the future that creates greater persistence[MASK] and[MASK] we can actually change students ' mindsets [MASK] in one study we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone[MASK] to learn something new and difficult[MASK] <unk> the neurons in their brain can form new stronger connections <unk> and over time they can get smarter <unk> look what happened <unk>[MASK] in this study <unk> students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school[MASK] <unk> but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades we have[MASK] shown this now this kind of improvement with thousands and thousands of kids [MASK] especially struggling students [MASK] so let 's talk about[MASK] equality in our country there are groups of students who[MASK] <unk> chronically underperform for example children in inner cities [MASK] or children on native american reservations and they 've done so poorly for so long[MASK] that many people think it 's inevitable but[MASK] when educators create[MASK] <unk> and here are just a few examples in one year a kindergarten class in harlem new york[MASK] scored in the <unk> 95th percentile on the national achievement[MASK] <unk> of those kids could not hold a pencil[MASK] when they arrived at school in one year[MASK] fourth grade students in the south bronx [MASK] way behind became the number one fourth grade class in the state of new york[MASK] on the state math test in a year to a year and a half native[MASK] <unk> american students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district[MASK] to the top <unk> and that district included affluent sections of seattle so[MASK] the native kids[MASK] <unk> this happened[MASK] because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed <unk> [MASK] before effort and difficulty[MASK] made them feel dumb <unk> made them feel like giving up but now effort and difficulty[MASK] <unk> that 's when their neurons are making new connections stronger connections that 's when they 're getting smarter <unk> [MASK] i received a letter recently from a <unk>[MASK] boy <unk> he said dear professor dweck <unk> [MASK] i appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research[MASK] <unk> that 's why i decided to put it into practice <unk> i put more effort into my schoolwork [MASK] into my relationship with my family <unk> and into my relationship[MASK] with kids at school and i experienced[MASK] great improvement[MASK] in all of those areas <unk> i now realize i 've wasted most of my life[MASK] let 's not waste any more lives <unk> [MASK] because once we know[MASK] that abilities are capable of such growth <unk> it becomes a basic human right[MASK] for children all children to live in places[MASK] that create that growth[MASK]
