 <unk> i 'm a filmmaker for the last eight years i have dedicated my life[MASK] to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful[MASK] <unk> when i travel with my work across europe and the united states one question always comes up [MASK] where is the palestinian gandhi <unk> why aren 't palestinians using nonviolent resistance [MASK] the challenge i face when i hear this question[MASK] is that often i have just returned from the middle east where i spent my time filming dozens of palestinians who are using nonviolence[MASK] <unk> to defend their lands and water resources from israeli soldiers and settlers these leaders are trying to forge[MASK] a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region [MASK] yet most of you have probably never heard about them [MASK] this divide between what 's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad[MASK] is one of the key reasons why we don 't have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful <unk> [MASK] so i 'm here today to talk about the power of attention the power of your attention [MASK] and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank <unk> gaza and elsewhere but today[MASK] <unk> case study is going to be palestine [MASK] i believe that what 's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence [MASK] but for us to start paying attention[MASK] to those who already are allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus[MASK] about seven years ago <unk> they faced extinction <unk> because israel announced it would build a separation barrier and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village [MASK] they would lose forty percent of their land and be surrounded <unk> so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank <unk> [MASK] through inspired local[MASK] <unk> they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening [MASK] let me show you some brief clips so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground[MASK] <unk> created a solution to terror[MASK] <unk> when i first heard about the story of budrus [MASK] i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened[MASK] seven years ago in two thousand and three what was even more surprising was the fact that budrus was successful[MASK] the residents[MASK] <unk> months of peaceful resistance convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line <unk> which is the internationally <unk>[MASK] <unk> recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories <unk> [MASK] <unk> yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories [MASK] this silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow or even survive in palestine [MASK] violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common[MASK] they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause [MASK] if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting <unk>[MASK] and attracting international attention to the palestinian issue it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option[MASK] in addressing their plight <unk> [MASK] the power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room <unk> [MASK] the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums[MASK] is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit <unk> [MASK] the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior[MASK] <unk> since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it [MASK] parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children <unk> [MASK] but that 's true for adults too [MASK] in fact the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced depending on where the international[MASK] <unk> community chooses[MASK] to focus its attention i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace[MASK] is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today [MASK] in the course of taking my film[MASK] to villages in the west bank in gaza and in east jerusalem <unk> i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation [MASK] in a village called wallajeh <unk> which sits very close to jerusalem <unk> the community was facing a[MASK] <unk> very similar plight to budrus they were going to be surrounded lose a lot of their lands[MASK] and not have freedom of access <unk> either to the west bank or jerusalem <unk> [MASK] they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention [MASK] so we organized a screening a week later[MASK] <unk> the organizers say that the villagers upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing [MASK] that people cared <unk> [MASK] so they kept on going [MASK] on the israeli side there is a new peace movement called solidariot <unk> which means solidarity in hebrew <unk> [MASK] the leaders of this movement have been using budrus[MASK] as one of their primary recruiting tools <unk> [MASK] they report that israelis who had never been active before <unk> upon seeing the film understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities <unk> [MASK] the examples of wallajeh <unk> and the solidariot movement show that even a[MASK] <unk> independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior <unk> [MASK] now imagine the power that big media players could have[MASK] if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like bil 'in ni 'lin wallajeh <unk> [MASK] in jerusalem neighborhoods like sheikh jarrah and silwan[MASK] the nonviolent leaders[MASK] would become more visible <unk> valued and effective in their work i believe that[MASK] the most important thing is is to understand that if we don 't pay attention[MASK] to these efforts <unk> they are invisible and it 's as if they never happened but i have seen first hand that[MASK] if we do they will multiply[MASK] <unk> multiply <unk> if they multiply their influence will grow in the overall <unk>[MASK] <unk> conflict and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation [MASK] these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus <unk> let 's give them attention[MASK] so they can prove it works everywhere[MASK]
