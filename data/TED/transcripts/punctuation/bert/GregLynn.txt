 <unk> i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that 's tracked by architecture what 's interesting about architects is [MASK] we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature and[MASK] <unk> arguably <unk> beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature <unk> so <unk> for roughly three hundred years the hot debate in architecture[MASK] was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one fifth of your head [MASK] or because your head[MASK] <unk> of your body [MASK] and the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet it wasn 't the <unk> 16th century[MASK] and[MASK] everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions <unk> so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as ten[MASK] get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision finer and finer and finer in the <unk> <unk> 15th century the decimal point was invented architects <unk>[MASK] <unk> stopped using fractions and they had a new model of nature <unk> so <unk> what 's going on[MASK] and which is using digital tools <unk> and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form and it has a lot of implications[MASK] <unk> in the way we think about nature <unk> [MASK] the best example of this would probably be the gothic and the gothic was invented after the invention of calculus although the gothic architects weren 't really using <unk>[MASK] <unk> calculus to define their forms <unk> but what was important is the gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form <unk> [MASK] <unk> cross you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines so you 're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form <unk>[MASK] <unk> much later robert maillart 's bridges which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola <unk> [MASK] <unk> the end of the <unk> 19th century beginning of the 20th century and how that hanging chain model translates into archways[MASK] and vaulting [MASK] so in all of these examples structure is the determining force frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams[MASK] and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall[MASK] interestingly in the last ten years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery with the structural engineer chris williams [MASK] in all these examples there 's one ideal form <unk> because these are thought in terms of structure <unk> and as an architect i 've always found these kinds of systems very limiting because[MASK] <unk> i 'm not interested in ideal forms and i 'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment so what i thought i would[MASK] bring up is another component that needs to be thought of whenever you think about nature <unk> and that 's basically the invention of[MASK] generic form in genetic[MASK] <unk> my hero is actually not darwin it 's a guy named william bateson father of greg bateson who was here for a long time[MASK] in monterey <unk> and he was what you 'd call a teratologist he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules <unk>[MASK] <unk> and laws rather than looking at the norms so instead of trying to find the ideal type[MASK] he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb <unk> when i first saw this image <unk> [MASK] ten years ago i actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time <unk> beautiful because it has symmetry <unk> [MASK] so <unk> what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations <unk> instead of[MASK] having a thumb <unk> you would either get another opposable thumb <unk> or you would get four fingers so the mutations reverted[MASK] <unk> to symmetry <unk> [MASK] and bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking [MASK] which is that wherever you lose information in a system <unk> [MASK] you revert back to symmetry so symmetry wasn 't the sign of order and organization which is what i was always understanding and as is an architect[MASK] symmetry was the absence of information <unk> so whenever you lost information you 'd move to symmetry[MASK] <unk> you added information to a system you would break symmetry so this whole idea of natural form[MASK] shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and[MASK] and generic form <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> literally after seeing that image and finding out what bateson was working with we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and[MASK] <unk> branching to start to think about architectural form <unk> [MASK] to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we 're using now and how they integrate calculus <unk> the fact that <unk>[MASK] means that we don 't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or[MASK] <unk> in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components so there might be[MASK] up to say fifty thousand pieces of material in this room you 're sitting in right now[MASK] that all need to get organized now typically you 'd think that they would all be the same like the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension you know[MASK] i haven 't verified this but it 's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension [MASK] because you 'd want to space them all out for everybody 's sight lines[MASK] <unk> the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting they 're all losing their modular quality <unk> and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions that 's because we 're all using calculus tools for manufacturing[MASK] and for design [MASK] calculus is also a mathematics of curves so even a straight line <unk> defined with calculus is a curve it 's just a curve without inflection [MASK] <unk> a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields whether it 's automobiles architecture products <unk> etc it 's really being affected by <unk>[MASK] <unk> this digital medium of curvature the intricacies of scale that come out of that you know in the example of the nose to the face there 's a fractional <unk>[MASK] <unk> with calculus the whole idea of subdivision is more complex because the whole and the parts are one continuous series it 's[MASK] too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus so i brought some images to just describe how that works this[MASK] is a korean church that we did in queens <unk> and in this example you can see that the components of this[MASK] <unk> but they 're repetitive without being modular each one of the elements in this structure[MASK] is a unique distance and dimension and all of the connections are unique angles now the only way we could design that [MASK] or possibly construct it is by using a <unk>[MASK] definition of the form it also is much more dynamic so that you can see that the same[MASK] <unk> opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it so the same space that appears to be a kind <unk>[MASK] <unk> of closed volume <unk> when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista <unk> [MASK] changes also in architecture [MASK] that we 're starting to look now not for some ideal form <unk> like a latin cross for a church <unk> but actually all the traits of a church <unk> so <unk> [MASK] light that comes from behind from an invisible source[MASK] <unk> directionality that focuses you towards an altar it turns out it 's not[MASK] rocket science to design a sacred space you just need to incorporate a certain[MASK] <unk> number of traits in a very kind of genetic way <unk> [MASK] so <unk> these are the different perspectives of that interior which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form [MASK] in terms of construction and manufacturing this is a[MASK] housing block that was built in the ' 70s in[MASK] <unk> here we 've broken the five hundred apartments up into small neighborhoods <unk> and differentiated those neighborhoods <unk> [MASK] i won 't go into too much description of any of these projects but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building[MASK] are all held up by one hundred and[MASK] structural trusses[MASK] <unk> because we 're using escalators to move people all of these trusses are picking up diagonal[MASK] loads <unk> so every one of them is a little bit <unk>[MASK] <unk> you move down the length of the building <unk> so <unk> working with[MASK] bentley and microstation we 've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these[MASK] <unk> so that if we change any element along the length of the building not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses <unk> [MASK] but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building <unk> so it 's a single calculation[MASK] for every single component of the building[MASK] that we 're adding onto so it 's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between[MASK] <unk> a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel <unk> but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized[MASK] relationship of all these components one to another [MASK] this idea has kind of brought me into doing some product design <unk> and it 's because[MASK] design firms that have connections to architects like i 'm working with vitra[MASK] which is a furniture company and alessi which is a houseware company [MASK] they saw this actually solving a problem this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic <unk> so <unk> [MASK] not to pick on bmw or to celebrate them but[MASK] take bmw as an example they have to in two thousand and[MASK] <unk> have a distinct identity for all their models of cars so the three hundred series or whatever their newest car is the one hundred series that 's coming out [MASK] has to look like the seven hundred series at the other end of their product line so they need a distinct coherent identity which is bmw [MASK] at the same time there 's a person paying thirty thousand dollars for a 300 series car and a person paying seventy thousand dollars for a seven hundred series <unk> and that person paying more than double[MASK] doesn 't want their car to look too much like the <unk> bottom of the market car so they have to also discriminate between these products <unk> so <unk> [MASK] as manufacturing starts to allow more[MASK] design options [MASK] this problem gets exacerbated of the whole and the parts now as an architect part to whole relationships is all i think about but in terms of product design it 's becoming more and more of[MASK] <unk> an issue[MASK] for companies <unk> so <unk> the first kind of test product we did was with alessi which was for a coffee and tea set it 's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set we <unk>[MASK] <unk> knew that at the beginning so i actually went to some people i knew down south in san diego and we used[MASK] <unk> just cut a[MASK] graphite mold <unk> put it in an oven heat it to one thousand degrees[MASK] <unk> gently inflate titanium that 's soft and then explode it at the last minute into this form <unk> [MASK] but what 's great about it is the forms are only a few hundred dollars <unk> the titanium 's several thousand dollars but the forms are very cheap <unk> [MASK] so <unk> we designed a system here[MASK] of eight curves that could be swapped[MASK] <unk> similar to that housing project i showed you [MASK] and we could recombine those together so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way that <unk>[MASK] <unk> way <unk> each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars <unk> and get incredible variation in the components[MASK] <unk> this is one of those examples of the sets [MASK] so for me what was important is that this coffee set which is just a coffee pot a teapot and those are the pots sitting on a tray[MASK] that they would have a coherence so they would be greg lynn alessi coffee pots but that everyone who bought one would have a one of a kind object that was unique in some way [MASK] to go back to architecture what 's organic about architecture as a field unlike product design[MASK] <unk> is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm like we have to design things which are coherent as a single object [MASK] but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale [MASK] architects tend to work[MASK] with signature[MASK] <unk> so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to say skyscrapers <unk> and that problem of signatures is a thing we 're very good at maintaining and working with [MASK] and intricacy which is the relationship of say <unk> the shape of a building its structure its windows its color its pattern [MASK] these are real architectural problems <unk> so <unk> [MASK] my kind of hero[MASK] for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs i got[MASK] <unk> in them because they 're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the[MASK] let 's call it the decoration i know the frog doesn 't think of it as decoration but that 's how it works[MASK] are all intricately connected to one another so a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern <unk> [MASK] <unk> the pattern and the form aren 't the same thing but they really work together and are fused in some way <unk> so <unk> when doing[MASK] a center for the national parks in costa rica <unk> we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building <unk> [MASK] we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum <unk> so it 's all one[MASK] continuous change in the massing but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms [MASK] in a housing project in valencia spain we 're doing the[MASK] different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass <unk> like a kind of monolith <unk> but it breaks down[MASK] into individual elements <unk> [MASK] <unk> can see that that change in massing also gives all forty eight of the apartments a unique shape and size <unk> but always within a kind of controlled[MASK] limit an envelope of change [MASK] i work with a group of other architects we have a company called united architects we were one of the finalists for the world trade center site design [MASK] and i think this just shows how[MASK] <unk> how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site [MASK] and to do that we tried to connect up[MASK] the five towers into a single system <unk> and we looked[MASK] <unk> there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing [MASK] we really approached it at the level of the typology of the building <unk> where we could build these five separate towers but they would all join at the <unk> 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass <unk> [MASK] with united architects also we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system <unk> [MASK] but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere[MASK] but again you can see this kind of organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole but breaks down into smaller parts but in an incredibly organic way[MASK]
