 <unk> the study of fishes it looks like a big <unk> boring word [MASK] but it 's actually quite exciting because ichthyology is the only ology with yolo[MASK] <unk> to the cool kids in the audience you already know yolo stands for you only live once [MASK] and because i only have one life i 'm going to spend it doing what i always dreamt of doing seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species <unk> and that 's what i get to do <unk> [MASK] now in recent years i really focused on caves for finding new species <unk> and it turns out there 's lots of new cavefish species out there [MASK] you just have to know where to look [MASK] and to maybe be a little thin[MASK] <unk> now cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology [MASK] they can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little holes <unk> [MASK] and they can tell me about the evolution of sight <unk> by being blind [MASK] now fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours all vertebrates[MASK] <unk> and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark cold cave environment [MASK] over many many generations they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here <unk> [MASK] now <unk> each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way <unk> [MASK] and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us <unk> and that 's why it 's so exciting when we find a new species [MASK] so this is a new[MASK] <unk> its closest relatives are cavefishes in kentucky in the mammoth cave system and they start to diverge when the ohio river split them a few million years ago <unk> [MASK] and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness <unk> [MASK] there 's this gene called rhodopsin that 's super critical for sight we have it and these species have it too[MASK] <unk> species has lost all function in that gene and the other one maintains it [MASK] so this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision and at the very roots of how we can see <unk> [MASK] but the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time maybe no[MASK] <unk> more so than in this species here this is a new species we described from madagascar that we named[MASK] that means big sickness in malagasy for how sick we got trying to collect this species <unk> [MASK] now <unk> believe it or not <unk> swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn 't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life[MASK] despite the fact that it tried to kill us <unk> [MASK] and that 's because this species in madagascar its closest relatives are six thousand kilometers away cavefishes in australia [MASK] now there 's no way a three inch long freshwater cavefish can swim across the indian ocean [MASK] so what we found when we compared the dna of these species is that they 've been separated for more than one hundred million years <unk> or about the time that the southern continents[MASK] <unk> southern continents were last together [MASK] so in fact these species didn 't move at all it 's the continents that moved them [MASK] and so they give us through their dna this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events [MASK] now this species here is so new i 'm not even allowed to tell you its name[MASK] <unk> can tell you it 's a new species from mexico <unk> and it 's probably already extinct [MASK] it 's probably extinct because the only known cave system it 's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby <unk> [MASK] unfortunately for cavefishes their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water <unk> [MASK] now <unk> we actually don 't know this species ' closest relative yet it doesn 't appear to be anything else in mexico[MASK] <unk> so maybe it 's something in cuba <unk> or florida <unk> or india <unk> [MASK] but whatever it is it might tell us something new about the geology of the caribbean or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness <unk> [MASK] but i hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too <unk> [MASK] and i 'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes[MASK] that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet[MASK] and the biology of how we see <unk> thank you[MASK]
