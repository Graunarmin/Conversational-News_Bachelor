 <unk> when i was eleven <unk> seeing some of my friends leaving the school because their parents could not afford textbooks[MASK] made me angry <unk> [MASK] when i was twenty seven hearing the plight of a desperate[MASK] slave father[MASK] whose daughter was about to be sold to a brothel[MASK] made me angry <unk> [MASK] at the age of fifty[MASK] the street in a pool of blood <unk> along with my own son [MASK] made me angry <unk> [MASK] dear friends for centuries[MASK] we were taught anger is bad our parents <unk> teachers priests everyone taught us[MASK] how to control and suppress our anger[MASK] but i ask why [MASK] why can 't we convert our anger for the larger good of society <unk> [MASK] why can 't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world [MASK] that i tried to do[MASK] <unk> friends <unk> [MASK] most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger <unk> like when i was[MASK] it has given birth to a new idea <unk> but i will come to that later on let me begin with[MASK] the story of how i got a name for myself <unk> [MASK] i had been a big admirer of mahatma gandhi since my childhood[MASK] <unk> and lead india 's freedom movement <unk> but more importantly he taught us[MASK] how to treat the most[MASK] vulnerable sections the most deprived people with dignity and respect [MASK] and so when[MASK] india was celebrating mahatma gandhi 's birth centenary in[MASK] and sixty nine at that time i was fifteen[MASK] an idea came to my mind [MASK] why can 't we celebrate it differently <unk> i knew as perhaps[MASK] many of you might know that in india a large number of people are born in the lowest[MASK] segment of caste [MASK] and they are treated as untouchables <unk> these are the people forget about[MASK] allowing them to go to the temples <unk> they cannot even go into the houses and shops[MASK] of high caste people <unk> so i[MASK] i was very impressed with the leaders of my[MASK] <unk> speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of gandhian ideals <unk> [MASK] so inspired by that i thought let us set an example by inviting these people[MASK] to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community <unk> i went to[MASK] some[MASK] <unk> it 's not possible it never happened [MASK] i said look at these leaders <unk> they are so great <unk> they are against untouchability they will come if nobody comes we can set an example [MASK] these people thought that[MASK] <unk> they were convinced my friends and i took our bicycles and invited[MASK] political leaders <unk> and i was so thrilled <unk> rather empowered[MASK] to see that each one of them agreed to come <unk> [MASK] i thought great idea we can set an example we can bring about change in the society[MASK] the day has come <unk> all these[MASK] untouchables <unk> three women and two men <unk> they[MASK] agreed to come <unk> i could recall that[MASK] they had used the best of their clothes <unk> they brought new utensils[MASK] they had taken baths hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do <unk> it was the moment of change [MASK] they gathered food was cooked it was seven o 'clock [MASK] by eight o 'clock we kept on waiting [MASK] because it 's not very uncommon that the leaders become late for an hour or so[MASK] <unk> so after eight o 'clock <unk> we took our bicycles and went to these leaders ' homes just to remind them [MASK] one of the leader 's wives[MASK] told me sorry <unk> he is having some headache perhaps he cannot come [MASK] i went to another leader and his wife told[MASK] he will definitely join so i thought that[MASK] the dinner will take place <unk> though not at that large a scale <unk> [MASK] i went back to the venue which was[MASK] a newly built mahatma gandhi park[MASK] it was ten o 'clock <unk> none of the[MASK] <unk> leaders showed up that made me angry [MASK] i was standing <unk> leaning against mahatma gandhi 's statue <unk> [MASK] i was emotionally drained <unk> rather exhausted[MASK] <unk> sat down where the food was lying <unk> [MASK] i kept my emotions on hold <unk> [MASK] but then when i took the first bite <unk> i broke down in tears and suddenly i felt[MASK] a hand[MASK] <unk> and it was the healing motherly touch[MASK] of an untouchable woman and she told me kailash why are you crying [MASK] you have done your bit <unk> you have eaten the food cooked by untouchables which has never happened in our memory[MASK] <unk> she was right <unk> [MASK] i came back home a little after midnight <unk> [MASK] shocked to see that several high caste elderly people were sitting in my courtyard <unk> [MASK] i saw my mother and elderly women were crying and they were pleading[MASK] to these elderly people because they had threatened to outcaste my whole family[MASK] and you know outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of [MASK] somehow they agreed to punish only me <unk> [MASK] and the punishment was purification that means i had to go six hundred miles away from my hometown[MASK] <unk> river ganges to take a holy dip <unk> [MASK] and after that i should organize a feast for priests one hundred and one priests wash their feet and drink that water [MASK] it was total nonsense <unk> and i refused to accept that punishment [MASK] how did they punish me <unk> i was barred from entering into my own kitchen[MASK] and my own dining room my utensils were separated[MASK] <unk> but the night when i was angry <unk> [MASK] they wanted to outcaste me <unk> [MASK] but i decided to outcaste the entire caste system [MASK] and that was possible because[MASK] the beginning would have been to change the family name or surname[MASK] <unk> in india most of the family names are caste names <unk> so i decided to drop my name <unk> [MASK] and then <unk> later on i gave a new name to myself[MASK] friends <unk> maybe one of you can tell me what[MASK] was i doing before becoming a children 's rights activist <unk> does anybody know <unk> [MASK] no <unk> [MASK] i was an engineer an electrical engineer and then i learned[MASK] how[MASK] the energy[MASK] <unk> of burning fire <unk> coal [MASK] the nuclear blast inside the chambers <unk> raging river currents[MASK] fierce winds [MASK] could be converted into the light and lives of millions <unk> [MASK] i also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy[MASK] <unk> could be harnessed for good and making society better <unk> so[MASK] i 'll come back to[MASK] the story of when i was caught in the prison <unk> i was very happy freeing a dozen children from slavery[MASK] <unk> handing them over to their parents <unk> i cannot explain my joy when i free a child <unk> [MASK] i was so happy <unk> [MASK] but when i was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown delhi <unk> [MASK] i saw that dozens of children were arriving <unk> they were being trafficked by someone <unk> i stopped them <unk> those people <unk> [MASK] <unk> i complained to the police <unk> so the policemen instead of helping me <unk> they threw me in this small <unk> tiny[MASK] shell <unk> like an animal <unk> [MASK] and that was the night of anger when one of the brightest and biggest ideas was born <unk> [MASK] i thought that if i keep on freeing ten children and fifty more will join <unk> [MASK] that 's not done and i believed in the power of consumers and let me tell you[MASK] <unk> that this was the first time[MASK] when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world [MASK] to educate and sensitize the consumers[MASK] to create a demand for[MASK] <unk> rugs in europe and america we have been successful <unk>[MASK] <unk> it has resulted[MASK] in a fall[MASK] in child labor in south asian countries by eighty percent [MASK] not only that [MASK] but this first ever consumer 's power or consumer 's campaign[MASK] has grown in other countries and other industries <unk> maybe chocolate maybe apparel maybe shoes it has gone beyond[MASK] my anger at the age of eleven when i realized how important education is for every child [MASK] i got an idea to collect used books[MASK] and help the poorest children i created a book bank at the at the age of[MASK] <unk> but i did not stop later on i cofounded the[MASK] world 's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the global campaign for education [MASK] that has helped in changing[MASK] the whole thinking towards education from the charity mode to the human rights mode <unk> and that has concretely helped the reduction of[MASK] <unk> my anger at the age of twenty seven to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel [MASK] has given me an idea to[MASK] go for a new strategy of raid and rescue freeing children from slavery[MASK] and i am[MASK] so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or ten or twenty <unk> [MASK] but my colleagues and i have been able to physically liberate eighty three thousand child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers[MASK] i knew that we needed global policies[MASK] <unk> organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in[MASK] a new international convention[MASK] to protect the children who are in the worst forms <unk> [MASK] and the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down[MASK] <unk> by one third in the last fifteen years[MASK] <unk> anger is an energy and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never be vanished [MASK] can never be destroyed <unk> so why can 't[MASK] the energy of anger[MASK] <unk> be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world a more just and equitable[MASK] <unk> world anger is within each one of you and[MASK] i will share a secret for a few seconds that if[MASK] we are confined in the narrow shells of egos <unk> and the circles of[MASK] <unk> then the anger will turn out to be hatred [MASK] violence <unk> revenge destruction <unk> [MASK] but if we are able to break the circles then the same anger could[MASK] turn into a great power <unk> we can break the circles by using our inherent compassion[MASK] and connect with the world through compassion to make this world better that same anger could be transformed into it[MASK] so dear friends sisters and brothers <unk> again as a nobel laureate <unk> i am urging you to become angry <unk> [MASK] i am urging you to become angry <unk> [MASK] and the angriest among us is the one[MASK] <unk> inspiration to others who or what inspires you and why[MASK] chris let me tell you and that is the truth each time[MASK] when i free a child the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother the first[MASK] smile of freedom <unk> and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter can ever come back and sit in her lap[MASK] become so emotional and the first tear of joy rolls down on her cheek <unk> [MASK] i see the glimpse of god in it this is my biggest inspiration and i am so lucky that not once as i said before but thousands of times [MASK] i have been able to witness my god in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations <unk> thank you[MASK]
