 <unk> when i was eighteen years old i had the golden opportunity to go on an international exchange program <unk> ironically i 'm an australian[MASK] <unk> who prefers proper icy cold weather so i was both excited and tearful[MASK] when i got on a plane to iceland after just having farewelled my parents and brothers goodbye <unk> i was welcomed into the home of a beautiful icelandic family[MASK] who took me hiking <unk> and helped me get a grasp of the melodic icelandic language [MASK] i struggled a bit with the initial period of homesickness i snowboarded after school <unk> and i slept a lot [MASK] two hours of chemistry class in a language that you don 't yet[MASK] <unk> understand can be a pretty good sedative [MASK] laughter my teacher recommended i try out for the school play just to get me a bit more socially active it[MASK] turns out i didn 't end up being part of the play <unk> but through it i met thordis [MASK] we shared a lovely teenage romance and we 'd meet at lunchtimes to just hold hands and walk around old downtown reykjavk i met her welcoming family[MASK] and she met my friends we 'd been in a budding relationship for a bit over a month when our school 's christmas ball was held thordis elva [MASK] i was sixteen and in love for the first time <unk> [MASK] going together to the christmas dance was a public confirmation of our relationship <unk> and i felt like the luckiest girl in the world <unk> [MASK] no longer a child but a young woman[MASK] <unk> my newfound maturity <unk> i felt it was only natural to try drinking rum for the first time that night too [MASK] that was a bad idea[MASK] <unk> i became very ill drifting in and out of consciousness in between spasms of convulsive vomiting [MASK] the security guards wanted to call me an ambulance <unk> but tom acted as my knight in[MASK] <unk> and told them he 'd take me home it was like a fairy tale <unk> his strong arms around me <unk> laying me in the safety of my bed <unk> [MASK] but the gratitude that i felt towards him soon turned to horror[MASK] as he proceeded to take off my clothes[MASK] and get on top of me <unk> [MASK] my head had cleared up but my body was still too weak to fight back and the pain was blinding <unk> i thought i 'd be severed in two[MASK] in order to stay sane i silently counted the seconds on my alarm clock <unk> [MASK] and ever since that night i 've known that there are seven thousand two hundred seconds in two hours [MASK] despite limping for days and crying for weeks this incident[MASK] didn 't fit my ideas about rape like i 'd seen on tv [MASK] tom wasn 't an armed lunatic he was my boyfriend <unk> and it didn 't happen in a seedy alleyway <unk> it happened in my own bed <unk> [MASK] by the time i could identify what had happened to me as rape he had completed his exchange program and left for australia [MASK] so i told myself it was pointless to address what had happened [MASK] <unk> it had to have been my fault somehow <unk> [MASK] i was raised in a world where girls are taught that they get raped for a reason [MASK] their skirt was too short <unk> their smile was too wide their breath smelled of alcohol <unk> [MASK] and i was guilty of all of those things so the shame had to be mine <unk> [MASK] it took me years to realize that only one thing could have stopped me from being raped that night <unk> and it wasn 't[MASK] <unk> skirt <unk> it wasn 't my smile <unk> it wasn 't my childish trust <unk> [MASK] the only thing that could 've stopped me from being raped that night is the man who raped me[MASK] had he stopped himself ts i have vague memories of the next day <unk> [MASK] the after effects of drinking a certain hollowness that i tried[MASK] but i didn 't show up at thordis 's door [MASK] it is important to now state that i didn 't see my deed for what it was [MASK] the word rape didn 't echo around my mind as it should 've and i wasn 't crucifying myself with memories of the night before it wasn[MASK] 't so much a conscious refusal it was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden[MASK] <unk> my definition of my actions completely refuted any recognition of the immense trauma i caused <unk> thordis [MASK] to be honest <unk> i repudiated the entire act[MASK] in the days afterwards[MASK] and when i was committing it [MASK] i disavowed the truth by convincing myself it was sex and not rape <unk> and this is a lie[MASK] spine bending guilt for [MASK] i broke up with thordis a couple of days later and then saw her a number of times during the remainder of my year in iceland <unk> [MASK] feeling a sharp stab of heavyheartedness each time [MASK] deep down i knew i 'd done something immeasurably wrong <unk> [MASK] but without planning it i sunk the memories deep <unk> and then i tied a rock to them[MASK] <unk> what followed is a nine year period that can best be titled as denial and running [MASK] when i got a chance to identify the real torment that i caused <unk> i didn 't stand still long enough to do so whether it[MASK] be via distraction <unk> substance use thrill seeking or[MASK] the scrupulous policing of my inner speak <unk> i refused to be static and silent[MASK] with this noise i also drew heavily upon other parts of my life to construct a picture of who i was <unk> [MASK] i was a surfer a social science student a friend to good people a loved brother and son <unk> [MASK] an outdoor recreation guide <unk> and eventually a youth worker <unk> [MASK] i gripped tight to the simple notion that i wasn 't a bad person[MASK] i didn 't think i had this in my bones i thought i was made up of something else [MASK] in my nurtured upbringing my loving extended family and role models [MASK] people close to me were warm and genuine in their respect shown towards women it[MASK] took me a long time to stare down this dark corner of myself and to ask it questions[MASK] <unk> nine years after the christmas dance i was twenty five years old and headed straight for a nervous breakdown [MASK] my self worth was buried under a soul crushing load of silence that isolated me from everyone that i cared about [MASK] and i was consumed with misplaced hatred and anger that i took out on myself [MASK] one day <unk> i stormed out of the door in tears after a fight with a loved one[MASK] <unk> and i wandered into a caf where i asked the waitress for a pen <unk> [MASK] i always had a notebook with me <unk> claiming that it was to jot down ideas in moments of inspiration <unk> but the truth[MASK] was that i needed to be constantly fidgeting because in moments of stillness <unk> i found myself counting seconds again [MASK] but that day i watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen[MASK] <unk> forming the most pivotal letter i 've ever written addressed to tom [MASK] along with an account of the violence that he subjected me to the words i want to find forgiveness stared back at me <unk> surprising nobody more than myself <unk> [MASK] but deep down i realized that this was my way out of my suffering because regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness[MASK] i deserved peace my era of shame was over [MASK] before sending the letter i prepared myself for all kinds of negative responses or what i found likeliest <unk> no response whatsoever <unk> [MASK] the only outcome that i didn 't prepare myself for was the one that i then got[MASK] a typed confession from tom[MASK] <unk> of disarming regret as it turns out he too had been imprisoned by silence <unk> and this marked the start of an[MASK] <unk> correspondence that god knows was never easy but always honest <unk> i relieved myself of the burdens that i 'd wrongfully shouldered[MASK] <unk> and he in turn wholeheartedly owned up to what he 'd done [MASK] our written exchanges became a platform to dissect the consequences of that night <unk> [MASK] and they were everything from gut wrenching to healing beyond words <unk> [MASK] and yet it didn 't bring about closure for me <unk> [MASK] perhaps because the email format didn 't feel personal enough <unk> perhaps because it 's easy to be brave when you 're hiding behind a computer screen on the other side of the planet <unk> [MASK] but we 'd begun a[MASK] <unk> dialogue that i felt was necessary to explore to its fullest [MASK] so after eight years of writing and nearly sixteen years after that dire night <unk> [MASK] i mustered the courage to propose a wild idea [MASK] that we 'd meet up in person and face our past once and for all ts [MASK] iceland and australia are geographically like this[MASK] in the middle of the two is south africa <unk> we decided upon the city of cape town <unk> and there we met for one week [MASK] the city itself proved to be a stunningly powerful environment to focus on reconciliation and forgiveness <unk> [MASK] nowhere else has healing and rapprochement been tested like it has in south africa [MASK] as a nation south africa sought to sit within[MASK] <unk> the truth of its past <unk> and to listen to the details of its history <unk> [MASK] knowing this only magnified the effect that cape town had on us [MASK] over the course of this week <unk> we literally spoke our life stories to each other from start to finish <unk> [MASK] and this was about analyzing our own history <unk> [MASK] we followed a strict policy of being honest[MASK] and this also came with a certain exposure an open chested vulnerability there were gutting confessions <unk> and moments where we just[MASK] absolutely couldn 't fathom the other person 's experience <unk> [MASK] the seismic effects of sexual violence were spoken aloud and felt face to face[MASK] <unk> we found a soaring clarity <unk> and even some[MASK] totally unexpected but liberating laughter when it came down to it we did out best[MASK] to listen to each other intently <unk> and our individual realities were aired with an an unfiltered purity[MASK] that couldn 't do any less than lighten the soul[MASK] wanting to take revenge is a very human emotion[MASK] instinctual even and all i wanted to do for years was to hurt tom back as deeply as he had hurt me <unk> [MASK] but had i not found a way out of the hatred and anger i 'm not sure i 'd be standing here today [MASK] <unk> to say that i didn 't have my doubts along the way [MASK] when the plane bounced on that landing strip in cape town <unk> i remember thinking why did i not just get myself a therapist and a bottle of vodka like <unk>[MASK] <unk> a normal person would do [MASK] at times our search for understanding in cape town felt like an impossible quest [MASK] and all i wanted to do was to give up and go home to my loving husband vidir and our son[MASK] but despite our difficulties this journey did result in a victorious feeling[MASK] that light had triumphed over darkness that something constructive could be built out of the ruins <unk> [MASK] i read somewhere that you should try and be the person that you needed when you were younger <unk> and back when i was a teenager[MASK] <unk> i would have needed to know that the shame wasn 't mine that there 's hope after rape [MASK] that you can even find happiness like i share with my husband today <unk> [MASK] which is why i started writing feverishly upon my return from cape town [MASK] resulting in a book co authored by tom that we hope can be of use to people from both ends of the <unk>[MASK] <unk> scale if nothing else[MASK] <unk> else <unk> it 's a story that we would 've needed to hear when we were younger <unk> [MASK] given the nature of our story i know the words that inevitably accompany it[MASK] victim <unk> rapist and labels are a way to organize concepts but they can also be dehumanizing in their[MASK] <unk> once someone 's been deemed a victim <unk> it 's that much easier to file them away as someone damaged <unk> [MASK] dishonored less than <unk> [MASK] and likewise once someone has been branded a rapist it 's that much easier to call him a monster[MASK] inhuman <unk> but how will we understand what it is in human societies that produces violence[MASK] if we refuse to recognize the humanity of those who commit it[MASK] and how [MASK] and how can we empower survivors if we 're making them feel less than [MASK] how can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats to the lives of women and children around the world [MASK] if the very words we use are part of the[MASK] <unk> what i 've now learnt my actions that night in <unk>[MASK] were a self centered taking i felt deserving of thordis 's body [MASK] i 've had primarily positive social influences and examples of equitable behavior around me <unk> [MASK] but on that occasion <unk> i chose to draw upon the negative ones <unk>[MASK] <unk> ones that see women as having less intrinsic worth and of men having some unspoken and symbolic claim to their bodies <unk> [MASK] these influences i speak of are external to me though <unk> [MASK] and it was only me in that room making choices <unk> nobody else [MASK] when you own something and really square up to your culpability <unk> i do think a surprising thing can happen[MASK] it 's what i call a paradox of ownership[MASK] i thought i 'd buckle under the weight of responsibility <unk> i thought my certificate of humanity would be burnt <unk> [MASK] instead <unk> i was offered to really own what i did and found that it didn 't possess the entirety of who i am <unk> [MASK] put simply something you 've done[MASK] doesn 't have to constitute the sum of who you are[MASK] <unk> the noise in my head abated <unk> the indulgent self pity was starved of oxygen <unk> and it was replaced[MASK] with the clean air of acceptance[MASK] an acceptance that i did hurt this wonderful person standing next to me [MASK] an acceptance that i am part of a large and shockingly everyday grouping of men who have been sexually violent toward their partners[MASK] 't underestimate the power of words <unk> saying to thordis that i raped her[MASK] changed my accord with myself as well as with her <unk> [MASK] but most importantly <unk> the blame transferred from thordis to me <unk> far too often the responsibility[MASK] <unk> is attributed to female survivors of sexual violence and not to the males who enact it <unk> [MASK] far too often <unk> the denial and running[MASK] leaves all parties at a great distance from the truth [MASK] there 's definitely a public conversation happening now [MASK] and like a lot of people <unk> we 're heartened that there 's less retreating from this difficult but important discussion <unk> [MASK] i feel a real responsibility to[MASK] <unk> add our voices to it te [MASK] what we did is not a formula that we 're prescribing for others <unk> [MASK] nobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain[MASK] or their greatest error <unk> breaking your silence is never[MASK] <unk> and depending on where you are in the world it can even be deadly to speak out about rape <unk> [MASK] i realize that even the most traumatic event of my life is still a testament to my privilege because i can talk about it without getting ostracized or even killed <unk> [MASK] but with that privilege of having a voice[MASK] comes the responsibility of using it[MASK] <unk> that 's the least i owe my fellow survivors[MASK] who can 't [MASK] the story we 've just relayed is unique <unk> and yet it is so common with sexual violence being a global pandemic <unk> [MASK] but it doesn 't have to be that way [MASK] one of the things that i found useful on my own healing journey is educating myself about sexual violence and as a result i 've been reading[MASK] <unk> writing and speaking about this issue for over a decade now <unk> going to conferences around the world [MASK] and in my experience <unk> the attendees of such events are almost exclusively women <unk> [MASK] but it 's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women 's issue[MASK] <unk> a majority of sexual violence[MASK] against women and men is perpetrated by men <unk> and yet their voices are sorely underrepresented in this discussion[MASK] but all of us are needed[MASK] here just imagine all the suffering we could alleviate if we[MASK] <unk> dared to face this issue together[MASK]
