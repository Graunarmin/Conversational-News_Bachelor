 <unk> i was on a long road trip this summer <unk> [MASK] and i was having a wonderful time listening to the amazing isabel wilkerson 's the warmth of other suns [MASK] it documents[MASK] six million black folks fleeing the south from[MASK] <unk> nine hundred and fifteen to one thousand nine hundred and seventy looking for a respite from all the brutality and trying to get to a better opportunity up north and[MASK] it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance of african americans [MASK] and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors and the humility and all the humiliations[MASK] it was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men [MASK] and i said you know this is a little deep i need a break <unk> i 'm going to turn on the radio [MASK] i turned it on and there it was ferguson[MASK] <unk> shot by a white police officer laid on the ground dead blood running[MASK] for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror and i thought [MASK] here it is again [MASK] <unk> this brutality against black men has been going on for centuries <unk> i mean it 's the same story it 's just different different names it could have been amadou diallo <unk> [MASK] it could have been sean bell <unk> it could have been oscar grant[MASK] <unk> it could have been trayvon martin [MASK] <unk> this brutality is really something that 's part of our national psyche it 's part of our[MASK] collective history <unk> what are we going to do about it <unk> you know that part of us that still[MASK] crosses the street <unk> locks the doors clutches the purses when we see young black men <unk> [MASK] that part <unk> [MASK] i mean[MASK] <unk> know we 're not shooting people down in the street but i 'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents[MASK] are in us we 've been schooled in them as well <unk> i believe that[MASK] we can stop these types of incidents these fergusons from happening[MASK] by looking within[MASK] and being willing to change ourselves <unk> so i have a call to action for you [MASK] there are three things that i want to offer us today to think about as ways to stop ferguson from happening again <unk> [MASK] three things that i think will help us reform our images of young black men <unk> three things that[MASK] <unk> i 'm hoping will not only protect them but will open the world[MASK] so that they can thrive can you imagine that can[MASK] you imagine our country embracing young black men <unk> seeing them as part of our future <unk> giving them that kind of openness that[MASK] kind of grace we give to people we love [MASK] how much better would our lives be how much better would our country be let me just start with number one <unk> [MASK] we gotta get out of denial[MASK] stop trying to be good people we need real people <unk> you know i do a lot of diversity work and people will come up to me at the beginning of[MASK] <unk> have a biased bone in our body [MASK] and i 'm like really because i do this work every day and i see all my biases i mean [MASK] not too long ago i was on a plane and i heard the voice of a <unk> woman pilot coming over the <unk> p a system and i was just <unk> so excited so thrilled [MASK] <unk> we are rocking it we are now in the stratosphere <unk> it was all good and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy <unk> and i was like [MASK] i hope she can drive [MASK] i know right but it 's not even like i knew that was a bias until i was coming back on the other leg and there 's always a guy driving and it 's often turbulent and bumpy and i 've never questioned the confidence of the male driver the[MASK] <unk> if you ask me explicitly i would say female pilot awesome [MASK] but it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome a little risky <unk> i lean on a bias that i didn 't even know that i had you[MASK] know fast moving planes in the sky i want a guy that 's my default men are my default[MASK] <unk> who is your default <unk> [MASK] who do you trust [MASK] who are you afraid of who do you implicitly feel connected to who do you run away from [MASK] i 'm going to tell you what we have learned the implicit association test which measures unconscious bias you can go online and take it five million people have[MASK] <unk> taken it <unk> turns out [MASK] our default is white <unk> we like white people we prefer white what do i mean by that when people are shown[MASK] images of black men and white men we are more quickly able to associate[MASK] that picture with a positive word that white person with a positive word than we are when we are trying to[MASK] <unk> associate positive with a black face <unk> and vice versa when we see a black face <unk> it is easier for us to connect[MASK] black with negative[MASK] than it is white with negative seventy percent[MASK] of white people taking that test prefer white fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white[MASK] <unk> you see we were all outside when the contamination came down[MASK] what do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates <unk> [MASK] you know <unk> one of the things that[MASK] you probably are thinking about and you 're probably like you know what i 'm just going to double down on my color blindness[MASK] <unk> recommit to that i 'm going to suggest to you no we 've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color the problem was never that we saw <unk>[MASK] <unk> color it was what we did when we saw the color <unk> it 's a false ideal <unk> [MASK] that 's keeping them from thriving and sometimes it 's causing them[MASK] an early death so in fact what the scientists are telling us is no way don[MASK] 't even think about color blindness <unk> in fact what they 're suggesting is stare at awesome black people[MASK] <unk> at them directly in their faces and memorize them because when we look at awesome folks who are black it helps to dissociate[MASK] the association that happens automatically in our brain why do you think i 'm showing[MASK] <unk> there were so many i had to cut them okay so here 's the thing <unk> i 'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are i 'm[MASK] trying to remind you[MASK] that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and[MASK] <unk> so here 's the thing the other possibility in science and it 's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions but[MASK] one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious[MASK] that you know <unk> and stick it up next to a person of color a black person who is fabulous then that sometimes actually causes[MASK] <unk> jeffrey dahmer and colin powell just stare at them <unk> right [MASK] but these are the things so go looking for your bias <unk> please please <unk> just get out of denial and go looking for <unk> disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old <unk>[MASK] <unk> stereotypes are wrong okay so that 's number one number two <unk> what i 'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them <unk> it 's not the hardest thing[MASK] <unk> to do but it 's also[MASK] <unk> one of these things where you have to be conscious and intentional about it you know i was in a wall street[MASK] area one time <unk> several years ago when i was with a colleague of mine and she 's really wonderful and she does diversity work with me and she 's a woman of color she 's korean <unk> and we were outside it was late at night and we were sort of wondering where we were going we were lost and i saw this person across the street[MASK] <unk> guy i was going toward him without even thinking about it and she was like oh that 's interesting [MASK] the guy across the street <unk> he was a black guy i think[MASK] black guys generally know where they 're going i don 't know why exactly i think that but that 's what i think <unk> so[MASK] she was[MASK] <unk> other direction same need same guy same clothes same time same street <unk> [MASK] different reaction and she said i feel so bad i 'm a diversity consultant i did the black guy thing i 'm a woman of color [MASK] oh my god and i said you know what <unk> please <unk> we really need to relax about this i mean you 've got to realize i go way back with black[MASK] <unk> i 've got a six <unk> ' five black guy son <unk> i was married to a black guy <unk> my black guy thing is so wide and so deep that i can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is [MASK] and he was my black guy he said yes ladies i know where you 're going i 'll take you there [MASK] you know biases are the stories we make up about people before we know who they actually are[MASK] <unk> but how are we going to know who they are[MASK] when we 've been told to avoid and be afraid of them so i 'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort <unk> [MASK] and i 'm not asking you to take any crazy risks i 'm saying [MASK] just do an inventory <unk> expand your social and professional circles who 's in your circle[MASK] <unk> who 's missing how many authentic relationships[MASK] do you have with young black people folks men <unk> women <unk> [MASK] or any other major difference from who you are and how you roll so to speak <unk>[MASK] <unk> just look around your periphery there may be somebody at work in your classroom in your house of worship somewhere there 's some black young guy there <unk> and you 're nice you say hi i 'm saying go deeper closer [MASK] further [MASK] and build the kinds of relationships the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes [MASK] i know some of you are out there i know because i have some white friends in particular that will say[MASK] <unk> have no idea how awkward i am like i don 't think this is going to work for me[MASK] i 'm sure i 'm going to blow this okay <unk> maybe but this thing is not about perfection it 's about connection <unk> [MASK] and you 're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable <unk> i mean you just have to do it and young black men what i 'm saying is if someone comes your way genuinely and[MASK] <unk> authentically take the invitation [MASK] not everyone is out to get you go looking for those people who can see your humanity you know it 's the[MASK] empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you something really powerful and beautiful happens [MASK] you start to realize that they are you [MASK] that they are part of you[MASK] <unk> that they are you in your family <unk> [MASK] and then we cease to be bystanders and we become actors we become advocates <unk> and we become allies <unk> [MASK] so go away from your comfort into a bigger brighter thing <unk> because that is[MASK] <unk> how we will stop another ferguson from happening that 's how we create a community where everybody <unk> especially young black men can thrive so this[MASK] last thing is going to be harder and i know it but i 'm just going to put it out there anyway when we see something we have to have the courage to say something even to the people we love you[MASK] know it 's holidays and it 's going to be a time when we 're sitting around the table and having a good[MASK] <unk> time many of us anyways will be in holidays and[MASK] you 've got to listen to the conversations around the table <unk> you start to say things like [MASK] grandma 's <unk>[MASK] uncle joe is racist and you know we[MASK] we love grandma and we love uncle joe we do we know they 're good people but what they 're saying is wrong <unk> [MASK] and we need to be able to say something because you know who else is at the table the[MASK] children are at the table and we wonder why these biases don 't die and move from generation to[MASK] <unk> because we 're not saying anything [MASK] we 've got to be willing to say grandma we don 't call people that anymore [MASK] uncle joe <unk> it isn 't true that he deserved that <unk> no one deserves that [MASK] and we 've got to be willing[MASK] to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents don 't have the luxury to do so[MASK] <unk> especially those who have young black sons we 've got to take our lovely darlings our future and we 've got to tell them[MASK] we have an amazing country[MASK] with incredible ideals we have worked incredibly hard and we have made some progress but we are not[MASK] <unk> we still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations [MASK] and it is making for despair[MASK] and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men <unk> [MASK] we still struggle you have to tell them with seeing both[MASK] the color[MASK] and the character of young black men <unk> [MASK] but that you <unk> [MASK] and you expect them to be part of the forces of change in this society that will stand against injustice and is willing [MASK] above all other things to make a society where[MASK] young black men can be seen for[MASK] all of who they are [MASK] so many amazing black men <unk> those who are[MASK] the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived[MASK] <unk> people who are powerful preachers [MASK] they are incredible scientists and artists and writers [MASK] they are dynamic comedians they are[MASK] doting grandpas <unk> caring sons[MASK] <unk> strong fathers and they are young men with dreams of their own <unk> thank you[MASK]
