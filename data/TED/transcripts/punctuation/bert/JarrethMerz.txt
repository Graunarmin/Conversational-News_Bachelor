 <unk> i was born in switzerland[MASK] and raised in ghana west africa ghana felt safe to me as a child <unk> i was free i was happy <unk> [MASK] <unk> marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in ghana but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability[MASK] and mismanagement in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i witnessed my first[MASK] military coup [MASK] we the children had gathered at a friend 's house <unk> [MASK] it was a dimly lit shack there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background and[MASK] a former head of state and general was being blindfolded[MASK] and tied to the pole <unk> the firing squad aimed <unk> fired[MASK] the general was dead now this was being broadcast live <unk> [MASK] and shortly after <unk> we left the country and we returned to switzerland <unk> [MASK] now europe came as a shock to me <unk> and[MASK] i think i started feeling the need to[MASK] to shed my skin in order to fit in i wanted to blend in like a chameleon i think it was a tactic of survival <unk> and it worked [MASK] or so i believed <unk> so here i was in two thousand and eight[MASK] wondering where i was in my life <unk> and i felt i was being typecast as an actor i was always playing the exotic african[MASK] the violent african the african terrorist <unk> [MASK] and i was thinking how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself and i[MASK] had become ashamed of the other the african in me <unk> [MASK] and fortunately i decided in two thousand and eight to return to ghana after twenty eight years of absence[MASK] <unk> i wanted to document on film the two thousand and eight presidential elections [MASK] and there i started by searching for the for the footprints in my childhood <unk> and[MASK] before i even knew it i was suddenly on a stage[MASK] surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political[MASK] rally <unk> and i realized that when i 'd left the country free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a[MASK] were a dream [MASK] and now that i 'd returned that dream had become reality <unk> though a fragile reality <unk> and i was thinking was ghana searching for its identity[MASK] like i was looking for my identity was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me <unk> and[MASK] it was as if through the standards of my[MASK] <unk> lived up to my full potential <unk> i mean nor had ghana even though we had been trying very hard <unk> now in <unk>[MASK] <unk> ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence [MASK] in the late 50s ghana and singapore had the same gdp <unk> [MASK] i mean today singapore is a first world country and ghana is not [MASK] but maybe it was time[MASK] to prove to myself yes it 's important to understand the past it is important[MASK] to look at it in a different light but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture[MASK] and build on those foundations in the present so here i was december 7th two thousand and eight [MASK] the polling stations opened to the to the voters at seven[MASK] <unk> but voters <unk> eager to take their own political fate into their hands [MASK] were starting to line up at four zero am in the morning <unk> [MASK] and they had traveled from near they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard <unk> [MASK] and i asked one of the voters i said whom are you going to vote for and he said i 'm sorry i can 't tell you [MASK] he said that his vote was in his heart and i understood this was their election and[MASK] <unk> weren 't going to let anyone take it away from them [MASK] now the first round of the voting didn 't bring forth a clear winner so nobody had achieved the absolute majority so voting went into a second round three weeks later [MASK] the candidates were back on the road they were campaigning <unk> the rhetoric of the candidates of course changed the heat was on and then[MASK] the cliche came to haunt us[MASK] there were claims of intimidation at the polling stations of ballot boxes being stolen <unk> [MASK] inflated results started coming in[MASK] and the mob was starting to get out of control we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets people were being beaten brutally[MASK] <unk> the army started firing their guns people were scrambling it was complete chaos <unk> [MASK] and my heart sank <unk> because i thought here we are again here is another proof[MASK] that the african is not capable of governing himself <unk> [MASK] and not only that i am documenting it documenting my own cultural shortcomings [MASK] so when the echo of the gunshots[MASK] <unk> it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob and i didn 't believe what i was hearing they were chanting we want peace <unk> we want peace [MASK] and i realized it had to come from the people [MASK] after all they decide <unk> and they did so the sounds that were before[MASK] distorted and loud were suddenly a melody the sounds of the voices were harmonious so it could happen[MASK] a democracy could be upheld peacefully [MASK] it could be by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace <unk> [MASK] now here 's an interesting[MASK] comparison we in the west we preach the[MASK] <unk> the golden light of democracy that we are the shining example of how it 's done <unk> but when it comes down to it ghana[MASK] found itself in the same place[MASK] in which the u s election stalled in the two thousand presidential elections bush versus gore <unk> but instead of the unwillingness[MASK] of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide[MASK] <unk> and its people it didn 't leave it up to the supreme court to decide the people did now[MASK] the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either <unk> i mean it was so incredibly close <unk> the electoral commissioner[MASK] declared with the consent of the parties to run an[MASK] <unk> so the people[MASK] went back to the polls[MASK] to determine their own president not the legal system and guess what it worked <unk> [MASK] the defeated candidate[MASK] gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle <unk> [MASK] i mean at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy <unk> they did not abuse their power[MASK] the belief in true democracy[MASK] and in the people runs deep proving that the african is capable of governing himself <unk> now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa[MASK] is not over <unk> but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted [MASK] now[MASK] i have learned that my[MASK] <unk> place is not just in the west or in africa <unk> and i 'm still searching for my identity <unk> but[MASK] i saw ghana create democracy better ghana taught me[MASK] to look at people differently and to look at myself differently and yes <unk> we africans can thank you[MASK]
