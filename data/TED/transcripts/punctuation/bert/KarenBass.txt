 <unk> i 'm a very lucky person [MASK] i 've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful earth and the people and creatures that live on it [MASK] and my passion was inspired at the age of seven when my parents first took me to morocco at the edge of the sahara[MASK] <unk> desert <unk> [MASK] now imagine a little brit somewhere that wasn 't cold and damp like home what an amazing experience <unk> [MASK] and it made me want to explore more <unk> [MASK] so as a filmmaker <unk> i 've been from one end of the earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot[MASK] and to capture animal behavior never seen before <unk> and what 's more[MASK] <unk> 'm really lucky <unk> because i get to share that with millions of people worldwide <unk> now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet[MASK] and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step [MASK] you might think that it 's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects <unk> but new technology is changing the way we can[MASK] <unk> film it 's enabling us to get fresh new images and tell brand new stories [MASK] in nature 's great events [MASK] a series for the bbc that i did with david attenborough <unk> we wanted to do just that images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar you see them all the[MASK] <unk> but there 's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed so[MASK] what we did we went to alaska <unk> which is where the grizzlies rely on really high <unk> almost inaccessible mountain slopes for their denning <unk> [MASK] and the only way to film that[MASK] is a shoot from the air[MASK] <unk> and british columbia <unk> thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep [MASK] there is nothing to eat up here <unk> but the conditions were ideal for hibernation <unk> [MASK] lots of snow in which to dig a den [MASK] to find food[MASK] <unk> mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast <unk> where the snow will already be melting <unk> [MASK] but getting down can be a challenge for small cubs[MASK] these <unk>[MASK] <unk> the fate of these bear families <unk> and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific depends on the salmon kb [MASK] i love that shot i always get goosebumps every time i see it [MASK] that was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro stabilized camera <unk> [MASK] and it 's a wonderful bit of gear <unk> because it 's like having a flying tripod crane and dolly all rolled into one[MASK] but technology alone isn 't enough [MASK] to really get the money shots it 's down to being in the right place at the right time and that sequence was especially difficult [MASK] the first year[MASK] we got nothing <unk> we had to go back the following year all the way back to the remote parts[MASK] <unk> and we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks and eventually we got lucky [MASK] the cloud lifted the wind was still <unk> and even the bear showed up and we managed to get that magic moment [MASK] for a filmmaker [MASK] new technology is an amazing tool <unk> but the other thing that really really excites me[MASK] is when new species are discovered <unk> now when i heard about one animal[MASK] <unk> i knew we had to get it for my next series untamed americas for national geographic [MASK] in two thousand and five [MASK] a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of ecuador <unk> and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery[MASK] of what pollinated a unique flower it depends solely on the bat[MASK] <unk> hasn 't even aired yet so you 're the very first to see this see what you think[MASK] <unk> but how to reach it <unk> [MASK] necessity is the mother of evolution[MASK] <unk> the longest relative to body length of any mammal[MASK] <unk> we filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower[MASK] and using a camera that could slow the action by forty times so imagine how quick that thing is in real life[MASK] now people often ask me where 's your favorite place on the planet [MASK] and the truth is i just don 't have one there are so many wonderful places <unk> [MASK] but some locations draw you back time and time again <unk> [MASK] and one remote location i first went there as a backpacker i 've been back several times for filming most recently for untamed americas[MASK] it 's the[MASK] <unk> altiplano in the high andes of south america <unk> and it 's the most otherworldly place i know <unk> [MASK] but at fifteen thousand feet it 's tough it 's freezing cold and[MASK] that thin air really gets you <unk> sometimes it 's hard to breathe especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment <unk> [MASK] and that pounding head just[MASK] <unk> feels like a constant hangover <unk> but the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere[MASK] is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity have a look[MASK] it 's called the altiplano or high plains [MASK] a place of extremes and extreme contrasts[MASK] <unk> mars than earth it seems just as hostile to life <unk>[MASK] stars <unk>[MASK] themselves[MASK] at twelve thousand feet[MASK] <unk> dry thin air makes for perfect stargazing <unk> [MASK] some of the world 's astronomers have telescopes nearby [MASK] but just looking up with the naked eye[MASK] i 'm
