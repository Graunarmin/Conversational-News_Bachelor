 <unk> to be honest by personality i 'm just not much of a crier <unk> [MASK] but i think in my career that 's been a good thing i 'm a civil rights lawyer and[MASK] i 've seen some horrible things in the world <unk> i began my career working police abuse cases in the united states and then[MASK] in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i was sent to rwanda to be the director of the u n ' s genocide investigation <unk> [MASK] it turns out that[MASK] tears just aren 't much help when you 're trying to investigate a genocide the things i had to[MASK] see and feel and touch[MASK] were pretty[MASK] <unk> unspeakable what i can tell you is this that the rwandan genocide was[MASK] one of the world 's greatest failures of simple compassion <unk> that word compassion actually comes from two latin words[MASK] <unk> i saw and experienced in rwanda as i got up close to human suffering it did <unk> in moments move me to tears <unk> [MASK] but i just wish that i and the rest of the world had been moved earlier <unk> [MASK] and not just to tears but to actually stop the genocide now by contrast[MASK] i 've also been involved with one of the world 's greatest successes[MASK] of compassion <unk> [MASK] and that 's the fight against global poverty <unk> it 's a cause that probably has involved all of us here [MASK] i don 't know if your first introduction might have been choruses of we are the world or[MASK] maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door <unk> or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water[MASK] <unk> i don 't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but i do remember the most jarring it was when i met venus[MASK] she 's a mom from zambia she 's got three kids and she 's a widow when i met her she had walked[MASK] about twelve miles in the only garments she owned to come to the capital city and to share her[MASK] <unk> she sat down with me for hours just ushered me in to the world of poverty <unk> [MASK] she described what it was like when the coals on the cooking fire[MASK] finally just went completely cold when that last drop of cooking oil finally ran out [MASK] when the last of the food <unk> despite her best efforts[MASK] <unk> she had to watch her youngest son peter suffer from malnutrition [MASK] as his legs just slowly bowed into uselessness as his eyes grew cloudy and dim <unk> and then as peter[MASK] finally grew cold [MASK] for over fifty years stories like this have been moving us to compassion <unk> we whose kids have plenty[MASK] <unk> to eat [MASK] and we 're moved not only to care about global poverty but to actually try to do our part to stop the suffering now[MASK] there 's plenty of room for critique that we haven 't done enough <unk> and what it is that we 've done hasn 't been effective enough <unk> [MASK] but the truth is this [MASK] the fight against global poverty is probably the broadest longest running manifestation[MASK] of the human phenomenon of compassion[MASK] in the history of our species <unk> and so i 'd like to share[MASK] a pretty shattering insight that might forever change the way you think about that struggle but first let me begin with what you probably already know[MASK] thirty five years ago when i would have been graduating from high[MASK] <unk> they told us that forty thousand kids every day died because of poverty [MASK] that number today is now down to seventeen thousand [MASK] way too many of course <unk> but it does mean that every year [MASK] there 's eight million kids who don 't have to die from poverty <unk> [MASK] moreover the number of people in our world who are living in extreme poverty which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day that has[MASK] <unk> fallen from[MASK] fifty percent to only fifteen percent <unk> [MASK] this is massive progress and this exceeds everybody 's expectations[MASK] about what is possible and i think you and i i think honestly that we can[MASK] we can feel proud and encouraged to see the way that compassion actually has the power[MASK] to succeed in stopping the suffering of millions <unk> but here 's the part[MASK] that you might not hear very much about [MASK] if you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day <unk> [MASK] it turns out that virtually the same two billion people who were stuck in that harsh poverty when i was in high school <unk> are still stuck there[MASK] <unk> so why why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty <unk> [MASK] well let 's think about venus for a moment now for decades my wife and i have been moved by common compassion to[MASK] sponsor kids to fund microloans to support generous levels of foreign aid but until i had actually talked to venus [MASK] i would have had no idea that none of those approaches[MASK] actually addressed why she had to watch her son die [MASK] we were doing fine [MASK] venus told me until brutus started to cause trouble [MASK] now brutus is venus ' neighbor and cause trouble is what happened the day after[MASK] <unk> husband died [MASK] when brutus just came and threw venus and the kids out of the house stole all their land <unk> and robbed their market stall [MASK] you see <unk> venus was thrown into destitution by violence <unk> [MASK] and then it occurred to me of course that none of my child sponsorships <unk> none of the microloans <unk> none of the traditional[MASK] <unk> were going to stop brutus because they weren 't meant to [MASK] this became even more clear to me when i met griselda [MASK] she 's a[MASK] a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community in guatemala <unk> and one of the things we 've learned over the years is that perhaps the most powerful thing[MASK] <unk> that griselda and her family can do[MASK] to get griselda and her family out of poverty is to make sure that she goes to school <unk> the experts call this[MASK] the girl effect <unk> [MASK] but when we met griselda she wasn 't going to school in fact[MASK] she was rarely ever leaving her home [MASK] days before we met her while she was walking home from church with her family in broad daylight[MASK] <unk> men from her community just snatched her off the street and violently raped her [MASK] see griselda had every opportunity to go to school[MASK] it just wasn 't safe for her to get there [MASK] and griselda 's not the only one around the world poor women and girls between the ages of fifteen and[MASK] <unk> they are when victims of[MASK] the everyday violence of domestic abuse[MASK] and sexual violence those two forms of violence account for more death and disability[MASK] than malaria than car accidents than war combined[MASK] <unk> the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence in south asia for instance i could drive past this rice mill[MASK] and see this man hoisting these 100 pound sacks of rice upon his thin back <unk> [MASK] but i would have no idea until later that he was actually a slave held by violence in that rice mill since i was in high school[MASK] <unk> programs right in his community were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves from the[MASK] beatings and the rapes and the torture of violence inside the rice mill <unk> [MASK] in fact half a century of anti poverty programs[MASK] have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history <unk> experts tell us that there 's about[MASK] <unk> million people in slavery today <unk> that 's about the population of the entire nation of canada where we 're sitting today <unk> [MASK] this is why over time i have come to call this epidemic of violence the locust effect <unk> [MASK] because in the lives of the poor it just descends like a plague and it[MASK] <unk> in fact now when you survey very very poor communities <unk> residents will tell you that their greatest fear[MASK] is violence <unk> but notice the violence that they fear[MASK] is not the violence of genocide or the wars <unk> it 's everyday violence <unk> [MASK] so for me as a lawyer of course my first reaction was to think well of course we 've got to change all the laws <unk> we 've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal <unk> [MASK] but then i found out <unk> it already[MASK] <unk> is the problem is not that the poor don 't get <unk>[MASK] <unk> that they don 't get law enforcement [MASK] in the developing world basic law enforcement systems are so broken that recently the u n issued a report that found that most poor people live outside[MASK] <unk> now honestly you and i have[MASK] just about no idea of what that would mean because we have no first hand experience of it [MASK] functioning law enforcement for us is just a total assumption <unk> in fact nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers[MASK] which of course is the number for the emergency police operator here in canada and in the united states <unk> where the average response time to a police nine[MASK] <unk> emergency call is about ten minutes <unk> so we take this just completely for granted but what if there was no law enforcement[MASK] to protect you [MASK] a woman in oregon recently experienced what this would be like she was home alone in her dark house on a saturday night [MASK] when a man started to tear his way into her home [MASK] this was her worst[MASK] <unk> nightmare because[MASK] this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault just two weeks before <unk> [MASK] so terrified she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do she calls nine hundred and eleven but only to learn that because of budget cuts[MASK] in her county law enforcement wasn 't available[MASK] <unk> can you ask him to go away[MASK] <unk> call the sheriff 's office tomorrow obviously if he comes in and unfortunately[MASK] <unk> choked and raped because this is what it means to live outside the rule of law <unk> [MASK] and this is where billions of our poorest live [MASK] what does that look like in bolivia for example if a man sexually assaults a poor child statistically[MASK] <unk> he 's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying than he is of ever going to jail for that crime <unk> [MASK] in south asia [MASK] if you enslave a poor person you 're at greater risk of being struck by lightning than ever being sent to jail for that crime <unk> [MASK] and so the epidemic of everyday violence it just rages on and it devastates our[MASK] <unk> efforts to try to help billions of people out of their <unk>[MASK] hell [MASK] because the data just doesn 't lie <unk> [MASK] it turns out that you can give all manner of goods and services to the poor [MASK] but if you don 't restrain the hands of the violent bullies from taking it all away you 're going to be very disappointed in the long term[MASK] <unk> impact of your efforts <unk> [MASK] so you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement in the developing world would be a huge priority for the global fight against poverty <unk> [MASK] but it 's not [MASK] auditors of international assistance recently couldn 't find even one percent of aid[MASK] going to protect the poor from the lawless chaos of everyday violence[MASK] and honestly when we do talk about[MASK] <unk> violence against the poor sometimes it 's in the weirdest of ways [MASK] a fresh water organization tells a heart wrenching story of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water <unk> and then celebrates the[MASK] solution of a new well that drastically shortens their walk end of story <unk> [MASK] but not a word about the rapists who are still[MASK] <unk> right there in the community [MASK] if a young woman on one of our college campuses was raped on her walk to the library [MASK] we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm [MASK] and yet for some reason this is okay for poor people [MASK] now the truth is the traditional experts in economic development and poverty[MASK] <unk> alleviation they don 't know how to fix this problem and so what happens <unk> they don 't talk about it [MASK] but the more fundamental[MASK] reason that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world is so neglected is because the people inside the developing world with[MASK] <unk> need it [MASK] i was at the world economic forum not long ago talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world[MASK] and i was just asking them how do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence [MASK] and they looked at each other and they said practically in unison we buy it[MASK] <unk> private security forces in the developing world[MASK] are now four five and seven times larger than the public police force <unk> [MASK] in africa <unk> the largest employer on the continent now[MASK] is private security <unk> but see the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer but the[MASK] <unk> left totally unprotected and they keep getting thrown to the ground <unk> this is a[MASK] a massive and scandalous outrage and it doesn 't have to be this way [MASK] broken law enforcement can be fixed [MASK] violence can be stopped almost all criminal justice systems they start out broken and corrupt but they can be[MASK] <unk> transformed by fierce effort and commitment <unk> the path forward is really pretty clear number one <unk> we have to start making[MASK] stopping violence indispensable to the fight against poverty <unk> in fact any conversation about global poverty that doesn 't include the problem of violence must be deemed not serious <unk> [MASK] and secondly we have to[MASK] begin to seriously invest resources and share expertise to support the developing world as they[MASK] new public systems of justice not private security that give everybody a chance to be safe [MASK] these transformations are actually possible and they 're happening today <unk> [MASK] recently the gates foundation funded a project in the second largest city of the philippines [MASK] where local advocates and local law enforcement were able to transform[MASK] <unk> corrupt police and broken courts so drastically [MASK] that in just four short years they were able to measurably reduce the commercial sexual violence against poor kids[MASK] by seventy nine percent [MASK] you know from the hindsight of history what 's always most inexplicable and inexcusable[MASK] <unk> are the simple failures of compassion [MASK] because i think history convenes a tribunal of our grandchildren[MASK] and they just ask us grandma grandpa <unk> where were you <unk> [MASK] where were you grandpa when the jews were fleeing nazi germany and were being[MASK] <unk> where were you and grandma where were you when they were marching our <unk>[MASK] <unk> neighbors off to internment camps <unk> and grandpa where were you when they were beating our african american neighbors just because they were trying to register to vote [MASK] likewise [MASK] when our grandchildren ask us grandma grandpa <unk> [MASK] where were you when two billion of the world 's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos[MASK] <unk> of everyday violence [MASK] i hope we can say[MASK] that we had compassion <unk> [MASK] that we raised our voice <unk> [MASK] and as a generation <unk> we were moved to make the violence stop <unk> [MASK] thank you very[MASK] <unk> really powerfully argued talk to us a bit about some of the things that have actually been happening to for example <unk> boost[MASK] police training how hard a process is that[MASK] <unk> well one of the glorious things that 's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious <unk> there 's actually now political will to do that [MASK] but it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise there 's a political will struggle that 's going to take place as well but those are winnable fights because we 've done some examples around the world at international justice mission that[MASK] <unk> encouraging ca so just tell us in one country <unk> how much it costs to make a material difference to[MASK] police for example i know that 's only one piece of it gh [MASK] in guatemala for instance we 've started a project there with the local police and court system prosecutors to retrain them so that they can actually effectively bring these cases and we 've seen prosecutions[MASK] against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by[MASK] <unk> than one thousand percent this project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year <unk> and the kind of bang you can get for your buck in terms of[MASK] leveraging a criminal justice system that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led and these countries especially a middle class[MASK] <unk> is seeing that there 's really no future with this total instability and total privatization of security i think there 's an opportunity a window for change ca [MASK] but to make this happen you have to look at each part in the chain the the police who else gh so that 's the thing about law enforcement it starts out with the police they 're the front end of the pipeline of justice but they hand if off to the prosecutors[MASK] <unk> and the prosecutors hand it off to the courts <unk> and the survivors of violence have to be supported by social services all the way through that so you have to do an approach that pulls that all together in the past <unk>[MASK] there 's been a little bit of training of the courts <unk> but they get crappy evidence from the police or a little police intervention that has to do with narcotics or terrorism but nothing to do with treating the common poor person with excellent law enforcement <unk> so it 's about pulling that[MASK] <unk> and you can actually have people in very poor communities experience law enforcement like us <unk> which is imperfect in our own experience for sure but boy is it a great thing to sense that you can call nine hundred and eleven and maybe someone will[MASK] will protect you ca gary i think you 've done a spectacular job of bringing this to the world 's attention in your book and right here today <unk> thanks so much <unk> gary haugen[MASK]
