 <unk> when we think of games there 's all kinds of things maybe you 're ticked off or maybe you 're looking forward to a new game you 've been up too late playing a game all these things happen to me[MASK] <unk> but when we think about games a lot of times we think about stuff like this first person shooters or the[MASK] what we would call aaa games <unk> or maybe you 're a facebook game player this is one my partner and i worked on maybe you play facebook games and that 's what we 're making right now this is a lighter form of game[MASK] <unk> maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations [MASK] this would be one of the tragically boring board games that you can figure out or maybe you 're in your living room playing with the wii with the kids <unk>[MASK] <unk> there 's this whole range of games <unk> and that 's very much what i think about i make my living from games i 've been lucky enough to do this since i was fifteen which also qualifies as i 've never really had a real job[MASK] <unk> but we think about games as fun and that 's completely reasonable[MASK] <unk> but let 's just think about this so this one here this is the one thousand nine hundred and eighty olympics now i don 't know where you guys were but i was in my living room it was practically a religious event <unk> [MASK] and this is when the americans beat the[MASK] <unk> and this was yes it was technically a game hockey is a game <unk> but really was this a game <unk> i mean <unk> people cried i 've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of[MASK] so this was an amazing experience or if anybody here is from boston so when the boston red sox won the world series after i believe <unk> three hundred and fifty one years [MASK] when they won the world series <unk> it was amazing i happened to be living in springfield at the time and the best part of it was[MASK] <unk> you would close the the women 's door in the bathroom and i remember seeing go sox and i thought really[MASK] <unk> or the houses you 'd come out because every game well i think almost every game went into overtime right so we 'd be outside and all the other lights are on in the whole block[MASK] <unk> and kids the the attendance was down in school kids weren 't going[MASK] <unk> it 's ok it 's the red sox right i mean there 's education and then there 's the red sox and we know where they 're stacked <unk> [MASK] so this was an amazing experience and again yes it was a game <unk> but they didn 't write newspaper articles people didn 't say you know really <unk> i can die now because the red sox won [MASK] and many people did so games it means something more to us it absolutely means something more so now <unk> this is an abrupt transition[MASK] <unk> there was three years where i actually did have a real job sort of i was the head of a college department teaching games so again it was sort of a real job and now i got to talk about making them as opposed to making them[MASK] part of the job of it when you 're a chair of a department is to eat[MASK] and i did that very well and so i 'm out at a dinner with this guy[MASK] called zig jackson so this is zig in this photograph this is also one of zig 's photographs he 's a photographer <unk> [MASK] and he goes all around the country taking pictures of[MASK] himself[MASK] you can see here he 's got zig 's indian reservation <unk> and this particular shot[MASK] this is one of the more traditional shots this is a rain dancer <unk> [MASK] and this is one of my favorite shots here <unk> so you can look at this and maybe you 've even seen things like this this is an expression of culture right and this is actually from his degradation series and what was most fascinating to me about this series is just look at that little boy there can you imagine[MASK] <unk> that that 's a traditional native american now i just want to change that guy 's race just imagine if that 's a black guy so honey come here let 's get you a picture with the black guy [MASK] right like seriously nobody would do this it baffles the mind <unk> and so zig being indian likewise it baffles his mind his favorite photograph my favorite photograph of his which i don 't have in here is indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of indians[MASK] <unk> to be at dinner with this photographer and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred <unk> and it was on an indian reservation he 'd taken his camera up there to photograph it but when he got there he discovered he couldn 't do it he just couldn 't capture the picture[MASK] and so they were talking back and forth about this question do you take the picture or not <unk> and that was fascinating to me as a game designer <unk> because it never occurs to me should i make the game about this difficult topic[MASK] <unk> or not because we just make things that are fun or will make you feel fear that visceral excitement[MASK] <unk> but every other medium does it <unk> [MASK] so this is my kid this is maezza and when she was seven years old she came home from school one day and like i do every single day i asked her what did you do today so she said we talked about the middle passage now this was a big[MASK] <unk> maezza 's dad is black and i knew this day was coming i wasn 't expecting it at seven i don 't know why but i wasn 't anyways so i asked her [MASK] how do you feel about that [MASK] so she proceeded to tell me and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here the ships start in england they come down from england they go to africa they go across the ocean that 's the middle passage <unk>[MASK] <unk> part they come to america where the slaves are sold she 's telling me <unk> but abraham lincoln was elected president and then he passed the emancipation proclamation and now they 're free[MASK] <unk> pause for about ten seconds can i play a game mommy and i thought[MASK] that 's it <unk> and so <unk> you know this is the middle passage this is an incredibly significant event[MASK] <unk> and she 's treating it like basically some black people went on a cruise this is more or less how it sounds to her [MASK] and so to me <unk> i wanted more value in this so when she asked if she could play a game <unk> i said[MASK] <unk> yes [MASK] and so i happened to have all of these little pieces i 'm a game designer so i have this stuff sitting around my house i said yeah you can play a game and i give her a bunch of these and i tell her to paint them in different families these are pictures <unk>[MASK] <unk> of maezza when she was god it still chokes me up seeing these so she 's painting her little families so then i grab a bunch of them and i put them on a boat[MASK] <unk> this was the boat it was made quickly obviously[MASK] and so the basic gist of it is i grabbed a bunch of families and she 's like mommy but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things [MASK] and she says they want to go and i said honey no they don 't want to go this is the middle passage nobody wants to go on the middle passage [MASK] so she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother [MASK] and as we 're going across the ocean following these rules she realizes that she 's rolling pretty high <unk> and she says to me we 're not going to make it[MASK] <unk> and she realizes <unk> we don 't have enough food and so she asks what to do and i i say remember she 's seven we can either put some people in the water[MASK] or we can hope that they don 't get sick and we make it to the other side <unk>[MASK] just the look on her face came over now mind you this is after a month of this is black history month right <unk> [MASK] <unk> this is her brother and sister if i came out of the woods avalon and donovan might be gone yes [MASK] but i 'd get to see them in america no but what if i saw them couldn 't we stay together so daddy could be gone yes [MASK] she was fascinated by this and she started to cry i started to cry her father started to cry and now we 're all crying he didn 't expect to come home from work to the middle passage but[MASK] <unk> and so <unk> we made this game and she she got it she got it because she spent time with these people it wasn 't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie[MASK] and so it was just an incredibly powerful experience this is the game which i 've ended up calling the new world because i like the phrase i don 't think the new world felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on[MASK] <unk> but when this happened i saw the whole planet i was so excited <unk> i 'd been making games for 20 some years[MASK] and then i decided to do it again my history is irish <unk> so this is a game called sochn leat it 's peace be with you it 's the entire history of my family in a single game <unk> [MASK] i made another game called train i was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics and if you 're going to cover a difficult topic this is one you need to cover and i 'll let you figure out what that 's about on your own[MASK] <unk> and i also made a game about the[MASK] <unk> trail of tears <unk> this is a game with fifty thousand individual pieces <unk> i was crazy when i decided to start it but i 'm in the middle of it now <unk> [MASK] it 's the same thing i 'm hoping that i 'll teach culture through these games <unk> [MASK] and the one i 'm working on right now which is because i 'm right in the middle of it and these for some reason choke me up like crazy is a game called mexican kitchen workers and[MASK] originally it was a math problem[MASK] <unk> more or less here 's the economics of illegal immigration [MASK] and the more i learned about mexican culture my partner is mexican the more i learned that you know for all of us food is a basic need[MASK] and it is obviously with mexicans too but it 's much more than that it 's an expression of love it 's an expression of[MASK] god i 'm totally choking up way more than i thought i 'll look away from the picture[MASK] it 's an expression of beauty it 's how they say they love you it 's how they say they care and you can 't hear somebody talk about their mexican grandmother without saying food in the first[MASK] <unk> sentence[MASK] <unk> and so to me <unk> this beautiful culture this beautiful expression is something that i want to capture through games <unk> and so games for a change it changes how we see topics it changes our perceptions about those people in topics <unk> [MASK] and it changes ourselves we change as people through games because we 're involved and we 're playing and we 're learning as we do so[MASK]
