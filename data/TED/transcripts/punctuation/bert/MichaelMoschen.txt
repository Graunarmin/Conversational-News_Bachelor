 <unk> i started juggling a long time ago but long before that i was a golfer and that 's what i was a golfer and[MASK] as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that i sort of lived my whole life is process[MASK] <unk> process and it 's the process of learning things one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer but he was lefty <unk> [MASK] and he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology[MASK] about ben hogan and[MASK] various things <unk> well <unk> i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know know stuff about[MASK] <unk> and that was the mythology of skill so one of the things that i love to do is to explore skill and since richard put me on this whole thing with music[MASK] i 'm supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab it relates a lot to music <unk> [MASK] but tod couldn 't come and the project is sort of somewhere i 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought or not <unk> but i 'm going to explore skill and[MASK] <unk> visual music i guess <unk> ok you can start the music[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> can be a lot of fun play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now[MASK] <unk> do a couple of pieces i do a big piece in a triangle[MASK] and these are three sections from it <unk> part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space[MASK] using not just my hands because a lot of juggling is <unk> <unk> hand oriented but using the rhythm of my body and feet <unk> and controlling the balls with my feet[MASK] <unk> next section was an attempt to explore space you see i think richard said something about people that are against something <unk> well a lot of people think jugglers[MASK] defy gravity or do stuff well i kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it 's a process of joining with forces[MASK] <unk> so what i 'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique <unk> so juggling gravity[MASK] up down if you figure out what up and down really are it[MASK] 's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up[MASK] <unk> but then you add in sideways[MASK] <unk> i look at it somewhat as a way when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands[MASK] because you 're not looking at your hands you 're looking at where the balls are or you 're looking at the audience [MASK] so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm [MASK] with the obvious reference to the feet <unk> but it 's also[MASK] where the feet were where the balls were[MASK] <unk> and remember you 're transposing you 're getting into a subculture here [MASK] and juggling the balls cross and all that ok if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines[MASK] of different heights <unk> but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm[MASK] good[MASK] you can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights <unk> ok <unk> change the rhythm so it 's even or you can go back[MASK] and change the height <unk> [MASK] now <unk> skill <unk> <unk> but you 're boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way so you 've got to go after the space down there[MASK] <unk> because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you and[MASK] then you get crazy[MASK] <unk> i 'm actually going to ask you to try something so you 've got to pay attention <unk> complexity[MASK] if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions perceptions change [MASK] it 's learning skills like being in a high speed car crash [MASK] things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn <unk> you may not be able to affect it[MASK] <unk> almost drifts on you it goes <unk> but that 's the closest approximation i can have to it <unk> so <unk> complexity now how many here are jugglers[MASK] ok <unk> so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this[MASK] <unk> it looks like a mess it looks like a mess with a guy there who 's got his hands around that mess <unk> ok <unk> well that 's what juggling is about right it 's[MASK] being able to do something that other people can 't do or can 't understand all right so that 's one way of doing it which is five balls down <unk> ok <unk> another way[MASK] <unk> but let 's try something <unk> ok <unk> so since you all don 't understand what the five ball pattern is i 'm going[MASK] <unk> let 's actually learn something actually <unk> let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure[MASK] <unk> what you 're going to learn is this [MASK] ok <unk> so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it[MASK] <unk> lot of different learning processes going on in here [MASK] one learning process that i see is this [MASK] <unk> shake your hands out <unk> now <unk> i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer <unk> ok <unk> so what you 're doing is you 're going la[MASK] <unk> and you 're getting this <unk> ok <unk> so that 's exactly what i 'm going to ask you to do but in a slightly different way <unk> you 're going to combine it <unk> so what i want you to do is[MASK] fingers i 'll tell you what to do with your fingers same thing but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball[MASK] that i ask you to follow [MASK] <unk> going to start off looking at the white ball and i 'm going to tell you which color and i 'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers[MASK] <unk> reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face[MASK] throughout their lives <unk> a moment of learning a moment of challenge it 's a moment that you can 't make sense of why the hell should i[MASK] <unk> anything to do with anything in my life you know i can 't decipher is it fun is it challenging am i supposed to cheat you know what are you supposed to[MASK] do you 've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life <unk> [MASK] ok <unk> trying to figure that stuff out but is it going to get you anywhere <unk> it 's just a moment[MASK] <unk> that 's all it is a moment <unk> ok <unk> i 'm going to change the script for one second just let me do this i don 't need music for it talking about time in a moment there 's a piece that i recently developed[MASK] which was all about that <unk> [MASK] a moment <unk> [MASK] and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects what i 've done for you here <unk> i developed a lot of those tricks and i put the choreography together <unk> but they 're not original techniques[MASK] <unk> i 'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that i 've developed ok <unk> so <unk> a moment <unk> how would you define a moment <unk> well as a juggler [MASK] what i wanted to do[MASK] was create something that was representational of a moment[MASK] <unk> what i did as a juggler was say ok <unk> what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else[MASK] <unk> something in here and you can all have a guess as to what it is there 's a mystery there 's a mystery in the moment <unk> and it[MASK] and then it 's dependent on something else[MASK] <unk> and then it comes to rest [MASK] just a little thing about time now this has expanded into a much bigger piece because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i 'm keeping time with this <unk> but i just thought i 'd talk about a moment[MASK] <unk> can we show the video of the triangle are we ready to do that yes [MASK] this is the piece that i told you about it 's a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle[MASK] <unk> ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at one hundred and twenty miles an hour [MASK] the only other thing is it was a real shock i always drove motorcycles <unk> and when i bought my first car [MASK] it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents ' house[MASK] <unk> making up the rules so you can 't cheat <unk> so you learn[MASK] to approach stillness[MASK] <unk> with different parts of your body [MASK] to have a conversation with it [MASK] to speak [MASK] to listen hup [MASK] now it 's dependent on rhythm and[MASK] keeping a center of balance when it falls going[MASK] <unk> a rhythm to it [MASK] the rhythm[MASK] can get much smaller [MASK] as your skill increases you learn to find[MASK] those tinier spaces [MASK] those tinier movements thanks now[MASK] i 'm going to show you the beginnings[MASK] piece[MASK] that[MASK] is about balance[MASK] in some ways <unk> and also oh actually <unk> if you 're bored not here here[MASK] 's one use for it [MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> i apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb square and level <unk> [MASK] and they influenced that and this next piece which i 'll do a little segment of two sticks you can go with it thanks <unk> [MASK] which is again exploring space[MASK] <unk> working with space and the lines in space in a different way[MASK] <unk> time[MASK] <unk> but working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this[MASK] is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls[MASK] <unk> and then[MASK] creating space[MASK] and the rhythm of space using the surface of the balls the surface of the arms just a little toy <unk> [MASK] which leads me to the next thing <unk> which is[MASK] what have i got here[MASK] <unk> i 'm actually leading up to something <unk> the newest thing that i 'm working on this is not it <unk> this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape[MASK] <unk> just did was i worked with the mathematics[MASK] the diameter and the circumference <unk> sometimes these pieces are mathematical in that way that i look at a shape and say what about[MASK] <unk> i use this and this and this sometimes what happens in life[MASK] affects my choice of objects that i try to work with the next piece that i 'm going to do which is the cylinders piece if you want to get that up[MASK] it has to do with cylinder seals from about five thousand years ago which were[MASK] stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay[MASK] with all sorts of great designs i love ceramics and all of that it 's a combination of that <unk> the beauty of that <unk> the shape [MASK] and[MASK] the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they[MASK] protected the contents the second influence on this piece came from[MASK] recycling[MASK] and looking into a tin can recycling bin[MASK] and seeing all that beautiful emptiness so if you want to go with the music for cylinders[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> talking about geometry and everything <unk> if you take[MASK] the circle and you split it in half can you run s curve music i 'm going to do just a short version of it[MASK] <unk> circles split in half[MASK] the[MASK] <unk> kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and i dance around a small stage so[MASK] two minutes just to end the latest piece that i 'm working on[MASK] what i love is that i never know what i 'm working on why i 'm working on it <unk> they 're not ideas they 're instincts and the latest thing that i 'm working on[MASK] something really[MASK] i don 't know what it is yet <unk> [MASK] and that 's good <unk> i like not to know for as long as possible[MASK] <unk> well because then it tells me the truth <unk> instead of me imposing the truth <unk>[MASK] <unk> is working with both positive and negative space[MASK] but also with these curves and what it involves and i don 't know if my hands are[MASK] too beaten up to do it or not but i 'll do a little bit of it <unk> it initially started off with me stacking these things bunches of them <unk> and then playing with[MASK] the sense of space of filling in the space and then it started[MASK] <unk> and become folding on themselves[MASK] and then changing levels [MASK] because my attempt[MASK] is to make visual instruments not to just make i 'll try one other thing [MASK] for work in three dimensions with your[MASK] <unk> perceptions of space[MASK] and time <unk> now i don 't know exactly where it 's going but i 've got a bit[MASK] bit of effort involved in this thing <unk> and it 's going to change as i go through it <unk> [MASK] but i really like it it feels right <unk> this may not be the right shape [MASK] and look at this shape and then i 'll show you the first design i ever put to it <unk> [MASK] just to see just to play[MASK] i love all different kinds of things to play with let 's see here to work with the positive and negative in a different way <unk> [MASK] and to change <unk> and to change so i 'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space we 'll see what i come[MASK]
