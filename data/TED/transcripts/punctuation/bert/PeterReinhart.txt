 <unk> this is a wheat bread a whole wheat bread <unk> and[MASK] it 's made with a new technique that i 've been playing around with and developing and writing about which for lack of a better name we call the epoxy method and i call it an epoxy method because it 's not very appetizing i understand that but[MASK] but if you think about epoxy what 's epoxy[MASK] 's two resins that are sort of in and of themselves neither of which can make glue <unk> but when you put the two together something happens a bond takes place <unk> and you get this very strong powerful[MASK] adhesive <unk> well <unk> in this technique what i 've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world the artisan bread baking community[MASK] <unk> been trying to accumulate over the last twenty years or so since we 've been engaged in a bread renaissance in america and put it together to come up with[MASK] a method[MASK] that would help to take whole grain breads and let 's face it everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains we finally after forty years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option we 're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them[MASK] <unk> for a wholegrain baker is you know how do you make it[MASK] taste good because whole grain[MASK] it 's easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread <unk> white flour is sweet it 's mainly starch and starch when you break it down what is starch <unk> it 's thank you sugar <unk>[MASK] yes <unk> so a baker <unk> and a good baker knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar[MASK] <unk> trapped in the starch with whole grain bread you have other obstacles you 've got bran which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber for the bran <unk>[MASK] <unk> is is fiber it 's got germ those are the good things but those aren 't the tastiest parts of the wheat so whole grain breads[MASK] <unk> when we think of something as a health food we think of it as something we eat out of obligation not out of passion[MASK] and love for the flavor and ultimately <unk> the challenge of the the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor [MASK] flavor is king flavor rules i call it the flavor rule flavor rules and and you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once [MASK] but they won 't eat it again if they don 't like it <unk> right so this is the challenge for this bread[MASK] we 're going to try this at lunch and i 'll[MASK] explain a bit more about it but it 's made not only with two types of pre doughs this attempt again at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before[MASK] that is not leavened it 's just dough that is wet it 's hydrated dough we call the soaker that helps to start enzyme[MASK] <unk> and enzymes are the secret kind of ingredient in dough that brings out flavor it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch <unk> that 's what enzymes are doing <unk> and so if we can release some of those they become accessible to us[MASK] in our palate they become accessible to the yeast as food <unk> they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust[MASK] <unk> the other pre dough that we make is fermented our pre ferment and it 's made it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a biga or any other kind of[MASK] pre fermented dough with a little yeast in it and that starts to develop flavor also and on day two we put those two pieces together <unk> that 's the epoxy <unk> [MASK] and we 're hoping that sort of the enzyme piece of dough[MASK] becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough and when we put them together and add the final ingredients we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain that 's the challenge[MASK] of wheat let 's go back and look at these twelve stages i 'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them okay we 're going to start with the first stage [MASK] and this is this is what every student has to begin with everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place [MASK] which is just a french way of saying [MASK] <unk> in its place [MASK] first stage so in baking we call it scaling weighing out the ingredients stage two is mixing we take the ingredients and we mix them we have to develop the gluten there 's no gluten in flour there 's only <unk>[MASK] <unk> the potential for gluten here 's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we 've got glutenin and gliadin neither of which are strong enough to make[MASK] <unk> and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to[MASK] essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly then we get into fermentation the third stage which is really where the flavor develops <unk> the yeast[MASK] comes alive and starts eating the sugars creating carbon dioxide and alcohol[MASK] essentially it 's burping and sweating which is what bread is it 's yeast burps and sweat and[MASK] <unk> somehow <unk> this is transformed the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food <unk> and we 're going to explore that in a minute [MASK] but then quickly through the next few stages we after it 's fermented and it 's developed started to develop flavor and character we divide it into smaller units [MASK] and then we take those units and we shape them we give them a little pre shape usually a round or a little torpedo shape[MASK] <unk> sometimes that 's called rounding and there 's a short rest period it can be for a few seconds it can be for twenty or thirty minutes we call that resting or benching then we go into final shaping [MASK] panning which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan this takes a second but it 's a[MASK] distinctive stage it can be in a basket it can be[MASK] <unk> a loaf pan but we pan it [MASK] and then stage nine[MASK] <unk> the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages again developing more flavor the final fermentation takes place in stage nine we call it proofing [MASK] proofing means to prove that the dough is alive [MASK] and at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape and it goes into the oven stage ten three transformations take place in the oven [MASK] the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust they give us that beautiful brown crust only[MASK] the crust can caramelize it 's the only place that gets hot enough [MASK] inside <unk> the proteins this gluten coagulates when it gets to about one hundred and sixty degrees the proteins all line up and they create structure the gluten structure what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread <unk> [MASK] and the starches when they reach about one hundred and eighty degrees <unk> [MASK] gelatinize[MASK] <unk> and gelatinization is yet another[MASK] oven transformation coagulation [MASK] caramelization and gelatinization when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that 's around them <unk> they they kind of swell and then they burst and they burst and they spill their guts <unk>[MASK] <unk> into the into the bread so basically now we 're eating yeast sweats sweat burps and starch guts [MASK] as bread and stage eleven we call it cooling because we never really eat the bread right away there 's a little carry over baking <unk> the proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up [MASK] and then we have stage twelve which the textbooks call packaging but my students call eating and so we 're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to[MASK] <unk> in a few minutes we will[MASK] try this and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker 's mission of pulling out flavor but i want to go back now[MASK] and revisit these steps and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation because i really believe that[MASK] all things[MASK] can be understood and this is not my own idea this goes back to the scholastics and to the ancients that all things can be understood on four levels the literal [MASK] the metaphoric or poetic level <unk> the political or ethical level and[MASK] <unk> ultimately <unk> the mystical or sometimes called the anagogical level it[MASK] 's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal in fact dante says you can 't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand[MASK] the literal level <unk> so that 's why we 're talking literally about bread <unk> but let 's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level all in my quest for answering the question what is it about bread that 's so special[MASK] and fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor because what happens[MASK] is bread begins as wheat[MASK] or any other grain but what 's wheat wheat is a grass that grows in the field and like all grasses at a certain point it puts out seeds <unk> [MASK] and we harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels now in order to harvest it i mean what 's harvesting it 's just a euphemism for[MASK] <unk> killing <unk> right i mean <unk> that 's what 's harvest we say we harvest the pig you know <unk> yes we slaughter you know yes that 's life <unk> we harvest the wheat [MASK] and in harvesting it we kill it <unk> now wheat is alive and as we harvest it it gives up its seeds [MASK] now at least with seeds we have the potential for future[MASK] we can plant those in the ground <unk> and we save some of those for the next generation <unk> but most of those seeds[MASK] get crushed[MASK] and turned into flour <unk> and at that point the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity it 's not only been killed <unk> but it 's been denied any potential for creating future life[MASK] <unk> so we turn it into flour <unk> [MASK] so as i said <unk> i think bread is a transformational food the first transformation and by the way the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else[MASK] radical not subtle not like hot water[MASK] made cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off and becoming steam that 's a transformation two different things well in this case the first transformation is[MASK] alive[MASK] to dead i 'd call that radical so we 've got now this this flour <unk> and what do we do we add some water in stage[MASK] <unk> stage one we weigh it in stage two we add water and salt to it <unk> mix it together and we create something that we call clay it 's like clay <unk> [MASK] and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call leaven [MASK] in this case it 's yeast but yeast is leaven what does leaven mean leaven comes from the root word that means[MASK] enliven[MASK] to vivify to bring to life <unk> [MASK] by the way what 's the hebrew word for clay[MASK] adam [MASK] you see the baker <unk> in this moment has become in a sense sort of the god of his dough you know and his dough <unk> [MASK] well while it 's not an intelligent life form is now alive and we know it 's alive because in stage three [MASK] it grows growth is the proof of life <unk> and while it 's growing all these literal transformations are taking place enzymes are breaking forth sugars yeast is eating sugar and[MASK] <unk> and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol bacteria is in there eating the same sugars turning them into acids in other words personality and character 's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker <unk> [MASK] and the baker 's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product [MASK] a subtle change in temperature a subtle change in time it 's all about a balancing act between time temperature and ingredients[MASK] <unk> 's the art of baking <unk> so all these things are determined by the baker <unk> and the bread goes through some stages and characters develop and then we divide it and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units and each of <unk>[MASK] <unk> those units are given shape by the baker <unk> and as they 're shaped they 're raised again all along proving that they 're alive and developing character[MASK] <unk> to the oven it 's still dough nobody eats bread dough a few people do i think but not too many i 've met some dough eaters but[MASK] it 's not the staff of life right bread is the staff of life but dough is what we 're working with and we take that dough to the oven [MASK] and it goes into the oven as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of one hundred and forty degrees <unk> it passes what we call the thermal death point <unk>[MASK] <unk> they think it 's the name of a video game <unk> [MASK] but it 's the thermal death point all life ceases there the yeast whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough to enliven it to vivify it in order to complete its mission which is also to turn this dough into bread [MASK] has to give up its life <unk> so you see the symbolism at work it 's starting to come forth a little bit you know it 's starting to make sense to me[MASK] what goes in is dough what comes out is[MASK] or it goes in alive comes out dead [MASK] third transformation first transformation alive to dead second transformation dead brought back to life <unk> third transformation alive to dead but dough[MASK] to bread [MASK] or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly <unk> and it 's what comes out of the oven that is what we call[MASK] <unk> the staff of life <unk> this is the the product that that[MASK] everyone in the world eats that is so difficult to give up[MASK] it 's so deeply embedded in our psyches that that bread is used as a symbol for life it 's used as a symbol for[MASK] <unk> and so as we get to stage twelve and we partake of that again completing the life cycle you[MASK] we have a chance to essentially ingest that it nurtures us and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this [MASK] so this is what i 've learned from bread this is what bread has taught me in my journey and[MASK] what we 're going to attempt to do with this bread here again is to use <unk> in addition to[MASK] <unk> everything we talked about this bread we 're going to call spent grain bread because as you know bread making is very similar to beer making [MASK] beer is basically liquid bread or bread is solid beer [MASK] and [MASK] they they 're invented around the same time i think beer came first and[MASK] the egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in[MASK] <unk> it turned into bread[MASK]
