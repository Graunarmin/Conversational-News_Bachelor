got to do with you <unk> . but first of all i want you to do me a favor <unk> can you all please reach into your pockets. and take out your mobile phone <unk> . feel that familiar weight <unk> . how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons . can you imagine your world without it it connects us. to our loved ones our family friends. and colleagues <unk> at home and overseas <unk> it is a symbol of an interconnected world <unk> . but what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail and it all boils down to a. <unk> in the congo as coltan <unk> it is an anticorrosive heat conductor it stores energy. in our mobile phones <unk> playstations. and laptops <unk> it is used in aerospace and medical equipment. as an alloy it is so powerful. <unk> that we only need tiny amounts it would be

by armed groups <unk> one well known illicit trade route. is that across the border to rwanda <unk> where congolese tantalum is disguised as rwandan <unk> . but don 't throw away your phones yet <unk> because the incredible irony is that. the technology that has placed such unsustainable devastating demands on the congo is the same technology. that has brought this situation to our attention . we
