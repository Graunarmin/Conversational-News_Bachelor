 <unk> i thought in getting up to my ted wish. i would try to begin by putting in perspective. what i try. <unk> to do and how it fits with. what they try to do. <unk> we live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent <unk> but insufficient. in three major ways it is first of all profoundly unequal <unk> . half the world 's people still living on less than two dollars a day a billion people with no access to clean water two and a half billion no access to sanitation . a billion going to bed hungry every night. one in four deaths every year from aids tb malaria. and the variety of infections associated with dirty water eighty percent of them under five years of age <unk> even in wealthy countries. it is common now to see inequality growing in the united states since two thousand and one. we 've had five years of economic growth five years of productivity growth in the workplace. <unk> but median wages are stagnant. and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent . so this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us which is why we 're all here in. northern california doing what we do. <unk> enjoying this evening. is profoundly unequal <unk> it is also unstable <unk> unstable because of the threats of. terror weapons of mass destruction the spread of global disease. and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren 't not so many years ago <unk> . and perhaps most important of all it is unsustainable because of climate change <unk> resource depletion. and species destruction . when i think about the world i would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren i hope to have . it is a world that moves. away from unequal unstable unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities. <unk> nationally and globally that share the characteristics of all successful communities a broadly shared accessible set of opportunities . a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise. and a genuine sense of belonging . all easier said than done <unk> when the terrorist incidents occurred in the united kingdom a couple of. <unk> years ago i think even though they didn 't claim as many lives as we lost in the united states on nine eleven i think the thing that troubled the british most was that. the perpetrators were not invaders but homegrown citizens. whose religious and political identities were more important to them. than the people they grew up with went to school with worked with shared weekends with shared meals with in other words. <unk> thought their differences were more important than their common humanity . it is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century . into this mix people like us who are not in public office have more power to do good than at any time in. <unk> because more than half the world 's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out . and even non democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion <unk> . because. primarily of the power of the internet people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money. that can change the world for some public good. <unk> when the tsunami hit south asia the united states contributed one point two billion dollars thirty percent of our households gave half of them gave over the internet <unk> . the median contribution was somewhere around fifty seven dollars <unk> . and thirdly because of the rise of non governmental organizations they. businesses other citizens ' groups have. enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings. <unk> beings . when i became president in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three there were none of these organizations in russia there are now a couple of hundred thousand <unk> . none in india there are now at least a half a million active . none in china there are now two hundred and fifty thousand registered with the government probably twice again that many who are not registered for. political reasons <unk> . when i organized my foundation. <unk> and i thought about the world as it is and the world that i. hope to leave to the next generation <unk> and i tried to be realistic about. what i had cared about all my life that i could still have an impact on . i wanted to focus on activities that would help to. alleviate poverty. <unk> fight disease <unk> combat climate change <unk> bridge the religious racial and other divides that torment the world <unk> but to do it in a way that would. either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group. to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more. <unk> you saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs and i want to say that the head of. our aids effort and the person who also is primarily active in the wish i 'll make tonight ira magaziner is here with me and i want to thank him for everything he 's done. <unk> out of office. and was asked to work first in the caribbean to try to help deal with the aids crisis <unk> . generic drugs were available for about five hundred dollars a person a year . if you bought them in vast bulks you could get them at a little under four hundred dollars the first country we went to work in the bahamas was paying three thousand five hundred dollars for these drugs <unk> . the market was so terribly disorganized. <unk> that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold . so the very first week we were working we got the price down to five hundred dollars and all of a sudden they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money . then we went to work with the manufacturers of aids medicines one of whom was cited in the film <unk> and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy. because even at five hundred dollars these drugs were being sold on a <unk>. basis so we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain and went to a <unk>. <unk> absolutely certain payment business i joked that that the main contribution we made to the battle against aids was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store. <unk> to a grocery store strategy <unk> . but the price went to one hundred and forty dollars from five hundred . and pretty soon the average price was one hundred and ninety two dollars now we can get it for about one hundred dollars <unk> . children 's medicine was six hundred dollars because nobody could afford to buy any of it we negotiated it down to one hundred and ninety. <unk> the french imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called unitaid got a bunch of other countries to help that children 's medicine is now sixty dollars a person a year <unk> . the only thing that is keeping us from. basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary. to diagnose treat and care for people and deliver this medicine <unk> . <unk> we started a childhood obesity initiative with the heart association in america we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry right deals. with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools <unk> . we just reorganized the markets <unk> and it occurred to me that in this whole. non governmental world somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets . <unk> is now what we 're trying to do and working with this large cities group to fight climate change <unk> . to negotiate huge big volume deals that will enable cities which generate seventy five percent of the world 's greenhouse gases to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics <unk> . and. <unk> this whole discussion as if it 's some sort of economic burden is a mystery to me i think it 's a bird 's nest on the ground <unk> . when al gore won his well deserved oscar for the inconvenient truth movie . i was thrilled <unk> but i had urged him to make a second movie quickly for those of you who saw an inconvenient truth . the most important. slide in the gore lecture is the last one <unk> which shows here 's where greenhouse gases are going if we. <unk> don 't do anything here 's where they could go and then there are six different categories of things we can do. to change the trajectory <unk> we need a movie on those six categories <unk> and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains. and to organize yourselves around it so we 're trying to do that . so organizing these markets is one thing we try to do now we have taken on a second thing and this gets to my wish. <unk> it has been my experience in working in developing countries. that while the headlines may all be the pessimistic headlines may say well we can 't do this that or the other thing because of corruption. i think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption <unk> and feeds. <unk> we now have the money given these low prices to distribute aids drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach . today these low prices are available in the twenty five countries where we work and in a total of sixty two countries and about five hundred and fifty thousand people are getting the benefits of them . but the money is there to reach others. <unk> the systems are not there to reach the people so. what we have been trying to do . working first in. rwanda and then in malawi and other places but i want to talk about rwanda tonight. is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with aids. <unk> infectious diseases maternal and child health and a whole range of health issues. poor people are grappling with in the developing world that can first be scaled for the whole nation of rwanda and then will be a model that could literally be implemented. in any other poor country in the world and the test is one will it do the job will it provide high quality care. <unk> will it do it at a price. that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to ten years <unk> . because the longer i deal with these problems the more convinced i am that we have to whether it 's economics health education whatever we have to build systems . and the absence of systems that function. break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight you think about whatever your life has been. however many obstacles you have faced in your life . at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved . in a world with no systems with chaos <unk> everything becomes a guerilla struggle <unk>. <unk> and this predictability is not there <unk> and it becomes almost impossible to save lives educate kids develop economies <unk> whatever . the person in my view who has done the best job of this. in the health care area of building a system in a very poor area. is dr paul farmer who many of you know has worked for now twenty years. <unk> primarily in haiti where he started but they 've also worked in russia in peru and other places around the world . as poor as haiti is in the area where farmer 's clinic is active and they serve a catchment area far greater than. the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve. since one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight they have not lost one person to tuberculosis. <unk> and they 've achieved a lot of other amazing health results so. when we decided to work in rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the aids problem <unk> we wanted to build a healthcare network because it had been totally destroyed. during the genocide in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four and the per capita income was still under. a dollar a day. <unk> asked paul farmer if he would help . because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in haiti and a model in rwanda that we could then take all over the country <unk> . number one it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on earth in the last fifteen years and number two . we would have something that that could then be adapted to any other poor country. anywhere in the world and so we have set about. doing that now we started working together eighteen months ago . and we 're working in an area called southern kayonza which is one of the poorest areas in. rwanda with a group that originally includes about four hundred thousand people . we 're essentially implementing what paul farmer did in haiti. <unk> and trains paid community health workers. who are able to identify health problems <unk> . ensure that people who have aids or tb are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly <unk> . who work on bringing about health education clean water and sanitation. <unk> providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have. problems of the severity that require it . the procedures that make this work have been perfected as i said by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last twenty years <unk> . recently we did an evaluation of the first eighteen months of our efforts in rwanda . <unk> the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country . and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it i. 'll tell you a little bit about our team because it 's indicative of what we do we have about five hundred people around the world working in our aids program. <unk> some of them for nothing just for transportation room and board <unk> . and then we have others working in these other related programs . our business plan in rwanda was put together under the leadership of diana noble <unk> . who is <unk> an unusually gifted woman but not unusual in the type of people who have. been willing to do this kind of work she was the youngest partner at schroder ventures in london in her. <unk> she was ceo of a successful e venture she started and built. reed elsevier ventures and at forty five she decided she wanted to do something different with her life <unk> . so she now works full time on this for very little pay <unk> . she and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this. health system up for the whole country and it would be worthy of. <unk> the kind of private equity work she used to do. when she was making a lot more money for it when we came to this rural area forty five percent of the children under the age of five. had stunted growth. due to malnutrition. percent of them died before they reached the age of five <unk> mortality. <unk> over fifteen percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and. inadequate sanitation. all entirely preventable and treatable . over thirteen percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses again all preventable and treatable <unk> . and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis. <unk> within the first eighteen months. <unk> the following things happened <unk> we went from zero to about two thousand people being treated for aids that 's eighty percent of the people who need treatment in this area <unk> . listen to this less than four tenths of one percent of those being treated. stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment that 's lower than the figure in the united states <unk> less than three tenths of one percent. <unk> transfer to the more expensive second line drugs four hundred thousand pregnant women were brought into counseling. and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system . that 's about forty three percent of all the pregnancies about forty percent of all the people i said. i meant forty thousand about forty percent of all the people who need tb treatment are now getting it in just eighteen months up from zero when we started . forty three percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow . we 've started the first malaria treatment programs they 've ever had there <unk> . patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated. along with. <unk> four other clinics <unk> complete with solar power generators good lab technology <unk> . we now are treating three hundred and twenty five people a month . despite the fact that almost one hundred percent of the aids patients are now treated at home . and the most important thing. is because we 've implemented paul farmer 's model <unk> using community health workers. we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of rwanda. for between five and six percent of gdp <unk> and that the government could sustain that. without depending on foreign aid after five or six years and. <unk> for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries. spend between nine and eleven percent of gdp on health care except for the united states we spend sixteen but that 's a story for another day . we 're now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks. to scale this system up. <unk> we 're also beginning to do this in malawi and. and we have similar projects in tanzania mozambique kenya and ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing to save as many lives as quickly as we can <unk>. but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world <unk> . <unk> set up the information technology <unk> the solar energy the water and sanitation the transportation infrastructure <unk> . but over a five to 10 year period we will take down the need for outside assistance. and eventually it will be phased out my wish. is that ted assist us in our work and help us to build a high quality rural health system in a poor country rwanda. <unk> that can be a model for africa and indeed for any poor country anywhere in the world <unk> my belief. is that this will help us to build a more integrated world. with more partners and fewer terrorists with more productive citizens and fewer haters a place we 'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up. <unk> it has been an honor for me particularly to work in rwanda where we also have a major economic development project. in partnership with sir tom hunter the scottish philanthropist . where last year we using the same thing with aids drugs <unk> cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates. on microcredit loans by thirty percent. and achieved three to. four hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers . these people have been through a lot. and none of us most of all me helped them. when they were on the verge of destroying each other . we 're undoing that now and they are so over it and so into their future <unk> . we 're doing this in an environmentally responsible way. <unk> doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the thirty five percent of the people that have no access but to do it with clean energy <unk> . to have responsible reforestation projects the rwandans interestingly enough have been quite good. mr wilson in preserving their topsoil. there 's a couple of guys. from southern farming families the first thing i did when i went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they 'd done with.
