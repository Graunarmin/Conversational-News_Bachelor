 <unk> so it all came to life. in a dark bar in madrid . i encountered my colleague from mcgill <unk> michael meaney and we were drinking a few beers <unk> and like scientists do. <unk> he told me about his work <unk> and he told me that he is interested. in how mother rats lick their pups. after they were born . and i was sitting there and saying this is where my tax dollars are wasted . on this kind of soft science . and he started telling me. <unk> the rats like humans <unk> lick their pups in very different ways <unk> some mothers do a lot of that . some mothers do very little and. most are in between but what 's interesting about it is when he follows these pups when they become adults. like years in human life long after their mother died <unk> they are completely different animals the animals that were licked and groomed. <unk> heavily the high licking and grooming are not stressed <unk> they have different sexual behavior <unk> they have a different. way of living than those that were not treated. as intensively by their mothers so then i was thinking to myself. <unk> this magic . how does this work as geneticists would like you to think <unk> perhaps the mother had the bad mother gene. that caused her pups to be stressful <unk> and then it was passed from generation to generation it 's all determined by genetics <unk> . or is it possible that something else is going on here. in rats <unk> we can ask this question and answer it <unk> so what we did is a. you essentially separate the litter the babies of this rat at birth to two kinds of fostering mothers not the real mothers <unk> but mothers that will take care of them high licking mothers and low licking mothers and you can do the opposite with the <unk>. pups and the remarkable answer was . <unk> gene you got from your mother it was not the biological mother that defined this property of these rats <unk> it is. the mother that took care of the pups so how can this work <unk> . i am an a epigeneticist i am interested. in how genes are marked by a chemical. <unk> the womb of our mothers and decide which gene will be expressed in what tissue different genes are expressed in the brain than in the liver and the eye. and we thought is it possible. that the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring. through her. <unk> and we spent ten years <unk> and we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events. by which the licking and grooming of the mother the care of the mother is translated to biochemical signals. that go into the nucleus and into the dna and program it differently so now the animal can. prepare itself for life is life going to be harsh is there going to be a lot of food are there going to be a lot of cats and snakes around. <unk> or will i live in an upper class neighborhood where all i have to do is behave well and proper <unk> and that will gain me social acceptance . and now one can think. about how important that process can be for our lives we inherit our dna. from our ancestors the dna. <unk> it evolved during evolution <unk> . but it doesn 't tell us if you are going to be born in stockholm . where the days are long in the summer and short in the winter or in ecuador where there. 's an equal number of hours for day and night all year round <unk> and that has such an enormous [ effect ]. on our physiology <unk> . so what we suggest is perhaps what happens early in. <unk> those signals that come through the mother tell the child. what kind of social world you 're going to be living in it. will be harsh <unk> and you 'd better be anxious and be stressful or it 's going to be an easy world <unk> and you have to be different is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light . is it going to be a world with a lot of food or little food if there 's no food around <unk> you 'd better develop your brain to binge. whenever you see a meal or store every piece of food that you have as fat <unk> . so this is good <unk> evolution has selected this to allow our fixed old dna to function in a dynamic way in new environments <unk> . but sometimes things can go wrong . for example if you 're born to a poor family. and the signals are you better binge <unk> you better eat. <unk> every piece of food you 're going to encounter . but now we humans and our brain have evolved have changed evolution even faster now you can buy mcdonald 's for one dollar <unk> . and therefore <unk> the preparation that we had. by our mothers is turning out to be maladaptive the same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine is going. <unk> cause obesity cardiovascular problems and metabolic disease <unk> . so this concept that genes could be marked by our experience <unk> and especially the early life experience can provide us a unifying explanation. of both health and disease <unk> . but is true only for rats <unk> the problem is we cannot test this in humans <unk> because ethically we cannot administer child. <unk> adversity in a random way <unk> so if a poor child develops a certain property we don 't know whether this is caused by poverty. or whether poor people have bad genes <unk> . so geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor because their genes make them poor . epigeneticists will tell you poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment that creates that phenotype. that property <unk> so we moved to look. into our cousins <unk> the monkeys . my colleague stephen suomi has been rearing monkeys in two different ways <unk> randomly separated the monkey from the mother. and reared her with a nurse. <unk> so these monkeys didn 't have a mother they had a nurse and other monkeys were reared with their normal natural mothers . and when they were old <unk> they were completely different animals <unk> . the monkeys that had a mother did not care about alcohol they were not sexually aggressive the monkeys that didn 't have a mother were aggressive were stressed and were alcoholics <unk> . so we looked at their dna. early after birth. to see is it possible that the mother is marking is there a signature of the mother in the dna of the offspring . these are day 14 monkeys <unk> . and what you see here is the modern way by which we study epigenetics we can now map those chemical marks which we call methylation marks <unk> . on dna at a single nucleotide resolution <unk> we can map the entire genome. <unk> we can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not and here 's a visual presentation of this what you see is the genes that got more methylated are red the genes that got less methylated are green . you can see many genes are changing <unk> because not having a mother is not just one thing it affects the whole way it sends signals about the whole way your world is going to look when you become an adult. and you can see the two groups of monkeys extremely <unk>. from each other <unk> . how early does this develop . these monkeys already didn 't see their mothers so they had a social experience <unk> do we sense our social status <unk> even at the moment of birth <unk> . so in this experiment we took placentas of monkeys. that had different social status. <unk> interesting about social rank. is that across all living beings <unk> they will structure themselves by hierarchy <unk> . monkey number one is the boss . monkey number four is the peon <unk> you put four monkeys in a cage there will always be a boss and always be a peon <unk> . and what 's interesting is that the monkey number one is much healthier than. <unk> monkey number four and if you put them in a cage <unk> monkey number one will. will not eat as much monkey number four will eat [ a lot ] and what you see here in this. methylation mapping a dramatic separation at birth. of the animals that had a high social status versus the animals that did not have a high status <unk> so we are. born already knowing the social information <unk> and that social information is not bad or good it just prepares us for life because we have to. program our biology differently if we are in the high or the low social status <unk> . but how can you study this in humans <unk> we can 't do experiments we. can 't administer adversity to humans <unk> but god does experiments with humans and it 's called natural disasters one of <unk>. <unk> the hardest natural disasters in canadian history happened in my province of quebec <unk> it 's the ice storm of one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight . we lost our entire electrical grid because of an ice storm when the temperatures were in the dead of winter in quebec minus twenty to minus thirty and there were pregnant mothers during that time <unk> . and my colleague suzanne king. <unk> followed. the children of these mothers for fifteen years and what happened was that. as the stress increased and here we had objective measures of stress . how long were you without power where did you spend your time was it in your mother in law 's apartment or in some. posh country home <unk> so all of these added up to a social. <unk> stress scale and you can ask the question how did the children look and it appears that as stress increases <unk> the children develop more autism <unk> they <unk>. <unk> develop more metabolic diseases and they develop more autoimmune diseases. <unk> green as stress increases an entire rearrangement of the genome in response to stress <unk> . so if. we can program genes if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes that they could be programmed can we deprogram them . because epigenetic. causes can cause diseases like cancer. metabolic disease. and mental health diseases <unk> let 's talk about cocaine addiction cocaine addiction is a terrible situation. that can lead to death and to loss of human life <unk> we asked the question can we reprogram the. <unk> addicted brain to make that. animal. not addicted anymore <unk> we used. a cocaine addiction model. that recapitulates what happens in humans in humans you 're in high school . some friends suggest you use some cocaine <unk> you take cocaine nothing happens <unk> months pass by something reminds you of what happened the first time a pusher. <unk> and you become addicted and your life has changed . in rats we do the same thing my colleague gal yadid he trains the animals to get used to cocaine then for one month <unk> . no cocaine <unk>. then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time by cue the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine . and they go crazy <unk> they will press the lever to get cocaine until they die <unk> . we first determined. that the difference between these. <unk> animals is that during that time when nothing happens there 's no cocaine around <unk> . their epigenome is rearranged their genes are re marked in a different way and when the cue comes <unk> their genome is ready. to develop this addictive phenotype <unk> so we treated these animals with drugs that either increase. dna methylation which was the epigenetic marker to look. <unk> at or decrease epigenetic. markings <unk> and we found that if we increased methylation these animals go even crazier they become more craving for cocaine <unk> . but if we reduce the dna methylation the animals are not addicted anymore <unk> we have reprogrammed them and a fundamental. difference between an epigenetic drug and any other drug. is that with epigenetic drugs we essentially remove the signs of experience <unk> and once they 're gone . they will not come back unless you have the same experience <unk>. the animal now is reprogrammed so when we visited the animals thirty days <unk> sixty days later which is in human terms many years of life <unk> . they were still not addicted. by a single epigenetic treatment. so. what did we learn about dna dna is not just a sequence of letters <unk> it 's not just a script . dna is a dynamic movie . our experiences are being written into this movie which is interactive you 're. like watching a movie of your life with the dna with your remote control . you can remove an actor. and add an actor . and so you have . in spite of the deterministic nature of genetics you have control of the way your genes look <unk> . and this has a tremendous optimistic message. for the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases like cancer. <unk> reverse the movie by removing an actor. and setting up. a new narrative <unk> so what i told you today is our dna is really combined of two components. <unk> two layers of information . one layer of information is old <unk> evolved from millions of years of evolution <unk> it is fixed. and very hard to change <unk> the other layer of information is the epigenetic layer which is. open and dynamic. and sets up a narrative that is. <unk> to control to a large extent our destiny to help the destiny of our children. and to hopefully conquer conquer disease. <unk> and. serious health challenges that have plagued humankind. for a long time <unk> so even though we are determined by our genes. we have a degree of freedom that can set up our life to a life of responsibility <unk> thank you.
