 <unk> i was born in a middle class family <unk> my father was five years old when he lost his father <unk> but by the time. i was born <unk> he was already a businessman. but it didn 't make a difference to him. if his children were going to be a boy or a girl they were going to go to school <unk> so i guess i was the lucky one . my mother had sixteen pregnancies <unk> from sixteen pregnancies <unk> five of us are alive <unk> . you can imagine. as a child what i went through. day to day i watched women. being carried to a graveyard <unk> or watched children going to a graveyard <unk> . at that time <unk> when i finished my high school <unk> i really wanted to be a doctor <unk> . i wanted to be a doctor to help women and children . so i completed my education. but i wanted to go to university <unk> . unfortunately in my country <unk> there wasn 't a dormitory for girls . so i was accepted in medical school <unk> but i could not go there <unk> . so as a result <unk> my father sent me to america <unk> . i came to america. <unk> i completed my education <unk> while i was completing my education my country was invaded by russia <unk> . and do you know that at the time i was completing my education <unk> . i didn 't know what was going on with my family or with my country <unk> there were months years <unk> i didn 't know about it . my family was in a refugee camp <unk> . so as soon as i completed my education. i brought my family to america <unk> i wanted them to be safe <unk> . but where was my heart <unk> my heart was in afghanistan <unk> . day after day when i listened to the news when i followed what was going on with my country <unk> my heart was breaking up <unk> . i really wanted to go back to my country <unk> . but at the same time i knew i could not go there . <unk> for me <unk> . i had a good job <unk> . i was a professor at a university . i earned good money <unk> i had a good life my family was here <unk> i could live with them <unk> . but i wasn 't happy <unk> i wanted to go back home <unk> so i went to the refugee camp <unk> . <unk> refugee camp in pakistan there were seven point five million refugees <unk> . seven point five million refugees about ninety percent of them were women and children <unk> . most of the men have been killed or they were in war <unk> . and you know <unk> in the refugee camp <unk> when i went day to day to do a survey i. <unk> you never could imagine <unk> . i saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping. and not knowing what to do <unk> . i saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere <unk> no education no entertainment <unk> no place to even live <unk> . i saw young men that had lost their father and their. <unk> old boy being the head of the household trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children <unk> . so it was a very devastating situation <unk> my heart was beating for my people <unk> and i didn 't know what to do at. that moment <unk> we talk about momentum <unk> . at that moment <unk> i felt <unk> what can i do for these people <unk> how could i help these people i am one individual. <unk> what can i do for them but at that moment <unk> i knew. that education changed my life . it transformed me <unk> . it gave me status <unk> it gave me confidence <unk> . it gave me a career <unk> it helped me to support my family to bring my family to another country <unk> to. <unk> i knew. that at that moment that what i should give to my people is education and health and that 's what i went after <unk> . but do you think it was easy . no because at that time education was banned for for girls <unk> completely . and also by russia invading afghanistan people were not trusting anyone it was very hard to. <unk> say i want to do this who am i . somebody who comes from the united states <unk> somebody who got educated here did they trust me <unk> of course not . so i really needed to build the trust in this community <unk> how am i going to do that . i went and surveyed and looked and looked . <unk> i found one man <unk> he was eighty years old he was a mullah . i went to his tent in the camp <unk> and i asked him i want to make you a teacher . and he looked at me and he said crazy woman <unk> crazy woman how do you think i can be a teacher . and i told him i will make you a teacher. <unk> and once i started a

were training women 's rights human rights democracy rule of law <unk> we were giving all kinds of training . and one day i tell you . one day i was in the office in peshawar pakistan . all of a sudden <unk> i saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me. <unk> away <unk> hide . and you know <unk> as a leader what do you do . you 're scared you know it 's dangerous you know your life is on the line but as a leader you have to hold it together . you have to hold it together and show strength <unk> . so i said what 's going on and these people were pouring into my office <unk> so i invited them to the office <unk> they came. and there were nine of them nine taliban <unk> they were the ugliest looking men you can ever see . very mean looking people <unk> black clothes <unk> black turban <unk> and they pour into my office <unk> . and i invited them to. have a seat and have tea <unk> they said. <unk> they are not going to drink tea and of course with the tone of voice they were using <unk> it was very scary <unk> but i was really. shaking up <unk> but also i was strong holding myself up <unk> . and of course by that time you know how i dress i dress from

's go leave her alone she 's ok . and you know <unk> this time i offered them tea again <unk> and they took a sip and they left . by that time <unk> my staff poured into my office <unk> they were scared to death they didn 't know why they didn 't kill. <unk> they didn 't know why they didn 't take me away <unk> but everybody was happy to see me <unk> very happy and i was happy to be alive of course of course. i was happy to be alive <unk> but also <unk> as we continuously gave training during the fall of the taliban. of course during the taliban there is another story we went underground
