 <unk> would like to show you how architecture has helped. to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope i. am a native of burkina faso. <unk> to the world bank burkina faso is one of the poorest countries in the world but what does it look like. to grow up in a place like that i am an example of that i was born in a little village called <unk>. there was no electricity no access to clean drinking water. and no school <unk> but my father wanted me. to learn how to read and write <unk> for this reason <unk> i had to leave my family when i was seven. and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family in this place. i sat. in a class like. <unk> that. with more than one hundred and fifty other kids <unk> and for six years . in this time it just happened to me to come to school. to realize that my classmate. <unk> village people still are dying in burkina faso <unk> and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem. i. had luck. i was lucky <unk> because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that <unk> but i was lucky i. had a. <unk> scholarship i could go to germany to study <unk> so now . i suppose <unk> i don 't need to explain to you how great. a privilege. it is for me to be standing before you today <unk> from <unk> gando my home village in burkina faso . to berlin in germany. <unk> to become an architect is a big big step <unk> but what to do with this. privilege <unk> . since i was a student i wanted. to open up better opportunities to other kids in gando i just wanted to use my skills and build a school <unk> . but how do you do it when you 're still a. <unk> student and you don 't have money <unk> oh yes i started to make drawings. and asked for money <unk> fundraising was not an easy task i. even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and. <unk> collect fifty thousand u s dollars <unk> . when i came home to gando. to bring the good news my people were over the moon . but. when they realized. that i was planning to use clay they were shocked a clay building is not able to stand a rainy season. <unk> and francis wants us to use it and build a school is this the reason why he spent so much time in europe studying. instead of working in the field with us . my people build all the time with clay <unk> but they don. <unk> i started to speak. with the community and. i could convince everybody <unk> and we could start to work <unk> . and the women <unk> the men everybody from the village was part of this building process i was allowed to use even. traditional techniques <unk> so clay floor. <unk> they start polishing it with a stone for hours <unk> and then. <unk> this is the school <unk> built with the community <unk> the walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from gando the roof. structure is made with cheap. steel bars normally hiding. <unk> inside concrete. and the classroom <unk> the ceiling is made out of both of them used together in this school there was a simple idea . to create comfort. in a classroom don 't forget it can be forty five degrees in burkina faso. <unk> so with simple ventilation <unk> i wanted to make the classroom. good for teaching and learning and this is the project today <unk> . twelve years old still in best condition <unk> and the kids . and for me and my community this project was a huge. success it has opened up opportunities to do. <unk> projects in gando so i could do a lot of projects <unk> and here i am going to share with you only three of them <unk>. the first one is the school extension of course how do you explain drawings. and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write <unk> i started to build a prototype like that the innovation was to build a clay. <unk> clay vault <unk> so <unk> then i jumped. on the top like that with my team <unk> and it works <unk> the community is looking it still works so we can build . and we kept building and that is the result <unk> the kids. are happy <unk> and they love it the community is very proud we made it and even. <unk> animals like these donkeys love our buildings . the next project is the library in gando and. see now we tried to. introduce different ideas in our buildings <unk> but we often don 't have so much material <unk> . something we have in. <unk> pots we wanted to use them. to create openings so we just bring them like you can see to the building site . we start cutting them <unk> and then we place them on top of the roof. before we pour the concrete <unk> and you have this result <unk> the openings are letting the hot air out. and light in very simple. <unk> my most recent project. in gando is a high school project i would like to share with you this the innovation in this project is to cast mud. like you cast concrete <unk> how do you cast mud <unk> we start making a lot of mortars like you can see and when. when everything is ready when you know what is the best recipe and the best form you start. working with the community and sometimes i can leave they will do it themselves <unk> i came to speak to you like that . another factor in gando is rain when the. rains come we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain . <unk> don 't confound with. christo and jeanne claude it is simply how we protect our walls . the rain in burkina comes very fast <unk> and after that you have floods everywhere in the country . but for us the rain is good it brings sand and gravel. to the river. we need to use to build <unk> we just wait for the rain to go we take the sand we mix it with. clay and we keep building that is it the gando project was always connected to training the people <unk> because. i just wanted one day when i fall down. and die that at least one person from gando keeps doing this work. <unk> my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves <unk> . usually for a young man from gando to earn money you have to leave the country. to the city sometimes leave the country and some never come back. <unk> can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family there 's a new quality in this work <unk> . yes you know it i have won a lot of awards through this work. <unk> for sure it has. opened opportunities <unk> i have become myself known. <unk> why i do what i do is my community . when i was a kid <unk> i was going to school <unk> i was coming back every holiday to gando . by the end of every holidays <unk> i had to say goodbye to the. <unk> open their clothes like that and give me the last penny . in my culture this is a symbol of deep affection <unk> . as a <unk> seven year old guy <unk> i was impressed <unk> i just asked my mother one day why. <unk> they are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful. and one day come back and help. improve the quality of life of the community i hope now that i was able to make my community proud. through this work <unk> and i hope i was able to. <unk> prove you the power of community and to show you that architecture. can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future.
