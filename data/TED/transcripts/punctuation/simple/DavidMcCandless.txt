 <unk> all suffering from information overload or data glut <unk> and. the good news is there might be an easy solution to that and that 's using our eyes more <unk> so visualizing information so that we can see the patterns and connections that. <unk> and then designing that information so it makes more sense or it tells a story or allows us to focus only on the information that 's important <unk> . failing that visualized information can just look really cool so let 's see . this is the $ billion dollar o gram and this image arose out of frustration i had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press. <unk> they 're meaningless without context . five hundred billion for this pipeline twenty billion for this war it doesn 't make any sense <unk> so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively <unk> . so i scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money <unk> so purple is . fighting and. red is giving money. <unk> and what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers you can literally see them . but more importantly you start to see patterns and connections between numbers that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports let. me point out some that i really like . this is opec 's revenue this green box here seven hundred and eighty billion a year <unk> . and this little pixel in the corner three billion that 's their climate change fund. americans incredibly generous people. <unk> over three hundred billion a year donated to charity every year <unk> compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top seventeen industrialized nations at one hundred and twenty billion <unk>. then of course the iraq war predicted to cost just sixty billion back in two thousand and three and. it mushroomed slightly afghanistan and iraq mushroomed now to three thousand billion so. now it 's great because now we have this texture. <unk> can add numbers to it as well so we could say well a new figure comes out let 's see african debt how much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that africa owes to the west let 's take a look <unk> . so there it is two hundred and twenty seven billion. is what africa owes and the recent financial crisis how much of this diagram might that figure take up what has that cost the world let 's. <unk> i think is the appropriate sound effect for. that much money <unk> eleven thousand nine hundred. billion <unk> so <unk> by visualizing this information we turned it into a landscape. that you can explore with your eyes a kind of map really a sort of information map and when you 're lost in information an information map is kind of useful . <unk> show you another landscape now we need to imagine what a landscape of the world 's fears. might look like let 's take a look <unk> this is mountains out of molehills a timeline of global media panic . so i 'll label this for you in a second <unk> but the height here i want to point out is the intensity of certain fears. as reported in the media <unk> let me point them out so this swine flu pink. sars brownish here remember that one <unk> the millennium bug <unk> . terrible disaster these little green peaks are asteroid collisions. <unk> these are what our fears look like over time in our media <unk> . but what i love and i 'm a journalist and what i love is finding hidden patterns i love being a data detective and there 's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it let. me highlight it for you . see this line <unk> this is a landscape for violent video games as you can see there 's a kind of. <unk> regular pattern in the data twin peaks every year if we look closer we see those peaks occur at the same month every year <unk> why . well <unk> november <unk> christmas video games come out and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content <unk> . but april isn 't a particularly. massive month for. video games why april well in april one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine was the columbine shooting and since then that fear has been remembered by the media. <unk> and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year you have retrospectives <unk> anniversaries court cases even <unk> copy cat shootings . all pushing that fear into the agenda <unk> . and there 's another pattern here as well can you spot it see that gap there there 's a gap <unk> and it affects all the other stories <unk> . why is there a gap there you see where it starts <unk> september two thousand and one when we had something very real to be scared about. so i 've been working as a data journalist for about a year and i keep hearing a phrase. all the time which is this data is the new oil . data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights and it 's all around us and it can be mined very easily <unk> . it 's not a particularly great metaphor in these times especially if you live around the gulf. <unk> mexico <unk> but i would perhaps adapt this metaphor slightly and i would say that data is the new soil . because for me it feels like a fertile creative medium over the years <unk> online we 've laid down. a huge amount of information and data and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity and it 's been worked and tilled. <unk> kind of milking the metaphor a little bit but it 's a really fertile medium <unk> and it feels like visualizations infographics data visualizations they feel like flowers blooming from this medium <unk> . but if you look at it directly it 's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts <unk> but if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way <unk> . interesting things can appear and and different patterns can be revealed <unk> let me show you this . can you guess what this data set is what rises twice. <unk> a year <unk> once in easter and then two weeks before christmas has a mini peak every monday <unk> and then flattens out over the summer. <unk> information guru lee byron and myself we scraped ten thousand status facebook updates for the phrase. <unk> we found people clearing out for spring break . coming out of very bad weekends on a monday . being single over the summer <unk> and then the lowest day of the year of course <unk> christmas day <unk> who would do that . so there 's a titanic amount of data out there now unprecedented <unk> but if you ask. <unk> the right kind of question or you work it in the right kind of way <unk> interesting things can emerge <unk> . so. information is beautiful data is beautiful i wonder if i could make my life beautiful <unk> . and here 's my visual c v i 'm not quite sure i 've succeeded <unk> pretty blocky the colors aren 't that great but i wanted to convey something. <unk> i started as a programmer and then i worked as a writer for many years about twenty years in print online and then in advertising and only recently have i started designing and. i 've never been to design school <unk> i 've never studied art or anything <unk> i just kind of learned through doing . and when i started designing i discovered an odd thing about myself <unk> i already knew how to design. but it wasn 't like i was amazingly. <unk> amazingly brilliant at it but more like i was sensitive to the. the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography it. 's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me. <unk> and i don 't feel like i 'm unique <unk> i feel that everyday all of us now are being blasted by information design . it 's being poured into our eyes through the web and we 're all visualizers now we 're all demanding a visual aspect to our. information. almost quite magical about visual information. it 's effortless it literally pours in and if you 're navigating a dense information jungle <unk> coming across a beautiful. graphic or a lovely data visualization it 's a relief it 's like coming across a clearing in the jungle <unk> i was curious about this so it led me to the work of a danish physicist called. <unk> and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms <unk> . so here we go this is your senses pouring into your senses every second . your sense of sight is the fastest <unk> it has the same bandwidth as a computer network . then you have touch which is about the speed of a usb key <unk> and then you have hearing and smell which has the throughput of a hard disk and then you have poor old taste which is like. barely the throughput of a pocket calculator <unk> and that little square in the corner. a naught 7 percent that 's the amount we 're actually aware of so a lot of your vision the bulk of it is visual and it 's pouring in it 's unconscious <unk>. the eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color shape and pattern . it loves them and it calls them beautiful it 's the language of the eye <unk> if you combine the language of the eye. with the language of the mind which is about words and numbers and. <unk> concepts <unk> you start speaking two languages simultaneously each enhancing the other . so you have the eye <unk> and then you drop in the concepts and that whole thing it 's two languages both working at the same time <unk> . so we can use this new kind of language if you like to alter our perspective or change our views. let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer <unk> who has the biggest military budget it 's got to be. america right massive six hundred and nine billion in two thousand and eight six hundred and seven rather . so massive in fact that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble . now you can see africa 's total debt there and the u k budget deficit for reference <unk> . so. that might well chime with your view that america is a sort of warmongering military machine out to overpower the world with its huge. <unk> complex . but is it true that america has the biggest military budget . because america is an incredibly rich country in fact it 's so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations ' economies inside itself it 's. so vastly rich so its military budget is bound to be enormous. <unk> to be fair and to alter our perspective we have to bring in another data set and that data set is gdp or the country 's earnings <unk> who has the biggest budget as a proportion of gdp let 's have a look that. changes the picture considerably . other countries pop into view that you perhaps weren 't considering <unk> and american drops into eighth now you can also do this with soldiers <unk> who has the most soldiers it 's got to be. china of course two point one million again chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to you know mobilize its enormous forces. but of course <unk> china has an enormous population so if we do the same we see a radically different picture <unk> china drops to <unk>. it actually has a tiny army. when you take other data into consideration <unk> . so <unk> absolute figures like the military budget in a connected world don 't give you the whole picture they 're not as true as they could be . we need relative figures that are connected to other data. <unk> can see a fuller picture <unk> and then that can lead to us changing our perspective as hans rosling the master my master <unk> said . let the dataset change your mindset . and if it can do that maybe it can also change your behavior take a look at this one i 'm a bit of a health nut <unk> i love. <unk> taking supplements and being fit but i can never. understand what 's going on in terms of evidence there 's always conflicting evidence should i take vitamin c should i be taking wheatgrass . this is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements. this kind of diagram is called a balloon race <unk> . so the higher up the image <unk> the more evidence there is for each supplement and the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to google hits. <unk> so you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity . but you can also if you grade the evidence do a worth it line so supplements above this line. are worth investigating but only for the conditions. listed below and then the supplements below the line. are perhaps not worth investigating now this image constitutes a huge amount of work we scraped like one thousand studies from pubmed the biomedical database. <unk> and we compiled them and graded them all and it was incredibly frustrating for me because i had a book of two hundred and fifty. visualizations to do for my book and i spent a month doing this and i only filled two pages but what it points to is that. visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression it 's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space. <unk> and once you 've curated that data and once you 've cleaned that data and once it 's there you can do cool stuff like this so i converted this into an interactive app <unk> . so i can now generate this application online this is the visualization online and i can say yeah brilliant . so it spawns itself <unk> and then i can say well just show me the stuff that affects heart health so let. 's filter that out <unk> so heart is filtered out so i can see if i 'm curious about that i think. <unk> want to take any synthetics i just want to see plants and and. just show me herbs and plants i 've got all the natural ingredients . now this app is spawning itself from the data the data is all stored in a google doc <unk> and it 's literally generating itself from that data so the data is now alive this is a living image and i can update it in a second new evidence. <unk> it can go beyond data and it can go beyond numbers i like to apply information visualization. to ideas and concepts <unk> this is a visualization of the. political spectrum an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down. <unk> from government into society and culture into families into individuals into their beliefs and and back around again in a cycle . what i love about this image is. it 's made up of concepts it explores our worldviews and it helps us it helps me anyway to see what others think to see where they 're coming from and it feels. just incredibly cool to do that. most exciting for me. designing this was that when i was designing this image <unk> . i desperately wanted this side <unk> the left side to be better than the right side being a journalist a left leaning person. but i couldn 't because i would have created a lopsided <unk> biased diagram . so in order to really create a full image i had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time. <unk> uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me which was very very annoying and uncomfortable . but not too uncomfortable because there 's something. unthreatening about seeing a political perspective <unk> versus being told or forced to. <unk> you 're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them it 's even fun to engage with them because it 's visual so that 's what. 's exciting to me <unk> seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream beautiful lovely data . so . just to wrap up i wanted to say that. it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions <unk> and information design. is about solving information problems it feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability <unk>. <unk> and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency or even just interestingness i mean i find information just too interesting it has a magnetic quality that draws me in . <unk> visualizing information can give us a very quick solution. to those kinds of problems even when the information is terrible the visual can be quite beautiful. often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly like this one . the recent icelandic volcano <unk> . which was emitting the most co2 was it the planes. or the volcano <unk> the grounded planes or the volcano <unk> so we can have a look we look at the data and we see. the volcano emitted one hundred and fifty thousand tons the grounded planes would have emitted three hundred and forty five thousand if they were in the sky <unk> so essentially <unk> we had our first.
