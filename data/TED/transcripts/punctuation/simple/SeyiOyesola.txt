 <unk> just to put. everything in context . and to kind of give you a background to where i 'm coming from so that a lot of the things i 'm going to say and the things i 'm going to do or. things i 'm going to tell you i 've done. you will understand exactly. why and how i got motivated to. to be where i am <unk> i graduated high school in cleveland ohio <unk>. and just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad we went back home finished. university education got a medical degree one thousand nine hundred and eighty six and by the time i was. an intern house officer <unk> i could barely afford to maintain my mother 's. 13 year old car and i was a paid doctor. this brings us to why a lot of us who are professionals are now as they say in diaspora . now are we going to make that a permanent thing where we all get trained and we leave <unk> . and we don 't go back . perhaps not. <unk> i should certainly hope not. because that is not my vision all right <unk> for good measure <unk> that 's where nigeria is. on the african map <unk> and just there is the delta region. that i 'm sure everybody 's heard of people getting kidnapped where the oil comes from the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy. in nigeria. <unk> but critical poverty this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago. tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care very interesting. <unk> how many people do you think. are on that taxi and believe it or not that is a taxi in nigeria and the capital well <unk> what used to be the capital. <unk> of nigeria lagos <unk> that 's a taxi and you have police on them so <unk>. <unk> how many policemen do you think are on this taxi <unk> and now <unk> three so when these. kind of people and believe me it 's not just the police that use these taxis in in lagos <unk> we all do i 've been on one of these and i didn 't have a helmet either. <unk> and it just reminds me of the thought. of what happens. when. one of us on a taxi like this. falls off has an accident and needs a hospital believe it or not some of us do survive some of us do survive. <unk> we do survive aids <unk> and like i tell my family and my wife reminds me every time . you 're risking your life you know <unk> every time you go to that country and she 's right <unk> . every time you go there <unk> you know. that if you actually need. critical care. critical care of any sort if you have an accident of which there are many there are accidents everywhere. where do they go where do they go when they. <unk> need. help for this kind of stuff <unk> i 'm not saying instead of . i 'm saying as well as aids <unk> tb malaria <unk> . typhoid the list goes on i 'm saying where do they go when they 're like me . when i go back home and i do. all kinds of things i teach <unk> i train. but i catch one of these things or i 'm chronically ill. <unk> with one of those . where do they go what 's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled <unk> . i think it 's quite significant this is where they go . these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden this is a major hospital in. <unk> from a major teaching hospital in nigeria now that. is less than a year old . in an operating room that 's sterilizing equipment in nigeria <unk> you remember all that oil yes . i 'm sorry if it upsets some of you but i think you need to see this <unk> that 's the floor <unk> ok <unk> you can say some of this is education you can say it 's. <unk> i 'm not pleading poverty <unk> i 'm saying we need more. than just you know vaccination . malaria <unk> aids <unk> because i want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there in fact when i start. running around saying hey <unk> boys and girls you 're cardiologists in the u s can you come home with me and do a mission i want them to think well there 's some. <unk> have a look at that that 's the anesthesiology machine <unk> and that 's my specialty right <unk> anesthesiology and critical care. look at that bag it 's been. taped with tape that we even stopped using in the <unk> u k and believe me these are current pictures now <unk> if something like this . which. has happened in the u k that 's where they go this is the intensive care unit. <unk> this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in. nigeria and jokingly we refer to it as expensive scare because it 's scary. and it 's expensive <unk> but we need to have it <unk> ok <unk>. so these are the problems there are no prizes for. telling us what the problems are. <unk> i think we all know and. several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us. even more problems these are a few of them . so what did i do there we go we 're going on a mission we 're going to do some open heart surgery i was the only. brit on a team of about nine american cardiac surgeons cardiac nurse intensive care nurse. <unk> we all went out and did a mission and we 've done three of them so far just so you know <unk> i do believe in missions i do believe in aid. and i do believe in charity they have their place <unk> but where do they go. for those things we talked about earlier because it 's not everyone that 's going to benefit from a mission . health is wealth in the words of hans rosling. <unk> you get. wealthier faster. if you are healthy first so here we are mission big trouble open heart surgery in nigeria. big trouble that 's mike mike comes out from mississippi <unk> does he look like he 's happy. <unk> it took us two days just to organize the place but hey <unk> you know. <unk> does he look happy yes . that 's the medical advice the committee chairman says yes i told you you weren 't going to be able to you can 't do this i just know it . look that 's the technician we had so yes you go on all right . i got him to come with me anesthesia tech come with me from the u k yes let 's just go work this thing out. <unk> africa generally <unk> we get a lot of donated equipment equipment that 's obsolete equipment that doesn 't quite work or it works and you can 't fix it and there 's nothing wrong with that <unk>. so long as we use it and we move on <unk> but we had problems with it we had severe problems there he had to get on the phone <unk> this guy was always on the phone so what we going to do now <unk> it looks like all these americans are here and yes. he thinks he 's british actually and he 's actually nigerian i just thought about that we eventually got it working is the truth <unk> . but it was one of these even older than the one you saw . the reason i have this picture here this x ray it 's just to tell you. where and how we were viewing x rays do you. <unk> nowadays everything 's on pax anyway you look at your x rays on a screen. and you you do stuff with them you email them <unk> but we were still using x rays but we didn 't even have a viewing box and we were doing <unk> open heart surgery <unk> . ok i know it 's not aids i know it 's not malaria <unk> but we still need this stuff. <unk> this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready. <unk> people still believe in voodoo heart disease . vsd hole in the heart <unk> tetralogies you still get people who believe in it and they came at sixty seven percent. oxygen saturation the normal is about ninety seven her condition open heart surgery that as she required <unk> would have been treated when she was a child <unk> . we had to do these for adults so we did succeed. and we still do we 've done three we 're planning another one in july in the north of the country so we certainly still do open heart but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in we ship everything instruments <unk> . we had explosions. because the kit was designed was designed and installed by people who weren 't used to it the oxygen. <unk> tanks didn 't quite work right but how many did we do the first one . twelve we did twelve open heart surgical patients successfully here is our very first patient out of intensive care <unk> . and. just watch that chair all right this is what i mean about. appropriate technology. <unk> that 's what he was doing <unk> propping up. the bed because the bed simply didn 't work have you seen one of those before no. doesn 't matter it worked i 'm sure you 've all seen or heard this before we the willing have been doing so much with so little for so long. <unk> this was my first company this one 's sole aim is to provide the very things that i think are missing so we put my hand in my pocket and say guys let 's just buy stuff let <unk>. <unk> 's go set up a company that teaches people educates them <unk> gives them the tools they need to keep going . <unk> transport <unk> this one will do everything and it will do it at half the price and doesn 't need compressed air if you 're in america and you don 't know about this one we do because we make it our duty. to find out what 's appropriate technology for for africa. what 's appropriately priced <unk> does the job and we move on anesthesia machine multi parameter. <unk> this little unit here. remember your little 12 volt plug in the car that charges your <unk> whatever <unk> game boy telephone <unk> . that 's exactly how the outlets are designed yes it will take a solar panel yes. a solar panel will charge it <unk> but if you 've got mains as well <unk> it will charge the batteries in there <unk> . and guess what we have a little pedal charger too. <unk> just in case <unk> and guess what if it all fails if you can find a car that 's still got a live battery and you stick it in it will still work <unk> . then you can customize it . is it dental surgery you want <unk> general surgery you want <unk> decide which instruments <unk> . stock it up with consumables <unk> . and currently we 're working on oxygen oxygen. oxygen. delivery is not new. <unk> oxygen concentrators are very old technology what is new <unk> and what we will have in a few months i hope is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce. <unk> 's not new zeolite removes nitrogen from air and. nitrogen is seventy eight percent. of air if you take nitrogen out what 's left oxygen pretty much so that 's not. new what we 're doing is applying this technology to it <unk> these are the basic features of my device or our device. <unk> this is what makes it so special apart from the awards it 's won it 's portable and it 's certified it 's. registered the mhra and the ce mark for those who don 't know for europe is the equivalent of <unk>. in the u s if you compare it with what 's on the market. ease of use complexity this picture was taken last year these are members of my graduating class. <unk> it was in this gentleman 's house in the potomac for those of you who are familiar with maryland <unk> there are too many of us outside. and everybody just to borrow a bit from hans hans rosling he 's my guy. if the size of the text represents what gets the most. <unk> the problems but what we really need are african solutions. that are appropriate for africa looking at the culture <unk> looking at the people looking at how much money they 've got . african people because they will do it with a passion <unk> i hope <unk> . and lots and lots of that little bit down there sacrifice you have to do it <unk> africans have to do it . in conjunction with everyone else <unk> thank you.
