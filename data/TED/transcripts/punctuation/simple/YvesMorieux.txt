 <unk> have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas why is productivity so disappointing. in all the companies where i work i have worked with more than. <unk> the internet . enigma number two . why is there so little engagement at work why do people feel so miserable even actively disengaged <unk> . disengaging their colleagues acting against the. interest of their. <unk> the celebration the people initiatives <unk> . the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams <unk> . at the beginning i thought there was a chicken and egg issue because people are less engaged they are less productive or vice versa because they are less. <unk> we put more pressure and they are less engaged <unk> but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates in fact to the basic pillars of management . the way we organize is based on two pillars <unk> the hard structure processes systems <unk> the soft feelings <unk> sentiments interpersonal relationships . traits <unk> personality. <unk> goes through a cultural transformation program <unk> it chooses these two pillars <unk>. <unk> now we try to refine them <unk> we try to combine them <unk> the real issue is and this is the answer to the two enigmas these pillars are obsolete <unk> . everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their. <unk> do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business <unk> the hard approach basically is that you start from strategy <unk>. <unk> systems kpis scorecards <unk> committees headquarters <unk> hubs clusters <unk> you name it i forgot all the <unk>. <unk> committees middle offices and interfaces <unk> what happens basically on the left you have more complexity the new complexity of business. we need quality <unk> cost reliability speed and every time there is a new requirement we use the same approach we create dedicated structure <unk>. <unk> processed systems basically to deal with the new complexity of business <unk> the hard approach. in the organization . <unk> any new requirement you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement what happens when the new requirement emerges <unk> some years ago a new requirement appeared on. <unk> the marketplace <unk> the length of the warranty period so therefore the new requirement is repairability making cars easy to repair otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light if you have to remove the engine. to access the lights the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours <unk> and the warranty budget will. <unk> what percentage of these people is variable compensation twenty percent at most. <unk> most <unk> divided by <unk>. <unk> makes a difference of zero point eight percent . what difference did it make in their actions their choices to simplify zero <unk> . but what occurs for zero impact <unk> mr repairability process scorecard evaluation . coordination with the twenty five other coordinators to have. <unk> in front of the new complexity of business <unk> the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines . it is basically the interplay <unk> . how the parts work together <unk> the connections <unk> . the interactions <unk> the synapses <unk> it is not the skeleton of boxes <unk> it is the nervous system of. <unk> whenever people cooperate <unk> they use less resources in everything . you know the repairability issue is a cooperation problem . when you design cars please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages . when we don 't cooperate we need more time more equipment. more systems <unk> more teams we need when procurement supply chain manufacturing don 't cooperate we need more stock more inventories more working capital who will pay for that . shareholders <unk> customers no they will refuse so who is left <unk> . the employees <unk> who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation. burnout <unk> they are overwhelmed <unk> accidents no wonder they disengage <unk> . how do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation . the hard in banks when there is a problem between the back office and the front office they don 't cooperate what is the solution they create. <unk> what happens one year later instead of one problem between the back and the front now i have two problems between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front <unk> plus i have to pay for the middle office <unk> . the hard approach is unable to foster cooperation it can only add new boxes new bones in the skeleton . the soft approach to make people cooperate we need to make them. <unk> improve interpersonal feelings the more people like each other the more they will cooperate it is totally wrong <unk> . it is even counterproductive <unk> look at home i have two tvs <unk> why precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife . not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife and why i try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because i love my wife <unk> . if i didn 't love my wife one tv would be enough. you will watch my favorite football game if you are not happy <unk> how is the book or the door . the more we like each other <unk> the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs and we go for a second tv or we escalate the decision above for. <unk> have to remove the engine to access the lights. <unk> the new complexity of business.
