 <unk> speaking up. is hard to do <unk> i understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago when my wife and i became. new parents <unk>. <unk> it was an amazing moment it was exhilarating and elating but it was also scary and terrifying and it got particularly terrifying. when we got home from the hospital and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding <unk> . and we wanted to call. our pediatrician <unk> but we also didn 't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy neurotic. <unk> so we worried <unk> and we waited <unk> when we got to the doctor 's office the next day she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated <unk>. our son is fine now and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her . but in that moment <unk> i should 've spoken up <unk> but i didn 't . but sometimes we speak up when we shouldn 't and i learned that over ten years ago when i let my twin brother down my twin brother. and for one of his first films he got an offer from a distribution company <unk>. he was excited and he was inclined to accept the offer <unk> but as a negotiations researcher <unk> i insisted he make a counteroffer <unk> and i helped him craft the perfect one . and it was perfect. <unk> the company was so offended they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing <unk> . and i 've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up when they can assert themselves when they can push their interests when they can express an opinion . when they can make an ambitious ask <unk> . and. the range of stories are varied and diverse <unk> but they also make up a universal tapestry can i correct my boss when they make a. <unk> mistake can i confront my coworker. who keeps stepping on my toes can i challenge my friend 's insensitive joke can i tell the person i love the most. my deepest insecurities <unk> . and through these experiences i 've come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior <unk> now <unk> sometimes. we 're too strong we push ourselves too much. <unk> 's what happened with my brother even making. an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior <unk> but sometimes we 're too weak <unk> that 's what happened with my wife and <unk> i . and this range of acceptable behaviors when we stay within our range <unk> we 're rewarded <unk> when we step outside that range <unk> we get punished in a variety of ways we get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized or we lose that raise or that promotion. or that deal <unk> now <unk> the first thing we need to know is what is my range <unk> but. the key thing is our range isn 't fixed. it 's actually pretty dynamic <unk> it expands. and it narrows based on the context and there 's one thing that determines that range more than anything else <unk> . and that 's your power <unk> your power determines your range. <unk> what is power <unk> power comes in lots of forms in negotiations it comes in the form of alternatives <unk> . so my brother had no alternatives <unk> he lacked power <unk> the company had lots of alternatives <unk> they had power sometimes it 's being new to a country like an immigrant or new to <unk>. <unk> an organization or new to an experience like my wife and i as new parents <unk> sometimes it 's at work where someone 's the boss and someone 's the subordinate. <unk> sometimes it 's in relationships where one person 's more invested than the other person . and the key thing is is that when we have lots of power <unk> our range is very wide we have a lot of leeway in how to behave <unk> . but when we lack power <unk> our range narrows <unk> we have very little leeway <unk>. the problem is. <unk> double bind happens when if we don 't speak up we go unnoticed <unk> . but if we do speak up <unk> we get punished <unk> . now many of you have heard the phrase the double bind and connected it with one thing and that 's gender the gender double bind is women who don 't speak up go unnoticed. <unk> and women who do speak up get punished <unk> and the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up <unk> . but they have barriers to doing so . but what my research has shown over the last two decades is is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind <unk>. it 's a really a low power double bind <unk> and what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise . <unk> and a woman or men and women <unk> and think biological cause there 's something fundamentally different about the sexes . but in study after study i 've found that a better explanation for many sex differences. is really power <unk> and so it 's the. <unk> lack power we have a narrow range and our double bind is very large . so we need to find ways to expand our range and over the last couple decades my colleagues and i have found two things really matter <unk> . the first you seem seem powerful in your own eyes the second you seem powerful in the eyes of others <unk> when i. i feel powerful . i feel confident not fearful i expand my own range <unk> when other people see me as powerful . they grant me a wider range <unk> so we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior and i 'm going to give you a set of tools today <unk>. <unk> speaking up is risky <unk> . but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up. <unk> the first. tool i 'm going to give you. got discovered in negotiations in an important finding . on average women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table . but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered there 's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious . that 's when they. <unk> when they advocate for others <unk> they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind they become more assertive <unk> this is sometimes called the mama bear effect . like a mama bear defending her cubs when we advocate for others we can discover our own voice <unk> . but sometimes we have to advocate for ourselves. <unk> how do we do that one of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective taking and <unk>. is really simple it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person <unk>. it 's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range <unk> when i take your perspective <unk> and i think about what you really want you 're more likely to give me what i really want <unk> . but here 's the problem. is hard to do so let 's do a little experiment <unk> i want you all to hold your hand just like this your finger put it up . and i want you to draw a capital letter e on your forehead as quickly as possible <unk> . ok <unk> it turns out that we can draw this e in one of two. <unk> this was originally designed as a test of perspective taking i 'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an e on their forehead my former student erika hall. and you can see over here that 's the correct e i drew the e so it looks like an e to another person that 's the <unk> perspective taking e because it looks like an e from someone else 's vantage point but this e over here. <unk> crisis <unk> i want to tell you about a particular crisis a man walks into a bank in watsonville california <unk> . and he says give me $ two thousand or i 'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb . now the bank manager didn 't give him the money <unk> she took a step back she took his perspective <unk> and she noticed something really important . he asked for a specific amount of money <unk> so she said. why did you ask for $ two thousand and he said my friend is going to be evicted unless i get him $ two thousand immediately and she said oh . you don 't want to rob the bank you want to take out a loan. <unk> someone 's perspective it allows us to be ambitious and assertive but still be likable. <unk> here 's another way to be assertive but still be likable <unk> and that is to signal flexibility . now <unk> imagine you 're a car salesperson <unk> and you want to sell someone a car you 're going to more likely make the sale if you give them. <unk> my research shows that when you give people a choice among options <unk> it lowers their defenses and they 're more likely to accept your offer . and this doesn 't just work with salespeople it works with parents <unk> when my niece was four <unk> she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything <unk> . but then my sister in law had a brilliant idea. <unk> what if i gave my my daughter a choice this shirt or that shirt <unk> ok that shirt this pant or that pant ok <unk> that pant <unk> and it worked brilliantly she got dressed quickly and without resistance when. i 've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up <unk> the number one answer is when i have social support in my. <unk> so we want to get allies on our side how do we do that well . one of the ways is be a mama bear when we advocate for others we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others <unk> but we also earn strong allies <unk>. <unk> another way we can earn strong allies <unk> especially in high places is by asking other people for advice <unk> . when we ask others for advice. <unk> like us because we flatter them <unk> and we 're expressing humility <unk> and this really works to solve another double bind <unk> and that 's the <unk>. the self promotion double bind is that if we don 't advertise our accomplishments <unk> no one notices <unk> and if we do we 're not likable <unk> but if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments we. are able to be competent in their. <unk> eyes but also be likeable and this is so powerful. it even works when you see it coming there. have been multiple times in life when i have been forewarned that a low power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice. i want you to notice three things about this first i knew they were going to come ask me for advice two. 've actually done research on the. <unk> strategic benefits of asking for advice <unk> and three <unk> it still worked <unk> . i took their perspective i became more invested in their cause i became more committed to them because they asked for advice <unk> . now <unk> another time we feel more confident speaking up. is when we have expertise expertise gives us credibility <unk> when we have high power <unk> we already have credibility we. <unk> only need good evidence . when we lack power <unk> . we don 't have the credibility <unk> we need excellent evidence . and one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion <unk> . i want everyone. in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them i want you to describe a passion of yours to me i 've had people do this all over the world. and i asked them what did you notice about the other person when they described their passion and the answers are always the same their eyes lit up and got big they smiled <unk>. a big beaming smile they used their hands all over i had to duck because their hands were coming at me . as you listened to their passion . they said my eyes lit up <unk> i smiled i leaned in . when we tap into our passion <unk> we give ourselves the courage in our own eyes to speak up <unk> but we also get the permission from others to speak up. tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak <unk> both men and women get punished. <unk> at work when they shed tears . but lizzie wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion <unk> the condemnation of our crying. disappears for both men and women i want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother 's wedding. <unk> my dad was a psychologist like me but his real love and his real passion was cinema like my brother <unk> and so he wrote a speech for my brother 's wedding. about the roles we play in the human comedy <unk> . and he said the lighter your touch <unk> the better you become at improving and enriching your performance those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance. grow change. and expand the self play it well <unk> and your days will be mostly joyful . what my dad was saying is that we 've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world <unk> . but he was also saying the essence of this talk <unk> . those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and. <unk> so when a scene calls for it be a ferocious mama bear. and a humble advice seeker have excellent evidence and strong. allies be a passionate perspective taker <unk> and if you use those tools and each and every one of you can use these tools. you will expand your range of acceptable behavior <unk> and your days will be mostly joyful <unk> thank you.
