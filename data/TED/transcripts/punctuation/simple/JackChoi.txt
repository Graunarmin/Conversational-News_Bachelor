 <unk> you know cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy for students it 's quite an experience . but for a school <unk> it could be very difficult. or expensive to maintain <unk> so we learned the. <unk> majority of anatomic classes taught . they do not have a cadaver dissection lab <unk> . maybe those reasons <unk> or depending on where you are cadavers may not be easily available <unk> so to address this . we developed with a dr brown in stanford <unk> . virtual dissection table. <unk> so with this anatomage table students can experience. the dissection without a human cadaver and the table form is important and since <unk>. just like the way they do dissections in the lab or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact. <unk> with your table our digital body. is one to one life size <unk> . so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy i. 'm going to do. some demonstrations <unk> as you can see. <unk> i use my finger to interact with my digital body. <unk> i 'm going to do some cuts i can cut any way i want to so i cut right here <unk> . then it 's going to show inside . and i can change my cut to see different parts <unk> . maybe i can cut there see the brain. <unk> and i can change my cut you can see some internal organs. <unk> so we call this. the slicer mode <unk> . <unk> going to do another cut . right there . this shows a lot of internal structures. <unk> so if i want to see the back side i can flip. and see from behind . <unk> images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you that means. we did the right job <unk> . so our doctors said these are eye candies. <unk> so instead of just butchering the body <unk> i 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to peel off all the skin. <unk> muscles and bones <unk> just to see a few internal organs <unk> . right here <unk> . let 's say. i 'm going to cut the liver right here. <unk> let 's say i 'm interested in looking at the heart <unk> i 'm going to do some surgery here. <unk> going to make a cut right there <unk> . and then you can see the inside of the heart you can see the atrium and the ventricles how blood flows to our. <unk> and veins. <unk> just like this students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to . it doesn 't have to be always dissection since it 's digital we can do reverse dissection . so let me show you i 'm going to start with the skeletal structure and i can add a few internal organs. yep maybe i can add quickly this way . and i can build muscles gradually just. like that we can see tendons and muscles . wish i could build my muscle this fast. <unk> way to. learn anatomy another thing i can show you is more often than not doctors get to meet patients. in x ray form so anatomage table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear. <unk> and also if you want you can compare. with how anatomy would appear in x ray too so when you are done <unk> just bring back. the body. and then it 's ready for another session it. looks like our table also can transform gender too it 's a female now.
