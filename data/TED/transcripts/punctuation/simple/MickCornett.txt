 <unk> how many of you have not been to oklahoma city and have no idea who i am <unk> . most of you let me give you a little bit of background . <unk> oklahoma city started in the most unique way imaginable back on a spring day in one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine the federal government held what they called a land run . they literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line <unk> and they fired off a gun <unk> and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake <unk> . and wherever they put down that stake that was their new home <unk> . and at the end of the very first day <unk> the population of oklahoma city had gone from zero to ten thousand. <unk> and our planning department is still paying for that . the citizens got together on that first day and elected a mayor <unk> and then they shot him . that 's not really all that funny. <unk> but it allows me to see what type of audience i 'm dealing with so i. appreciate the feedback . the <unk> 20th century was fairly kind to oklahoma city our economy was based on commodities so the price of cotton or the price of wheat . and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas . and along the way we became a city of innovation <unk> . the shopping cart was. <unk> parking meter invented in oklahoma city <unk> you 're welcome. <unk> having an economy though that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs and that was certainly the case in oklahoma city 's history <unk>. <unk> when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat our economy was soaring <unk> and then in the early. 1980s it cratered quickly . the price of energy dropped <unk> our banks began to fail before the end of the decade one hundred banks had failed in the state of oklahoma . there was no bailout on the horizon <unk> . our banking industry <unk> our oil and gas industry <unk> our commercial real estate industry were all. <unk> at the bottom of the economic scale <unk> . young people were leaving oklahoma city in droves for washington and dallas and houston and new york and tokyo <unk> anywhere where they could find a job that measured up to their educational attainment because in oklahoma city the good jobs just weren 't there <unk> . but along at the end of the ' 80s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named ron <unk>. <unk> norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn 't incentivizing companies up front it was about creating a place where businesses. <unk> to locate and so he pushed an initiative called maps. that basically was a penny on the dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff it built a new sports arena . a new canal downtown it fixed up our performing arts center . a new baseball stadium downtown a lot of things to improve the quality of life and the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life the next mayor came. <unk> along . he started maps for kids <unk> rebuilt the entire inner city school system all seventy five buildings either built anew or refurbished <unk> . and then in two thousand and four in this rare. collective lack of judgment. bordering on civil disobedience. <unk> the citizens elected me mayor now the city i inherited. was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy <unk> . and for the very first time we started showing up on the lists . now you know the lists i 'm talking about the media and the internet love to rank cities . and in oklahoma. <unk> never really been on lists before . so i thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there we weren 't anywhere close to the top but we were on the list we were somebody <unk> . best city to get a job <unk> best city to start a business <unk> best downtown. oklahoma city <unk> and then. came the list. of the most obese cities in the country. <unk> there we were now i like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places . dallas and houston and new orleans and atlanta and miami you know these are cities that typically you 're not embarrassed to be associated with . but nonetheless <unk> i didn 't like being on the list . and about that time <unk> i got on the scales. <unk> scales <unk> . and i weighed two hundred and twenty pounds <unk> and then i went to this website sponsored by the federal government <unk> and i typed in my height i typed in my weight. and i pushed enter <unk> and it came back and said. <unk> obese . and then i started getting honest with myself about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity <unk> . and i noticed this pattern . that i was gaining about two or three pounds a year <unk> and then about every ten years i 'd drop twenty or thirty pounds <unk> . and then i 'd do it again <unk> and i had this huge closet full of clothes <unk> and i could only wear a third of it at any one time. <unk> and only i knew which part of the closet i could wear but it all seemed fairly normal going through it <unk> . well <unk> . i finally decided i needed to lose weight and i knew i could because i 'd done it so many times before so i simply stopped eating as much i had always exercised that really wasn 't the part of the equation that i needed to work on . but i had been eating three thousand calories a day. and i cut it to two thousand calories a day and the weight came off i lost about a pound a week for about forty weeks . along the way though <unk> i started examining my city <unk> . its culture <unk> its infrastructure <unk> trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity. <unk> and i came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car . laughter but if you happen to be a person you are combatting the car seemingly at every. <unk> no traffic congestion in oklahoma city to speak of . and so people live far far away <unk> our city limits are enormous <unk> six hundred and twenty square miles but fifteen miles is less than fifteen minutes . you literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in oklahoma city <unk> . and as a result people tend to spread out land 's cheap. we had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments for a long long time we had fixed that but it had been relatively recently and there were. literally one hundred thousand or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had virtually no level of walkability. <unk> how we might deal with obesity and was taking all of these elements into my mind i decided that the first thing we need to do. was have a conversation you see in oklahoma city <unk> we weren 't talking about obesity <unk> and so . on new year 's eve of two thousand and seven i went to the zoo <unk> . and i stood in front of the elephants <unk> and i said. <unk> city is going on a diet <unk> and we 're going to lose a million pounds well that 's when all hell broke loose . the national media gravitated toward this story immediately <unk> . and they really could have gone with it one of two ways. <unk> they could have said this city is so fat. that the mayor had to put them on a diet . but fortunately <unk> the consensus was look this is a problem in a lot of places this is a city that 's wanting to do something about it . and so they started helping us drive traffic to the website <unk> now the web address was. <unk> weekday morning to talk about the the initiative and on that day one hundred and fifty thousand visits were placed to our website people were signing up <unk> . and so the pounds started to add up and the conversation that i thought was so important to have was starting to take place it was taking place inside the. <unk> mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids <unk> it was taking place in churches . churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity <unk> . suddenly it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace <unk> and the large companies they typically have wonderful wellness programs but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like. <unk> they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to. deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others. <unk> and then came the next stage of the equation . it was time to push what i called maps three now maps three. <unk> like the other two programs had had an economic development motive behind it . but along with the traditional economic development tasks like building a new convention center <unk> we added some health related infrastructure to the process <unk> . we added a new central park seventy acres in size to be right downtown in oklahoma city <unk> . we 're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there. <unk> and wellness centers throughout the community. <unk> we put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original maps and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe kayak and rowing <unk> . we hosted the olympic trials last spring we have olympic caliber events coming to. <unk> athletes from all over the world moving in . along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional <unk> . we also with another initiative that was passed are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area we. 're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two. we had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods <unk> but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability <unk> . through yet another funding source we 're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian friendly our streets were really wide <unk> . <unk> and you 'd push the button to allow you to walk across <unk> and you had to run in order to get there in time <unk> . <unk> really a redesign rethinking the way we build our infrastructure designing a city around people and not cars <unk> . we 're completing our bicycle trail master plan we 'll have over one hundred miles when we 're. through building it out <unk> and so you see this culture starting to shift in oklahoma city <unk> and lo and behold the demographic. <unk> changes that are coming with it are very inspiring <unk> . highly educated twentysomethings are moving to oklahoma city from all over the region and indeed even from further away in california . when we reached a million pounds in january of two thousand and twelve <unk> i flew to new york with some. <unk> participants who had lost over one hundred pounds whose lives had been changed <unk> . and we appeared on the rachael ray show <unk> and then that afternoon i did a round of media in new york pushing. the same messages that you 're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it <unk> . and i went into the lobby of men 's fitness magazine . the same magazine that had put us on that list. <unk> five years before <unk> . and as i 'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter <unk> i notice there 's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table <unk> . and i pick it up and i look at the headline across the top and it says america 's fattest cities do you live in one . well <unk> i knew i did so i picked up the magazine and i began to look <unk> . and we weren 't on it. then i looked on the list of fittest cities <unk> and we were on that list . we were on the list as the <unk> 22nd fittest city in the united states <unk> our state health statistics are doing better <unk> . granted <unk> we have a long way to go health is still not something that we should be proud of in oklahoma city but we seem to have turned the. <unk> cultural shift. of making health a greater priority <unk> . and we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings people with choices choosing oklahoma city in large numbers <unk> . we have the lowest unemployment in the united states <unk> probably the strongest economy in the united states <unk> . and if you 're like me at some point in your educational career you were asked to read a book called the grapes of wrath. oklahomans leaving for california in large numbers for a better future . when we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west it appears that what we 're seeing now is the wrath of grapes . the grandchildren are coming home. <unk> you 've been a great audience and very attentive thank you very much for having.
