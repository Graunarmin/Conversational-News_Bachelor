 <unk> when i was eleven <unk> seeing some of my friends leaving the school because their parents could not afford textbooks. made me angry <unk> . when i was twenty seven hearing the plight of a desperate. slave father. whose daughter was about to be sold to a brothel. made me angry <unk> . at the age of fifty. the street in a pool of blood <unk> along with my own son . made me angry <unk> . dear friends for centuries. we were taught anger is bad our parents <unk> teachers priests everyone taught us. how to control and suppress our anger. but i ask why . why can 't we convert our anger for the larger good of society <unk> . why can 't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world . that i tried to do. <unk> friends <unk> . most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger <unk> like when i was. it has given birth to a new idea <unk> but i will come to that later on let me begin with. the story of how i got a name for myself <unk> . i had been a big admirer of mahatma gandhi since my childhood. <unk> and lead india 's freedom movement <unk> but more importantly he taught us. how to treat the most. vulnerable sections the most deprived people with dignity and respect . and so when. india was celebrating mahatma gandhi 's birth centenary in. and sixty nine at that time i was fifteen. an idea came to my mind . why can 't we celebrate it differently <unk> i knew as perhaps. many of you might know that in india a large number of people are born in the lowest. segment of caste . and they are treated as untouchables <unk> these are the people forget about. allowing them to go to the temples <unk> they cannot even go into the houses and shops. of high caste people <unk> so i. i was very impressed with the leaders of my. <unk> speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of gandhian ideals <unk> . so inspired by that i thought let us set an example by inviting these people. to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community <unk> i went to. some. <unk> it 's not possible it never happened . i said look at these leaders <unk> they are so great <unk> they are against untouchability they will come if nobody comes we can set an example . these people thought that. <unk> they were convinced my friends and i took our bicycles and invited. political leaders <unk> and i was so thrilled <unk> rather empowered. to see that each one of them agreed to come <unk> . i thought great idea we can set an example we can bring about change in the society. the day has come <unk> all these. untouchables <unk> three women and two men <unk> they. agreed to come <unk> i could recall that. they had used the best of their clothes <unk> they brought new utensils. they had taken baths hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do <unk> it was the moment of change . they gathered food was cooked it was seven o 'clock . by eight o 'clock we kept on waiting . because it 's not very uncommon that the leaders become late for an hour or so. <unk> so after eight o 'clock <unk> we took our bicycles and went to these leaders ' homes just to remind them . one of the leader 's wives. told me sorry <unk> he is having some headache perhaps he cannot come . i went to another leader and his wife told. he will definitely join so i thought that. the dinner will take place <unk> though not at that large a scale <unk> . i went back to the venue which was. a newly built mahatma gandhi park. it was ten o 'clock <unk> none of the. <unk> leaders showed up that made me angry . i was standing <unk> leaning against mahatma gandhi 's statue <unk> . i was emotionally drained <unk> rather exhausted. <unk> sat down where the food was lying <unk> . i kept my emotions on hold <unk> . but then when i took the first bite <unk> i broke down in tears and suddenly i felt. a hand. <unk> and it was the healing motherly touch. of an untouchable woman and she told me kailash why are you crying . you have done your bit <unk> you have eaten the food cooked by untouchables which has never happened in our memory. <unk> she was right <unk> . i came back home a little after midnight <unk> . shocked to see that several high caste elderly people were sitting in my courtyard <unk> . i saw my mother and elderly women were crying and they were pleading. to these elderly people because they had threatened to outcaste my whole family. and you know outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of . somehow they agreed to punish only me <unk> . and the punishment was purification that means i had to go six hundred miles away from my hometown. <unk> river ganges to take a holy dip <unk> . and after that i should organize a feast for priests one hundred and one priests wash their feet and drink that water . it was total nonsense <unk> and i refused to accept that punishment . how did they punish me <unk> i was barred from entering into my own kitchen. and my own dining room my utensils were separated. <unk> but the night when i was angry <unk> . they wanted to outcaste me <unk> . but i decided to outcaste the entire caste system . and that was possible because. the beginning would have been to change the family name or surname. <unk> in india most of the family names are caste names <unk> so i decided to drop my name <unk> . and then <unk> later on i gave a new name to myself. friends <unk> maybe one of you can tell me what. was i doing before becoming a children 's rights activist <unk> does anybody know <unk> . no <unk> . i was an engineer an electrical engineer and then i learned. how. the energy. <unk> of burning fire <unk> coal . the nuclear blast inside the chambers <unk> raging river currents. fierce winds . could be converted into the light and lives of millions <unk> . i also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy. <unk> could be harnessed for good and making society better <unk> so. i 'll come back to. the story of when i was caught in the prison <unk> i was very happy freeing a dozen children from slavery. <unk> handing them over to their parents <unk> i cannot explain my joy when i free a child <unk> . i was so happy <unk> . but when i was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown delhi <unk> . i saw that dozens of children were arriving <unk> they were being trafficked by someone <unk> i stopped them <unk> those people <unk> . <unk> i complained to the police <unk> so the policemen instead of helping me <unk> they threw me in this small <unk> tiny. shell <unk> like an animal <unk> . and that was the night of anger when one of the brightest and biggest ideas was born <unk> . i thought that if i keep on freeing ten children and fifty more will join <unk> . that 's not done and i believed in the power of consumers and let me tell you. <unk> that this was the first time. when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world . to educate and sensitize the consumers. to create a demand for. <unk> rugs in europe and america we have been successful <unk>. <unk> it has resulted. in a fall. in child labor in south asian countries by eighty percent . not only that . but this first ever consumer 's power or consumer 's campaign. has grown in other countries and other industries <unk> maybe chocolate maybe apparel maybe shoes it has gone beyond. my anger at the age of eleven when i realized how important education is for every child . i got an idea to collect used books. and help the poorest children i created a book bank at the at the age of. <unk> but i did not stop later on i cofounded the. world 's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the global campaign for education . that has helped in changing. the whole thinking towards education from the charity mode to the human rights mode <unk> and that has concretely helped the reduction of. <unk> my anger at the age of twenty seven to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel . has given me an idea to. go for a new strategy of raid and rescue freeing children from slavery. and i am. so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or ten or twenty <unk> . but my colleagues and i have been able to physically liberate eighty three thousand child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers. i knew that we needed global policies. <unk> organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in. a new international convention. to protect the children who are in the worst forms <unk> . and the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down. <unk> by one third in the last fifteen years. <unk> anger is an energy and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never be vanished . can never be destroyed <unk> so why can 't. the energy of anger. <unk> be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world a more just and equitable. <unk> world anger is within each one of you and. i will share a secret for a few seconds that if. we are confined in the narrow shells of egos <unk> and the circles of. <unk> then the anger will turn out to be hatred . violence <unk> revenge destruction <unk> . but if we are able to break the circles then the same anger could. turn into a great power <unk> we can break the circles by using our inherent compassion. and connect with the world through compassion to make this world better that same anger could be transformed into it. so dear friends sisters and brothers <unk> again as a nobel laureate <unk> i am urging you to become angry <unk> . i am urging you to become angry <unk> . and the angriest among us is the one. <unk> inspiration to others who or what inspires you and why. chris let me tell you and that is the truth each time. when i free a child the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother the first. smile of freedom <unk> and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter can ever come back and sit in her lap. become so emotional and the first tear of joy rolls down on her cheek <unk> . i see the glimpse of god in it this is my biggest inspiration and i am so lucky that not once as i said before but thousands of times . i have been able to witness my god in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations <unk> thank you.
