 <unk> i want to ask you to. <unk> body and what you 're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller maybe you 're hunching. <unk> crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold onto our arms like this. <unk> sometimes we. spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right. <unk> we 're going to come back to that in a few minutes <unk> and i 'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds. so we 're really fascinated with body language <unk> and we 're particularly interested in other people 's body language you know we. 're interested in like you know . laughter an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward. <unk> wink <unk> or maybe even something like a handshake narrator here. they are arriving at number ten this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states here comes the prime minister. <unk> weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc and the new york times so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists. it 's language so we think about communication when we think about communication we think about interactions <unk> so what is your body language communicating to me what 's mine communicating to. <unk> this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time. looking at the effects of of our body language or other people 's body language on judgments and we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language <unk> . and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote . who we ask out on a date for. <unk> nalini ambady a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch <unk>. <unk> soundless clips of real <unk>. interactions their judgments of the physician 's niceness. predict whether or not that physician will be sued <unk> so it doesn 't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted. <unk> even more dramatic. <unk> alex todorov at princeton has shown us that. judgments of political candidates ' faces in just one second predict seventy percent of u s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes. <unk> and even let 's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea. <unk> when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that 's influenced by our nonverbals and that 's ourselves <unk>. <unk> we are also influenced by our nonverbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology <unk> so. <unk> power dynamics i became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance. <unk> and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom <unk> they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out <unk> you take up space you 're basically. <unk> it 's about opening up <unk> and. this is true across the animal kingdom it 's not just limited to primates . and humans do the same thing . so they do this both when they when they have power sort of chronically <unk> . and also when they 're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us. how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she. <unk> shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind. do this when they win at a physical competition <unk> so when they cross the finish line and they 've won it doesn 't matter if they 've never seen anyone do it they do this <unk> . so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted . what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite. <unk> we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we don 't want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing <unk> . and this is what happens when you put together high and low power <unk> so what we tend to do. when it comes to power is that we complement the other 's nonverbals so if someone is being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller <unk> we don 't mirror them we do the opposite of them. <unk> so. i 'm watching this behavior in the classroom. what do i notice i notice that. mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas really coming into the room they get right into the middle of the room. before class even starts like they really want to occupy space <unk> when they sit down they 're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this. <unk> you have other people who are virtually collapsing. <unk> when they come in as soon they come in you see it <unk> you see it on their faces and their bodies <unk> and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand . i notice a couple of things about this one you 're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so. women are much more likely to do this kind of. <unk> than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising. <unk> but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half the grade . so. business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in. and then you get these differences in grades and it. <unk> to be partly attributable to participation . so i started to wonder <unk> you know okay <unk> . so you have these people coming in like this and they 're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so. my main collaborator dana carney who 's at berkeley <unk> and i really wanted to know. <unk> can you fake it till you make it <unk> like can you do this just for a little while. and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful <unk> so we know that our nonverbals. govern how other people think and feel about us there 's a lot of evidence but our question really was do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves <unk> . there 's some evidence that they do so for example. <unk> we smile when we feel happy but also when we 're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this <unk> . it makes us feel happy <unk> so it goes both ways <unk> when it comes to power . it also goes both ways <unk> so when you when you feel powerful you 're more likely to do this <unk> but it 's also possible that. when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful. <unk> question really was <unk> you know <unk> so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds . and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i 'm talking about thoughts. and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that 's. <unk> i look at hormones <unk> so what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like <unk> so powerful people. tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more optimistic <unk> they actually feel they 're going to win even at games of chance. <unk> they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of. differences between powerful and powerless people . physiologically there also are differences on two key hormones <unk> testosterone which is the dominance hormone <unk> . and cortisol which is the stress hormone <unk> . so. what we find is that. alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol <unk> and. powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol. <unk> so what does that mean when you think about power people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance <unk> . but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader. that 's dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive probably not right you want the person who 's powerful and assertive and dominant <unk> but not very stress reactive the person who 's laid back. <unk> we know that. in primate hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over. <unk> if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly . within a few days that individual 's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly <unk> so we have this evidence <unk> both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level. <unk> that role changes can shape the mind <unk> so what happens okay you take a role change . what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it 's going to make you feel more powerful . so. this is what we did <unk> we decided to bring. <unk> just going to show you five of the poses although they took on only two so here 's one a. couple more <unk> this one has been dubbed the wonder woman by the media <unk> here are a couple more <unk> . <unk> so you can be standing or you can be sitting and here are the low power poses so you 're folding up you 're making yourself small <unk> . this one is very low power when you 're touching your neck you 're really protecting yourself <unk> so. this is what happens they come in they spit into a vial for two minutes we say you need to do this or this they don 't look at pictures of the poses we don 't want to prime them with a concept of power we want them to be feeling power so two minutes they do this <unk> . we then ask them. how powerful do you feel on a series of items <unk> and then we give them an opportunity to gamble . and then we take another saliva sample that 's it that 's the whole experiment <unk> so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling. we find that when you are in the high power pose condition eighty six percent of you will gamble when you 're in the low power pose condition only sixty percent and that 's a whopping significant difference. here 's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high power people experience about a 20 percent increase . and low power people experience about a 10 percent decrease <unk> so again two minutes <unk> and you get these changes . here 's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a. <unk> so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really <unk>. and feeling sort of shut down and we 've all had the feeling right <unk> . so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it 's not just others but it 's also ourselves. also our bodies change our minds <unk> . but the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways <unk> this is in the lab it 's this little task it 's. just a couple of minutes. <unk> where can you actually apply this <unk> which we cared about of course. <unk> and so we think. situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends for teenagers it 's at the lunchroom table for some people it 's speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or. doing a job interview we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview <unk> so. we published these. <unk> and the media are all over it and they say <unk> okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know . so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no that 's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no don 't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it 's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you. <unk> you 're sitting down you 're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out. you 're looking at your notes you 're hunching up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right do that find two minutes <unk> so that 's what we want to test okay so <unk>. <unk> we bring people into a lab and they do either high or low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview. <unk> it 's five minutes long they are being recorded they 're being judged also and the judges. are trained to give no nonverbal feedback <unk> so they look like this imagine this is the person interviewing you . so for five minutes <unk> nothing <unk> and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it 's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand . <unk> so this really spikes your cortisol <unk> so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened. we then have these coders look at these tapes four of them they 're blind to the hypothesis <unk> they 're blind to the conditions they have no idea who 's been posing in what pose <unk> . and they they end up. looking at these sets of tapes and they say we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don 't want to hire these people . <unk> we also evaluate these people much more positively overall . but what 's driving it <unk> it 's not about the content of the speech <unk> it 's about the presence that they 're bringing to the speech because we rate them on all these variables related to competence <unk>. like <unk> how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what 's affected these kinds of things . <unk> residue over them <unk> so this is what 's driving the effect or mediating mediating the effect <unk> so. when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me. <unk> it feels fake right so i said fake it till you make it <unk> it 's not me <unk> i don 't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud. <unk> feel like an impostor <unk> i don 't want to get there only to feel like i 'm not supposed to be here <unk> and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about. being an impostor and feeling like i 'm not supposed to be here when i was nineteen <unk> i was in a really bad car accident i was thrown out of a car <unk> . rolled several times i was thrown from the car <unk> and i woke up in a head injury rehab ward <unk> and i had been. <unk> withdrawn from college <unk> and i learned that my iq had dropped by two standard deviations <unk> which was. very traumatic <unk> i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child . so i 'm taken out of college i keep trying to go back <unk> they say you 're not going to finish college <unk> just. <unk> there are other things for you to do but that 's not going to work out for you . so i really struggled with this and i have to say <unk> having your identity taken from you your core identity and for me it was being smart . having that taken from you there 's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that . so i felt entirely powerless i worked and worked and i got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked <unk> eventually i graduated from college it. took me four years longer than my peers <unk> and i convinced someone my. <unk> angel advisor susan fiske to take me on and so i ended up at princeton and i was like i am not supposed to be here <unk> i am an impostor . and the night before my first year talk and the first year talk at princeton is a 20 minute talk to twenty people that 's it . i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i 'm. <unk> because i took a gamble on you and you 're staying you 're going to stay <unk> and this is what you 're going to do . you are going to fake it <unk> you 're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do you 're just going to do it and do it and do it <unk> even if you 're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out of body experience until you have this moment where you say '. oh my gosh i 'm doing it like i have become this i. <unk> so that 's what i did five years in grad school a few years you know i 'm at northwestern i moved to harvard <unk> . i 'm at harvard i 'm not really thinking about it anymore <unk> but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here . so at the end of my first year at harvard. <unk> a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who i had said look you 've gotta participate or else you 're going to fail came into my office i really didn 't know her at all. <unk> she said i 'm not supposed to be here . and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized. <unk> oh my gosh i don 't feel like that anymore. <unk> i don 't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it. <unk> supposed to be here <unk> and tomorrow you 're going to fake it you 're going to make yourself powerful and you know and you 're going to go. into the classroom <unk> and you are going to give the best comment ever you know <unk> and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around and were like oh my god i didn 't even notice her sitting there. <unk> she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed. <unk> and so i i want to say to you don 't fake it till you make it <unk> fake it till you become <unk>. <unk> it do it enough until you actually become it and internalize . <unk> last thing i 'm going to leave you with is this tiny tweaks. can lead to big changes <unk> . so . this is two minutes <unk> two minutes <unk> two minutes two minutes <unk> before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation . for two minutes <unk> try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that 's what you want to do <unk> configure your brain to cope the best in that situation <unk>. get your testosterone up get your cortisol down don 't leave that situation feeling like. <unk> didn 't show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am <unk> so i want to ask you first <unk> you know <unk> . both to try power posing <unk> . and also i want to ask you to share the science because this is simple <unk> i don 't have ego involved in this give it away. <unk> share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power give it to them because they can do it in private they need their bodies <unk> privacy and two minutes <unk> . and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank you.
