 <unk> thank you so much i 'm going to try to take you on. a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins since we are such a visual species <unk> it 's hard for us to really understand this so i 'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it but let 's also think as a visual. <unk> species what it 's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look. underwater we really can 't see very far our vision which works so well in air all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic <unk> . and what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another dolphins and toothed whales use. <unk> echolocation they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient they can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat . all marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch <unk> so the large baleen whales will produce long beautiful songs <unk> which are used in reproductive advertisement. for male and females both to find one another and to select a mate. and mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another so sound is really critical for their lives <unk> . the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals whose world was so foreign to me . was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds and i mentioned i 'll use some visual representations of sounds here 's the first example this is a plot of frequency. <unk> against time sort of like musical notation where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower and time goes this way <unk> . this is a picture of a trainer 's whistle a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it 's done the right thing and can come get a fish <unk> it sounds sort of like tweeeeeet like that. this is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer 's whistle. if you hummed this tune to your dog or. <unk> cat and it hummed it back to you you ought to be pretty surprised very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds <unk> it 's really important for our music and our language <unk>. <unk> so it 's a puzzle the few other mammal groups that do this why do they do it a lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand. <unk> use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems <unk> so let 's start with calls of a nonhuman primate <unk> many mammals <unk>. <unk> have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf are apart this is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys. signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch each individual here has a radically different call they can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals . how about the setting in which animals need to use this call well let 's look at mothers and calves in normal life for mother and calf dolphin they 'll often drift apart or swim apart if mom is chasing a fish. <unk> and when they separate. they have to get back together again <unk> what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle against the maximum distance so when dolphins are separating <unk>. <unk> by less than twenty meters less than half the time they need to use whistles most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around <unk> but all of the time when they separate by more than one <unk>. <unk> hundred meters they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again <unk> . <unk> whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of of a dolphin but there are some exceptions when a male dolphin leaves mom . it will often join up with another male and form an alliance which may last for decades <unk> as these two animals form a social bond . their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar this plot shows two members of a pair as you can see at the top here. <unk> share an up sweep like woop woop woop they both have that kind of up sweep whereas these members of a pair go <unk>. and what 's happened is they 've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group it 's a very interesting way that they can. form a new identifier for the new social group that they 've had let 's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about. <unk> protecting dolphins. from human disturbance anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded and clearly his behavior is being disrupted this is a bad situation <unk> . but it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away <unk> the dolphins will start whistling they 'll change what they 're doing they 'll have a more cohesive group wait for the boat to go by and then they 'll get back. <unk> to normal business <unk> well in a place like sarasota florida <unk> the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes <unk> . so even in the situation that doesn 't look as bad as this it 's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work . and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia. <unk> lars bider has done work. comparing dolphin behavior and distribution. before there were. dolphin watching boats when there was one boat not much of an impact and two boats when the second boat was added what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area <unk>. <unk> completely of the ones that stayed their reproductive rate declined so it could have a negative impact on the whole population . <unk> about activities that we thought were benign we may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems i. 'd also like to point out that sound doesn 't. obey boundaries <unk> so you can draw a line to try to protect an area <unk> but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area <unk> and i 'd like to switch now from this local . <unk> environment to to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean <unk> this is a kind of map we 've all been looking at the world is mostly blue but i. 'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think <unk> notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land . to me the most mind bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where. oceanographers took a ship to the southern indian ocean deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound that same sound. traveled to the west and could be heard in bermuda <unk> . and traveled to the east <unk> and could be heard in monterey the same sound so we live in a world of satellite communication are used to global communication <unk> but it 's still amazing to me. <unk> has properties that allow low frequency sound. to basically move globally <unk> the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours it 's nearly halfway around the globe. in the early ' 70s roger payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that. sound could transmit over these large areas but very few biologists. believed it. <unk> it actually turns out though <unk> even though we 've only known of long range propagation for a few decades <unk> the whales clearly have evolved over tens of millions of years . <unk> a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean <unk> so blue whales and fin whales produce very low frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges the top plot here shows. <unk> songs and they appear to play a role in reproduction sort of like that of song birds down below here we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges <unk> . the biologists continued to be skeptical of the long range communication issue well past the ' 70s until the end of the cold war <unk> . what happened was during the cold war the u s navy had a system that was secret at the time. that they used to track russian submarines <unk> it had deep underwater microphones or hydrophones cabled to shore all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic <unk> . and after the berlin wall fell the navy made these systems available to whale <unk>. to see what they could hear <unk> this is a plot from christopher clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by bermuda. <unk> went down to the latitude of miami and came back again it was tracked for for forty three days swimming one thousand seven hundred kilometers or more than one thousand miles <unk> this shows us both <unk>. <unk> that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles they 're ocean based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated. <unk> fins and blues which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans . the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds so they can make a sound that 's a little higher in frequency broader band and more complicated so you 're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here. humpbacks when they. develop the ability to sing this song <unk> they 're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what. <unk> i described <unk> . this means that humpback song is a form of animal culture just like music for humans would be i. think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from australia <unk> . biologists on the east coast of australia were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area <unk> and this orange line here marks the typical songs. <unk> they all sang the normal song <unk> but in ' ninety six they heard a few weird songs and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales . the west coast calls became more and more popular <unk> until by one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight none of the whales sang the east coast song it was completely gone they just sang the cool new west coast song <unk>. <unk> it 's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old fashioned style before and with no golden oldies stations. <unk> nobody sang the old ones i 'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls . now you are listening to a recording made by chris clark zero point two miles away from a humpback . you can hear the full frequency range it 's quite loud <unk> you sound very nearby the next recording you 're going to. hear was made of the same humpback song fifty miles away that 's shown down here <unk> you only hear the. <unk> low frequencies you hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long range in the ocean and is not quite as loud now. after i play back these humpback calls i 'll play blue whale calls but they have to be sped up because they 're so low in frequency. that you wouldn 't be able to hear it otherwise here 's a blue whale call at fifty. <unk> is the sound of a ship and i 'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it imagine that whale. <unk> listening from five hundred miles there 's. a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other . now this is something that 's been known for quite a while <unk> this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound and on the y axis is the loudness of of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency . <unk> in the low frequencies <unk> this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth . up high these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave <unk> but right in the middle here where there 's a sweet spot . the noise is dominated by human ships <unk> now think about it this is an amazing thing that in this frequency range where whales communicate <unk> the main source globally on our planet for the noise comes from human ships <unk> thousands of human ships distant. <unk> far away <unk> just all aggregating <unk> . the next slide will show what the impact this may have on the range at which whales can communicate <unk> so here we have the loudness of a call at the whale and as we get farther away <unk> the sound gets fainter and fainter <unk> . now. in the pre industrial ocean as we were mentioning this whale call could be easily. <unk> it 's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers . let 's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping . all of a sudden the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to ten kilometers now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they 're dispersed <unk>. <unk> imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations . <unk> have contact calls like i described for the dolphins i 'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales. to stay in touch <unk> and this is the kind of call that is used by say right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again <unk> . now imagine let 's put the ship noise in the in the picture what 's a mother to do if the ship comes by and her calf isn 't there i 'll describe a couple strategies . one strategy is if your call 's down here. <unk> and the noise is in this band you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better <unk> . susan parks of penn state has actually studied this she 's looked in the atlantic here 's data from the south atlantic here 's a typical south atlantic contact call from the ' 70s look what happened by two thousand to the average call . same thing in the north atlantic in the ' 50s versus two thousand . over the last fifty years as we 've put more noise into the oceans these whales have had to shift it 's as if the whole population. had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor it. 's an amazing shift <unk> induced by humans over this large scale in both time and space <unk> . and we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder like i did when that ship was playing by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band <unk>. <unk> now there 's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be . probably lost opportunities if we also have to wait for silence they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate <unk> so we have to be very concerned. about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate or are not able to perform critical functions it 's a really important problem <unk> . <unk> and i 'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area looking at the impact of shipping on whales . in terms of the shipping noise the international maritime organization of the united nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships to tell the industry how you could quiet ships <unk> . and they 've already found that by by being more intelligent about better propeller. <unk> you can reduce that noise by ninety percent <unk> if you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull you can reduce that noise by ninety nine percent <unk> . so at this point it 's primarily an issue of cost and standards <unk> if this group can establish standards and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem <unk> . but there 's also another problem from ships that i 'm illustrating here <unk> and that 's the problem of collision <unk> this is a whale that just squeaked. <unk> by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision <unk> but collision is a serious problem endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision <unk> and it 's very important to try to reduce this i. 'll discuss two very promising approaches <unk> . the first case comes from the bay of fundy these black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the bay. <unk> the colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane it turns out that this lane here. goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision <unk> well biologists. who couldn 't take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say can. <unk> those are just lines on the ground can 't you move them over to a place where there 's less of a risk and the international maritime organization responded very strongly these are the new lanes the shipping <unk>. <unk> lanes have been moved <unk> and as you can see the risk of collision is much lower <unk> so it 's very promising actually we can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks . <unk> gas emissions with global warming the maersk line. looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money <unk> they rush as fast as they can to get to their port <unk> but then they often wait there. what maersk did is they worked ways to slow down they could slow down by about fifty percent <unk> this reduced their fuel consumption by about thirty percent. which saved them money <unk> . and at the same time <unk> it had a significant benefit for whales it you slow down you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision <unk> . so to conclude i 'd just like to point out you know the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment they 've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this <unk> . and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities. <unk> same time we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems <unk> i hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected <unk>. <unk> areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate thank you very much.
