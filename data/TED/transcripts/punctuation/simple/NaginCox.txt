 <unk> so many of you have probably seen the movie the martian . but for those of you who did not it 's a movie about an astronaut who is stranded on mars <unk> and his efforts to stay alive until the earth can send a rescue mission to bring him back to earth. gladly they do re establish communication. with the character astronaut watney at some point so that he 's not as alone on mars until he can be rescued <unk> . so while you 're watching the movie or even if you haven 't when you think about mars you 're probably thinking about how far away it is. <unk> what might not have occurred to you is what are the logistics really like of working on another planet of living on two planets when there are people on the earth and there are. rovers or people on mars <unk> so think about when you have friends families and <unk>. <unk> co workers in california on the west coast or in other parts of the world when you 're trying to. communicate with them one of the things you probably first think about is wait . what time is it in california <unk> will i wake them up is it ok to call . so even if you 're interacting with colleagues who are in europe you 're immediately thinking about what does it take. to coordinate communication when people are far away <unk> . so we don 't have people on mars right now <unk> but we do have rovers and actually right now on curiosity. it is six ten in the morning so six ten in the morning on mars <unk> . we have four rovers on mars the united states has put four rovers on mars since the mid 1990s and i have been privileged enough to work on three of them so i am a spacecraft engineer a spacecraft operations engineer. <unk> at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in los angeles california <unk> . and these rovers are our robotic emissaries <unk> so they are our eyes and our ears <unk> and they see the planet for <unk>. <unk> us until we can send people so we learn how to operate on other planets through these rovers so before we send people we send robots . <unk> difference on mars right now from the time that we 're at is because the martian day is longer than the earth day <unk>. our earth day is twenty four hours because that 's how long it takes the earth to rotate how long it takes to go around once <unk> so our day is twenty four hours . it takes mars. <unk> hours and approximately forty minutes to rotate once <unk> so that means that the martian day is forty minutes longer. than the earth day <unk> so teams of people who are operating the rovers on mars like this one what we are doing is we are. living on earth but working on mars so we have to think as if we are actually on mars with the rover . our job the. <unk> job of this team of which i 'm a part of is to send commands to the rover to tell it what to do the next day . to tell it to drive or drill or tell her whatever she 's supposed to do <unk> . so while she 's sleeping. and the rover does sleep at night because she needs to recharge her batteries and she needs to weather the cold martian night and so she sleeps. <unk> while she sleeps <unk> we work on her program for the next day <unk> so i work the martian night shift . so in order to come to work on the earth at the same time every day on mars like let 's say i need to be at work at five zero p m this team needs to be at work. <unk> mars time every day then we have to come to work on the earth. forty minutes later every day . in order to stay in sync with mars that 's like moving a time zone every day so one day you come in at eight zero . the next day forty minutes later at eight forty . the next day forty minutes later at. <unk> the next day at ten zero so you keep moving forty minutes every day until soon you 're coming to work in the middle of the night. the middle of the earth night <unk> right so you can imagine how confusing that is hence <unk> the mars watch <unk>. <unk> have been mechanically adjusted so that it runs more slowly . right and we didn 't start out i got this watch in two thousand and four when spirit and opportunity. the rovers back then we didn 't start out thinking that we were going to need mars watches right we thought ok we 'll just have the time on our on our computers and on the mission control screens and that would be enough . yeah not so much because we weren 't just working on mars time we were actually living on mars time and we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was. <unk> was <unk> so you really needed something. on your wrist to tell you what time is it on the earth what time is it on mars <unk> . and it wasn 't just the time on mars that was confusing we also needed to be able to talk to each other about it . so a. <unk> a martian day again twenty four hours and forty minutes so when we 're talking about something that 's happening on the earth <unk> we will say <unk> today . so for mars we say tosol . laughter yesterday became <unk>. for mars <unk> again we didn 't start out thinking oh let 's invent a language. <unk> it was just very confusing i remember somebody walked up to me and said i would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow on the rover and i said . tomorrow <unk> tomorrow or mars <unk> tomorrow we started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to. <unk> some of you might say pop . so we have people who say nextersol or solorrow . and then something that i noticed after a few years of working on these missions was that the people who work on the rovers <unk> we say tosol . the people who work on the landed missions that don 't rove around they say tosoul. <unk> i could actually tell what mission you worked on from your martian accent . so we have the watches and the language and you you 're detecting a theme here right so that we don 't get confused . but even the earth daylight could confuse us if you think that right now you 've come to work and it 's the middle of the martian night and there 's light streaming in from the windows that 's going to be confusing as well. <unk> so you can see from this image of the control room that all of the blinds are down so that there 's no light to distract us the blinds went down all over the building <unk>. about a week before landing and they didn 't go up until we went off mars time . <unk> all over the windows and and. dark curtains and shades because it also affects your families and so here i was living in kind of this darkened environment <unk> but so was he and he. 'd gotten used to it but then i would get these plaintive emails from him when he was at work should i come. <unk> are you awake <unk> what time is it on mars <unk> and i decided ok so he needs a mars watch . but of course it 's two thousand and sixteen so there 's an app for that so now. instead of the watches we can also use our phones <unk> but the impact on families was. was just across the board it wasn 't just those of us who were working on the rovers but our families as well. <unk> well this is david oh one of our flight directors and he 's at the beach in los angeles with his family at one zero in the morning . so because we landed in august and his kids didn 't have to go back to school until september they actually went on to mars time with him for one month . they got up forty minutes later. <unk> every day <unk> . and they were on dad 's work schedule so they lived on mars time for a month and had these great adventures like going bowling in the middle of the night or going to the beach <unk> . and one of the things that we all discovered. is you can get anywhere in los angeles at three zero in the morning when there 's no traffic . so we would get off work and. we didn 't want to go home and bother our families and we were hungry so instead of going. locally to eat something we 'd go wait . there 's this great all night deli in long beach <unk> and we can get there in ten minutes so we would drive down it was like the 60s no traffic we would drive down there and the restaurant owners would go who are you people . and why are you at my restaurant at three. <unk> morning so they came to realize that there were these packs of martians <unk> . roaming the la freeways in the middle of the night. in the middle of the earth night and we did actually start calling ourselves martians <unk>. so those of us who were on mars time would refer to ourselves as martians. and everyone else as earthlings. <unk> have people on mars.
