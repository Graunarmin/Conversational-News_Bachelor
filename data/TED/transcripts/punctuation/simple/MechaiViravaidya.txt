 <unk> welcome to thailand <unk> now when i was a young man forty years ago . the country was very very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty <unk> we decided to do something about it <unk> . but we didn 't begin with a welfare program. or a poverty. <unk> reduction program <unk> but we began with a family planning program <unk> following a very successful maternal child health. activity <unk> sets of activities so basically no one would accept family planning if their children didn 't survive so the first step <unk> get to the children get to the mothers <unk> . <unk> and then follow up with family planning not just child mortality alone <unk> you need also family planning now let me take you back. <unk> as to why we needed to do it in my country that was the case in <unk>. seven children per family tremendous growth at three point three percent there was just no future we needed to reduce the population growth rate <unk> so. we said let 's do it the women said we agree we 'll use pills <unk> but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills . and we had very very few doctors <unk> we didn 't take no as an answer we took no. <unk> no as a question <unk>. we went to the nurses and the midwives who were also women and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill . that was wonderful but it covered only twenty percent of the country what do we do for the other eighty percent leave them alone and say well <unk> they 're not medical personnel no we decided to do a bit more . <unk> ordinary people that you saw <unk> actually below that yellow sign i wish they hadn 't wiped that because there was <unk>. we were so much bigger than coca cola in those days <unk> . and no difference <unk> the people they chose were the people we chose. they were well known in the community <unk> they knew that customers were always right <unk> and they were terrific <unk> and they practiced their family planning themselves <unk> so they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country in every village of the country <unk> so there we are we went. <unk> to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution wherever there were people and you can see boats with the women selling things here 's the floating market <unk>. <unk> selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives wherever you find people you 'll find contraceptives in thailand <unk> . <unk> get to religion because in the philippines the catholic church was pretty strong . and thai people were buddhist <unk> we went to them and they said look could you help us i 'm there the one in blue not the yellow holding a bowl of holy water. for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms. for the sanctity of the family <unk> . and this picture was sent throughout the country <unk> so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves <unk> and the women were saying no wonder we have no side effects it 's been blessed. <unk> that was their perception <unk> and then we went to teachers <unk> you need everybody to be involved. in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place <unk> so we went to the teachers <unk> over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet a b for birth c for condom i for iud v for vasectomy <unk> . and then we had a snakes and ladders game where you throw dice if you land on anything. <unk> planning <unk> you move ahead <unk> like mother takes the pill every night <unk> very good mother move ahead . uncle buys a condom very good uncle move ahead <unk> uncle gets drunk doesn 't use condom come back start again . again education class entertainment <unk> . and the kids were doing it in school too we had relay races with condoms we had children 's condom blowing championship and before long the condom was know as the girl 's best friend. <unk> in thailand for poor people diamonds don 't make it so the condom is the girl 's best friend <unk> we introduced our first microcredit program <unk>. and the women who organized it said we only want to lend to women who practice family planning if you 're pregnant take care of your pregnancy if you 're not pregnant you can take a loan out from us . <unk> it 's still going on it 's a part of the village development bank it 's not a real bank <unk> but it 's a fund microcredit <unk> and we didn 't need a big organization to run it it was run by the villagers themselves <unk> and <unk>. you probably hardly see a thai man there it 's always women women women women <unk> . <unk> and this is on the fourth of july <unk> we decided to provide vasectomy to all men but in particular american men to the front of the queue right up to the ambassador 's residence. during his [ unclear ] and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it very appropriate room . <unk> 'll give you some lunch of course it must be american cola you get two brands coke and pepsi <unk> and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic . laughter and here is this then young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid . obviously he 's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten <unk> . and he was very happy it made a lot of news in america and it angered some people also i said don 't worry come over and i 'll do the whole lot of you. and what happened in all this thing from seven children. to one point five children population growth rate of three point three to zero point five <unk> . you could call it the coca cola approach if you like it was exactly the same thing i 'm not sure whether coca cola followed us or we followed coca cola but we 're good friends. <unk> and so that 's the case of everyone joining in we didn 't have a strong government we didn 't have lots of doctors. but it 's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior . then aids came along and hit thailand <unk> and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids but unfortunately the government was in denial denial denial <unk> so our <unk>. <unk> work wasn 't affected <unk> so i thought well if you can 't go to the government go to the military so i went to the military and asked to borrow three hundred radio stations <unk> they have more than the government and they 've got more guns than. so i asked them could they help us in our fight against hiv <unk> and after i gave them statistics they said yes okay you can use all the radio stations television stations and that 's when we went onto the airwaves <unk> . and then we got a new prime minister soon after that and he said mechai could you come and join he asked me in because he liked my. <unk> he became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget <unk> fifty fold every ministry even judges had to be involved in aids education everyone and we said the public institutions religious institutions schools. everyone was involved <unk> . and here every media person had to be trained for hiv <unk> and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising. <unk> to earn more money so they were happy with that <unk> . and then aids education in all schools starting from university <unk> and these are high school kids teaching high school kids and the best teachers were the girls not the boys <unk> . and they were terrific <unk> and these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and hiv were known as mother theresa. <unk> and then we went down one more step these are primary school kids. third fourth grade going to every household in the village every household in the whole of thailand <unk> giving aids information. and a condom to every household given by these young kids and no parents objected because we were <unk> trying to save lives <unk> and this. was a lifesaver <unk> and we said everyone needs to be involved so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don 't work and dead customers don 't buy so they all trained <unk> and then we have this captain condom. <unk> going to schools and night spots <unk> and they loved him <unk> you need a symbol of something. <unk> in every country every program <unk> you need a symbol and this is probably the best thing he 's ever done with his mba . and then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets everywhere everywhere in taxis you get condoms and also in traffic the policemen give you. <unk> can you imagine new york policemen giving out condoms of course i can and they 'd enjoy it immensely i see them standing around right now everywhere imagine if they had condoms <unk> giving. out to all sorts of people and then new change we had hair bands <unk> clothing and the condom for. your mobile phone during the rainy season and these were the condoms that we introduced. one says . weapon of mass protection we found you know somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction <unk> but we have found the weapon of mass protection <unk> the condom <unk> and then it says here with the american flag . don 't leave home without it . but i have some to give out afterward <unk> but let me warn you. <unk> condoms can do so many things look at this i gave this to al gore and to bill senior also stop global warming use condoms. <unk> and then this is the picture i mentioned to you. the weapon of mass protection <unk> and let the next olympics save some lives <unk> why just run around. and then finally . in thailand we 're buddhist we don 't have a god so instead we say in rubber we trust . so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools because. <unk> alcohol impairs judgment <unk> and then what happened after all this time everybody joined in according to the <unk>. new cases of hiv declined by ninety percent and according to the world bank <unk> seven point seven million lives were saved <unk> otherwise there wouldn 't be many thais walking around today <unk> so it just <unk>. <unk> showed you <unk> you could do something about it ninety percent of the funding came from thailand <unk> there was political commitment some financial commitment and everybody joined in the fight so just don 't leave it to the. <unk> specialists and doctors and nurses <unk> we all need to help <unk> and then we decided to help people out of poverty now that we got aids somewhat out of the way this time not with government alone <unk> but in cooperation <unk>. with the business community because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit those are the things to be provided by the business community. <unk> trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs <unk> little business people the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise so that was done the money goes from the company <unk>. into the village via <unk> tree planting it 's not a free gift <unk> they plant the trees <unk> and the money goes into their microcredit fund which we call the village development bank <unk> everybody joins in and they feel they own the bank <unk> because they have brought the money in . those who are living in poverty <unk> access to credit must be a human right <unk> . access to credit must be a human right <unk> otherwise they 'll never get out of poverty <unk> . and then before getting a loan you must be trained here 's what we call a barefoot mba . teaching people how to do business so that when they borrow money they 'll succeed with the business these are. <unk> and this is very interesting nike ice cream and nike biscuits . this is a village sponsored by nike they said they should stop making shoes and clothes make these better because we can afford them . and then we have silk <unk> thai silk now we 're making scottish tartans as you can see on the left to sell to all people of scottish. <unk> so anyone sitting in and watching tv get in touch with me <unk> . and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand . coffee and condoms see starbucks you awake we keep you awake and alive that 's the difference . can you imagine at every starbucks that you can also get condoms <unk> you can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino <unk> . and then now finally in education we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it 's a. <unk> learning center for everyone we call this our school based integrated rural development <unk> and it 's a center a focal point. for economic and social development re do the school make it serve the community needs <unk> . and here is a bamboo building all of them are bamboo this is a geodesic dome made of. <unk> and i 'm sure buckminster fuller would would be very very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome <unk> and we use vegetables around the school ground <unk> so they raise their own vegetables <unk>. <unk> and then finally i firmly believe if we want the mdgs to work the millennium development goals we need to add family planning to it of course child mortality first. <unk> the next olympics to be involved. in saving lives <unk> and then finally that is our network <unk> and these are our thai tulips . thank you very much indeed.
