 <unk> half a century of trying to help prevent wars there 's one question. that never leaves me how do we deal with extreme violence without using. <unk> when you 're faced with brutality whether it 's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence. or on the streets of syria today facing tanks and shrapnel . what 's the most effective thing to do fight back give in . use more force this. <unk> how do i deal with a bully. without becoming a thug in return has been with me ever since i was a child <unk> i remember. i was about thirteen <unk> glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room. as soviet tanks. rolled into budapest <unk> and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down. <unk> and i rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase <unk> and my mother came up and said what on earth are you doing and i said i 'm going to budapest . and she said what on earth for and i said kids are getting killed there there 's something terrible happening and she said don 't be so silly . and i started to cry <unk> . and she got it she said okay i see it 's serious. much too young to help you need training i 'll help you but just unpack your suitcase . and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s . but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn 't get from training courses <unk> . i wanted to understand how violence how oppression. works and what i 've discovered since. is this . bullies use violence in three ways they use political violence. to intimidate physical violence to terrorize. and mental or emotional violence. <unk> to undermine . and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence <unk> . nelson mandela. went to jail believing in violence and twenty seven years later. he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills. <unk> the incredible skills that they needed. to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy <unk> . and they did it in a total devotion to non violence . they realized. that. using force against. <unk> does work . over time i 've collected about a half dozen methods that do work of course there are many more that do work and that are effective . and the first is that the change that has to take place has to take. place here inside me it 's my. <unk> my attitude to oppression that i 've got control over and that i can do something about and what i need to develop is <unk>. to do that that means i need to know how i tick <unk> when i collapse <unk> where my. formidable points are where my weaker points are when do i give. <unk> not the only one it 's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power. <unk> and my heroine here like satish 's is aung san suu kyi in burma . she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon. <unk> came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns <unk> and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers. were more scared than the student protesters behind her but she told the students to sit down <unk> and she walked. forward with such calm and such clarity. and such total lack of fear. that she could walk right up to the first gun put her hand on it. and lower it . and no one got killed. so that 's what the mastery of fear can do not only faced with. <unk> machine guns but if you if you meet a knife fight in the street but we have to practice <unk> so what about our fear <unk> . i have a little mantra . my fear. grows fat on the energy i feed it and if it grows very big it probably happens so. <unk> we all know the three o 'clock in the morning syndrome <unk> when something you 've been worrying about wakes you up i see a lot of people. and. for an hour you toss and turn it gets worse and worse and by four o 'clock. you 're pinned to the pillow. by a monster this big the only thing to do is to get up make a cup of tea and sit down. <unk> the fear like a child beside you <unk> . you 're the adult the fear is the child and you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants what it needs . how can this be. made. better how can the child feel stronger <unk> and you make a plan. <unk> now we 're going back to sleep half past seven we 're getting up and that 's what we 're going to do . i had one of these three <unk> a m episodes on sunday. paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you . so i did the thing i got up made the cup of tea <unk> sat down with it did it all and i 'm here. <unk> that 's fear what about anger wherever there is. injustice there 's anger <unk> . but anger is like gasoline <unk> and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match you 've got an inferno <unk> . but. anger as an engine in an engine is powerful if we can put our anger inside. <unk> inside an engine it can drive us forward it can get us through the dreadful moments. and it can give us real inner power <unk> and i learned this. in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were. <unk> exposing us to. that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong <unk> totally ineffective in order to develop. a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger it 's okay to be angry with. the the thing the nuclear weapons in this case but it is hopeless to be angry with the. <unk> they are human beings just like us and they 're doing what they think is best and that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them <unk> . so that 's the third one anger <unk> and it brings me to the crux. of what 's going on or what i perceive as going on in the world today which is that. last century was top down power it was still governments telling people what to do . this century there 's a shift it. 's bottom up or grassroots power it 's like mushrooms coming through concrete <unk> . it 's people joining up with people as bundy just said miles away. to. bring about change <unk> and. peace direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do. <unk> they know best what to do so peace direct gets behind them to do that and the kind of thing they 're doing is. demobilizing militias <unk> rebuilding economies <unk> resettling refugees. <unk> even liberating child. <unk> they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this <unk> and. what they 've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only. less humane but it 's less effective than using methods that connect people with people that rebuild. and i think that the u s military is finally beginning to get this . up to now their <unk>. policy. has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost <unk> and if civilians get in the way that 's written as. and this is so infuriating and. humiliating for the population of afghanistan . that it makes the recruitment for al qaeda very easy <unk> when people are so disgusted by for example the burning of the koran . so the training of the troops has to change <unk> and i think. <unk> signs that it is beginning to change the british military have always been much better at this but there is. one magnificent example for them to take their cue from and that 's a brilliant. u s lieutenant colonel called chris hughes <unk> and he was leading his men. down the streets of najaf. in iraq actually. and suddenly people were. pouring out of the houses on either side of the road screaming <unk> yelling <unk> furiously angry and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified <unk> . didn 't know what was going on couldn 't speak arabic <unk> . and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his. <unk> and these. huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor <unk> wobbled to the ground <unk> . and complete silence fell . and after about two minutes everybody. moved aside and went home now. that to me is. <unk> wisdom in action in the moment that 's what he did . and it 's happening. everywhere now you don 't believe me have you asked yourselves. why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last thirty years. <unk> dictatorships in czechoslovakia <unk> east germany. <unk> and this hasn 't just happened . a lot of it. is due to a book written by an 80 year old man in boston gene sharp . he wrote a book called from dictatorship to democracy. <unk> the world and it 's being used by young people and older people everywhere. because it works and it 's effective <unk> . so this is what gives me hope not just hope this is what makes me feel very positive right now. <unk> beings are getting it we 're. getting practical <unk> . doable methodologies to answer my question how do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug . we 're using the kind of skills that i 've outlined. <unk> recognizing and working with our fear using anger as a fuel <unk> . cooperating with others <unk> banding together with others <unk> courage . and most importantly <unk> commitment. to active. have to believe in it i see evidence everywhere of how it works and. i see that we <unk> ordinary people can do what aung san suu kyi and ghandi. and mandela did we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known. and we can organize to overcome oppression. by opening our hearts as well as. strengthening this incredible resolve <unk> and <unk>. <unk> this open heartedness is exactly what i 've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since i got here yesterday <unk> thank you.
