 <unk> probably don 't know me but i am one of those 01 percenters that you hear about and read about and i am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat. <unk> and tonight what i would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats to my people because it feels like it 's time for us all. to have a chat . like most plutocrats <unk> i too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist i have founded cofounded or funded. over thirty companies across a range of industries <unk> i was the first non family investor in amazon com . i cofounded a company called aquantive. that we sold to microsoft. <unk> for six point four billion dollars my friends and i we own a bank <unk> i tell you this . unbelievable right <unk> i tell you this. to show. that my life is like most plutocrats <unk> i have a broad. perspective on capitalism and business <unk> and i have been rewarded obscenely. for that. with a life that. <unk> most of you all can 't even imagine multiple homes a yacht my own plane <unk> etc etc etc . but let 's be honest i am not the smartest person you 've ever met i am certainly not the hardest working <unk> . i was a mediocre student i 'm not technical at all i can 't write a word. <unk> my success is the consequence of spectacular luck of birth of circumstance. and of timing. <unk> but i am actually pretty good at a couple of things one <unk> i have an unusually high tolerance for risk . and the other is i have a good sense a good intuition about what will happen in the future and i think that that intuition about the future. essence. of good entrepreneurship so what do i see in our future today you ask <unk> i see pitchforks as in. angry mobs with pitchforks <unk> because while people like us plutocrats. <unk> fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind in one thousand nine hundred and eighty <unk> the top one percent of americans shared about eight percent of national [ income ] . while the bottom fifty percent of americans shared eighteen percent . thirty years later today the top one percent shares over twenty percent of national. <unk> the bottom fifty percent of americans share twelve or thirteen . if the trend continues <unk> . the top one percent will share over thirty percent of national [ income ] in another thirty years <unk> . while the bottom fifty percent of americans will share just six . you see the problem isn 't that we have some inequality . some inequality is necessary. for a. <unk> is at historic highs today. and it 's getting worse every day <unk> and if wealth power <unk> and income continue to concentrate. at the very tippy top our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a. before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks <unk> so i have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires. and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world <unk> wake up <unk> wake up <unk> it cannot last . because if we do not do something to fix the glaring. economic inequities in our society the pitchforks will come. <unk> for us . for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality <unk> it has never happened <unk> there are no examples . you show me a highly unequal society and i will show you a police state or an uprising <unk> . the pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this. <unk> it 's not a matter of if it 's when and it will be terrible when they come. for everyone but particularly. for people like us plutocrats <unk> i know i must sound like some liberal do gooder i. 'm not i 'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong. what i am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately. rising inequality doesn 't just increase our risks from pitchforks <unk> but it 's also terrible. for business too . so the model for us rich guys should be henry ford when ford famously introduced the $ five day <unk> which was twice the prevailing wage at the time <unk> . he didn 't just increase the productivity of his factories. he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor. into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made ford intuited. what we now know is true <unk> that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem. and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem a feedback. <unk> loop between customers and businesses raising wages. increases demand which increases hiring <unk> which in turn increases wages. and demand and profits <unk> and that virtuous cycle of increasing. prosperity is precisely what is missing from today 's. economic recovery. <unk> this is why we need to put behind us the <unk> trickle down policies that so dominate both political parties. and embrace something i call middle out economics. middle out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient. <unk> that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality that they 're not efficient at all but are effective. if well managed this <unk>. <unk> allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work. by [ efficiently ] allocating existing resources it works. creating new solutions to human problems the genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary. <unk> system <unk> it rewards people for solving other people 's problems. <unk> the difference between a poor society. and a rich society obviously is. the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens the sum of the solutions. that we have in our society really is our prosperity and this explains why companies like google and amazon and microsoft and apple and the entrepreneurs. <unk> who created those companies have contributed so much. to our nation 's prosperity . this <unk> 21st century. perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems <unk>. <unk> how many problem solvers diverse able problem solvers we have and thus how many of our fellow citizens. actively participate <unk> both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions and as customers who consume them <unk> . but this maximizing participation thing. doesn 't happen by accident it doesn 't happen by itself it. <unk> requires effort and investment which is why. all highly prosperous capitalist democracies. are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure. that they depend on <unk> we plutocrats. need to get this. <unk> economics thing behind us this idea that the better we do the better everyone else will do it 's not true . how could it be . i earn one thousand times the median wage <unk> but i do not buy one thousand times as much stuff do i i. actually bought two pairs of these pants <unk> what my partner mike calls my manager pants. <unk> i could have bought two thousand pairs but what would i do with them . laughter how many haircuts can i get how often can i go out to dinner . no matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get we can never drive. a great national economy only a thriving middle class can do that . there 's nothing to be done my plutocrat friends. might say . henry ford was in a different time <unk> maybe we can 't do some things <unk> maybe we can do some things <unk> . june nineteen <unk> two thousand and thirteen <unk> bloomberg published. an article i wrote called the capitalists case for a. <unk> the good people at forbes magazine <unk> among my biggest admirers called it nick hanauer 's <unk>. and yet just three hundred and fifty days after that article was published seattle 's mayor ed murray. signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in seattle to fifteen dollars an hour more than double what the prevailing federal. <unk> seven point two five rate is . how did this happen reasonable people might ask <unk> it happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source. of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies <unk> we reminded them that when workers have more money <unk> businesses have more. <unk> and need more employees <unk> . we reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage . taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need <unk> . we reminded them that low wage workers. make terrible taxpayers and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses all businesses benefit. <unk> yet all can compete . now the orthodox reaction of course is raising the minimum wage costs jobs right <unk> . your politician 's always echoing that trickle down idea by saying things like well. if you raise the price of employment guess what happens you get less of it . are you sure. <unk> because there 's some contravening evidence since one thousand nine hundred and eighty the. wages of ceos in our country have gone from about thirty times the median wage to five hundred times . that 's raising the price of employment . and yet to my knowledge <unk> . i have never seen a company outsource its ceo 's job automate. <unk> export the job to china . in fact we appear to be employing more ceos and senior managers than ever before so too for technology workers. and financial services workers who earn multiples of the of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them so clearly. you can raise the price of employment. and get more of it i know that most people think that. <unk> minimum wage is this insane <unk> risky economic experiment <unk> we disagree <unk> we believe that the $ fifteen minimum wage in seattle. is actually the continuation of a logical economic policy it is allowing our city to kick your city 's ass <unk> . <unk> washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation <unk> we pay all workers $ nine <unk>. <unk> which is almost thirty percent more than the federal minimum of seven point two five . but crucially four hundred and twenty seven percent more than the federal tipped minimum of two point one. three if trickle down thinkers were right <unk> then washington state should have massive unemployment seattle should be sliding into the ocean <unk> and yet. seattle is the fastest growing big city in the country <unk> washington state. is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation . the restaurant business in seattle booming . why <unk> because the fundamental law of capitalism is when workers have more money businesses have more customers. and need more workers . when restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants . that 's not bad for the restaurant business <unk> that 's good for it despite what some restaurateurs. may tell you is it more complicated than i 'm making. <unk> a lot of dynamics at play <unk> but can we please stop insisting. that if low wage workers earn a little bit more unemployment will skyrocket and the economy will collapse <unk> there is no evidence for it . the most insidious thing about trickle down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer everyone is better off . it is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer <unk> that will be bad for the economy this. <unk> nonsense so can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me. and my plutocrat friends. made our country <unk> we plutocrats know even if we don 't like to admit it in public that if we had been born somewhere else not. <unk> here in the united states we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit it. 's not that they don 't have good entrepreneurs in other places <unk> even very very poor places it 's just that that 's all that those entrepreneurs ' customers can afford . so here 's an idea for a new kind. of economics a new kind of politics. <unk> new capitalism let 's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives <unk> but also. that the more people we include both as entrepreneurs and as customers the better it works . let 's by all means shrink the size of government . but not by slashing the poverty programs <unk> but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually don 't need those programs <unk> . let 's invest enough in the middle. <unk> class. to make our economy fairer. and more inclusive and by fairer more truly competitive <unk> and by more truly competitive more able to generate the solutions. to human problems that are the true drivers of growth. and prosperity capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for. prosperity in human societies if it is well managed <unk> . but capitalism because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems <unk> tends towards inexorably inequality <unk> concentration and collapse <unk> . the work of democracies. <unk> is to maximize. the inclusion of the many. in order to create prosperity not to enable the few to accumulate money <unk> government. does create prosperity and growth by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive <unk> . balancing the power of capitalists like me. and workers. isn 't bad for capitalism it. <unk> essential to it programs like a reasonable minimum wage . affordable healthcare paid sick leave and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure. necessary for the middle class like education r and d <unk> these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace. to drive growth <unk> because no one benefits from. <unk> it like us . many economists would have you believe that their field is an objective science <unk> i disagree <unk> . and i think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status. and power. <unk> which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories. to tell everyone else about why our relative. relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone . like we are indispensable the job creators <unk> and you are not like. <unk> tax cuts for us create growth <unk> but investments in you. will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country that we matter that you don 't . for thousands of years these stories were called divine right <unk> today we have. <unk> the united states of america made us not the other way around . that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies not a consequence of it. <unk> and we should never forget. that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit . fellow plutocrats. i think it may be time for us to recommit to our country . to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective <unk> a capitalism that will ensure. that america 's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world . let 's secure the future for ourselves our children and their children . or alternatively. <unk> we could do nothing hide in our gated communities and. private schools <unk> enjoy our planes and yachts and wait for the pitchforks.
