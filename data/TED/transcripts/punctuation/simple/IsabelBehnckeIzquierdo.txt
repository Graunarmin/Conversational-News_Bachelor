's where we learn to trust. and where we learn about the rules of the game <unk> play increases creativity. <unk> creativity and resilience <unk> and it 's all about the generation of diversity. diversity of interactions diversity of behaviors <unk> diversity of connections . and when you watch bonobo play you 're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter. <unk> dance and ritual . play is the glue that binds us. <unk> together <unk> . now <unk> i don 't know how you play <unk> . but i want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild first it 's a ball game <unk> bonobo style. and i do not mean football <unk> so here <unk> . we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game. <unk> have a look what she 's doing <unk> it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase she 's got him by the balls only. i think that he 's rather loving it here right yeah . so sex play is common in both bonobos and humans <unk> and this video is really interesting because it shows. <unk> this video 's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as testicles and. and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust. while at the same time being tremendous fun but play 's a shapeshifter . play 's a shapeshifter and it can take many forms some of. <unk> more quiet <unk> imaginative curious maybe where wonder is discovered anew <unk> . and i want you to see <unk> this is fuku a young female and she is quietly playing with water. i think like her we sometimes play alone <unk> and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds . <unk> that playful curiosity that drives us to explore drives us to interact <unk> and then the unexpected connections we form. are the real hotbed for creativity <unk> so these are just small tasters. into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present . but they also hold a secret for our future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world. <unk> creativity and greater cooperation . the secret is that play is the key to these capacities . in other words play is our adaptive wildcard . in order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play. but will we make the most of our playfulness play is not. <unk> frivolous . play 's essential for bonobos and humans alike life is not just red in tooth and claw <unk> . in times when it seems least appropriate to play it might be the times when it is most urgent <unk> . and so my fellow primates <unk> let us. embrace this gift from evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity <unk> fellowship. and wonder thank you.
