 <unk> i grew up in a very small village in canada <unk> and i 'm an undiagnosed. dyslexic . i had a really hard time in school in fact my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried. <unk> cried all the way to school <unk> . i ran away <unk> i left when i was twenty five years old to go to bali <unk> . and there i met my incredible wife <unk> cynthia and together over twenty years we built an amazing jewelry business <unk>. <unk> it was a fairy tale <unk> and then we retired then she took me to see a film that i really didn 't want to see it ruined. my life . the inconvenient truth and mr gore <unk> i have four kids . and even if part of what he says is true <unk> they 're not going to have the life that i. <unk> and i decided at that moment. that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could. to improve their possibilities so. here 's the world <unk> and here we are in bali <unk> it 's a tiny little island sixty miles by ninety miles <unk> it has an intact. <unk> cynthia and i were there we had had. a wonderful life there <unk> and we decided to do something unusual we decided to give. back. locally <unk> and here it is it 's called the green school <unk> i know it doesn 't look like a school . but it is something we decided to do and it is extremely extremely green the classrooms have no walls. <unk> the teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard <unk> the desks are not square . at green school <unk> the children are smiling an unusual thing for school especially for me <unk> and we practice holism <unk> . and for me it 's just the idea that if this little girl. graduates as a. <unk> chances are she 'll demand a whole world. a whole world to live on our children spend one hundred and eighty one days. going to school in a box the people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum. out of the same materials <unk> . so if this gentleman had had a holistic education. <unk> would he be sitting there <unk> would he have had more possibilities in his life . the classrooms have natural light <unk> they 're beautiful they 're bamboo . the breeze passes through them and when the natural breeze isn 't enough . the kids deploy bubbles but not the kind of bubbles you know these bubbles are made from natural cotton. and rubber from the rubber tree. <unk> so we basically turned the box into a bubble and these kids know that painless climate control. may not be part. of their future <unk> we pay the bill at the end of the month but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren . we have to teach the kids. that the world is not. indestructible . these kids did a little graffiti on their desks <unk> . and then they signed up for two extra courses the first one was called sanding. and the second one was called re waxing but since that happened they own. those desks <unk> they know they can control their world. 're on the grid we 're not proud of it <unk> but an amazing alternative energy company in paris. is taking us off the grid with solar <unk> and this thing. is the second vortex to be built in the world in a two and a half meter drop on a river when the turbine drops in . it will produce eight thousand watts of electricity day and night <unk> . and you know what these. there 's nowhere to flush <unk> and as long as we 're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water you 're all really smart just do the math . how many people times how much water . there isn 't enough water these are compost toilets and nobody at the school wanted to know about them. especially the principal . and they work people use them people are okay. <unk> it 's something you should think about doing not many things didn 't work <unk> the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights. got eaten by the sun in six months we had to replace them with recyclable plastic . the teachers dragged giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms. <unk> so we had some good ideas we took old automobile windshields put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard . green school sits in south central bali <unk> . and it 's on twenty acres of rolling garden there 's an amazing river traveling through it and you can see there. how we manage to get across the river . i met a father the other day <unk> he looked a little crazed i said. <unk> welcome to green school he said i 've been on an airplane for twenty four hours i asked him . why he said i had a dream once about a green school and i saw a picture of this green school i got on an airplane . in august i 'm bringing my sons . this was a great. <unk> but more than that people are building green houses around green school <unk> so their kids can walk to school on the paths <unk> . and people are bringing their green industries hopefully their green restaurants . to the green school <unk> it 's becoming a community <unk> it 's becoming a green model . we had to look at everything . no petrochemicals in the pavement no pavement these are volcanic stones laid by hand there are no sidewalks. the sidewalks are gravel they flood when it rains but they 're green this is the school buffalo <unk> . he 's planning to eat that fence for dinner all the fences at green school are green and. when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate they found out the fence was made out of. <unk> they took the tapioca roots up to the. kitchen sliced them thinly and made delicious chips <unk> landscaping <unk> . we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms we dropped them gently in . we made space for these guys. who are bali 's last black pigs <unk> and the school cow. is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower. on the playing field these young ladies. are living in a rice culture <unk> but they know something that few people know in a rice culture they know how to plant organic rice . they know how to look after it <unk> they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it <unk> . they 're part of the rice cycle. and these skills will be valuable for them in their future <unk> this young man is picking organic vegetables. <unk> we feed four hundred people lunch every day. and it 's not a normal lunch there 's no gas <unk> local balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners. using secrets that only their grandmothers know the food. is incredible green school is a place of pioneers <unk> local and global. <unk> and it 's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world the kids are from twenty five countries when i see them together <unk> i know. that they 're working out how to live in the future <unk> green school is going into its third year with one hundred and sixty children <unk> . it 's a school where you do learn reading one of my favorites writing. i was bad at it arithmetic but. <unk> you also learn other things you learn bamboo building you practice. ancient balinese arts this is called mud wrestling in the rice fields . the kids love it <unk> the mothers aren 't quite convinced . laughter we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives and. <unk> local means that. twenty percent of the population of the school has to be balinese . and this was a really big commitment <unk> and we were right <unk> and people are coming forward from all over the world. to support the balinese scholarship fund <unk> because these kids will be bali 's next green leaders <unk> . the teachers are as diverse as the student body <unk> and the amazing thing is that. volunteers are popping up a man came from java with a new kind of organic agriculture a woman came from africa with music <unk> . and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed. to creating a new generation of global green leaders <unk> . the green school effect we don 't know what it is we need. <unk> someone to come and study it <unk> but what 's happening our learning different kids dyslexic we 've renamed them. prolexic are doing well in these beautiful beautiful. classrooms <unk> and all the kids are thriving <unk> and how did we do all this on giant grass. <unk> it 's bamboo it comes out of the ground like a train <unk> it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months. and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this it 's as strong. and dense as teak and it will hold up. any roof when the architects came they brought us these things <unk> and you 've probably seen things like this the yellow box was called the administration complex. we squashed it we rethought it but mainly. we renamed it the heart of school and that changed everything forever <unk> it 's a double helix <unk> . it has administrators in it and many many other things . and the problem of building it when the balinese workers. saw long reams of plans. <unk> they looked at them and said what 's this so we built. big models <unk> we had them engineered by the engineers and balinese carpenters like this. measured them with their bamboo rulers <unk> selected the bamboo and built the buildings. using. <unk> and the balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building. and when the scaffolding came down <unk> . we realized that we had a cathedral a cathedral to green and a cathedral to. <unk> the heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it <unk> from the time the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs. and floors it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world <unk> but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful . is this doable in your community <unk> we believe it is green school is a model we built for the world. <unk> it 's a model we built for bali. <unk> and you just have to follow these simple simple rules be local <unk> let the environment lead. and think about how your grandchildren. might build so mr gore <unk> thank you you ruined my life <unk> but you gave me an incredible. <unk> and if you 're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next fifty around the world <unk> please come and see us thank you.
