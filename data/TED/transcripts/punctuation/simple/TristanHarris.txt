 <unk> what does it mean to spend our time well <unk> . i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my. <unk> probably too much i probably obsess over it my friends think i do but i feel like i kind of have to . because these days it feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me . and when that happens it feels like parts of my life. are slipping away . specifically it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this like technology i check things i. 'll give you an example. <unk> if this email shows up how many of you have gotten an email like this right <unk> i 've been tagged in a photo <unk> . when this appears <unk> i can 't help but click on it right now right <unk> because like what if it 's a bad photo <unk> so i have to click it right now <unk> . but. i 'm not just going to. <unk> i 'm actually going to do is spend the next twenty minutes but. the worst part is that i know this is what 's going to happen and even knowing that that 's what 's going to happen. doesn 't stop me from doing it again the next time. <unk> or i find myself in a situation like this <unk> . where i check my email and i pull down to refresh <unk> but the thing is that. pull down to refresh again. why am i doing this <unk> this doesn 't make any sense <unk> but. i 'll give you a hint why this is happening . what do you think makes more money in the united states. <unk> game parks and baseball combined . slot machines . how can slot machines make all this money. when we play with such small amounts of money we play with coins how is this possible . <unk> the thing is my phone. is a slot machine <unk> . every time i check my phone i 'm playing the slot machine to see <unk> what am i going to get <unk> . what am i going to get every time i check my email i 'm playing the slot machine saying what am i going to get every time i scroll a news feed <unk> . i 'm playing the slot machine to. <unk> what am i going to get next <unk> . and the thing is that again knowing exactly how this works and i 'm a designer i know exactly how the psychology of this works i know exactly what 's going on. but it doesn 't leave me with any choice <unk> i still just get sucked into it . so what are we going to do because it leaves us with this all or nothing relationship with technology right <unk> . <unk> and you 're connected and distracted all the time or you 're off <unk> but then you 're wondering am i missing something important . in other words you 're either distracted. or you have fear of missing out right <unk> . so we need to restore choice we want to have a. <unk> with technology that gives us back choice. about how we spend time with it and we 're going to need help. from designers because knowing this stuff doesn 't help we 're going to need design help so what would that look like <unk> . so let 's take an example that we all face . chat text messaging <unk> so let 's say there 's two people nancy 's on the left and she 's working on a document and john 's on the right. <unk> suddenly remembers i need to ask nancy for that document before i forget. so when he sends her that message <unk> it blows away her attention <unk>. that 's what we 're doing all the time bulldozing each other 's attention left and right <unk> . and there 's serious cost to this <unk> because every time we interrupt each other . it takes us about. twenty three minutes on average to refocus our attention <unk> we actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing . this is gloria mark 's research combined with. microsoft research that showed this and her research also shows that it actually trains bad. <unk> this is crazy so how do we fix this <unk> . because nancy and john are in this all or nothing relationship nancy might want to disconnect but then she 'd be worried <unk> what if i 'm missing something important <unk>. design. <unk> let 's say you have nancy again on the left john on the right <unk> and john remembers i need to send nancy that document except this time nancy can mark that she 's focused let 's say she drags a slider and says i want to be focused for thirty minutes so bam she 's focused <unk> . now when john wants to message her . he can get the thought off of his mind because he has a need he has this thought and he needs to dump it out before he forgets <unk> . except this time it holds the. <unk> messages. so that nancy can still focus <unk> but john can get the thought off of his mind <unk> . but this only works if one last thing is true <unk> which is that nancy needs to know. that if something is truly important john can still interrupt but. instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions. we 're now only creating conscious interruptions <unk> . so we 're doing two things here we 're creating a new choice for both nancy and john but there 's a second subtle thing we 're doing here too . and it 's that we 're changing the question we 're answering <unk> instead of the goal of chat. <unk> let 's design it so it 's easy to send a message that 's the goal of chat it should be really easy to send a message to someone. we change the goal to something deeper and a human value which is let 's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship. between two people <unk> so we upgraded the goal . now do designers actually care about this do we want to have conversations about what. <unk> deeper human goals are well i 'll tell you one story <unk> a little over a year ago i got to. help organize a meeting between some of technology 's leading designers. and thich nhat hanh thich nhat hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness. <unk> and it was the most amazing meeting you have to imagine picture a room on one side of the room you have. a bunch of tech geeks on the other side of the room you have a bunch of. long brown robes shaved heads <unk> buddhist monks <unk> . and the questions were about the deepest human values like what does the future of technology look like when you 're designing for the deepest questions and the deepest human. <unk> and our conversation centered on. listening more deeply to what those values might be . he joked in our conversation that what if instead of a spell check <unk> . you had a compassion check <unk> meaning you might highlight a word that might be accidentally. abrasive perceived as abrasive by someone else <unk> so. does this kind of conversation happen in the real world not just in these design meetings <unk> well the answer is yes. <unk> one of my favorites is couchsurfing if you didn 't know couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay. with a free couch from someone who 's trying to offer it . so great service what would their design goal be <unk> what are you designing for if you work at couchsurfing <unk> . well you would think it 's to match guests with hosts. that 's a pretty good goal but that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before where we 're just trying to deliver a message <unk> so what 's the deeper human goal . well they set their goal as the need to create lasting positive experiences and relationships between people who 've never met before . and the most amazing thing about this was in two thousand and seven they introduced a way. <unk> to measure this <unk> which is incredible i 'll tell you how it works for every design goal you have have you have to have a corresponding measurement to know how you 're doing. a way of measuring success <unk> so what they do is let 's say you take two people. who meet up <unk> and they they take the number of days those two people spent. <unk> and then they estimate how many hours were in those days. how many hours did those two people spend together <unk> . and then after they spend that time together they ask both of them how positive was your experience did you have a good experience with this person that you met <unk> . and they subtract from those positive hours. the amount of time people spent on the website <unk> because that 's a cost to people 's lives <unk> why should we value that as success. <unk> and what you were left with is something they. refer to as net orchestrated conviviality . or really just a net good times created the net hours that would have never existed had couchsurfing not existed . can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day and measure. <unk> actual net new contribution of hours in people 's lives that are positive that would have never existed if you didn 't do what you were about to do at work today . can you imagine. a whole world that worked this way <unk> can you imagine a social network. that let 's say you care about cooking <unk> and it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized and the cooking articles that you were glad you read <unk> and subtracted from that. <unk> the articles you weren 't glad you read or the time you spent scrolling that you didn 't like . imagine a professional social network that instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created or messages sent <unk> instead <unk>. <unk> measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get. <unk> and subtracted the amount of time people spent. on the website or imagine. dating services . like maybe tinder or something <unk> where instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did <unk> which is how they measure success today instead measured the deep <unk>. <unk> romantic fulfilling connections people created <unk> . <unk> but can you imagine a whole world that worked this way that was helping you spend your time well <unk> . now to do this you also need a new system because you 're probably thinking today 's internet economy today 's economy in general is measured in time spent the more users you have . the more usage you have the more time people spend that 's how we measure. <unk> but we 've solved this problem before . we solved it with organic when we said we need to value things a different way <unk> we said this is a different kind of food <unk> . so we can 't compare it just based on price this is a different category of food <unk> we solved it with leed certification <unk> . where we said this is a different kind of building. that stood for different values of environmental sustainability <unk> what if. <unk> we had something like that for technology <unk> what if we had something. whose entire purpose and goal was to help create net new positive contributions to human life <unk> . and what if we could value it a different way <unk> so it would actually. <unk> imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores <unk> imagine you had web browsers that helped route you to these kinds of design products <unk> . can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world . we can create this world today <unk> . company leaders all you have to do only you can prioritize a new metric <unk> which is your metric for net. <unk> positive contribution to human life <unk> and have an honest conversation about that maybe you 're not doing so well to start with but let 's start that conversation . designers you can redefine. success you can redefine design arguably you have more power than many people in your in your organization to. create the choices that all of us live by maybe like in medicine where we have a hippocratic oath to recognize the responsibility and and this higher. value that we have to treat patients what if designers had something like that in terms of this new kind of design . and users for all of us we can demand technology that works this way <unk> now it may seem. <unk> mcdonald 's didn 't have salads until the consumer demand was there <unk> . walmart didn 't have organic food until the consumer demand was there we have to demand. this new kind of technology <unk> and we can do that . and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that 's driven and run entirely on time. <unk> to world that 's driven by time well spent <unk> . i want to live in this world and i want this conversation to happen let 's start that conversation now.
