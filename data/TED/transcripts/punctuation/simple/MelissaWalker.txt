 <unk> military service member deployed to afghanistan . you are responsible for the lives of hundreds of men and women <unk> and your base is under attack <unk> . incoming mortar rounds are exploding. <unk> all around you . struggling to see through the dust and the smoke <unk> you do your best to assist the wounded and then crawl to a nearby bunker <unk> . conscious but dazed by the blasts you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened . as you regain your vision you see a bloody face staring. <unk> back at you the image is terrifying <unk> but you quickly come to understand it 's not. real . this vision continues to visit you multiple times a day and in your sleep <unk> . you choose not to tell anyone for fear of losing your job or being seen as weak <unk> . you give the vision a name. <unk> bloody face in bunker <unk> and call it <unk> bfib for short <unk> . you keep <unk> bfib locked away in your mind <unk> secretly haunting you for the next seven years . now close your eyes . can you see. <unk> you 're beginning to see the face of the invisible wounds of war <unk> commonly known as post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury <unk> . while i can 't say i have post traumatic stress disorder <unk> i 've never been a stranger to it . when i was a little girl i would visit my grandparents every summer . it was my grandfather who introduced me to the effects of combat on the psyche. my grandfather was serving as a marine in the korean war a bullet pierced his neck and rendered him unable to cry out . he watched as a corpsman passed him over declaring him a goner <unk> and then leaving him to die . years later after his physical wounds had healed and he 'd returned home he rarely spoke of his experiences in waking life. but at night i would hear him shouting obscenities from his room down the hall . and during the day i would announce myself as i entered the room careful not to startle or agitate him . he lived out the remainder of his days isolated and tight lipped never finding a way to express himself . and i didn 't yet have the tools to guide him. i wouldn 't have a name for my grandfather 's condition until i was in my 20s . seeking a graduate degree in art therapy <unk> i naturally gravitated towards the study of trauma . and while sitting in class learning about post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd for short . my mission to help service members who suffered like my grandfather began to take. <unk> form . we 've had various names for post traumatic stress throughout the history of war <unk> . homesickness <unk> soldier 's heart <unk> . shell shock thousand yard stare for instance <unk> and while i was pursuing my degree a new war was raging. <unk> and thanks to modern body armor and military vehicles service members were surviving blast injuries they wouldn 't have before <unk> . but the invisible wounds were reaching new levels <unk> and this pushed military doctors and researchers to try and truly understand the effects that traumatic brain injury. and ptsd have on the brain <unk> . due to advances in technology and neuroimaging we now know there 's an actual shutdown in the broca. <unk> 's or the speech language area of the brain after an individual experiences trauma . this physiological change or speechless terror as it 's often called . coupled with mental health stigma the fear of being judged or misunderstood <unk> possibly even removed from their current duties has led to the invisible struggles of our servicemen and women. <unk> generation after generation of veterans have chosen not to talk about their experiences and suffer in solitude <unk> . i had my work cut out for me when i got my first job as an art therapist at the nation 's largest military medical center walter reed . after working for a few years on a locked in patient psychiatric unit i eventually transferred to the. <unk> national intrepid center of excellence nicoe which leads tbi care for active duty service members . now i believed in art therapy <unk> but i was going to have to convince service members <unk> big tough strong manly military men . and some women too to give art making as a. psychotherapeutic intervention a try the results have been nothing short of spectacular <unk> . vivid <unk> symbolic artwork is being created by our servicemen and women <unk> and every work of art tells a story . we 've observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech language issue with the brain. art making accesses the same sensory areas of the brain that encode trauma. <unk> can use the art making to work through their experiences in a nonthreatening way . they can then apply words to their physical creations <unk> reintegrating the left and the right hemispheres of the brain . now we 've seen this can work with all forms of art. drawing <unk> painting collage but what seems to have the most impact is. finally these invisible wounds don 't just have a name they have a face . and when service members create these masks it allows them to come to grips <unk> literally with their trauma . and it 's amazing how often that enables them to break through the trauma and. <unk> that was a real experience for one of my patients <unk> and when he created his mask he was able to let go of that haunting image <unk> . initially it was a daunting process for the service member but eventually he began to think of bfib as the mask not his internal wound and he would go to leave each session he would hand me the mask and. <unk> in a box to further contain him <unk> and when the service member went to leave the nicoe he chose to leave <unk> bfib behind . a year later <unk> he had only seen bfib twice <unk> and both times bfib was smiling and the service member didn 't feel anxious . now whenever that service member is haunted by some traumatic memory he continues to paint every time he paints these disturbing images. <unk> them less. or not at all . philosophers have told us for thousands of years that the power to create is very closely linked to the power to destroy <unk> . now science is showing us that the part of the brain that registers a traumatic wound. can be the part of the brain where healing happens too <unk> and art therapy is showing us how to make that connection. <unk> we asked one of our service members to describe how <unk> mask making impacted his treatment <unk> and this is what he had to say service member you. sort of just zone out into the mask you zone zone out into the drawing <unk> and for me it just released. the block <unk> so i was able to. do it <unk> and then when i looked at it after two days. <unk> here 's the puzzle and then from there it just soared <unk> i mean from there my treatment just when. out of out of sight because they were like kurt explain this <unk> explain this and. for the first time in twenty three years i could actually talk about stuff openly to like anybody <unk> i could talk to you about it right now if i wanted to <unk> because it. unlocked it it 's just amazing <unk> and it allowed me to put. <unk> of ptsd and. tbi stuff together in one place that has never happened before <unk> . sorry melissa walker over the past five years we 've had over one thousand masks. made it 's pretty. <unk> i wish i could have shared this process with my grandfather but i know that he would be thrilled. that we are finding ways to help today 's and tomorrow 's service members heal <unk> . and finding the resources within them. that they can call upon to heal themselves <unk> thank you.
