 <unk> welcome to africa. or rather i should say welcome home because this is where it all really began isn 't it . looking at fossils dating back several millions of years it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it. began right here. we are on an amazing journey. the next four days you 're going to hear stories. of africa the next chapter fantastic tales <unk> anecdotes from speakers but i want to turn that upside down for a moment <unk> . and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say <unk> . what 's the worst thing you 've ever heard about africa <unk> and this is not a rhetorical question. <unk> want answers from you go for it the worst. is about africa the story we have not heard the stories that we want to know and the stories that do exist about positive tales . a part of my. talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent to separate the rhetoric from the reality <unk> the fact from the fiction . to go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the. actual things that are happening. <unk> on the ground that make africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you <unk> . so let 's get going because africa to some degree is on a turnaround . a turnaround in terms of how it manages its image and how it takes control of its own destiny . and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on. for most of my professional career. <unk> all started almost a decade ago . as a young consultant at mckinsey & company at their first african office in johannesburg <unk> and there we worked with leading ceos on african issues and african companies. on turnarounds making the companies not just the best in africa but the best globally <unk> . but i really formalized this focus on turnarounds when i was completing my mba in the united. <unk> states <unk> it all began with a fantastic phone call it was from rosabeth moss kanter . harvard business school guru and a professor of mine and she said i want to write a case euvin. a case on a public sector leader that has lessons. for the corporate world and the leader that came to mind was nelson mandela. because nelson mandela <unk> as he took over power as the first. democratically elected president of south africa <unk> faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos <unk> . but he started the country on a path of a positive cycle . now the case nelson mandela change leader became part of the research base. for a chapter in rosabeth 's new book called confidence. <unk> became a new york times bestseller and topped business week 's hardcover bestseller list . and why i tell you this story is because later when i was interviewed on sabc africa on a pan african broadcast they asked what is. your key lesson or the key thing you enjoy the most because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project. the lesson from that was that it was africa an african story that was used to share news with the rest of the world of. <unk> what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds africa. was being used as a success story <unk> . so i want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation and that has to do with me. because in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i packed a few things into a backpack. and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career you should have seen my parents ' reaction. but very soon <unk> i found myself from the southern part of africa in south africa at the very north in egypt <unk> and i sought out the most remote places . i went to the siwa oasis that was one of my stops and the siwa oasis is famous for several things but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great went to. when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him and legend has it that alexander. <unk> trekked through this desert <unk> half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm and myth says that he had an audience with the oracle and it foretold his destiny of greatness . this was three hundred bc <unk> so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers . now the thing i remember about siwa. was the magical view of the sky at night with no natural. <unk> light source siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry . fast forward to two thousand and two i 'm sitting in cambridge massachusetts at the healthcare development conference and i see the same picture but from the opposite side . a satellite picture looking down at the earth <unk> . and it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me. because i 'll never forget it i remember the very. <unk> moment <unk> and i wanted to share that image with you of what i saw at that point . the first thing that i saw was north america at night. glowing <unk> in all its glory <unk> a warm feeling . light. <unk> and then i saw it africa <unk> quite literally the dark continent . and while africa may be dark the thing that brought. the message home to me. was that this is the challenge we are facing <unk> but it 's also the opportunity <unk> . because whilst africa may be dark other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas. <unk> it 's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there <unk> entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope. it was george kimble the geographer who said. that the only thing dark about africa is our ignorance of it . so let 's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer <unk> let 's start unpacking it. africa. is the second largest continent <unk> a landmass second from asia <unk> . it also is the second most populated continent with nine hundred million people <unk> . in fact coming back to the land mass africa is so big that you could fit in the continental united states <unk> china <unk> and the entire europe into africa and still have space. <unk> africa is home to over one thousand languages. two thousand is is another estimate that 's out there with over two thousand languages and dialects <unk> . but you could say invest in africa in over one thousand languages and it wouldn 't make a difference . what does the data say <unk> . as an investment banker i 'm in the. <unk> and the changes that are taking place in capital markets <unk> so i want to share with you some of these. bellwether signals or signs and winds of change that are sweeping this continent <unk> so let 's start on that and let 's start at the high level on the macro factors . inflation in general is coming down across africa that 's the first sign. in many countries reaching double digit figures <unk> so let 's start looking at some of those . i call it my z e n cluster <unk> zambia from two thousand and four to two thousand and six moves from the eighteen percent in inflation to the nine percent. <unk> egypt from the sixteen percent to about eight point four percent <unk> . nigeria a similar situation from the sixteen percent to the eight percent <unk> single digits <unk> . more fascinating you have other countries. south africa <unk> mauritius namibia. <unk> that 's just part of the story you have a similar trend with currencies currencies going through an extreme time of stability <unk> . but that 's looking at the big picture and the first myth to dispel is that africa. is not a country it 's made up. <unk> very definition to say invest in africa is a no go it 's meaningless <unk> each country. has a unique value proposition you can make money you can lose money in africa but. opportunities boy oh boy they exist and this is what today is about it 's about discussing those very. <unk> so let 's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data . i was recently elected as emeka mentioned as the president of the south african chamber of commerce in america <unk> and i 'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is <unk>. <unk> a fascinating position to be in to hear this dialogue that 's just increasing in tenor and velocity of. <unk> talk about the gold the minerals the first world infrastructure. a bit about the other side of it for example south africa was recently voted as the top. destination for the top one thousand uk companies for offshore call centers same language <unk> timeline <unk> et cetera makes sense . other headlines that have recently reached south africa were bain capital and kkr the big boys of private equity. <unk> headline in south africa they have landed quite ominous <unk> but. what were they there for to acquire assets bing capital 's acquisition of edcon <unk> a large retailer . is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy because it is actually a long term play . being a retailer <unk> it is a play on the belief that this middle class that 's growing will continue to grow. <unk> that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue . but the story of africa <unk> and my focus is beyond south africa. because there 's so much happening . undoubtedly nigeria is clearly a hot spot <unk> challenges and we will hear a lot about nigeria in these four days <unk> but. looking at goldman sachs ' work. we had the. <unk> famous bric report <unk> . the new report the next eleven highlights that by two thousand and twenty nigeria is going to be amongst the top ten economies in the world it 's an investment opportunity <unk> . think about that . is anyone. our banks our investors seriously thinking about going to nigeria if you haven 't why not what 's going on. <unk> couple of things <unk> i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets bellwether signs again <unk> . guarantee trust bank recently issued the first euro bond. out of africa and this excludes south africa <unk> but the first eurobond the raising of international capital offshore <unk> . off its own balance sheet <unk> without any sovereign backing. <unk> an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy <unk> without any sovereign backing a nigerian company raising capital offshore <unk> it 's just a sign of things to come looking at the oil industry . africa. provides eighteen percent. of the u s ' s oil supply with the middle east just sixteen percent it 's an important strategic partner . let 's put nigeria in perspective two point two to two point four million barrels of oil a day the same league as kuwait the same league as venezuela. <unk> but with africa let 's start being careful about this and emeka and i have had these discussions we have to move away from what 's called the curse of the commodities . because it 's not about oil it 's not about commodities for africa to truly be sustainable we have to move beyond. to other industries <unk> so let 's unpack those very quickly and i 'm going to move through these very very very fast because i can see that clock counting down . what else is going on there. egypt . egypt is launching a first large industrial zone two point eight billion investment the announcement just came out the last few weeks close to the mediterranean <unk> near alexandria. textiles <unk> petrochemicals it 's being managed by <unk>. a singaporean based management company so they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries away from oil let 's look at agriculture. let 's look at forestry what 's going on there <unk> in tanzania last week we had the launch. of the east african organic produce. standard <unk> again <unk> gathering together farmers <unk> gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards. for organic produce better prices it ties in with. <unk> small scale farmers in terms of no pesticides no fertilizers <unk> again <unk> opportunity. to tackle markets to get that higher price <unk> uganda <unk> the new forest company . replanting and redeveloping their forests why is that important . as the energy. <unk> needs are met and electricity is needed [ we will need ] poles for rolling out electricity but here is the sweetener in the deal they 're going to be tapping into carbon credits . let 's go back to nigeria <unk> . the banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation from over eighty banks to twenty five banks <unk> strengthening of the system . but what 's going on there only ten percent of the country is banked the. largest population in africa is in nigeria one hundred and. <unk> people <unk> think about that . there are only seven hundred atms in the country opportunity <unk> the same for telecoms across the country . now let 's look at the continent as a whole people look at the roads for example and they 'd say angola <unk> ninety percent of roads are. nigeria seventy percent of roads are untarred <unk> zambia eighty percent in general more than fifty percent of roads are untarred this is an opportunity <unk> . energy needs it 's an opportunity <unk> . so what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing let 's look at the stock markets in africa if i had to ask you in two thousand and five. what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world. <unk> to mind . in two thousand and five the egyptian stock exchange returned over one hundred and forty five percent <unk> . what 's going on in some of the other countries let 's look at some two thousand and six numbers <unk> kenya over sixty percent . nigeria over forty percent south africa in the twenty percents high ones . these are the trends that are taking place. but in any investment decision the key question is . what is my alternative investment . because in africa today we are competing globally for capital and global capital is agnostic it. has no loyalties there 's an overhang of capital. <unk> and the key is yield pickup . what africa is providing is a diversification play <unk> and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that 's aware of what he or she is doing . now when looking at africa vis a vis other things and countries in africa vis a vis other things comparisons become important ten years ago. there were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the standard & poors moody 's and fitch 's . <unk> sixteen african countries and growing. have sovereign country ratings <unk> what does this mean take nigeria again <unk> double b minus. in the league of ukraine and turkey <unk> immediately we have a comparison <unk> . the backbone of making investment decisions for global. holders of capital some other figures south africa. in fact one of the big agencies is setting up an office in africa <unk> why are they doing that . because they expect investment to follow so one of the big bellwethers and one of my final points i want to mention is. the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel. <unk> african news channel . they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen me and you . the investments we are going to be making the investments the world is going to be making that 's the 24 hour news channel dedicated to africa <unk> . so that 's the change that 's coming down the pipeline . so in conclusion. <unk> i want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago <unk>. this time [ i 'll ] give you the entire picture that i saw in two thousand and two and ask you. that when you think about what your role can be in africa <unk> think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent because there are amazing. <unk> and think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind. because things can be turned around rather quickly in one thousand eight hundred and ninety nine joseph conrad. released the heart of darkness a tale of grim horror. along the congo river <unk> . if one looks. <unk> on the congo river is one of those bright lights <unk> and that 's the very congo river generating light. the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro electric power . that is a transformation in power of ideas <unk> . so the next step over the next four days is us exploring more of these ideas <unk> . and perchance if you can always keep this picture in your mind <unk> that when we convene maybe. in the distant future in two thousand and twenty twenty that picture will look very different <unk> thank you.
