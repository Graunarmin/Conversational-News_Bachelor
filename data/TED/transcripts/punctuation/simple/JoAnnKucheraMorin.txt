 <unk> the allosphere it 's a three story metal sphere in an echo free chamber <unk> think of the allosphere as a large dynamically varying digital microscope. that 's connected to a supercomputer <unk> twenty researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere and be completely immersed in. <unk> their data <unk> imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin <unk> . imagine. if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material <unk> imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain. <unk> as though it was a world <unk> and see tissues as landscapes and hear blood density levels as music this is some of the research that you 're going to see that we 're undertaking at the allosphere . but first a little bit about this group of artists scientists and engineers that are working together i 'm a composer <unk>. <unk> the inventor of the allosphere with my visual artist colleagues we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space visually and sonically <unk> . our scientist colleagues are finding new. <unk> patterns in the information and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest. dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration . i 'm going to fly you into five research projects in the allosphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin <unk> . this first project is called the allobrain and it 's our attempt to quantify. <unk> beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful you 're flying through the cortex of my colleague 's brain . our narrative here is real fmri data that 's mapped visually and sonically the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with you see twelve <unk>. intelligent computer agents the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you. <unk> mining blood density levels <unk> and they 're reporting them back to you sonically <unk> higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain they 're actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities <unk> . we 're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next. artistic and scientific installation. <unk> in this artistic and scientific installation <unk> biogenerative algorithms are helping us to. understand self generation and growth very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences for artists <unk> we 're making new worlds that we can uncover <unk>. <unk> and explore these generative algorithms grow over time and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects <unk> our researchers are interacting with this data by. <unk> injecting bacterial code which are computer programs that allow these creatures to grow over time we 're. going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world down into the atomic world as we fly into a lattice of atoms <unk> this is <unk>. <unk> real afm atomic force microscope data from my colleagues in the solid state lighting and energy center they 've discovered a new bond a new material. <unk> for transparent solar cells <unk> we 're flying through two thousand lattice of atoms oxygen <unk> hydrogen and zinc you view the bond in the triangle . it 's four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom you see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists <unk> this is. <unk> allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms <unk> we think it makes a beautiful structural art the sound that you 're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms <unk>. <unk> we 've mapped them into the audio domain so they 're singing to you oxygen <unk> hydrogen and zinc have their own signature we. single hydrogen atom <unk> we 're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the. equation in time. <unk> what you 're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom you 're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines <unk>. the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular. in a minute we 're going to move to a two orbital configuration <unk> and you 're going to notice a pulsing <unk> and you 're going to hear an undulation between the sound this is actually <unk>. <unk> a light emitter <unk> as the sound starts to pulse and contract our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted they 're starting to find new mathematical. <unk> in these calculations and they 're understanding more about quantum mathematics we. 're going to move even further down . and go to one single electron spin this will be the final project that i show you <unk> . our colleagues in the center for quantum computation and spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin. <unk> we 've taken this information and we 've made a mathematical model out of it you 're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow this is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology.
