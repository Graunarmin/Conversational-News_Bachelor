 <unk> do you think the world is going to be a better place next year in the next decade can we. end hunger achieve gender equality. <unk> climate change all in the next fifteen years <unk> . well according to the governments of the world yes we can . in the last few days <unk> the leaders of the world <unk> meeting at the un in new york <unk> agreed a new set of global goals for the development of the world to two thousand and thirty <unk> . and here they are these goals are the product. of a massive consultation exercise the global goals. are who we humanity want to be . now that 's the plan <unk> . but can we get there can this vision for a better world really be achieved . well i 'm here today because we 've run the numbers <unk> . and the answer. <unk> is that maybe we actually can but not with business as usual. <unk> now the idea that the world is going to get a better place may seem a little fanciful . watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards not forwards . and let 's be frank it 's pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements coming out of the un <unk> . but please i invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment. because back in two thousand and one the un agreed another set of goals <unk> the millennium development goals . and the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people living in poverty. by two thousand and fifteen the target was to take from a baseline of one thousand nine hundred and ninety . <unk> percent of the world 's population lived in poverty to get to eighteen percent poverty. this year . did we hit this target well. no <unk> we didn 't <unk> we exceeded it this year global poverty is going to fall to twelve percent . now that 's still not good enough and the world does still have plenty of problems <unk> but the pessimists. <unk> and doomsayers who say that the world can 't get better are simply wrong . so how did we achieve this success well a lot of it was because of economic growth . some of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as china and india <unk> which have seen. rapid economic growth in recent years so can we pull off the same trick again can economic growth get us to the global goals. <unk> well <unk> to answer that question we need to benchmark where the world is today against the global goals and figure out how far we have to travel <unk> . but that ain 't easy because the global goals aren 't just ambitious <unk> they 're also pretty complicated . over seventeen goals there are then one. <unk> and literally hundreds of indicators also <unk> while some of the goals are pretty specific. end hunger. others are a lot vaguer. promote peaceful and tolerant societies <unk> . so to help us with this benchmarking <unk> i 'm going to use a tool called the social progress index what this does is measures all the stuff the global goals are trying. <unk> but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time . the social progress index basically asks three fundamental questions about a society <unk> . first of all does everyone have the basic needs of survival food water <unk> shelter <unk> safety <unk> secondly does everyone have the building blocks of a better life education information. <unk> and a sustainable environment <unk> . and does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives through rights <unk> freedom of choice <unk> freedom from discrimination and access to the world 's most advanced knowledge . the social progress index sums all this together using fifty two indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of zero to one hundred . and what we find is that there 's a wide diversity of performance in the world today <unk> the highest performing country. <unk> norway <unk> scores eighty eight the lowest performing country <unk> central african republic scores thirty one . and we can add up all the countries together weighting for the different population sizes <unk> and that global score is sixty one . in concrete terms that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of cuba or kazakhstan today. that 's where we are today sixty one out of one hundred <unk> what do we have to get to to achieve the global goals <unk> . now the global goals are certainly ambitious <unk> but they 're not about turning the world into norway in just fifteen years <unk> . so having looked at the numbers my estimate is that a score of <unk>. would not only be a giant. <unk> it would also count as hitting the global goals target <unk> . so there 's our target seventy five out of one hundred can we get there well. the social progress index can help us calculate this . because as you might have noticed there are no economic indicators in there there 's no gdp or economic growth in the social progress index model <unk> . and what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth. and social progress. let me show you on this chart <unk> so here on the vertical axis <unk> i 've put social progress the stuff the global goals are trying to achieve higher is better and then. on the horizontal axis is gdp per capita further to the right means richer <unk> . and in there i 'm now going to put all the countries of the world each one represented. <unk> and on top of that i 'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship . and what this tells us is that as we get richer social progress does tend to improve . however as we get richer <unk> each extra dollar of gdp is buying us less and less social progress <unk> . and now we can use this information to start building our. <unk> we have a social progress score of sixty one and a gdp per capita of $ fourteen thousand and the place we 're trying to get to remember <unk>. <unk> global goals target <unk> so here we are today $ fourteen thousand per capita gdp <unk> how rich are we going to be in two thousand and thirty that 's what we need to know next . well . <unk> the best forecast we can find comes from the us department of agriculture <unk> which forecasts three point one percent average global economic growth over the next fifteen years <unk> . which means that in two thousand and thirty <unk> if they 're right . per capita gdp will be about $ twenty three thousand <unk> . so now the question is if we get that much richer <unk> how much social progress are we going to get <unk> . well <unk> we asked a team of economists at deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers <unk> and they came back and. <unk> if the world. world 's average wealth goes from $ fourteen thousand a year to $ twenty three thousand a year social progress is going to increase from sixty one. to sixty two point four . just sixty two point four just a tiny increase . now this seems a bit strange economic growth seems to have really helped. <unk> in the fight against poverty <unk> but it doesn 't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the global goals <unk> so what 's going on . well i think there are two things <unk> the first is that in a way we 're the victims of our own success <unk> we 've used up the easy wins from economic growth and now we 're moving on to harder problems <unk> . <unk> we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits there are costs to the environment costs from new health problems like obesity . so that 's the bad news we 're not going to get to the global goals just by getting richer <unk> . so are the pessimists right . well maybe not because the social progress index also has some very good news <unk> . let me take you back to that regression line so this is the average relationship between gdp and social progress. <unk> and this is what our last forecast was based on but as you saw already there is actually lots of noise around this trend line what. that tells us quite simply is that gdp is not destiny <unk> . we have countries that are underperforming on social progress. <unk> relative to their wealth . russia has lots of natural resource wealth but lots of social problems <unk> . china has boomed economically <unk> but hasn 't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues . india has a space program and millions of people without toilets . now on the other hand we have countries <unk>. <unk> on social progress relative to their gdp. <unk> costa rica has prioritized education health and environmental sustainability and. as a result it 's achieving a very high level of social progress <unk> despite only having a rather modest gdp . and costa rica 's not alone . from poor countries like rwanda to richer countries like new zealand <unk> we see that it 's possible to get lots of social progress <unk> even if your gdp is not so great <unk> . and that 's really important <unk> because it tells us. <unk> two things <unk> first of all it tells us that. we already in the world have the solutions to many of the problems that the global goals are trying to solve . it also tells us that we 're not slaves to gdp . our choices matter if we prioritize the well being of people then we can make a lot more progress than our gdp might expect <unk> . how much. <unk> enough to get us to the global goals <unk> . well let 's look at some numbers <unk> what we know already the world today is scoring sixty one on social progress <unk> and the place we want to get to is seventy five . if we rely on economic growth alone <unk> we 're going to get to sixty two point four <unk> so <unk>. <unk> let 's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress the russia china indias just up to the average how much social. <unk> progress does that get us well that takes us to sixty five . it 's a bit better <unk> . but still quite a long way to go <unk> so let 's get a little bit more optimistic and say what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well being . well then we get to sixty seven . and now let 's be even bolder. <unk> what if every country in the world chose to be like costa rica in prioritizing human well being using its wealth for the well being of its citizens well then we get to nearly seventy three . very close to the global goals <unk> . can we achieve the global goals <unk> certainly not with business as usual <unk> . even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there if it just raises the. <unk> if we 're going to achieve the global goals we have to do things differently <unk> we have to prioritize social progress <unk> and really scale solutions around the world <unk> . i believe the global goals are a historic opportunity because the world 's leaders have promised to deliver them . let 's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism let 's hold them to that promise. <unk> we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable <unk> tracking their progress all the way through the next fifteen years <unk> . and i want to finish by showing you a way to do that called the people 's report card . the people 's report card brings together all this data into a simple framework that we 'll all be familiar with from our school days to hold them to account . it grades our performance on the global goals on a scale from f to a. where f is humanity at its worst and a is humanity at its best our world today is scoring. a c . the global goals are all about getting to an a <unk> . and that 's why we 're going to be updating the people 's report card annually for the world and for all the countries of the world so we can hold our leaders to account. to achieve this target and fulfill. this promise . because getting to the global goals will only happen if we do things differently <unk> if our leaders do things differently . and for that <unk> to happen that needs us to demand it . so let 's reject business as usual <unk>. <unk> just one question the millennium development goals established fifteen years ago they were kind of applying to every country but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging. <unk> the new global goals are explicitly universal . they ask for every country to show action and to show progress how can i as a private citizen use the report card to. to create pressure for action michael green this is a really important point it 's a big shift in priorities it 's no longer about poor countries and just poverty it 's about every country <unk> and every country is going to have challenges in getting to the global goals <unk> even i 'm sorry to say bruno. <unk> switzerland has got to work to do and so that 's why we 're going to produce these report cards in two thousand and sixteen for every country in the world then we can really see how are we doing and it 's not going to be <unk>. <unk> rich countries scoring straight a 's <unk> and that then i think is to provide a point of focus for people to start demanding.
