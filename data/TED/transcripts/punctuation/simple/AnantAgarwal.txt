 <unk> i 'd like to reimagine education <unk> . the last year has seen the invention of a new four letter word it starts with an m mooc . massive open online. <unk> many organizations. are offering these online courses to students all over the world in the millions . for free <unk> anybody who has an internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it <unk> . now <unk> in this discussion today i 'm going to focus on a different aspect of. <unk> we are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education. to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom now our classrooms could use change <unk> so here 's a classroom. at this little three letter institute in the northeast of america mit <unk> and this was a classroom about fifty or sixty years ago and this is a classroom today. <unk> what 's changed <unk> the seats are in color whoop de do . education really hasn 't changed. in the past five hundred years the last big innovation. in education was the printing press and the textbooks <unk> everything else has changed around us you know from healthcare to transportation <unk> everything is different. <unk> education hasn 't changed it 's. also been a real issue in terms of access <unk> so what you see here is not a rock concert <unk> and the person you see at the end of the stage. is not madonna this is a classroom at the obafemi awolowo university in nigeria <unk> . <unk> we 've all heard of distance education <unk> but the students way in the back two hundred feet away from the instructor i think they are undergoing. education now i really believe. that we can transform education both in quality and scale and access through technology . for example <unk> at edx . <unk> are trying to transform education through online technologies. <unk> given education has been calcified for five hundred years <unk> . we really cannot think about reengineering it <unk> micromanaging it we really have to completely reimagine it it 's like going from ox carts. to the airplane even the infrastructure has to change everything has to change we need to go from. lectures on the blackboard to online exercises online videos <unk> we have to go to interactive virtual. <unk> laboratories and gamification we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards <unk> everything really has to change <unk> . so at edx and a number of other organizations we are applying these technologies to education. through moocs to really increase access to education and you heard of this example where when we launched our very first course and this was <unk>. circuits and electronics course about a year. year and a half ago one hundred and fifty five thousand students. from one hundred and sixty two countries enrolled in this course and we had no marketing budget . now one hundred and fifty five thousand is a big number this number is bigger than the total number of alumni of mit in its. <unk> passed the course and this was a hard course <unk> seven thousand two hundred is also a big number <unk> . if i were to teach at mit two semesters every year <unk> i would have to teach for forty years. before i could teach this many students. now these large numbers are just one part of the story <unk> so today i want to discuss a different aspect the other side of moocs take a different perspective. we are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom to create a blended model of learning . but before i go into that let me tell you a story <unk> . when my daughter. turned thirteen became a teenager <unk> she stopped speaking english and she began speaking this new language <unk> i call it. teen lish it 's a digital language it 's got two sounds a grunt and a silence . honey come over for dinner. were just not communicating <unk> until one day i had this epiphany <unk> i texted her . i got an instant response <unk> . i said no that must have been by accident she must have thought you know some friend of hers was calling her so. i texted her again <unk> boom another response i said this is great <unk> . and so since then our life has changed <unk> i text her she responds it 's just been absolutely great. so our millennial generation is built differently now. i 'm older and my youthful looks might belie that but. i 'm not in the millennial generation but our kids are really different <unk> the millennial generation is completely. comfortable with online technology <unk> so why are we fighting it in the classroom let 's not fight it let 's embrace it in fact i believe and i have two fat thumbs i can 't text very well. but i 'm willing to bet that with evolution our kids and and their grandchildren will develop really really little itty bitty thumbs to text much better that evolution will fix all of that stuff <unk> . but what if we embraced technology embraced the millennial generation 's. natural predilections and really think about creating these online technologies blend them into their lives <unk> so here 's what we can. <unk> do so rather than driving our kids into a classroom herding them out there at eight o 'clock in the morning. i hated going to class at eight o 'clock in the morning . so why are we forcing our kids to do that so instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms in their bedroom in the dining room in the. <unk> they 're most creative then they come into the classroom. for some in person interaction <unk> . they can have discussions amongst themselves they can solve problems together they can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions <unk> . in fact . with edx when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world this was happening unbeknownst to us . two high school teachers at the sant high school in mongolia. <unk> had flipped their classroom <unk> and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises <unk> where the learners in the high school 15 year olds mind you would go and do these things in their <unk>. <unk> own homes and they would come into class and as you see from this image here <unk> they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work . <unk> also doing other pilots <unk> so we did a pilot experimental blended courses working with san jose state university in california . again with the circuits and electronics course you 'll hear that a lot that course has become. sort of like our petri dish of learning <unk> so there the students would again <unk> the instructors flipped the classroom <unk>. blended online and in person and the results were staggering . now don 't take these results to the bank just yet . just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more but the early results are incredible <unk> . so traditionally semester upon semester for the past several years this course again a hard course . had a failure rate of about forty to forty one percent every semester with this blended class late last year <unk> . the failure rate fell to nine percent . so the results can be. <unk> extremely extremely good now before we go. too far into this i 'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas what are some key ideas that makes all of this work . one idea is active learning the idea here is rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures. <unk> we replace this with what we call lessons lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises <unk> so a student might watch a <unk>. <unk> video and follow that with an interactive exercise think of this as the ultimate <unk>. of education you teach by asking questions <unk> and this is a form of learning called active learning and really promoted by a very early paper. <unk> retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing students learn much better when they are interacting with the material <unk> . the second idea is self pacing . now when i went to a lecture hall and if you were like me by the fifth minute i would lose the professor <unk> i wasn 't all that smart and i would be scrambling taking notes <unk> and then i would lose. <unk> the rest of the hour instead wouldn 't it be nice with online technologies we offer videos and interactive engagements to students <unk> they can hit the pause button <unk> . they can rewind the professor . heck <unk> they can even mute the professor <unk> so this form of self pacing can be very helpful to learning <unk> . the third idea that we have is instant feedback <unk> with instant. <unk> how else do you teach one hundred and fifty thousand students your computer is grading all the exercises and we 've all submitted homeworks and. your grades come back two weeks later you 've forgotten all about it <unk> . i don 't think i 've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days some are never graded <unk> . so with instant feedback students can try to apply answers if they get it wrong <unk> they can get instant feedback they can try it again and try it again and this really becomes much more engaging they get the instant feedback <unk> . and this little green check mark that you see here. <unk> here. is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edx . learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark. in fact one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year <unk> he then went on to take a software course from berkeley at the end of the year . and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course. <unk> check mark . oh god have i missed you . when 's the last time you 've seen students posting comments like this about homework . my colleague ed bertschinger who heads up the physics department at mit . has this to say about instant feedback he indicated that instant feedback. turns teaching moments. into learning. <unk> outcomes <unk> . the next big idea is gamification you know all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on you know they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it <unk> . so we applied these gamification techniques to learning and we can build these online laboratories how do you teach creativity how do you teach design we can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs <unk> so as this little video shows. you can engage students much like they design with legos <unk> so here the learners are building a circuit with lego like ease <unk> . and this can also be graded by the computer . fifth is peer learning <unk> so here <unk> we use discussion forums and discussions and facebook like interaction not. <unk> but to really help students learn let me tell you a story. when we did our. circuits course for the one hundred and fifty five thousand students. i didn 't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course. i told my tas okay twenty four seven we 're going to be up monitoring the forum answering questions they had answered questions for one hundred students how do you do that for one hundred and fifty thousand . so one night i 'm sitting up there at two a m at night and i think there 's this question from a student from pakistan. and he asked a question and i said okay let me go and type up an answer i don 't type all that fast and i begin typing up the answer <unk> and before i can finish. another student from egypt popped in with an answer not quite right so i 'm fixing the answer <unk> and before i can finish a student from the u s had popped in with a different answer <unk> . and then i sat back fascinated <unk> . boom boom. <unk> the students were discussing and interacting with each other and by four a m that night i 'm totally fascinated <unk> having this epiphany and by four a m in the morning they had discovered the right answer <unk> . and all i had to do was go and bless it good answer . so this this is absolutely amazing where students are learning from each other and they 're telling us that they are learning by teaching . now this is all not just in the future. <unk> so we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world from tsinghua in china to the national university of mongolia in mongolia to berkeley in california. all over the world and these kinds of technologies really help the blended model can really help revolutionize education . it can also solve a practical problem of moocs <unk> . the business aspect we can also license these mooc courses to other universities and therein. lies a revenue model for moocs where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next generation textbook <unk> . they can use as much or as little as they like and it becomes a tool in the teacher 's arsenal <unk> . finally <unk> i would like to have you dream with me for a little bit i would like us to really reimagine education. <unk> we will have to move from lecture halls to e spaces . we have to move from books to tablets like the <unk> aakash in india or the raspberry pi twenty dollars the aakash is forty dollars <unk> . we have to move from bricks and mortar school buildings. to digital dormitories <unk> but i think at the end of the day i think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities. <unk> otherwise how else do we tell our grandchildren that <unk> your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks. and watched this professor at the end. talk about content and you know <unk> you didn 't even have a rewind button <unk> thank you.
