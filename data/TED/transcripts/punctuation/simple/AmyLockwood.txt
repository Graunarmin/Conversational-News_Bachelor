 <unk> i am a reformed marketer <unk> and i now work in international development . in october i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo <unk> which is the [ second ] largest country in africa in fact it 's as large as western europe <unk>. <unk> but it only has three hundred miles of paved roads . the drc is a dangerous place in the past ten years five million people have died due to a war in the east . but war isn 't the only reason that life is difficult in the drc . there are many health issues as well . in fact the hiv prevalence rate is one point three percent among adults this might not sound like a large number <unk> but in a. <unk> million people it means there are nine hundred and thirty thousand that are infected <unk> . and due to the poor infrastructure only twenty five percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need <unk> . which is why in part donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost <unk> . and so while i was in the drc i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms <unk> . including damien . damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa it 's a hotel that 's only open. <unk> until midnight so it 's not a place that you stay <unk> but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come . now damien knows all about condoms <unk> but he doesn 't sell them he said there 's just not in demand <unk> . it 's not surprising <unk> because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms <unk> . joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said. despite the fact that donor agencies. <unk> provide them at low or no cost <unk> and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them . their customers don 't buy the branded versions they like the generics <unk> . and as a marketer i found that curious <unk> and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like . and it turns out that there are three main messages used. <unk> they name the condoms things like vive to live or trust . they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv <unk> put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them <unk> . show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or. <unk> to act prudently now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom . what is it that you think about just before you get a condom . sex <unk> . and the private companies that sell condoms in these places <unk> they understand this their marketing is slightly different . the name might not be much different <unk> but the imagery sure is. <unk> some brands are aspirational. <unk> and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative <unk> . and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing understanding. who 's the audience and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that aren 't even in the country they 're working. <unk> 's people back home people that support their work people like these . but if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv we need to think about the customer . the people whose behavior needs to change. the couples the young women the young men whose lives depend on it and so the lesson is. <unk> this it doesn 't really matter what you 're selling . you just have to think about who is your customer <unk> and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior it might just save their lives <unk> . thank you.
