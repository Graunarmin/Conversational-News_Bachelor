 <unk> we live in difficult and challenging economic times of course <unk> and one of the first. victims of difficult economic times i think is public spending of any kind but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science and particularly. curiosity led science and exploration <unk> . so i want to try and convince you in about fifteen minutes that that 's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do but i think to set the scene. <unk> i want to show the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted but. it is a bit of a mess . but actually it 's not my fault it 's from the guardian newspaper. <unk> beautiful demonstration of how much science costs <unk> because if i 'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity driven science and exploration <unk> i should tell you how much it costs . <unk> so this is a game called spot the science budgets this is the u k government spend you see there it 's about six hundred and twenty billion a year . <unk> 's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs and it 's one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob it 's about three point three billion pounds per year. <unk> out of six hundred and twenty billion that funds everything in the u k from medical research space exploration. so that 's what we 're arguing about that percentage by the way is about the same in the u s and germany and france . r & d in total in the economy <unk> publicly funded is about zero point six percent of gdp <unk> . so that 's what we 're arguing about . the first thing i want to say and this is straight from wonders of the solar system is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful. <unk> this is a picture that actually was sent back by the cassini space probe around saturn after we 'd finished filming wonders of the solar system so it isn 't in the series it 's of the moon enceladus <unk>. <unk> so that big sweeping white sphere in the corner is saturn which is actually in the background of the picture <unk> . <unk> moon <unk> . what 's fascinating and beautiful this an unprocessed picture by the way i should say it 's black and white straight from saturnian orbit what. 's beautiful is you can probably see on the limb there some faint sort of . wisps of almost smoke. rising up from the limb <unk> this is how we visualize that in wonders of the solar system it 's a beautiful graphic. <unk> what we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon. that 's fascinating and beautiful in itself <unk> but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains. requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon <unk> . and what 's important about that is that on our planet <unk> on earth <unk> wherever we find liquid water we find life so to find. <unk> strong evidence of liquid pools of liquid beneath the surface of a moon seven hundred and fifty million miles away from the earth is really. quite astounding <unk> so what we 're saying essentially is maybe that 's a habitat for life in the solar system <unk> . well let me just say that was a graphic i just want to show this picture that 's one more. <unk> this is when cassini flew beneath enceladus so it made a very low pass just a few hundred kilometers above the surface <unk> and so this again a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space absolutely beautiful <unk> . but that 's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system <unk> that 's probably this place <unk> which is a moon of jupiter europa <unk> and again we had to fly to the jovian system to get any <unk>. <unk> sense that this this moon as most moons was anything other than a dead ball of rock it 's actually an ice moon. <unk> what you 're looking at is the the surface of the moon europa which is a thick sheet of ice probably a hundred kilometers thick . but by measuring the way that europa interacts with the magnetic field of jupiter <unk> and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around . we 've inferred very strongly that there 's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of europa <unk> so below the ice. <unk> ocean of liquid around the whole moon <unk> . it could be hundreds of kilometers deep we think <unk> we think it 's saltwater <unk> and that would mean that <unk> there 's more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined <unk> . so that place a little moon around jupiter <unk> is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the earth <unk> that we know of . tremendous. <unk> and beautiful discovery . our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful it may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask which is are we alone in the universe . is there any other use to exploration and science other than just a sense of wonder <unk> well. <unk> when i was about. eight months old it was taken by apollo eight as it went around the back of the moon earthrise from apollo eight a famous picture many people have said that it 's the picture that saved one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight which was a. turbulent year the student riots in paris the height of the. <unk> the reason many people think that about this picture <unk> and al gore has said it many times actually on the stage at ted . is that this picture <unk> arguably was the beginning of the environmental movement <unk> because for the first time we saw our world not as. <unk> a solid immovable kind of indestructible place <unk> but as a very small fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness. <unk> what 's also not often said about the space exploration about the apollo program is the economic contribution it made i mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this . it cost a lot didn 't it <unk> well <unk> actually <unk> many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness the economic impact of apollo . the biggest one was in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five by chase. <unk> and it showed that for every $ one spent on apollo fourteen came back into the u s economy <unk> so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration in engineering <unk>. achievement and i think in inspiring young scientists and engineers fourteen times over . <unk> many observers looked at the light given off from atoms and they saw strange pictures like this . what you 're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn 't just glow like a like a white light it just emits light at particular colors a red one a light blue one some dark blue ones. now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that 's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them and the electrons <unk>. <unk> can only be in particular places <unk> and when they jump up to the next place they can be and fall back down again they emit light at particular colors <unk> and so the fact that atoms when you <unk>. <unk> heat them up only emit light at very specific colors was one of the key drivers that. <unk> led to the development of the quantum theory the theory of the structure of atoms i just wanted to show this picture because this is. remarkable this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun <unk> . and now this is a picture of atoms in the sun 's atmosphere absorbing light <unk> and again they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down jump up and fall down . but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum and the element. <unk> helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element and that 's why helium 's called helium it 's called helios . helios from the sun <unk> . now that sounds esoteric and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit <unk> . but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon for example. the way that silicon behaves the fact that you can build transistors is a purely quantum phenomenon <unk> so without that <unk>. understanding of the structure of atoms which led to this rather esoteric theory quantum mechanics then we wouldn 't have transistors we wouldn 't have silicon chips we wouldn 't have pretty much the basis of our modern. <unk> one more i think wonderful twist to that tale . in wonders of the solar system we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal it 's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature <unk>. <unk> that you get on earth is you can transport it not only to the planets but to the most distant stars and galaxies <unk> . <unk> the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than quite specifically one point four times the mass of the sun <unk> . that 's a limit imposed on the mass of stars you can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory get a telescope swing it to the sky <unk> and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than one point four times the mass of the sun <unk> . <unk> incredible prediction . what happens when you have a star that 's right on the edge of that mass well this is a picture of it <unk> . this is the picture of a galaxy a common our garden galaxy with what one hundred billion stars like our sun in it it 's just one of. billions of galaxies in the universe there are a billion stars in the galactic core <unk> which is why it 's shining out so brightly this is about fifty million light years away <unk> so one of our neighboring. <unk> but that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy. <unk> so that star is also fifty million light years away it 's part of that galaxy <unk> and it 's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with. a billion suns in it that 's a type ia supernova explosion . now that 's an incredible phenomena because it 's a star that sits there it 's called a. <unk> it sits there about say one point three times the mass of the sun <unk> and it has a binary companion that goes around it <unk> so a big star a big ball of gas <unk> and what it does is it sucks gas <unk>. off its companion star until it gets to this limit called the chandrasekhar limit . <unk> but a huge amount of. chemical elements into the universe in fact that one is a carbon oxygen dwarf now there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the big bang . and there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars it was made in stars like that locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions <unk>. <unk> like that in order to recondense into planets stars new solar systems and indeed people like us <unk> . <unk> demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics because we understand that process because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth <unk> . this is a beautiful quote that i found we 're talking about serendipity there from alexander fleming when i woke up just after dawn on september twenty eight one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight i certainly didn 't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world 's first antibiotic. <unk> of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor <unk> and they certainly didn 't intend to. describe the mechanics of supernova explosions which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe <unk> . so i think science can be. serendipity is important it can be. <unk> it can reveal quite astonishing things <unk> it can also <unk> i think finally. reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet <unk> this is a spectacular picture <unk>. of our home planet <unk> now it doesn 't look like our home planet it looks like saturn because of course it is it was taken by the cassini space probe . faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings <unk> and if i blow it up there you see it it looks like a moon <unk> but in fact it 's a picture of earth it was a picture of earth captured <unk>. in that frame of saturn <unk> that 's our planet from seven hundred and fifty million miles away <unk> . <unk> but that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet it was taken by this thing <unk> which is called the voyager spacecraft and that 's a picture of me in front of it for scale the. voyager is a tiny machine <unk> it 's currently ten billion miles away from earth transmitting with that dish with the power of twenty watts and we 're still in contact with it <unk> . but it visited jupiter saturn <unk> uranus and neptune and after it visited all four of those. planets <unk> carl sagan who 's one of my. <unk> my great heroes had the the wonderful idea of turning voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited <unk> . and it took this picture of earth . now it 's very hard to see the earth there it 's called the pale blue dot picture <unk> but earth is suspended in that red shaft of light that 's earth from four billion miles away . and. i 'd like to read you. what sagan wrote about it just to to finish because i cannot say. words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken . he said consider again that dot <unk> that 's here that 's home that 's us . on it <unk> everyone you love <unk> everyone you know <unk> . everyone you 've ever heard of . every human being who ever was lived out their lives <unk> . the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every. <unk> hunter and forager <unk> every hero and coward <unk> every creator and destroyer of civilization . every king and peasant <unk> every young couple in love <unk> every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer <unk> . every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar <unk> every supreme leader every saint and sinner. <unk> in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam it. 's been said that astronomy 's a humbling and character building experience there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world . to me <unk> it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another. and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot <unk> the only home we 've ever. <unk> beautiful words about the power of science and exploration <unk> . the argument has always been made and it will always be made that we know enough about the universe you could have made it in the <unk> 1920s you wouldn 't have had penicillin you could have made it in <unk> the 1890s you wouldn 't have the transistor <unk>. <unk> and it 's made today in these difficult economic times surely we know enough we don 't need to discover anything else about our universe <unk> . <unk> clearly under assault all the time we know enough at the turn of the <unk> 19th century just exploit it just build things . he said this he said nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind. than to presume that our views of science are ultimate that our triumphs are complete that there are no mysteries in nature <unk> and that there are no new worlds to conquer.
