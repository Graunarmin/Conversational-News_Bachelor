 <unk> my favorite topic is. shortcuts <unk> the master of shortcuts it 's of course <unk> nature <unk> but i will demonstrate different ways. <unk> difficulties and go to the point to find an answer probably much quicker than arthur did <unk> so <unk> first. we violate the common sense <unk> the logic all of you if you hold your hand like this <unk> ninety degrees. all of you <unk> not you <unk> all of you <unk> right <unk> palm. <unk> if you do this the common <unk> the logic says you must turn the wrist do you agree <unk> . good <unk> but i will first teach you. a method how you can do it without moving the wrist <unk> and then the shortcut <unk> you can do it immediately <unk> right <unk> . hold the hand like this palm up don 't move the wrist the wrist is i doesn 't speak very many but i do the best what i are. <unk> right molded you say with iron that was a joke actually <unk> and i. ok <unk> . hold the hand palm up do this <unk> don 't move the wrist <unk> over the heart <unk> don 't move the wrist <unk> forward don 't move the wrist . up <unk> don 't move the wrist <unk> over the heart. <unk> you have got to this position from this without moving the wrist now the shortcut . but it was six six moves <unk> now with one move <unk> i start here <unk> palm down you can. <unk> that was the warming up. now i need an assistant i talked to a nice. <unk> and you can sit over there one item here was water <unk> right <unk> and i will give my tribute. to water i think it 's enough with water for me the other guys can talk about. <unk> i will demonstrate different ways of memorizing control cards and so on and. <unk> don 't gamble but so if we are. if we have. <unk> now i will interact so a different person. all the time so not the same person can answer so we have an agreement <unk> . which one shall have a good poker hand which number one two three four or five lennart green three good <unk> and. here <unk> i had a mat here to make it a little the critical moment is. if a card shark gathers the cards together immediately when he. before he deals the card now <unk> . so i think number three i have arranged them in a full house . with queens and it. <unk> i start with three queens <unk> . so here you see the contrast when i treat the cards . and two tens . <unk> also the other hand is good if all the other guys have good hands too so these guys have actually a stronger hand three aces and two kings . this guy beats them with four of a kind or deuce deuce. <unk> i will have the winning hand ten jack queen. <unk> hand that looks so good from the beginning number three <unk> at the end was actually the lowest hand such life <unk> right <unk> . so please. mix them <unk> now <unk> if you are interested i will demonstrate some underground techniques . <unk> the first term is estimation here i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush of course. <unk> count the cards but this is much quicker right you agree <unk> so here i have actually <unk>. i know exactly where the cards are so here i can make a bet <unk> and this is actually one of the points where i get my money <unk> so here. <unk> a term. i do it quick <unk> i call this stealing <unk> . so here <unk> i think i know about where the cards are i will spread the cards and you 'll say stop when i point to them right. ok <unk> . now <unk> another term called shuffle tracking . shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards <unk> . even if another person person shuffles <unk> this is a little risky so because if you look now i can still see. <unk> agree <unk> but if you square square <unk> and shuffle . and then a cut so here <unk> to follow my cards i must look at the shuffle from the. <unk> to calculate but actually i don 't like to calculate <unk> i work direct with the right brain <unk> if you pass the left brain you have to take care of logic and common sense . direct in the right brain that 's much better and so . arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing and. <unk> if you work with in the right atmosphere with humor <unk> you have that 's the password to the. cosmic bank of knowledge where you can find any solution of. any problem <unk> ok <unk> now i drop the cards and you say stop anyway right <unk> not at the last card zoe stop lg . yeah <unk> when i 'm sober i do this much quicker <unk> but we will check. <unk> not in order it that was a mistake no i 'm kidding . no <unk> now and then i put in a mistake just to emphasize how difficult it is right . yeah last night i forgot that that was a mistake but now i 'm glad i remember it so. <unk> this deck is bought here sorry i have a little pad to make it a little softer . this deck is bought here in america it 's called . bicycle and this deck is very flexible but not so many people know <unk> . <unk> at the right spots you see how thin and flexible this deck is right <unk> now you can carry this in your wallet so. <unk> when we will have it back you do this <unk> but not too much <unk> then you. have to push it down again here please if you push these. heaps everyone see push them together so they are really interlaced. and then i will demonstrate a thing from. russian satellite stealen stolen . probably copied from america but we will see . here. shortcuts <unk> i talk about shortcuts. <unk> i go very quick. through the deck and try to find some pattern <unk> . the new chaos theory is already old right <unk> but you know i think you are familiar with. fractals the mandelbrot spirals and all these things <unk> and. it 's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern. <unk> and not concentrate if you concentrate and calculate then you go to. then it 's the left brain but if you just look and talk in another language <unk> . yeah great i think i have it <unk> so now different persons. <unk> all the time when i lift the heap i peek. <unk> seven of diamonds perfect my favorite yeah seven so i will do it quick <unk> very quick <unk> but in slow motion so you can follow. <unk> i think i do it the same way <unk> i like to. so i know where it is <unk> ten of diamonds <unk> but now i do it the regular speed right. <unk> person even if it 's the same spot we can take some over there later <unk> so now i will drop the cards . and you 'll say stop <unk> anywhere got it five of clubs <unk> . not the last yes that 's difficult to find a card here we do it. again the person who said five of clubs say stop <unk> when the cards are in the. <unk> use a little force there <unk> i think we save five of clubs <unk> and now a card with a contrast of five of clubs. <unk> i will do the most difficult thing . for example you are sitting in las vegas <unk> and you 're betting <unk> and you let the other guys peek this card. by mistake <unk> feel it 's just the regular one card <unk> and now when i lift this card <unk> it shall. <unk> queen of hearts <unk> so that 's a tough challenge right <unk> . so here i grab. you know this five of clubs <unk> and queen of hearts <unk> yes this is a tough. one because here i must take. <unk> switch it with the five of clubs <unk> so now a false count which card shall i use queen or five. <unk> time eight nine <unk> ten <unk> this is a kind of optical deal right <unk> . when i put one card at a table look it 's not one card it 's look it 's a bunch of cards that gives this. impression <unk> yeah <unk> . now some hard stuff. <unk> i think we keep the queen here <unk> yes <unk> . now to the satellites things <unk> . this oh sorry <unk> don 't look at the beam my fault. <unk> now <unk> when i deal the cards in the laser . i know where they are but yes <unk> did the camera got it. <unk> do the cameras see the cards now. <unk> back the other one take back the queen. <unk> i have to peek lots of cards <unk> i think there are lots of. i don 't know how many but ten fifteen spades in a deck at least right laughter. so every time i lift the heap i peek right <unk> then i arrange them so i can. get them quick. <unk> so i start with the ace. yeah ace ah yeah spades same mistake as before right <unk> so. i arrange the spades the clubs. <unk> i try to do this right here first i take the spades <unk> you see i don 't work with prestige so always do mistakes . it doesn 't matter to me <unk> and now. <unk> and then i get some extra sympathy points. <unk> and we switch this to the king <unk> ace of diamonds <unk> and now look ace of diamonds will guide <unk> . so i find . <unk> there was the place <unk> and here is king of spades <unk> correct yeah ok . now a little more difficult thing maybe you think i have the cards in order already so you help me to shuffle again <unk> another suit please. <unk> like this guy yeah <unk> . ok <unk> that should be my end effect but ok <unk> armani who said armani . you <unk> i drop the cards and you which size <unk> . which size it 's a piece of cake i like challenges <unk> which size. <unk> this is tough . ok <unk> a suit <unk> i had. <unk> to locate diamonds i look at the cards and ok we try <unk> yeah <unk> you help me <unk> if i drop the card face up . like this you reverse it. <unk> i work with pattern. <unk> why do i put myself in this position . i have to figure out so many outs when i miss some cards but i love it <unk> so now i will do it <unk> i will try to. <unk> find. find the diamonds <unk> but i will do it the hard way <unk> it 's too easy to do it right away right <unk> . i think i will do it <unk> . blindfolded . at this distance it works immediately. <unk> i like the empathy empathy <unk> but it was. <unk> you can take the nostril too because some guys think. <unk> with dignity and elegance right <unk> . but i like her yeah i said be a little. <unk> rely on other senses right . i work with vibration. <unk> start with ace of diamonds <unk> just kidding warming up king of hearts . laughter and i give you a diamonds <unk> so they so you put them here in a nice row right <unk> and you can see. <unk> i never ever miss two <unk> this is interesting always i 've found two <unk> but the wrong color spades sorry. <unk> and the deck is a gift to you after so let the skepticals here in this <unk> examine them <unk> right <unk> remind me it 's a gift. two and it was two of. <unk> two of diamonds <unk> i 'll do it quick now three three of diamonds. <unk> this is maybe a little tough we will try. <unk> you see that in the screen and this is face up <unk> and it 's not at the bottom here so next card will be was it five. <unk> i do this <unk> i know where it is because i peeked before and then. <unk> i love this jonny wayne move.
