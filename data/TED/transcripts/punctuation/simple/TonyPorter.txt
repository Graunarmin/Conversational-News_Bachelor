 <unk> new york city <unk> . between harlem and the bronx . growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no pain. <unk> no emotions with the exception of anger and definitely no fear that men are in charge <unk> which means women are not . that men lead <unk> and you should just follow and do what we say <unk> . that men are superior women are inferior <unk> that men are strong women are weak . that women are of less value <unk> . property of. <unk> i 've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men <unk> better known as. the man box . see this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man <unk> now i also want to say <unk> without a doubt there are some wonderful wonderful <unk> absolutely wonderful things about being a man. <unk> time . there 's some stuff that 's just straight up twisted <unk> . and we really need to begin to challenge <unk> look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing <unk> redefining what we come to know as manhood . this is my two at home kendall and jay <unk> they 're eleven and twelve kendall 's fifteen months older than jay. time when my wife her name is tammie and i we just got real busy and whip bam boom kendall and jay . and when they were about five and six four and five jay could come to me <unk> come to me crying <unk> it didn 't matter what she was crying about <unk>. she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out daddy 's got you that 's all that 's important. <unk> now kendall on the other hand and like i said he 's only fifteen months older than her. he 'd come to me crying it 's like as soon as i would hear him cry a clock would go off. <unk> i would give the boy probably about thirty seconds <unk> which means <unk> by the time he got to me <unk> i was already saying things like why are you crying . hold your head up <unk> look at me <unk> explain to me what 's wrong tell me what 's wrong. <unk> i can 't understand you why are you crying and out of my own frustration. of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box <unk> i would find myself saying things like just go in your room . just go on go on in your room <unk> sit down get yourself together. and. <unk> come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a what like a man <unk> and he 's five years. as i grow in life i would say to myself my god what 's wrong with me what am i doing why would i do this and i think back i. i think back. to my father there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family . my brother henry he died tragically when we were teenagers <unk> we lived in new york city as i said we lived in the bronx at the time and. the burial was in a place called long island it was about two hours outside of the city <unk> . and as we were preparing to come back from the burial the cars stopped at the bathroom. <unk> to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city . and the limousine empties out my mother my sister my auntie they all get out but my father and i stayed in the limousine . and no sooner than the women got out . he burst out crying <unk> . he didn 't want cry in front of me <unk> but he knew he wasn 't going to make it back to the city and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and. <unk> emotions in front of the women <unk> and this is a man who ten minutes ago had just put his teenage son in the ground. something i just can 't even imagine . the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me. for crying in front of me and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me. for not crying. i come to also look at this as this this fear that we have as men this fear that just has us paralyzed holding us hostage. to this man box <unk> i can remember speaking to a 12 year old boy a football player <unk> and i asked him i said how would you feel. if in front of all the players your coach told you. <unk> you were playing like a girl now i expected him to say something like i 'd be sad i 'd be mad i 'd be angry or something like that no the boy said to me. the boy said to me it would destroy me and i said to myself god . if it would destroy him to be called a girl. <unk> it took me back to a time when i was about twelve years old. <unk> i grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city at this time we 're living in the bronx <unk> and in the building next to where i lived there was a guy named johnny <unk> . he was about sixteen years old and we were. <unk> all about twelve years old younger guys <unk> and he was hanging out with all us younger guys <unk> and this guy he was up to a lot of no good he was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder what is this 16 year old boy doing with these 12 year old boys . and he did spend a lot of time up to no good he was a troubled kid <unk> his mother had died from a heroin overdose <unk> he was being raised by his. grandmother his father wasn 't on the set his grandmother had two jobs he was home alone a lot. <unk> tell you we young guys <unk> we looked up to this dude man <unk> he was cool <unk> . he was fine that 's what the sisters said he was fine he was having sex. <unk> we all looked up to him <unk> so one day i 'm out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i don 't know what he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony they called me anthony growing up as a kid hey anthony come on upstairs . <unk> johnny call you go so i run right upstairs . as he opens the door he says to me do you want some . now i immediately knew what he meant <unk> because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you want some meant one of two things sex or drugs. and we weren 't doing drugs now my box <unk> my card <unk> my man box card was immediately in jeopardy. <unk> i never had sex <unk> we don 't talk about that as men you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex for everybody else we go around like we 've been having sex since we were two there ain 't no first time . the other thing i couldn 't tell him is that i didn 't want any that 's even worse we 're supposed to always be on the prowl women are objects <unk> especially sexual objects. anyway so i couldn 't tell him any of that. <unk> mother would say make a long story short i just simply said to johnny yes he told me to go in his room i go in his room on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila <unk> she 's sixteen years old <unk> she 's nude . she 's what i know today to be mentally ill <unk> higher functioning at times than others we had a whole choice of. inappropriate names for. <unk> johnny had just gotten through having sex with her well actually he raped her but he would say he had sex with her <unk> because while sheila never said. no she also never said yes <unk> so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same so when i go in the room i close the door folks i 'm petrified. i stand with my back to the door so johnny can 't bust in the room and see that i 'm not doing anything <unk> and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something <unk> so now i 'm no longer trying to figure out what i 'm going to do i 'm trying to figure out how i 'm going. <unk> get out of this room <unk> so in my twelve years of wisdom <unk> . i zip my pants down <unk> i walk out into the room and lo and behold to me <unk> while i was in the. room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys up so now there 's a living room full of guys it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office and they asked me how. <unk> and i say to them it was good . and i zip my pants up in front of them and i head for the door . now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited <unk> because i didn 't get caught <unk> but i knew i felt bad about what was happening . this fear getting outside the man box <unk> totally enveloped me enveloped me it was way more. <unk> and my man box card. than about sheila and what was happening. to her . see collectively <unk> we as men are taught to have less value in women to view them as property and the objects of men <unk> we see that as an equation that equals violence against women . we as men good men the large majority of men <unk> . we operate on the foundation of this this whole collective socialization we kind of see ourselves separate but we 're very much a part of it you see. we have to come to understand that less value <unk> property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can 't happen without it <unk> so we 're very much a part of the solution <unk>. as well as the problem the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country. <unk> this is the love of my life my daughter jay <unk> . the world i envision for her how do i want men to be acting and behaving <unk> i need you on board <unk> i need you with me <unk> i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men. that it 's okay to not be dominating that it 's okay to have feelings and emotions that. <unk> 's okay to promote equality that it 's okay to have women who are just friends and that 's it that it 's okay to be whole . that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman i remember asking a nine year old boy . i asked a nine year old boy . what would life be like for you if you didn 't have to adhere to this man box he said to me i would be free.
