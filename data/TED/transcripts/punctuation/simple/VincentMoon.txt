 <unk> how can we use computers <unk> cameras <unk> microphones. to represent the world in an alternative way <unk> as much as possible <unk>. <unk> possible to use the internet to create a new form of cinema and actually why do we record well. it is with such simple questions in mind that i started to make films. ten years ago first. with a friend christophe <unk> abric he had a website la blogothque dedicated to independent music we were crazy about music we wanted to. <unk> represent music in a different way . to film the music we love the musicians we admired as much as possible far from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it . we started to publish. every week sessions on the internet <unk> we are going to see a few extracts now. <unk> in the shower to sigur ros playing in a parisian cafe <unk> . from phoenix playing by the eiffel tower. to tom jones in his hotel room in new york <unk> . from arcade fire in an elevator in the olympia to beirut going down. <unk> brooklyn <unk> . from r e m in a car. to the national around a table at night in the south of france . from bon iver playing with some friends in an apartment in montmartre to. <unk> many more. unknown or very famous bands we published all those films for free on the internet <unk> and we wanted to share. all those films and represent music in a different way we wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new. <unk> at the time . ten years ago actually there was no such project on the internet <unk> . and i guess that 's why the project we were making the take away shows got quite successful <unk> reaching. millions of viewers <unk> after a while i got. a bit. i wanted to go somewhere else <unk> i felt the need to travel and to discover some other music <unk> to explore the world . going to other corners <unk> and actually it was also. this idea of. nomadic cinema sort of that i had in mind <unk> how. could the use of new technologies and the road fit together how could i edit my films in a bus crossing the andes . so i went on five year travels around the globe i started at the time in the digital film and music. <unk> was also an homage to french filmmaker chris marker we 're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films. <unk> from experimental electronic music in singapore with one man nation to. brazilian icon tom z singing on his rooftop in so paolo <unk> . from the bambir the great rock band from armenia. to some traditional songs in a restaurant. <unk> in tbilisi <unk> georgia <unk> . from white shoes a great retro pop band from jakarta indonesia. to. <unk> many. other places and musicians around the world <unk> . my desire was to make it as a trek <unk> . to do all those films it would have been impossible with a big company behind me with a structure or anything <unk> i was traveling alone with a backpack. computer <unk> camera microphones in it alone actually but just with local people meeting my team <unk> which was. absolutely not professional people . on the spot there going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek i really believed that cinema could be. this very simple thing <unk> i want to make a film and you 're going to give me a place to stay for the night <unk> i give you a moment of cinema. <unk> had no idea about what i would do there. <unk> three months later <unk> after traveling all around the country i had recorded <unk> thirty three films only with the help. of local people only with the help of people that i was asking all the time the same question what is important to record here. today <unk> by living in such a way by working without any structure. <unk> react. to the moment. and to decide oh this is important to make now this is important to record that whole person <unk> this is important to create this exchange <unk> . when i went to chechnya <unk> the first person i met. looked at me and was like . <unk> what kind of problems are you going to study well <unk> i was there to research on sufi rituals in chechnya actually. incredible culture of sufism in chechnya <unk> which is absolutely unknown outside of the region . as soon as people understood that i would give them those films i would publish them online for free under a creative commons license. <unk> would also really give them to the people and i would let them do what they want with it i just want to represent them in a beautiful light i just want to portray them in a way that. their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather. <unk> that 's the way. people are going to look differently at their own culture at their own land they 're going to think about it differently it may be a way to maintain a certain diversity. <unk> is a tombstone of a live performance it 's a really good sentence to keep in mind. nowadays in an era saturated by images <unk> what 's the point of that where do we go with it <unk> . i was researching i was still. keeping this idea in mind <unk> what 's the point. <unk> was researching on music trying to pull <unk> trying to get closer to a certain origin of it where is this all coming from i am french <unk> i had no idea. about what i would discover which is a very simple thing <unk> . everything was sacred at first and music was spiritual healing <unk> . how could i use my camera <unk> . my little tool to get closer. and maybe. not only capture the trance but find an equivalent a <unk>. maybe <unk> something. in complete harmony. with the people. that is now my my new research i 'm doing on spirituality on new spirits around the world. maybe a few more extracts now. from the tana toraja funeral ritual in indonesia. <unk> the sufi rituals of chechnya. to a mass in the holiest church of armenia. <unk> some sufi songs in harar the holy city of ethiopia <unk>. to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the amazon of peru with the shipibo then. to my new project the one i 'm doing now here in brazil. on the new <unk> spiritualities all around the country this is my quest my own little quest of what i call experimental ethnography <unk>. trying to to hybrid all those different genres <unk> trying to regain a certain. <unk> why do we record i was still there <unk> i really believe cinema teaches us to see . the way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world . and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible terrible job at representing the world. events only simplifications of everyday life i think we are recording to regain a certain complexity <unk> . to reinvent. <unk> you show up in places like the ones you just have shown us and you are carrying a camera and i assume that. you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome you walk into sacred rituals private moments in a. village a town a group of people <unk> how do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens. <unk> that 's what it taught me to travel <unk> to trust. the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain the respect is stepping forward not stepping backward and i really think that. by engaging your body in the moment in the ceremony in the places people welcome you and understand your energy bg you told me that most of the videos you have. made are actually one single shot. <unk> don 't do much editing i mean you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length etc <unk> otherwise you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning and so is that the case it. 's correct . vm my idea is that i think that as long as we. don 't cut in a way as long. <unk> going to. get closer to the moment <unk> . to that moment and to that place i really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer <unk> to not cut. all the time. from one place to another to just let the time go bg tell me in a few words about your new project hbridos here in brazil. <unk> just before coming to tedglobal you have actually been traveling around the country for that . tell us a couple of things vm hbridos is i really believe brazil <unk> far from the cliches is the greatest religious country in the world the greatest. country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities and it 's a. big project i 'm doing over this year <unk> which is researching in very different. <unk> regions of brazil <unk> in very different forms of cults and trying to understand how people live together with spirituality nowadays bg the man who is going to appear onstage. momentarily and vincent 's going to introduce him <unk> is one of the subjects of one of his past. videos <unk> when did you do a video with him vm i guess four years ago. <unk> four years <unk> in my first travel bg so it was one of your first ones in brazil vm it was amongst the first ones in brazil. from bg so let 's introduce him <unk> who are we waiting for vm i 'll just make it very short it 's a very. great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest brazilian musicians of all time please welcome nan vasconcelos. <unk> would. <unk> was. the. the. the. <unk> correct. i. the. <unk> in a. way. the. the. the.
