 <unk> what i want to talk about is as background is the idea that cars are art this is actually quite meaningful to. to me because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole we don 't do coffee. coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it and cars are thought so much as a product that it 's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side. under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art <unk> and so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane if you accept that. that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital <unk> a now at this point you 're going to see a picture of michelangelo <unk> this is completely. <unk> and they 're not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for one hundred years and have made our lives functionally. a lot better in many ways <unk> they 've also been a real pain in the ass <unk> . because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve we have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion. but that 's not what interests me in this speech what interests me in this speech is. <unk> cars <unk> automobiles may be what you use <unk> but cars are what we are in many ways <unk> and. as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and i believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like bmw is really hip on . and lots of other things then i think we can look past that and try and understand why. <unk> hook is in many of us. of this car y ness and what that means what we can learn from it that 's what i want to get to . cars are not a suit of clothes cars are an avatar cars are an expansion. of yourself they. take your thoughts your ideas your emotions and they multiply it your anger whatever <unk> it 's an avatar <unk> it 's a super waldo that you happen to be inside of and if you feel sexy the car is sexy <unk> and if you 're full of road. <unk> you 've got a chevy like a rock right cars are a sculpture. did you know this that every car you see out there is sculpted by hand . many people think well it 's computers and it 's done by machines and stuff like that well they reproduce it <unk> but the originals are all done by hand it 's done by by men and women. who believe a lot in their craft <unk> . and they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum that tension between. the need to express. <unk> to discover <unk> then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship . rules that say <unk> this is how you handle surfaces <unk> this is what control is all about this is how you show you 're a master of your craft <unk> . and that tension that discovery that push for something new and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship. that 's as strong in cars as it is in anything we work in clay <unk> which hasn 't changed much since. <unk> michelangelo started screwing around with it and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too real quickly. michelangelo once said he 's there to discover the figure within ok <unk> . there we go the automobile that was one hundred years right there did you catch that . between that one there <unk> and that one there it changed a lot didn 't it ok it. 's not marketing there 's a very interesting car concept here <unk> but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here i want to talk about this. <unk> why it means you have to wash a car what is it that sensuality you have to touch about it <unk> <unk> that 's the sculpture that goes into it that sensuality <unk> and it 's done by men <unk>. <unk> and women working just like this <unk> making cars <unk> now this little quote about sculpture from henry moore . comes right back to this idea of the mean <unk> it 's that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me <unk> and we tell other people do this do this do this until this thing comes alive <unk> we are completely infected . and beauty. can be the result of this infectiousness it 's quite wonderful . this sculpture is of course at the heart of all of it and it 's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars and it. 's not a whole lot different really when they 're working like this or when somebody works like this. it 's that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty now now i get to the point i. want to talk about cars as art art in the platonic sense is truth <unk> it 's beauty and love <unk> now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers <unk> . we don 't really have a problem talking about love <unk> we don 't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense that 's what we 're searching for when we 're working our craft <unk> we are really trying to find that truth out there. <unk> not trying to find vanity and beauty we 're trying to find the beauty in the truth <unk> however engineers tend to look at things a little bit more. newtonian <unk> instead of this quantum approach we 're dealing with irrationalisms and we 're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four and if you get four point zero it 's better and four point zero is even better. <unk> and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence. in why we 're doing what we 're doing we 've pretty much accepted the fact though that we are the women in the organization at bmw bmw is a very manly type business <unk> men men men it 's engineers. <unk> and we 're kind of the female side to that that 's ok that 's cool you go off and be manly we 're going to be a little bit more female . because what we 're interested in. is finding form that 's more than just a. <unk> we 're interested in finding beauty that 's more than just an aesthetic it 's really a truth <unk> and i think this idea of soul as being at the heart of great cars . is very applicable you all know it <unk> you know a car when you 've seen it with soul <unk> you know how strong this is <unk> . well this experience of love and the experience of design to me are interchangeable and now i 'm coming to my story <unk> . i discovered something about love. and design. through a project called deep blue <unk> and first of all you have to go with me for a second <unk> and say. you know you could take the word love out of a lot of things in our society put the word design in and it still works like this quote here you know it. kind of works you know <unk> you can understand that it works in truisms all is fair in design and war . certainly we live in a competitive society <unk> i think this one here there 's a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me <unk> . you know <unk> this is like you know this is like puppy love you know this is cool right. it really only gets serious when you look at something like this ok . this is one substitution that i believe all of us in design management are guilty of . and this idea that there is more to love <unk> more to design when it gets down to your neighbor your. <unk> it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be but right now it 's in dealing with our own people our own teams who are doing the creating so to my story <unk>. the idea of. people work is what we work with here <unk> and i have to make a bond with my designers when we 're creating bmws <unk> . we have to have a shared intimacy a shared vision that means we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way there 's good times there 's interesting times . and there 's some stress times too you want to do cars you 've got to go outside. you 've got to do cars in the rain <unk> you 've got to do cars in the snow. <unk> that 's by the way is a presentation we made to our board of directors we haul their butts out in the snow too you want to know cars outside . well you 've got to stand outside to do this and because these are artists . they have very artistic temperaments all. now one thing about art is art is discovery <unk> and art is discovering yourself through your art. <unk> one thing about cars is we 're all a little bit like pygmalion <unk> we are completely in love with our own creations this is one of my favorite paintings. it really describes our relationship with cars this is sick beyond belief but. because of this <unk> the intimacy with which we work together as a team. takes on a new dimension a new meaning <unk> we have a shared center. <unk> we have a shared focus. that car stays at the middle of all our relationships <unk> and it 's my job in the competitive process to narrow this down i. heard today about about joseph 's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction . you know that 's what i have to do sometimes . we start out with ten cars we narrow it down to five cars down to. <unk> cars down to two cars down to one car <unk> and i 'm in the middle of that. killing basically <unk> someone 's love <unk> someone 's baby <unk> this is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team. that permits you to do this <unk> because their life is wrapped up in that too <unk> they 've got that gene infected in them as well <unk> and they want that to live more than. <unk> this project deep blue <unk> . put me in contact with my team in a way that i never expected and i want to pass it on to you because i want you to reflect on this <unk> perhaps in your own relationships <unk> we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap <unk>. <unk> of faith for bmw <unk> we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it that i only had a phone number that connected me to them <unk>. staff of artists that are just your wrist we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers. to find out what 's the successor to the suv phenomenon in america <unk> this is one thousand nine hundred and ninety six we did this project and so we sent them off. with this team name deep blue <unk> now many people know deep blue from ibm we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they 'd think we 're talking about computers it. turned out it was quite clever because. <unk> so people get wrapped up in it <unk> and we took a team of designers and we sent them off to america <unk> . and we gave them a budget what we thought was a set of deliverables a timetable and nothing else <unk> like i said i just had a phone number that connected me to them and a group of engineers. worked in germany <unk> and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what 's the successor to the suv they would come together compare. <unk> then they would work apart <unk> come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn 't pollute each other 's ideas but at the same time came together and resolved the problems . hopefully really understand the customer at its heart where the customer is live with them in america <unk> so. sent the team off and actually something different happened <unk> they went other places. <unk> all i got was postcards . now i got some postcards of these guys in las vegas and i got some postcards of these guys in the grand canyon and i got these postcards of niagara falls <unk> and pretty soon they 're in new york and i don 't know where else <unk> . and i 'm telling myself this is going to be a great car they 're doing research that i. <unk> six or seven apartments it was cheaper to rent elizabeth taylor 's ex house in malibu <unk> and. at least they told me it was her house i guess it was at one time she had a party there or something but anyway <unk> . <unk> who 'd left their some had left their wives behind and families behind . and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in america but the first three months were the most intensive <unk> . and one of the young women in the project she was a fantastic lady. <unk> she actually built her room in the bathroom the bathroom was so big <unk> she built the bed over the bathtub. it 's quite fascinating. on the other hand i didn 't know anything about this <unk> . ok <unk> nothing <unk> this is all going on <unk> and all i 'm getting is postcards of these guys in las vegas or whatever saying don 't worry chris this is really going to be good ok <unk> . so my concept of what a design studio was probably i wasn 't up to speed on where these guys were. <unk> however the engineers back in in munich had taken on this kind of newtonian solution. and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin and you know . these really serious questions that that are confronting the modern consumer <unk> and one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings . and these incredibly stressed out engineers would create some. <unk> i didn 't know was and what we found out was these guys they can 't even like talk to each other. under those conditions you get a divergence of newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split. in your dialog that is so deep and so far <unk> that they cannot bring this together at all and. so we had our first meeting <unk> after three months in tiburon which is just up the road from here you know tiburon <unk> . and the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to dr goschel who is now my boss and at that time he was co mentor on the project. and they would present their results <unk> we would see where we were going we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america <unk>. <unk> and so i had these ideas in my head that this is going to be great i mean i 'm going to see so much work it 's so intense i know. <unk> probably las vegas meant a lot about it . and i 'm not really sure where the grand canyon came in either but somehow all this is going to come together and i 'm going to see some really great product <unk> so we went to tiburon <unk> after three months . and the team had gotten together the week before. <unk> many days ahead of time the engineers flew over and designers got together. <unk> it turns out that. the engineers hadn 't done anything <unk> and they hadn 't done anything because. kind of like in car business engineers are there to solve problems <unk> and we were asking them to create a problem . and the engineers were waiting for the designers to say this is the problem that we 've created <unk> now help us solve it. <unk> 't talk about it <unk> so what happened was the engineers showed up with nothing <unk> . and the engineers told the designers if you go in with all your stuff we 'll walk out we. 'll walk right out of the project . so i didn 't know any of this <unk> and we got a presentation that had an agenda looked like this there was a whole lot of. <unk> we spent four hours. being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers . and here i 'm expecting at any moment ok they 're going to turn the page and i 'm going to see the cars i 'm going to see the sketches i 'm going to see maybe some idea of where it 's going . dialog kept on going with mental maps of words <unk> . and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance i was seriously being baffled with bullshit <unk> . and if you can imagine. <unk> what this is like to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working and they 're out there spending all this money and they 're learning and they 're doing all this stuff. <unk> i went fucking ballistic right i went. nuts you can probably remember tiburon it used to look like this. <unk> after four hours of this <unk> i stood up and i took this team apart <unk> i screamed at them <unk> i yelled at them what the hell are you doing . you 're letting me down you 're my designers <unk> you 're supposed to be the creative ones what the hell is going on around here . it was probably one of my better tirades i have some good ones but this was probably one of my better ones . and i went into these people how could they take bmw 's money how could they. <unk> because of course they didn 't tell us that they had. three station wagons full of drawings <unk> model concepts pictures everything i wanted they 'd locked up in the cars <unk> . because they had shown solidarity with the engineers. and they 'd decided not to show me anything in order to give the. <unk> chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadn 't realized of course that. they couldn 't do problem creating <unk> so we went to lunch . and. i 've got to tell you this was one seriously quiet lunch <unk> the engineers all sat at one end of the table the. designers and i sat at the other end of the table <unk> . really quiet. you know that 's what you get furious about right <unk> and somebody asked me about catherine my wife <unk> you know <unk> did she fly out with me or something i said no . and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife <unk> and. i recalled that when catherine and i were married <unk> the priest gave a very nice sermon <unk> and he said something very important <unk> he said love. <unk> does not mean counting how many times i say ' i love you ' it doesn 't mean. you had sex this many times this month and it 's two times less than last month <unk> so that means you don 't love me as much love is not selfish . and i thought about this <unk> and i thought you know. <unk> i 'm not showing love here . i 'm seriously. <unk> i 'm in the air <unk> i 'm in the air without trust <unk> this cannot be <unk> . this cannot be that i 'm expecting a certain number of sketches <unk> . and to me that 's my quantification method for qualifying a team this cannot be . so i told them this story <unk> i said guys <unk> i 'm thinking about something here <unk> this isn 't right <unk> . i can 't have a relationship with you guys. <unk> we all broke down into tears to be quite honest about it <unk> because. they still could not tell me. how much frustration they had built up inside of them not being able to show me what i wanted and merely having to ask me to trust. that it would come <unk> . and i think we felt much closer that day we cut a lot of strings that didn 't need to be there <unk> . and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about . we put the car back at the center of our of our thoughts <unk> and we put love <unk> . i think <unk> truly back into the. center of the process <unk> by the way that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation. after suvs in america one of those. was. the idea of a crossover coupes you see it downstairs <unk> the x coupe they. had a lot of fun with that it was the rendition of our motorcycle the gs as carl magnusson. <unk> as the idea of what could be a motorcycle <unk> if you add two more wheels <unk> . and so <unk> in conclusion my lesson that i wanted to pass on to you was this one here i 'm also going to steal a little quote out of little prince there 's a lot to be said about trust. and love <unk> if you know that those two words are synonymous for design . i had a very very meaningful relationship with my team that day <unk> and it 's stayed that way ever since <unk> and i hope that. that you too find that there 's more to design. <unk> design and more towards the art of the design than doing it yourself it 's true that the trust and the love <unk> that makes it worthwhile <unk> thanks so much.
