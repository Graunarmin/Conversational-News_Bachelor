 <unk> i used to be a malthusian this was my mental model of the world <unk> . exploding population small planet it 's going to lead to ugly things <unk> . but i 'm moving past malthus <unk> because i think that we just might be about one hundred and fifty years from a kind of new enlightenment. <unk> here 's why . this is the u n ' s population data you may have seen . for the world <unk> and the world 's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than ten billion <unk> late this century and after that most likely it 's going to begin to decline . so what then <unk> . most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth <unk> so a lot of economists. <unk> look at declining population and expect to see stagnation <unk> maybe depression <unk> . but a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects . one <unk> fewer people on a fixed amount of land. make investing in property a bad bet. <unk> in the cities a lot of the. cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value <unk> . take away land speculation <unk> price of land drops <unk> and that begins to lift a heavy burden. off the world 's poor number two a declining population. means scarce labor scarce labor drives wages as wages increase that also lifts the burden. <unk> on the poor and the working class <unk> now i 'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the black death <unk> but look what happened in europe. after the plague <unk> rising wages land reform <unk> . technological innovation <unk> birth of the middle class <unk> . <unk> social movements. like the renaissance <unk> and later the enlightenment . most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward romanticizing the past <unk> all of the western religions begin. with the notion of eden <unk> and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future <unk> . so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide. from the good old days. but i think we 're in for another change about two generations after the top of that curve <unk> . once the effects of a declining population start to settle in . at that point we 'll start romanticizing the future again instead of the nasty brutish past . so why does this matter why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away. transitions are dangerous times <unk> . when land owners start to lose money and labor demands more pay <unk> there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future . fear for the future. leads to some rash decisions <unk> if we have a positive view about the future. then we may be able. <unk> to accelerate through that turn instead of careening off a cliff.
