 <unk> for years i 've been feeling frustrated because as a religious historian i 've become acutely aware. of the centrality of compassion in all the. <unk> major world faiths every single one of them has evolved their own version of what 's been called the golden rule . sometimes it comes in a positive version always treat all others as you 'd like to be treated yourself and equally important. is the negative version don 't do to others what you would not like them to do to you . look into your own heart <unk> discover what it is that gives you. <unk> pain. and then refuse under any circumstance whatsoever to inflict that pain on anybody else and. people have. emphasized the importance of compassion not just because it sounds good but because it works . people have found that when they have. implemented the golden rule as confucius. <unk> said all day and every day . not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism. <unk> but to do it all day and every day you dethrone yourself from the center of your world put another there and you transcend yourself. and it brings you into the presence of what 's been called god. <unk> nirvana rama <unk> tao <unk> something that goes beyond. what we know in our ego bound existence <unk> . but you know you 'd never know it a lot of the time that this was so central to the religious life because with a few wonderful exceptions very often when religious <unk>. <unk> people come together religious leaders come together they 're arguing about abstruse doctrines. or uttering a council of hatred. or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort . often people don 't really want to be compassionate . i sometimes see when i 'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead. <unk> and that of course defeats the object of the exercise now why was i so grateful to ted . because they took me very gently. from my <unk> book lined study. and brought me into the 21st century enabling me to speak to a much much wider audience than i could have ever conceived because i feel. <unk> an urgency about this if we don 't manage to implement the golden rule. globally . so that we treat all peoples <unk> wherever and whoever they may be as though they were as important as ourselves <unk> . i doubt that we 'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation the task of our time one of the great tasks. <unk> of our time is to build a global society as i said where people can live together in peace and the religions. that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem <unk> and of course. it 's not just religious people who believe in the golden. <unk> this is the source of all morality this imaginative act of empathy putting yourself in the place of another <unk> . and so we have a choice it seems to me we can either go on. bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith or we can. go back to the rabbis <unk> rabbi hillel. <unk> older contemporary of jesus who when asked by a pagan. to. sum up the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on one leg said that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor . that is the torah and everything else is only commentary . and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture. <unk> that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate and we need to revive that spirit <unk> and it 's not just going to happen. because a spirit of love wafts us down we have to make this happen <unk> and we can do it. with the modern communications that ted has introduced. <unk> i 've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners in singapore . we have a group going to use the charter to heal divisions recently. that have sprung up in singaporean society <unk> and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically <unk> in. <unk> there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to to be taking. people <unk> young people and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art. throughout europe the muslim communities are holding events and discussions are. discussing the centrality of compassion in islam and in all faiths <unk> . but it can 't stop there it can 't stop with the launch. <unk> launch religious teaching this is where we 've gone so wrong concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines . religious teaching must always lead to action <unk> . and. i intend to work on this till my dying day and. i want to continue with our. <unk> we 've so. dropped out of compassion people often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody <unk> but of course you don 't understand compassion. if you 're just going to think about it you also have to do it i want them to get the media involved because the media are. <unk> crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people which are dividing us from one another . the same applies. to educators i 'd like youth to get. a sense of the dynamism the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate. <unk> and also see that it demands acute intelligence not just a gooey feeling i 'd like to call upon scholars to explore. the compassionate. theme in their own and in other people 's traditions and perhaps above all to encourage a sensitivity. about uncompassionate speaking so that because people have this charter. lack of them they feel empowered to challenge. uncompassionate speech <unk> disdainful remarks from their religious leaders their political leaders from the captains of industry. because we can change the world we have the ability. <unk> i would never have thought of putting the charter online i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of. <unk> boffins sitting together in a room. and issuing yet another arcane statement . and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas because that is what is so wonderful about ted in this room . all this expertise. <unk> if we joined it all together we could change the world <unk> and of course the problems. <unk> sometimes seem insuperable but i 'd just like to quote <unk> finish at the end with a reference to. a british author an oxford author whom i don 't quote very often c s lewis. but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since i read it when i was a schoolgirl it 's in his book the four loves. <unk> distinguished between erotic love when two people gaze spellbound into each other 's eyes. and then he compared that to friendship . when two people stand side by side as it were shoulder to shoulder with their eyes fixed on a common goal. <unk> side by side.
