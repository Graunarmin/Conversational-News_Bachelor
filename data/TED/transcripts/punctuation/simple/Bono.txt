 <unk> alexander graham bell famously said on his first successful telephone call hello is that domino 's pizza. <unk> another famous man jerry garcia said what a strange <unk> long trip and he. should have said what a strange long trip it 's about to become at this very moment <unk> you are viewing my upper half. <unk> my lower half is appearing at a different conference. <unk> turns out be in two places at once but still i 'm sorry i can 't be with you in person i 'll explain at another. time and though i 'm a rock star i just want to assure you that none of my wishes. will include a hot tub <unk> but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on. this revolution is much bigger than that i hope i believe what turns me on. about the digital age what excites me personally is that you have closed the gap. between dreaming. and doing you see it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song <unk> you needed a studio and a producer. <unk> you need a laptop <unk> <unk> if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of. mass of equipment and a hollywood budget <unk> now <unk> you need a camera that fits in your palm . and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination. has been decoupled from the old constraints <unk> and that really really excites me. <unk> i 'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking. writ large what i would like to see is idealism decoupled. idealism. decoupled from all constraints political economic. psychological whatever <unk> the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world <unk> from the ease. with which you swept away obstacles. <unk> that no one knew could even be budged <unk> and that 's actually what i 'd like to talk about today . first though i should probably explain why <unk> and how i got to this place <unk> . it 's a journey that started. <unk> do they know it 's christmas . band aid live aid . another very tall . grizzled rock star my friend sir bob geldof issued a challenge to feed the world . it was a great moment <unk> and it utterly changed my life . <unk> and myself went to ethiopia. <unk> we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on we lived in ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage . the children had a name for me they called me the girl with the beard. <unk> continent beautiful royal people <unk> anybody who ever gave anything. to africa got a lot more back ethiopia didn 't just. blow my mind <unk> it opened my mind <unk> anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his. <unk> would you take. my son with you <unk> he knew in ireland <unk> that his son would live <unk> . and that in ethiopia his son would die <unk> it was the middle of that awful famine . well <unk> i turned him down <unk> and. <unk> a funny kind of sick feeling <unk> but i turned him down and it 's a feeling i can 't ever quite forget . and in that moment <unk> i started this journey . in that moment <unk> i became. the worst thing of all i became a rock star with a cause . laughter except this isn 't the cause <unk> is it. <unk> thousand africans dying every single day from aids a preventable treatable disease. for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy that. 's not a cause <unk>. that 's an emergency <unk> eleven million aids orphans in africa twenty million by the end of the decade that 's not a cause that. 's an emergency <unk> today every day nine thousand more africans will catch hiv because of. <unk> stigmatization and lack of education <unk> that 's not a cause that 's an emergency <unk> . so what we 're talking about here is. human rights <unk> the right to live like a human . the right to live period and what we 're facing in africa is. an unprecedented threat to human dignity. <unk> equality <unk> the next thing i 'd like to be clear about is what this problem is <unk> . and what this problem isn 't because this is not all about charity <unk> . this is about justice really this is not about charity <unk> this is about justice . <unk> and that 's too bad because. we 're very good at charity <unk> . americans like irish people are good at it <unk> . even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami. it 's inspiring <unk> but justice. is a tougher standard than charity <unk> you see . <unk> africa makes a fool of our idea of justice <unk> it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern . it questions our commitment . because there is no way. we can look at what 's happening in africa and if we 're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else . as you heard in the film <unk> anywhere else not here <unk> . not here <unk> not in america <unk> not in europe . in fact. <unk> a head of state. that you 're all familiar with. admitted this to me and it 's really true there is no chance. this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa <unk> africa is a continent. <unk> and deep down if we really accepted that africans were equal to us <unk> we would all do more to put the fire out we 're standing around with watering cans when. what we really need is the fire brigade <unk> you see it 's not as dramatic. as the tsunami . it 's crazy really when you think about it does stuff have to look like an action movie these days. to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing. countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear <unk> catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones. we could avert funny that anyway i believe. that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual. <unk> people dying a day in africa. may be africa 's crisis but the fact that it 's not on the nightly news that we in europe or you in america are not treating it like an emergency. i want to argue with you tonight that that 's our crisis <unk> i want to argue that though africa is not the front line. in the war against terror <unk> it could be soon every week. <unk> extremists take another african village they 're attempting to bring order to chaos well why aren. poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence we know this in turbulent times <unk> isn 't it cheaper. <unk> and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later . the war against. terror is bound up. in the war against poverty . and i didn 't say that . colin powell said that . now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen. there 's an opportunity here. <unk> and it 's real it 's not spin it 's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world. a chance to re describe ourselves. to the world <unk> . we will not only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart. in these nervous dangerous times <unk> don 't you think that on a purely commercial level. <unk> drugs are great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology doesn 't compassion look well on us <unk> and let 's cut the. the crap for a for a second in certain quarters of the world <unk> brand eu brand usa . is not at its shiniest <unk> . the neon sign is fizzing and cracking. someone 's put a brick through the window <unk> the regional branch managers are getting nervous <unk> never before. have we in the west been so scrutinized our values do we have any our credibility . these things are under attack around the world <unk> brand usa. could use some polishing and i say that as a fan you know. as a person who buys the products <unk> but think about it <unk> more. make sense but that 's just the easy part <unk> or ought to be but equality for africa. that 's a big expensive idea <unk> . <unk> the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth. can we all do about this . well much more than we think we can 't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must <unk> and because we can . we must . this is the straight. truth <unk> the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation. that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye . look across the ocean to africa <unk> and say this and mean it <unk> . we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this. <unk> let me say this without a trace of irony. before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies forget the ' 60s . we can change the world <unk> i can 't you can 't as individuals <unk> but we. <unk> change the world <unk> i really believe that the people in this room look at the gates foundation they 've done incredible stuff <unk> unbelievable stuff <unk> but working together . we can actually change the world <unk> we can turn. the inevitable outcomes <unk> and transform. the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us. <unk> i 'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in <unk>. but i want to argue that this is the moment. that you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier <unk> headier. <unk> ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room. was born for this moment is really what i want to say to you tonight <unk> most of you started out wanting to change the world didn 't you . most of you did the digital world <unk> well now actually because of you it is possible to change the. <unk> they know much more than i do so. why then are we not pumping our fists. into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we 've got to do something about. it it is a pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse. <unk> but for the first time in history <unk> we have the technology <unk> we have the know how we have the cash <unk> we have the life saving drugs . do we have the will i hope this is obvious <unk> but i. 'm not a hippie <unk> and. i 'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling <unk> i do not have flowers in my hair. <unk> actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not sandals. <unk> but i know toughness when i see it . and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle. to the movement that started out here <unk> you see idealism detached from action is. <unk> just a dream <unk> but idealism. allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit . is very exciting it 's very real it 's very strong <unk> and it 's very present. in a crowd like you . last year at data <unk> this organization i helped set up. <unk> we launched a campaign to summon this spirit. in the fight against aids and extreme poverty we 're calling it the one campaign <unk> it 's based on our belief. that the action of one person can change a lot <unk> but the actions of many coming together as one can change. <unk> we feel that now is the time. to prove we 're right there are moments in history. when civilization redefines itself <unk> we believe this is one <unk> we believe that this could be the time. when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer acceptable . this could be the time that we finally get serious. about changing the future. <unk> for most people. who live. on planet earth momentum has been building <unk> . lurching a little but it 's building <unk> this year is a test for us all especially the. the leaders of the g8 nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching . i have been of late disappointed with the bush. <unk> administration. they started out with such promise on africa <unk> they made some really great promises . and actually have fulfilled a lot of them but some of them. they haven 't they don 't feel the push from the ground is the truth . but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american. <unk> people and i hear their worries about the deficit and the fiscal well being of their country i understand that <unk> but there 's much more push from the ground. than you 'd think if we got organized what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that. aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it. <unk> it in the in the crassest possible terms <unk> . the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but. in goodwill stability and security. that we 'll gain . so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold <unk> and not have it deducted from my. <unk> my number of wishes <unk> what i hope. is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians. to do right by africa <unk> . by america and by the world <unk> give them permission <unk> if you like to spend their political capital and your financial capital. <unk> national purse on saving the lives of millions of people that 's really what what i would like you to do because. we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity . and you at this conference are in a unique position some of the. <unk> we 've been talking about you invented them or at least revolutionized the way that they 're used . together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital . and pushed. pushed the boundaries and we 'd like you to. give us that energy give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing <unk> as i say there 're two things on the line here there 's the. <unk> but there 's also our sense of ourselves . people are starting to figure this out movements are springing up <unk> artists politicians pop stars priests <unk> ceos <unk> ngos mothers ' unions student unions . a lot of people are getting together and working. under this umbrella i told you about earlier the one campaign. <unk> i think they just have one idea. in their mind which is where you live in the world. should not determine whether you live in the world history . like god is watching what we do when the history books. <unk> i think our age will be remembered for three things really it 's just three things. this whole age will be remembered for the digital revolution <unk> yes <unk> the war against terror <unk> yes <unk> . and what we did. or did not do to put out the fires in africa <unk> some say we can 't afford to . <unk> the ones that ted has offered to grant <unk> . you see if this is true and i believe it is. <unk> the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination. from the physical constraints of matter <unk> this should be a piece of piss . laughter i should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes <unk> most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them. <unk> when somebody else is picking up the tab <unk> anyway here 's number one <unk> i. wish for you to help. build a social movement of more than one million american activists for africa. is my first wish i believe it 's possible a few minutes ago i talked about. all the citizens <unk> ' campaigns that are springing up . you know there 's lots out there and with this one campaign as our umbrella my organization data and other groups have been tapping into the energy and. and the enthusiasm that 's out there from hollywood into the heartland of america. we know there 's more than enough energy to power this movement we just need your help. in making it happen <unk> . we want all of you here church america corporate america microsoft america apple america coke america pepsi america nerd america noisy america <unk> . we can 't afford to be cool. and sit this one out i do believe if we build a movement. that 's one million americans. <unk>
