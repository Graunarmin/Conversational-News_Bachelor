 <unk> sure whether. i really want to see a snare drum at nine o 'clock or so in the morning laughter. anyway it 's just great to see such a full theater <unk> and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation. interesting things of course is the combination of. that raw hand on the instrument and. technology <unk> and what he said about listening to our young people of course my job is all about. <unk> is to teach the world to listen <unk> that 's my only real aim in life . and it sounds quite simple but actually it 's quite a big . big job because you know . when you look at a piece of music for example if i just open my little. <unk> motorbike bag. we have here hopefully a piece of music. that is full of little black dots on the page and you know . we open it up <unk> . and i read the music <unk> so. technically i can actually read this i will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics. i will do exactly as i 'm told. and so therefore because time is short <unk> if i just played you literally the first maybe . two lines or so it. 's very straightforward there 's nothing too difficult about the piece but here i 'm being told that the piece of music is very quick . i 'm being told where to. <unk> play on the drum i 'm being told which part of the stick to use <unk> . and i 'm being told the dynamic <unk> . and i 'm also being told that the drum is without snares snares on <unk> snares off <unk> so therefore. <unk> if i. translate. <unk> and so on my career would probably last about five years however <unk> what i have to do as a musician. is do everything that is not on the music <unk> everything that that there isn 't time to learn from a teacher. <unk> to talk about <unk> even from a teacher <unk> but it 's the things you notice when you 're not actually with your instrument. that in fact become so interesting <unk> and that you you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface of a drum <unk> . so there we experience the translation. <unk> the interpretation. <unk> if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on i see that you 're clutching a teddy bear etc etc <unk> so i get a basic idea as to. what you might be about what you might like what you might do as a profession. <unk> etc etc however <unk> that 's just the initial initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look. and we try to interpret but actually it 's so unbelievably shallow in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what technically might be hard or . you know what i want to do just the basic feeling. <unk> enough and i think what herbie said <unk> please listen . listen <unk> we have to listen to ourselves first of all if i play for example. <unk> holding the stick where literally i do not let go of the stick drum. sound you 'll experience quite a lot of shock. <unk> coming up through the arm and you feel really quite believe it or not detached from the instrument and from the stick stick <unk> even though i 'm actually holding the stick quite tightly . by holding it tightly i feel strangely more detached <unk> . if i just simply let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system suddenly. much more . and i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum <unk> and i 'm doing far far less so in the same way that <unk> i need time with. this instrument i need time with people in order to interpret them not just translate. <unk> but interpret them if for example <unk> i play just a few bars of a piece of music. for which i think of myself as a technician that is someone who is basically a percussion player. <unk> and so on if i think of myself as a musician. <unk> is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just thinking. about and i remember. when i was twelve years old and i started playing timpani and percussion <unk> and. my teacher. <unk> how are we going to do this you know music. is about. listening . and i said yes i agree with that so what 's the problem . and he said well <unk> how are you going to hear this how are you going to hear that and i said well how do you hear it he said . well i think i hear it through here and i said well i think i do too <unk> but i also hear it. through my hands. <unk> tummy my chest my legs and so on and so we began our lessons every single time. tuning drums in particular the kettle drums or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval so something like . <unk> it 's amazing that when you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference . can be felt with just the tiniest part. <unk> your finger there and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room and together <unk> we would listen . to the sounds of the instruments <unk> and really try to connect with those sounds far far more broadly than simply depending on the ear because of course the ear is. subject to all sorts of things the room we happen to be in the amplification the quality of the instrument. <unk> the type of sticks. <unk> beings but we all have our own little sound colors as it were that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things . and as i grew older i then auditioned for the royal academy of music in london and they said well no we won 't accept you because we haven 't a clue you know. <unk> if you refuse if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to. perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound. <unk> then we have to think very very hard about the people you do actually accept . and as a result <unk> once we got over over a little hurdle and having to audition twice . they accepted me <unk> and not only that <unk> what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom under no. <unk> circumstances were they to refuse any application. on the basis of whether someone had no arms no legs they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand . no circumstances at all were used to refuse. <unk> every single entry had to be listened to experienced and then based on the musical ability then that person. could either enter or not . and so therefore <unk> this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions <unk> and i have. <unk> of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world the interesting thing about this as well though . is quite simply that. not only were people connected with sound which is basically all of us we well know that music really is our. <unk> some of the extraordinary things i 've experienced as a musician when you may have. lad who. has got the most incredible challenges who may not be able to control his movements who may be deaf who may be blind etc etc suddenly <unk> if that. <unk> young lad. sits close to this instrument and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba <unk> and you play something that 's so incredibly. almost i don 't really have the the right sticks perhaps but something something like this let me change. <unk> and. <unk> i 'm on top of the sound . i have the sound coming this way <unk> he would have the sound coming through the resonators <unk> if there were no resonators on here <unk> we would have . so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn 't experience. <unk> those of you in the back few rows wouldn 't experience either every single one of us depending on where we 're sitting will experience this sound quite quite differently . <unk> and of course being the participator of the sound <unk> and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound i want to produce for example. exactly because i 'm not even touching it but yet . we get the sensation of something happening in the same way that when i see a tree moves . then i imagine that tree making a rustling sound do you. see what i mean whatever the eye sees then there 's. <unk> so there 's always always that huge. i mean just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience <unk>. and not by learning a piece of music <unk> putting on someone else 's interpretation of it buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music <unk> and so on and so forth <unk> because that isn 't giving me enough of something that is so raw. and so. basic and something that that i can fully experience the journey of so it may be that in certain halls . this dynamic. may well work. <unk> they 're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft gentle playing may have to be. <unk> this explosion in. access to sound. especially through the deaf community this has not only affected how music institutions how. <unk> schools for the deaf. treat sound <unk> and not just as a means of therapy although of course <unk> being a participator of music that definitely is the case as well. but it 's meant that. acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together there are so few halls in this world that. actually. have have very good acoustics dare i say <unk> but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine the tiniest <unk>. softest softest sound to something that is so broad <unk> so huge so incredible there 's always something it may sound good up there may not be so good <unk>. <unk> there it may be great there but terrible up there maybe terrible over there but not too bad there. etc etc <unk> so to find an actual hall. is incredible for which you can play exactly what you imagine without it being cosmetically enhanced <unk> so therefore <unk> acousticians are actually. in conversation with. people. <unk> this is quite interesting <unk> i cannot give you. any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls but it 's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom. so many years <unk>. <unk> we 've been saying well how on earth can they experience music. <unk> deafness is about or we go like that and we imagine that 's what blindness is about if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot. walk <unk> it may be that they can walk three four five steps that to them means they can walk . in a year 's time it could be two extra steps <unk> . in another year 's time three extra steps those are hugely important aspects. to think about <unk> . so when we do listen to each other it 's unbelievably important for us to really. to really test our listening skills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment for me. <unk> a musician who deals with ninety nine percent of new music it 's very easy for me to say oh yes i like that piece <unk> no i don 't like that piece and so on and. i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time <unk> it may be that the chemistry isn 't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music <unk>. but that doesn 't mean i have the right to say it 's a bad piece of music <unk> . <unk> one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid <unk> so there are no rules no right no wrong this way that way <unk> if i asked you to. clap maybe i can do this <unk> if i can just say please. clap and create the sound of thunder i 'm assuming we 've all experienced. <unk> i don 't mean just the sound i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves and please try to create that through your clapping try just please try. <unk> thing here <unk> though is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago. exactly the same question <unk> now. great imagination thank you very much <unk> however <unk> not one of you got out of your seats to think right how can i clap ok . maybe . maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds maybe i can use the other parts of my body to. extra sounds not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands in the same <unk>. <unk> way when we listen to music we assume that <unk> it 's all being fed through here <unk> this is how we experience music of course <unk> it 's not. <unk> can we do with thunder <unk> i remember. my teacher. when i first started my very first lesson i was all prepared with sticks <unk> ready to go . and instead of him saying ok evelyn please <unk> feet slightly apart arms at a more or less 90 degree angle sticks in a more or less v shape. keep this amount of space here <unk> etc please keep keep your back straight etc etc etc where i was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid frozen <unk>. <unk> and i would not be able to strike the drum because i was thinking of so many other things he said evelyn take this drum away for for seven days and i 'll see you next week . <unk> i no longer required the sticks i wasn 't allowed to have these sticks <unk> . i had to basically look at this particular drum see how it was made what these little lugs did <unk> what the snares did turned it upside down <unk> experimented with the shell. <unk> it was such an unbelievable experience because where on earth. <unk> experience that in a piece of music <unk> where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book so we never ever dealt with actual study books <unk> so for example one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with. being a percussion player as opposed to a musician is basically straightforward <unk>. <unk> and a little faster. and so on and so forth <unk> what does this piece require <unk>. so why can 't i then do that whilst learning a piece of music <unk> and that 's exactly what he did <unk> . and interestingly the older i became and when i became a full time student at a. <unk> all of that went out of the window we had to study from study books <unk> and constantly <unk> the question well why why what is this relating to i need to play a <unk>. <unk> piece of music well this will help your control well <unk> how why do i need to learn that i need to relate it to a piece of music <unk> you know <unk> i need to say something. <unk> why am i doing that i need to have the reason and the reason has to be. by saying something through the music . and by saying something through music which basically is sound <unk> we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people but i don 't want to. <unk> take responsibility of your emotional baggage that 's up to you when you walk through a hall <unk> because that then determines what and how we listen to <unk>. <unk> certain things i may feel sorrowful or happy <unk> or exhilarated or angry when i play certain pieces of music <unk> but i 'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing so please the next time you. <unk> go to a concert just. allow your body to open up allow your body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you 're not going to experience the same thing as the performer <unk>. is the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound because they 're hearing the contact of the stick. <unk> on the drum <unk> or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the string etc or. the breath that 's creating the sound from wind and brass they 're experiencing that rawness there <unk> but yet they 're experiencing something so unbelievably pure <unk> which is before the sound is actually happening <unk> . please take note of the life of the sound. after the actual initial strike or breath is being pulled. just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished i 'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference rather than just arriving last night. <unk> but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses <unk> but. thank you very much for having me. <unk> you know. the. <unk> clue. <unk> can.
