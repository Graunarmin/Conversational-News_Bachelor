 <unk> couple of years i have produced what i call the dead mall series thirty two short films and counting about dead malls now <unk> . for those of you who are not familiar with what a dead mall is it 's basically a. <unk> shopping mall that has fallen into hard times so it either has few shops and fewer shoppers or. it 's abandoned and crumbling into ruin no sale at penny 's . i started producing this series. in early two thousand and fifteen. after going through kind of a dark period in my life where i just didn 't want to. <unk> i put my camera away. and i just stopped . so in in two thousand and fifteen i decided to make a short film about the owings mills mall . owings mills mall opened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six i should know because i was there on opening day. i was there with my family along with every other family in baltimore. <unk> and you had to drive around for for forty five minutes. just to find a parking spot so if you can imagine <unk> that 's not happening at the malls today <unk> my first mall job. that i had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called herman 's. world of sports <unk> maybe you remember herman 's world of sports you guys remember that yeah <unk> so. i worked in a lady 's shoe store i worked in. <unk> a leather goods store and i also worked in a. video store and not being one who was very fond. of the retail arts . i got fired from every single job. <unk> i did what any normal teenager did in the 1990s i shoplifted. <unk> i 'm just kidding i hung out with my friends at the mall . everyone 's like oh my god what kind of talk is this. <unk> hanging out at the mall could be fun but it could be really lame too like sharing a cigarette with. unemployed mall rat. who has put on black lipstick for the night. while you 're on your break from your crappy minimum wage job . as i stand here today <unk> owings mills has been gutted and it 's ready for the wrecking ball. the last time i was there it was in the evening and it was about three days before. they closed the mall for good <unk> and you kind of felt they never announced the mall was closing but you had this. sort of feeling this ominous feeling that something big was going to happen like it was the end of the road it was a very. creepy. <unk> walk through the mall let me show you. <unk> when i started producing the dead mall series i put the videos up onto youtube and while i thought they were interesting. frankly i didn 't think others would share the enthusiasm for such a drab and depressing topic. <unk> i was wrong because a lot of people started to comment and at first the comments were like. basically like oh my god that 's the mall from my childhood what happened . and then i would get comments from people who were like . there 's a dead mall in my town you should come and film it so i started to travel. <unk> these dead malls <unk> some were open <unk> some were abandoned <unk> it was. kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned but i somehow always found a way in . the malls that are still open they always do this weird thing like the dead malls. <unk> 'll have three stores left <unk> but they try to spruce it up. to make it appear like things are on the up and up for example <unk> you 'll have an empty store. and they bring the gate down so at owings mills for example they put this tarp over the gate right <unk> and it 's got. a stock photo of a woman. who is so happy and she 's holding a blouse and she 's like. laughter and then there 's a guy standing next to her with like <unk> an espresso cup and he 's like . laughter and it says what brings you today . laughter i wanted to be scared and depressed <unk> thank you. <unk> the comments just kept pouring in. on the videos from all over the country and then all over the world . and i started to think this could really be something but i had to get creative because i 'm like <unk> how long. are people going to sit and watch me waddling through an empty mall. <unk> i filmed with an iphone <unk> so i 'd walk through the mall with an iphone and you know like. that . and. security because malls they don 't like photography so the security would come up and be like put that away and i 'm like ok so i had to get creative and sneaky <unk> . so i started using a hidden camera. and different techniques to get the footage that i needed and basically what i. <unk> to do was make the video like it was a first person experience like you are sitting. put your headphones on watching the screen it 's like you 're there in the video like a video game basically . i also started to use music. <unk> is a music genre that emerged in the early <unk>. among internet communities here 's an example. <unk> from an album he did called hologram plaza so if you look that up. <unk> is more than an art form it 's like a movement it 's nihilistic it 's angsty but it 's somehow comforting the whole aesthetic. is a way of dealing with things you can 't do anything about like no jobs <unk> or sitting in your parents ' basement eating ramen noodles. vaporwave came out of this generation 's desire to express their hopelessness the same way. that the. <unk> did sitting around in the food court one of my favorite malls. i 've been to. is in corpus christi <unk> and it 's called the sunrise mall when i was a kid . my favorite thing to do was watch movies and i used to watch movies over and over and over again and. one of my favorite films was the legend of billie jean. now for those of you who have seen the legend of billie jean you 'll know that <unk>. it 's a great film i love it <unk> and helen slater and christian slater and if you didn 't know they are not related <unk> many people thought that they were brother and sister they 're not but anyway <unk> . sunrise mall was used in the film as a filming location the mall. <unk> and here 's billie jean running across. the fountain <unk> being chased by hubie pyatt 's friends . and she jumps over here <unk> and you can see the shot right here is what it looks like today. <unk> 's pretty incredible i mean honestly. it 's exactly the same <unk> and there they are falling in the fountain and she runs up the stairs this is a nice shot of the the whole. thing here dan bell . i love that so. much i always think in my head if i owned a. <unk> in the food court and invite millennials and hipsters. to come and drink and eat <unk> . and i guarantee you within three weeks h & m and levi 's will be banging on the door trying to get space <unk> i don 't know why they don 't do this but apparently . it 's only in my. mind it goes all day. anyway in closing . when they first asked me to do this talk i said do you have the right person <unk>. <unk> i put my camera down three or four years ago and it took. going to these malls for me to be inspired again <unk> . and to see my audience and people from. <unk> over the world writing me and saying god i love your videos is. incredible <unk> . i don 't know how to even explain it as an artist how fulfilling that is if you would have told me a year ago. that i would be standing on this stage. talking to all of you wonderful people i would have never believed it i am humbled and so appreciative <unk> thank you very much.
