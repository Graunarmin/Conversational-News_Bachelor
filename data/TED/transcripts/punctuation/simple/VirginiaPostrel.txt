 <unk> you might be wondering why i 'm wearing sunglasses . and one answer to that is because i 'm here to talk about glamour <unk> so we all think we know what glamour is here it is it 's glamorous movie stars like marlene. <unk> and it comes in a male form too very glamorous <unk> not only can he shoot <unk> drive drink you know he drinks wine there actually is a little wine in there. and of course always wears a tuxedo <unk> but i think. that glamour actually has a much broader meaning one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters but also comes in other forms a magazine <unk>. <unk> well it 's certainly not this one <unk> this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand it 's all about sex tips. sex tips are not glamorous and drew barrymore for all her wonderful charm is not glamorous either <unk> but there is a glamour of industry <unk> this is margaret <unk> bourke white. <unk> 's one of her pictures she did fantastic glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places. <unk> and there 's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur. this is the hewlett packard garage we know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding <unk> hewlett packard . there 's the glamour of physics what could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe <unk> grand unification and . by the way it helps if you 're brian greene he has other kinds of glamour and there is of course <unk> this glamour <unk> this is very very. <unk> what do we mean by glamour <unk> well one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary <unk> . and it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary in this case the one thousand nine hundred and thirteen dictionary <unk> because for centuries glamour had a very particular meaning and the word was actually used. differently from the way we think. you had a glamour <unk> it wasn 't glamour as a quality you cast a glamour glamour was a literal magic spell not a metaphorical one the way we use it today but <unk>. <unk> a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent <unk> celtic magic . <unk> deception this definition for any artificial interest in or association with an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified <unk>. but still <unk> glamour is an illusion glamour is a magic spell. <unk> when the witches cast a magic spell on you it was not in your self interest it was to get you to act against your interest <unk> . well of course in the 20th century glamour came to have this different meaning associated with hollywood and this is hedy lamarr hedy lamarr said anyone can look glamorous all you have to do is sit there and look stupid . but in fact with all due respect to hedy about whom we 'll hear more later there 's a lot more to it there was a tremendous amount of technical. achievement associated with creating this hollywood glamour there were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make up experts you can go to the museum of hollywood history in hollywood and see <unk>. <unk> max factor 's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up so you 've got this highly stylized portrait of something that. <unk> not entirely of this earth it was a portrait of a star and actually we see glamorized photos of stars all the time they call them false color <unk> glamour is a form <unk>. of falsification <unk> but falsification to achieve a particular purpose it. <unk> process of idealization glorification and dramatization and it 's not just the case for people glamour doesn 't have to be people architectural photography julius schulman who has talked about transfiguration took this. fabulous famous picture of the kauffman house architectural photography is extremely glamorous <unk> it puts. <unk> you into this special special world <unk> this is alex ross 's comic book art which appears to be extremely realistic as part of his style is he <unk>. <unk> gives you a kind of realism in his comic art <unk> except that light doesn 't work this way in the real world when you stack people in rows the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground but not in the world of glamour <unk> . <unk> which was telling us that glamour is back glamour is all about transcending the everyday <unk> and i think that that 's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is <unk> . this is filippino lippi 's. portrait of saint apollonia <unk> and i don 't know who she is either but this is the [ 16th ] century equivalent of a supermodel it 's a very glamorous portrait why is it glamorous. <unk> because she is beautiful but that does not make you glamorous that only makes you beautiful . she is graceful she is mysterious and she is transcendent and those are the central qualities of glamour . you don 't see her eyes they 're looking downward she 's not looking away from you exactly but you have to mentally imagine her world she 's encouraging you to. <unk> contemplate this higher world to which she belongs where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture mel gibson 's passion <unk>. <unk> of the christ not glamorous that 's glamour that 's michelangelo 's pieta where mary is the same age as jesus and they 're both awfully happy and pleasant <unk> . mysterious a little bit distant that 's why often in these glamour shots the person is not looking at the audience it 's why. sunglasses are glamorous but also not so far above us that we can 't identify with the person in some sense there has to be something like us <unk> so as i say in religious art you. know god is not glamorous god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent omniscient too far above us. <unk> and yet you will see in religious art saints or the virgin mary will often be portrayed not always in glamorous forms. as i said earlier <unk> glamour does not have to be about people . but it has to have this transcendent quality what is it about superman aside from alex ross 's style which is very glamorous <unk> one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can. <unk> glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized perfect place <unk> and this is one reason that. modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous <unk> the less experience we have with them the more glamorous they are so you can do a glamorized picture of a car <unk> but you can 't do a glamorized picture of traffic you can do a glamorized picture of an. <unk> but not the inside <unk> the notion is that it 's going to transport you and the story is not about you know . the guy in front of you in the airplane who has this nasty little kid or the big cough . the story is about where you 're arriving or thinking about where you 're arriving <unk> and this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling <unk>. this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period <unk> but because. <unk> streamlining it transports us from the everyday the same thing arches are very glamorous <unk> . arches with stained glass even more glamorous <unk> staircases that curve away from you are glamorous <unk> i happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because to me it captures the whole promise of the. academic contemplative life but maybe that 's because i went to princeton anyway <unk> skylines are super glamorous. <unk> streets not so glamorous you know when you get actually to this town it has reality <unk> the horizon the open road . is very very glamorous there are few things more glamorous than the horizon except possibly. multiple horizons of course here you you don 't feel the cold <unk> . <unk> you just see the possibilities in order to pull glamour off you need this renaissance quality of sprezzatura which is a term coined by castiglione in his. book the book of the courtier there 's the not glamorous version of what it looks like today after a few centuries <unk> and sprezzatura is the art that conceals art <unk> it makes <unk>. <unk> things look effortless you don 't think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress she just looks completely. <unk> natural <unk> and i remember reading <unk> after the lara croft movies how angelina jolie would go home completely black and blue. <unk> of course they covered that with make up because lara croft did all those same stunts but she doesn 't get black and blue because she has sprezzatura to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without. <unk> and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour glamour is about editing how do you create the sense of transcendence the sense of evoking a perfect world the sense of you know . life could be better i could join this i could be a perfect person i could join this perfect world <unk> we don 't tell you all the grubby details <unk> . now this was kindly lent to me by jeff bezos from last year <unk> this is underneath jeff 's. <unk> this is what the real world of computers lamps electrical appliances of all kinds looks like . but if you look in a catalog particularly a catalog of modern beautiful. objects for your home it looks like this there are no cords look next time you get these catalogs in your mail you can usually figure out where they hid the cord <unk> but there 's always this illusion that if you. buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords and the same thing is true of if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer. and even in these wireless eras you don 't get to live in the world without cords you have to have mystery and you have to have grace <unk> and there she is grace this is the most <unk>. glamorous picture i think ever part of the thing is that in rear window the question is is she too glamorous to live in his world and the answer is no but of course it 's really just a movie here 's hedy lamarr. <unk> again <unk> and you know this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because like sunglasses it conceals and reveals at the same time translucence is glamorous that 's why <unk>. <unk> all these people wear pearls it 's why barware is glamorous glamour is translucent not transparent not opaque it invites us into the world but it doesn 't give us a completely clear picture <unk> and i think if grace kelly. <unk> is the most glamorous person maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous it has that sense of going. up and away <unk> and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were particularly going down and of course glass block has that sense of translucence translucence so this session 's. <unk> supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour 's really partly about meaning all individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized. in reality they have contradictions they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other whatever it is and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals and the way we deal with that is we. we displace them we put them into a golden world an imagined world an age of heroes the world to come and in the life of an individual we often associate that with some object the white picket fence <unk> . the perfect house <unk> the perfect kitchen no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen you know . you buy that viking range this is what your kitchen will look like the perfect love life symbolized by the perfect. <unk> necklace the perfect diamond ring <unk> the perfect getaway in your perfect car this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia. <unk> the perfect office again no cords as far as i can tell. and certainly no it doesn 't look a thing like my office i mean there 's no paper on the desk we want this golden world and some people get rich enough and if they have their ideals in a sort of domestic sense. <unk> to acquire their perfect world <unk> dean koontz built this fabulous home theater which is i don 't think accidentally in art deco style that symbolizes this sense <unk>. <unk> of being safe and at home this is not always good <unk> because what is your perfect world what is your ideal and also what has been edited out is it something important <unk>. <unk> is a movie that is all about glamour i could do a whole talk on the matrix and glamour <unk> it was criticized for glamorizing violence because look. sunglasses and those long coats. and of course they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world this is another margaret <unk> bourke white photo this is from soviet union attractive i mean look how happy the people are and. <unk> fan of peta but i think this is a great ad because what they 're doing is they 're saying your coat 's not so glamorous what 's been edited out is something important <unk> . but actually what 's even more important than remembering what 's been edited out is thinking are the ideals good <unk> because. glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive and it 's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor <unk> this is from triumph of the will brilliant editing to cut together things. <unk> there 's a glamour shot <unk> national socialism is all about glamour <unk> it was a very aesthetic ideology it was all about cleaning up germany <unk> and the west and the world and ridding it of anything <unk>. unglamorous so glamour can be dangerous i think glamour has a genuine appeal has a genuine value i 'm not against glamour but there 's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life <unk> and there is both a way. <unk> to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it and that 's to take isaac mizrahi 's advice and confront the manipulation of it all and sort of admit that that manipulation is something that we enjoy but also. enjoy how it happens and here 's hedy lamarr she 's very glamorous but you know she invented.
