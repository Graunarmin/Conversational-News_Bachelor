 <unk> people love their automobiles they allow us to go where we want to when we want to they 're a form of entertainment <unk> they 're a form of art . a pride of ownership <unk> songs are written about cars prince wrote a great. <unk> little red dirt devil he wrote about a car one of my favorites has always been make love to your man in a chevy van because that was my vehicle when i was in college . the fact is when we do our market research around the world we see there 's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile seven hundred <unk>. <unk> and fifty million people in the world today own a car and you say boy that 's a lot but you know what that 's just twelve. <unk> percent of the population <unk> we really have to ask the question can the world sustain that number of automobiles <unk> and if you look at projections over the next ten to fifteen to twenty years <unk>. it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of one point one billion vehicles <unk> if you park those end to end and wrap them around the earth . <unk> progress with automobile technology over the last one hundred years cars are dramatically cleaner dramatically safer more efficient and radically more affordable than they were one hundred years ago <unk> . but the fact remains. <unk> the fundamental dna of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same if we were to reinvent the automobile today <unk> rather than one hundred years ago <unk> knowing what we know about the issues associated with our. <unk> product and about the technologies that exist today what would we do we wanted something that was really affordable the fuel cell looked great one tenth as many moving parts a. fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine <unk> and it emits just water <unk> and we wanted to take advantage of moore 's law with electronic controls and software and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected . <unk> engine the fuel cell and hydrogen as the energy carrier first was autonomy autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head <unk> we embodied all of the key components <unk>. <unk> of a fuel cell propulsion system <unk> we then had autonomy drivable with hy wire and we showed hy wire here at this conference last year hy wire is the world 's first drivable fuel cell <unk> and we have followed up that now with sequel <unk> and sequel. <unk> truly is a real car so if we could run the video. <unk> but the real key question i 'm sure that 's on your mind where is the hydrogen going to come from and secondly. <unk> when are these kinds of cars going to be available so let me talk about hydrogen first the beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources it can come from fossil fuels it can <unk>. <unk> come from any way that you can create electricity including renewables <unk> and it can come from biofuels and that that 's quite exciting the vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen a lot of hydrogen is produced. <unk> in the world it 's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline which i find is somewhat ironic it 's produced in the fertilizer industry it 's produced in the. chemical manufacturing industry <unk> that hydrogen is being made because there 's a good business reason for its use <unk> but it tells us that we know how to create it we know how to create it <unk>. we know how to handle it safely <unk> we did an analysis where you would have a station in. <unk> each of the one hundred largest cities in the united states <unk> and located the stations so you 'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time . we put one every twenty five miles on the freeway <unk> . and it turns out that translates into about twelve thousand stations <unk> and at a million dollars each that would be about twelve billion dollars that 's a lot of money . but if you built the alaskan pipeline today that 's half of what the alaskan pipeline would cost. but the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling. <unk> like recharging your laptop or recharging your cell phone so we 're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen we think it 's a question of not. whether but a question of when what we 've targeted for ourselves and we 're making great progress toward this goal is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells <unk> . designed and validated . <unk> with the internal combustion engine we 're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine <unk> and doing it in terms of affordability at scale volumes its performance and its durability <unk> . so that 's what we 're driving to for two thousand and ten <unk> we haven 't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn 't possible . we actually think the future is going to be event driven so since we can 't predict the future we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future i 'm very very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks. sit idle ninety percent of the time <unk> they 're parked all around us they 're usually parked within one hundred feet of the people that own them . now if you take the power generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the united states it turns out that <unk>. <unk> the power in four percent of the automobiles equals that of the electric grid of the us that 's a huge. <unk> mobile power generating capability <unk> and hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they 're parked to generate electricity for the grid. we talked about swarm networks earlier talk about the ultimate swarm having all of the processors and all of the cars when they 're sitting idle being part of a global grid. for computing. <unk> we find that premise quite exciting . the automobile becomes then an appliance not in a commodity sense but an appliance mobile power mobile platform for information and computing and communication as well <unk>. <unk> as a form of transportation and the key to all of this is to make it affordable to make it exciting to get it on a pathway where there 's a way to make money doing it . <unk> people say how do you sleep at night when you 're wrestling with a problem of that magnitude i tell them i sleep like a baby i wake up crying every two hours laughter. actually the theme of this conference i think has hit on one of the major keys to pull that off and that 's relationships and working together <unk> thank you very much. <unk> one you know i could be wrong about this but my sense is that in the public mind today <unk> gm is not viewed as. as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your japanese competitors maybe even as as ford are you serious about it and. <unk> when the consumers want it when the regulators force us to do it we will go there will you guys really try and show leadership on this.
