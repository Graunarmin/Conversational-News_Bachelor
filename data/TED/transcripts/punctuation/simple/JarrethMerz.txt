 <unk> i was born in switzerland. and raised in ghana west africa ghana felt safe to me as a child <unk> i was free i was happy <unk> . <unk> marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in ghana but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability. and mismanagement in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i witnessed my first. military coup . we the children had gathered at a friend 's house <unk> . it was a dimly lit shack there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background and. a former head of state and general was being blindfolded. and tied to the pole <unk> the firing squad aimed <unk> fired. the general was dead now this was being broadcast live <unk> . and shortly after <unk> we left the country and we returned to switzerland <unk> . now europe came as a shock to me <unk> and. i think i started feeling the need to. to shed my skin in order to fit in i wanted to blend in like a chameleon i think it was a tactic of survival <unk> and it worked . or so i believed <unk> so here i was in two thousand and eight. wondering where i was in my life <unk> and i felt i was being typecast as an actor i was always playing the exotic african. the violent african the african terrorist <unk> . and i was thinking how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself and i. had become ashamed of the other the african in me <unk> . and fortunately i decided in two thousand and eight to return to ghana after twenty eight years of absence. <unk> i wanted to document on film the two thousand and eight presidential elections . and there i started by searching for the for the footprints in my childhood <unk> and. before i even knew it i was suddenly on a stage. surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political. rally <unk> and i realized that when i 'd left the country free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a. were a dream . and now that i 'd returned that dream had become reality <unk> though a fragile reality <unk> and i was thinking was ghana searching for its identity. like i was looking for my identity was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me <unk> and. it was as if through the standards of my. <unk> lived up to my full potential <unk> i mean nor had ghana even though we had been trying very hard <unk> now in <unk>. <unk> ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence . in the late 50s ghana and singapore had the same gdp <unk> . i mean today singapore is a first world country and ghana is not . but maybe it was time. to prove to myself yes it 's important to understand the past it is important. to look at it in a different light but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture. and build on those foundations in the present so here i was december 7th two thousand and eight . the polling stations opened to the to the voters at seven. <unk> but voters <unk> eager to take their own political fate into their hands . were starting to line up at four zero am in the morning <unk> . and they had traveled from near they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard <unk> . and i asked one of the voters i said whom are you going to vote for and he said i 'm sorry i can 't tell you . he said that his vote was in his heart and i understood this was their election and. <unk> weren 't going to let anyone take it away from them . now the first round of the voting didn 't bring forth a clear winner so nobody had achieved the absolute majority so voting went into a second round three weeks later . the candidates were back on the road they were campaigning <unk> the rhetoric of the candidates of course changed the heat was on and then. the cliche came to haunt us. there were claims of intimidation at the polling stations of ballot boxes being stolen <unk> . inflated results started coming in. and the mob was starting to get out of control we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets people were being beaten brutally. <unk> the army started firing their guns people were scrambling it was complete chaos <unk> . and my heart sank <unk> because i thought here we are again here is another proof. that the african is not capable of governing himself <unk> . and not only that i am documenting it documenting my own cultural shortcomings . so when the echo of the gunshots. <unk> it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob and i didn 't believe what i was hearing they were chanting we want peace <unk> we want peace . and i realized it had to come from the people . after all they decide <unk> and they did so the sounds that were before. distorted and loud were suddenly a melody the sounds of the voices were harmonious so it could happen. a democracy could be upheld peacefully . it could be by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace <unk> . now here 's an interesting. comparison we in the west we preach the. <unk> the golden light of democracy that we are the shining example of how it 's done <unk> but when it comes down to it ghana. found itself in the same place. in which the u s election stalled in the two thousand presidential elections bush versus gore <unk> but instead of the unwillingness. of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide. <unk> and its people it didn 't leave it up to the supreme court to decide the people did now. the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either <unk> i mean it was so incredibly close <unk> the electoral commissioner. declared with the consent of the parties to run an. <unk> so the people. went back to the polls. to determine their own president not the legal system and guess what it worked <unk> . the defeated candidate. gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle <unk> . i mean at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy <unk> they did not abuse their power. the belief in true democracy. and in the people runs deep proving that the african is capable of governing himself <unk> now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa. is not over <unk> but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted . now. i have learned that my. <unk> place is not just in the west or in africa <unk> and i 'm still searching for my identity <unk> but. i saw ghana create democracy better ghana taught me. to look at people differently and to look at myself differently and yes <unk> we africans can thank you.
