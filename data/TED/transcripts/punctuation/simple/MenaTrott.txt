 <unk> over the past couple of days as i 've been preparing for my speech i 've. become more and more nervous about what i 'm going to say and about being on the same same stage as all these fascinating people being on the same stage as al gore who was the first person i ever voted for . and. so i was getting pretty nervous and you know i didn 't know that chris sits on the stage . and that 's more nerve racking but then i started thinking about my family i started thinking about my father. and my grandfather and my <unk>. and i realized that i had all of these teds going. <unk> who am i chris kind of mentioned i started a company with my husband . we have about one hundred <unk> and twenty five people internationally if you looked in the book you saw this . which. i really was appalled by . and because i wanted to impress you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday. <unk> with graphs i made a graph that moves <unk> and i talk about the makeup of me . laughter so <unk> besides this freakish thing this is my science slide this is math <unk> and this is science this is genetics this is my grandmother <unk> . and this is where i get this mouth . so i 'm a blogger <unk> which probably to a lot of you means. <unk> things. <unk> you may have heard about the kryptonite lock. brouhaha where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen and it spread all over kryptonite had to adjust. adjust the lock and they had to address it to. avoid too many customer concerns you may have heard about rathergate which was basically. <unk> on an old typewriter it 's on word bloggers exposed this or they worked hard to expose expose this . you know blogs are scary this is what you see i see this and i 'm sure scared i swear on stage shitless about blogs <unk> because this is not. something that 's. <unk> money just by running ads to support his family up in oregon that 's all he does now <unk> and this is something that blogs have made possible <unk> . and then you have something like this which is interplast it 's a wonderful organization. of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it children with cleft palates get it and they document their story this is wonderful . i am not that. <unk> caring . i talk about myself that 's what i am i 'm a blogger <unk> i have always decided that i was going to be an expert on one thing and i am an expert on this person . and so i write about it <unk> . so the short story about my blog it started in two thousand and one i was twenty three i wasn 't happy with my. <unk> because i was a designer but i wasn 't being really stimulated i was an english major in college i didn 't have any use for it <unk> but i missed writing . so i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories <unk> this was an illustration about my camp experience when i was eleven years old . and how i went to a ymca camp <unk> christian camp and basically by the end i had made my friends hate me so much. <unk> find me they sent a search party and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible peak you can laugh this is ok. this is me <unk> this is what happened to me and when i started my blog it was really this one goal. <unk> i said i am not going to be famous to the world <unk> but i could be famous to people on the internet and i set a goal i said i 'm going to win. <unk> an award because i had never won an award in my entire life <unk> . and i said i 'm going to win the south by southwest weblog award and i won it i reached all of these people and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day <unk> . and then i wrote a post about a banjo <unk> . i wrote a post. about wanting to buy a. <unk> three hundred banjo which is a lot of money . and i don 't play instruments <unk> i don 't know anything about music <unk> i like music and i like banjos . and i think i probably heard steve martin playing and i said i could do that . and i said <unk> i said to my husband ben can i buy a banjo and he 's like no and my husband . this is my husband who is very hot he won an award for being hot. <unk> i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him he was such a tyrant he would not let me buy this banjo <unk> and those people who know me understood my joke this is mena this is how i make a joke <unk>. <unk> at people because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. and if he knew i was showing this right now i put this in today he would kill me <unk> . but the thing was my friends read it and they 're like oh that mena she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid . but i got emails from people that said oh my god your husband is such an asshole how much money does he spend on beer in a year. <unk> you could take that money and buy your banjo <unk> why don 't you open a separate account i 've been with him since i was seventeen we 've never had a separate bank account <unk> . they said separate your bank account spend your money spend his money that 's it and then i got people saying leave him laughter. i was like ok what who are these people and why are they reading this and i realized <unk> i don 't want to reach these people <unk> i don 't want to write for this public audience. <unk> and i started to kill my blog slowly i 'm like i don 't want to write this anymore. slowly and slowly and i and i did tell personal stories from time to time i wrote this one and i put this up because of einstein today. <unk> i 'm going to get choked up because this is my first pet and she passed away two years ago <unk> and i decided to break from i don 't really write about my public life because i wanted to give her a little memorial but anyways . it 's these sorts of personal stories you know you read the blogs about. <unk> politics or about media and gossip and all these things . these are out there but it 's more of the personal that interests me and this is this is who who i am . you see norman rockwell and you have art critics say norman rockwell is not art norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not. something to be considered. <unk> i think this is one of the most important things to us as. humans these things resonate with us and if you think about blogs you think of high art blogs the history paintings about you know . all the biblical stories <unk> and then you have this these are the blogs that interest me the people that just tell stories. one story is about this baby and his name is odin his father was a blogger <unk> . and he was writing his blog one day. <unk> his wife gave birth to her baby <unk> <unk> at twenty five weeks <unk> . and he never expected this one day <unk> it was normal the next day it was hell <unk> and this is a one pound baby <unk> so odin was documented every single day pictures were taken every day <unk> day one day two . you have day nine they 're talking about his apnea . <unk> baby is so small and i 've never encountered such a. just a disturbing image but just just so heartfelt <unk> and. you 're reading this as it happens so on day fifty five everybody reads that he 's having failures breathing failures and heart failures and it 's slowing down and you you don 't know what to expect <unk> . but then it gets better <unk> day ninety six he goes home and. you see this post that 's not something you 're going to. <unk> in a paper or magazine but this is something this person feels and people are excited about it <unk> twenty eight comments that 's not a huge amount of people reading but twenty eight people matter . and today he is a healthy baby who <unk> if you read his blog it 's snowdeal org his father 's blog. he is taking pictures of him still because he is still his son and he is i think at his age level right now because he had. he had received such great treatment from the hospital so . blogs <unk> so what you 've probably heard these things before we talked about the well <unk> and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history but. i think blogs are basically just an evolution <unk> and that 's where we are today it 's this record of who you. <unk> your persona you have your google search where you say what is mena trott and then you find these things and you. 're happy or unhappy. <unk> but then you also find people 's blogs <unk> and those are the records of people that are writing daily not necessarily about the same topic but things that interest them <unk> . and. we talk about the world flattens being in this panel and. i am very optimistic whenever i think about blogs i 'm like we 've got to reach all these people hundreds of millions and billions of people we 're getting into china we want to be there. <unk> but there are so many people that won 't have the access to write a blog but to see something like the $ one hundred computer is amazing because blogging software is simple . we have a successful company because of timing and because of perseverance but it 's simple stuff it 's not rocket science <unk> . and so that 's an amazing thing to consider. so. the life record of a blog is something that i find. <unk> incredibly important <unk> and we started with a slide of my teds <unk> . and i had to add this slide because i knew the minute i showed this my mom my mom will see this because she does read my blog. and she 'll say why wasn 't there a picture of me this is my mom so i have all the people that i know of . but this this is basically the extent of the family that i know. <unk> i showed a norman rockwell painting before <unk> and this one <unk> i grew up with looking at constantly i would spend hours looking at the connections saying oh the little kid up at the top has red hair <unk>. <unk> so does that first generation up there and it 's just these little things <unk> . <unk> so that has always influenced me. i have this record this one thousand nine hundred and ten census of another grabowski that 's my maiden name and there 's a theodore <unk> because there 's always a theodore <unk> this is all i have i have <unk>. a couple of facts about somebody i have their date of birth their age what they did in their household if they spoke english and that 's it that 's all i know of these people and it 's pretty sad because i only go back five generations. that 's it <unk> i don 't even know what happens on my mom 's side because she 's from cuba and i don 't have that many things. just doing this i spent time in the archives that 's why my husband 's a saint i spent time in the washington archives just sitting there <unk> looking for these things now it 's online but he sat through that and so you have this record and. this. <unk> this is the only picture i have . and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs to think about the people that are on those $ one hundred computers talking about who they are sharing these personal stories this is an amazing thing . another. photo that has greatly influenced me <unk> or a series of photos is this project that 's done by an argentinean man and his wife . and he 's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past. ' seventy six twenty <unk> oh my god i 'm <unk>. <unk> years twenty nine years . there was a joke originally about my graph that i left out which is you see all this math i 'm just happy i was able to add it up to one hundred because that 's my skill set. so you have these people. <unk> now this is them today <unk> or last year <unk> and that 's a powerful thing to have to be able to track this i wish that i would have this of my family i know that. one day my children will be wondering or my grandchildren or my great grandchildren if i ever have children. what i am going to who i was <unk> so i do something that 's very narcissistic i am a. <unk> an amazing thing for me because it captures a moment in time every day <unk> i take a picture of myself i 've been doing this since last year every single day <unk> and you know it 's. the same picture it 's basically the same person only a couple of people read it i don 't write this for this audience i 'm showing it now but i would go. insane if this was really public about four people probably read it <unk> and they they tell me you haven 't updated i 'm probably going to get people telling me i haven 't updated <unk> but this is. <unk> i can go back to a day to april two thousand and five and say what was i doing this day <unk> i look at it i know exactly it 's this visual cue that is so important to what we do <unk>. i put the bad pictures up too <unk> because. there are bad pictures and i remember instantly i am in germany in this i had to go for a one day trip. i was sick <unk> . and i was in a hotel room and i wanted not to be there and so you see these things it 's not just always smiling now i 've kind of evolved it so i have this look if you look at my driver 's license i have the same look. and it 's a pretty. disturbing thing but it 's something that is really important <unk> and. the last story i really want to tell is this story because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what i 'm doing i 'll probably get choked up because i. <unk> to when i talk about this . so this woman her name was emma <unk> and she was a blogger on our service typepad <unk> and she was a beta tester so she was there right when we opened you know there was one hundred people . and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer she was writing and writing and we all started reading it because we had so few blogs on the service we could keep track of everyone <unk> . and she was writing one day and then she disappeared. <unk> for a little bit and her sister came on and she said that emma had passed away and all of our support staff who had talked to her. were were really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company <unk> . and this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world that this woman is in england . and she lives. <unk> she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing <unk> but the big thing that. really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said <unk> and she wrote on this blog that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her and being able to talk to people and to share what was going. <unk> being able to write. and receive comments <unk> and that was amazing to be able to know that we had empowered that and that. blogging. was something that she felt comfortable doing and. the idea that blogging doesn 't have to be scary that we don 't always have to be attack of the blogs that we can be people who are open and wanting to help and talk to people that was an amazing thing. and so i printed out and sent a pdf of. <unk> her blog to her family and they passed it out at her memorial service and even in her her. obituary they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life and that 's a huge thing so this is her legacy <unk> and. i think that my call to action to all of you is think about blogs think about what they are think about what you 've thought of them <unk> and then. actually do it because it 's something that 's really going to change our lives.
