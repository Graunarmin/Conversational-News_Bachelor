 <unk> dream of mankind to fly like a bird <unk> birds are very agile they fly not with rotating components so they fly only by flapping their. <unk> so we looked at the birds <unk> and we tried to make a model that is powerful ultralight <unk> and it must have excellent <unk>. aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings <unk> . <unk> as a role model <unk> . so we bring a team together <unk> there are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders <unk> and <unk>. the task was to build an ultralight <unk> indoor flying model. that no one would be hurt if it. fell down <unk> so why do we do all this we are a company in the field of automation <unk> . and we 'd like to do very lightweight structures because that 's energy efficient <unk> and we 'd like to learn more about. pneumatics and. <unk> your seat belts on and put your. <unk> without a skin <unk> we have a wingspan of about two meters the length is one meter and six <unk> and the weight is only four hundred and fifty grams <unk> . and it is all out of carbon. <unk> fiber in the middle we have a motor <unk> and we also have a gear in it <unk> and we use the gear to transfer. the circulation of the motor <unk> so within the motor we have three hall sensors so we know exactly where the wing is. <unk> we have the possibility to fly like a bird <unk> so if you go down you have the large area of propulsion and if you go up . the wings are not that large <unk> and it is easier to get up. <unk> the next thing we did or the challenges we did was to coordinate this movement <unk> we have to turn it go up and go down <unk> we have a split wing <unk> with the split wing <unk> we get the lift. at the upper wing <unk> and we get the propulsion at the lower wing also we see how we measure. <unk> we had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency <unk> so therefore it rises <unk>. up from passive torsion to active torsion from thirty percent up to eighty percent . <unk> only if you control and regulate it you will get that aerodynamic efficiency <unk> so the overall consumption of energy is about.
