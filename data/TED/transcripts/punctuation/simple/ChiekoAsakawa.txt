 <unk> might think there are many things that i can 't do because i cannot. <unk> i just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage <unk> but there is also a lot that i can do this is me. rock climbing for the first time . actually <unk> i love sports and i can play many sports like swimming skiing skating scuba diving running and so on . but there is one limitation . somebody needs to help me i. <unk> be independent <unk> . i lost my sight at the age of fourteen in a swimming pool accident <unk> . i was an active independent teenager and suddenly i became blind . the hardest thing for me was losing my independence things that until then. <unk> one of my challenges was textbooks <unk> . back then there were no personal computers no internet no smartphones . so i had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks and i had to create my own books in braille . can you imagine . of course my brothers were not happy about it and later i. they were not there whenever i needed them i think they tried to stay away from me <unk> i don 't blame them <unk> . i really wanted to be freed from relying on someone . that became my strong desire to ignite innovation <unk> . jump ahead to. <unk> to myself <unk> how come there is no computer technology to. create books in braille <unk> these amazing technologies. must be able to also help people with limitations like myself <unk> that 's the moment my innovation journey began <unk>. <unk> such as a digital braille editor digital braille dictionary and a digital braille library network <unk> . today <unk> every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks by using personal computers and mobile devices in braille or in voice <unk> . this may not surprise you since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in two. <unk> fifteen but braille went digital many years before digital books already in the late <unk>. almost thirty years ago strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity. to create digital books way back then <unk> and this is actually. not the first time this happened <unk> because history shows us. accessibility ignites innovation . the telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people . some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities . now i 'm going to give. <unk> you another example from my own life in the ' 90s people around me started talking about the internet and web browsing . i remember the first time i went on the web i was astonished <unk> . i could access newspapers at any time and every day <unk> i could even search. <unk> desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the internet and i found ways. to render the web into synthesized voice <unk> which dramatically simplified the user interface . this led me to develop the home page reader in. <unk> i developed the home page reader <unk> i got many comments from users one that i strongly remember said . for me the internet is. a small window to the world it was a revolutionary moment for the blind the cyber world. <unk> and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses <unk> way beyond what i imagined . it can help drivers listen to. their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking <unk> . today <unk> i am more independent <unk> but it is still not enough . for example <unk> when i approached the stage just now i needed assistance. <unk> my goal is to come up here independently <unk> and not just here . my goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you <unk> . ok now let me show you the latest technologies this is a smartphone app that we are working on. ev take the two doors to go out the door is on your right <unk>. nick is approaching <unk> looks so happy. <unk> he is not talking to you. <unk> dark chocolate with almonds ev you gained five pounds since yesterday. <unk> app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors. and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself <unk> but the computer vision part. that showed who is approaching <unk> in which mood we are still working on that part and recognizing facial expressions. is very important for me to be social <unk> . so now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world <unk> . we call this. cognitive assistance it understands our surrounding world. and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration. <unk> to my fingers cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities. in other words our five senses . this technology is only in an early stage <unk> but eventually i 'll be able to find a classroom on campus <unk> . enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street. it will be amazing if i can find you on the street before you notice me . it will become my best buddy <unk> and yours . so this really is a great challenge it is a challenge. that needs collaboration which is. <unk> fundamental technologies you just saw in the video the frontier is the real world the blind community is exploring. this technical frontier and the pathfinder <unk> . i hope to work with you to explore the new era and the next time that i 'm on this stage. <unk> through technology and innovation i will be able to walk up here all by myself <unk> thank you so much.
