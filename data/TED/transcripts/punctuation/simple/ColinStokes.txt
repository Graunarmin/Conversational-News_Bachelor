 <unk> my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch. <unk> i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids <unk> and when my daughter was four we got to watch the wizard of oz together. <unk> totally dominated her imagination for months her favorite character was glinda of course it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand. <unk> but you watch that movie enough times <unk> and you start to realize how unusual it is now we. live today and are raising our children in a kind of children. <unk> the trend really caught on with interestingly <unk> another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl. by dressing up as the enemy 's guards do you know what i 'm talking about yeah . now . there 's a big difference between these two movies a couple of really big differences between the wizard of oz and all the movies we watch today one is there 's very little violence in. <unk> wizard of oz the. monkeys are rather aggressive as are the apple trees <unk> but. i think if the wizard of oz were made today <unk> . the wizard would say dorothy you are the savior of oz that the prophecy foretold <unk> use your magic slippers to defeat the <unk>. <unk> armies of the wicked witch but that 's not how it happens <unk> another thing that 's really. unique about the wizard of oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters. are female . now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter . which was years later and the situation was different at that point i also had a son <unk> . he was only three at the time he was not invited to. <unk> the screening he was too young for that but he was the second child <unk> and the level of supervision had plummeted so. he wandered in <unk> . and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling. <unk> i don 't think he understands what 's going on but. he is sure soaking in it <unk> . and i wonder what he 's soaking in is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty . is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government . is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for aunt beru <unk> and of course. <unk> this princess who 's really cool <unk> but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe which he does. by the magic that he was born with <unk> compare this to one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine with the wizard of oz how does dorothy win her movie <unk> . by making friends with everybody. and being a leader that 's. <unk> kind of the world i 'd rather raise my kids in. oz <unk> right <unk> and not the world of dudes fighting <unk> . which is where we kind of have to be why is there so much force capital f force in the movies we have for our kids and so little yellow brick road <unk>. there is a lot of great writing about the impact. <unk> movie has on girls and you should do that reading it 's very good <unk> . i haven 't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe <unk> i know from my own experience that. princess leia did not provide the adequate context that i could have used in navigating the adult world that. <unk> i really expected the credits to start rolling. because that 's the end of the movie right i finished my quest i got the girl <unk> why are you still standing there. i don 't know what i 'm supposed to do the movies are very very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward and there 's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys <unk> it 's almost as though if you 're a. <unk> boy you are a dopey animal and if you are a girl you should bring your warrior costume <unk>. there are plenty of exceptions and i i will defend the disney princesses in front of any you <unk> but they do. send a message to boys that they are not the boys are not really the target audience. <unk> they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy <unk> . but they are not necessarily showing boys how they 're supposed to defend against the patriarchy there 's no models for them <unk> . and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids <unk> . and as three dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are these are still war movies . <unk> of course the most successful studio of all time. continues to crank out classic after classic every single one of them about the journey of a boy <unk> or <unk>. <unk> a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son <unk> or. <unk> this year when they finally came out with brave i recommend it to all of you it 's on demand now do. you remember what the critics said when brave came out aw i can 't believe pixar made a princess movie it. 's very good don 't let that stop you. <unk> now almost none of these movies pass the bechdel test i don 't know if you 've heard of this it has not yet caught on and caught fire. but maybe today we will start a movement alison bechdel is a comic book artist and back in the mid ' 80s she. recorded this conversation she 'd had with a friend. about assessing the movies that they saw <unk> and it 's very simple there 's just three questions you should ask. <unk> is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines. so try to meet that bar and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie. <unk> and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like. <unk> 've seen it <unk> and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love in fact this week i went to see a very high quality <unk>. <unk> argo right <unk> oscar buzz doing great at the box office a consensus idea of what a quality hollywood film is it pretty much. <unk> a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis . we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep <unk> angst ridden conversations in this hideout <unk> and. the. great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and. <unk> you coming to bed honey that 's hollywood for you . so let 's let 's look at the numbers two thousand and eleven of the one hundred most popular movies how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists . eleven it 's not bad. 's not as many percent as the number of women we 've just elected to congress so that 's good but there is a number that is greater than this that 's going to bring. <unk> this room down. last year the new york times published a study that the government had done here 's what it said one out of five. women in america. say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life . now i don 't think that 's the fault of popular entertainment <unk> i don 't think kids. <unk> movies have anything to do with that i don 't even think that. music videos or pornography are really directly related to that but something is going wrong <unk> . and when i hear that statistic one of the things i think of is. that 's a lot of sexual assailants who are these guys what are they learning what are they failing to learn. <unk> are they absorbing the story that a male hero 's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward which is a woman who has no friends and doesn 't speak . are we soaking up that story . <unk> as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter. like all of you who are doing the same thing we find this world. and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them we have tools at our disposal like girl power . and we hope that that will help <unk> but i gotta wonder is girl power going to protect. <unk> at the same time <unk> actively or passively we are training our sons. to maintain their boy power <unk> i mean i think the netflix queue. is one way that we can do something very important <unk> and i 'm talking mainly to the dads here i think we have got to show our sons. a new definition of manhood the definition of manhood is already. turning upside down <unk> you 've read about how the new economy is changing the. <unk> roles of caregiver and wage earner they 're throwing it up in the air . so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this some new relationship with each other and i think we really have to show them and model for them <unk> . how a real man. is someone who trusts his. <unk> and respects them <unk> . and wants to be on their team and stands up against the real bad guys <unk> who are the men who want to abuse the women <unk> . and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies. that pass the bechdel test if we can find them <unk> and to seek out the heroines who are there . who show real courage who bring people together <unk> and to nudge our sons to identify. <unk> with those heroines and to say i want to be on their team because they 're going to be on their team. <unk> the wizard of oz.
