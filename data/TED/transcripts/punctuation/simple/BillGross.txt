 <unk> first got interested in solar energy <unk> my family had moved from fort lee new jersey to california from the snow to lots of heat and gas lines there was gas rationing <unk>. the energy crisis was in full. <unk> and i got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis . i had just taken trigonometry in high school i learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus that got me very excited <unk> . and i really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light so i started this company called solar devices <unk> and this was a company where i built parabolas. <unk> i took metal shop <unk> and i remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and stirling engines and i was building a stirling engine over on the lathe and all the motorcycle guys said you 're building a bong aren 't you and i said no it 's a stirling engine but they didn 't believe me . i sold the plans for this. engine and for this dish in the back of popular science magazine for four dollars each <unk> and i earned enough money to pay for my first year of caltech <unk> it was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech <unk> . and at my first year at caltech i continued the business. <unk> then in the second year of caltech they started grading the whole first year was pass fail but the second year was graded i wasn 't able to keep up with the business <unk> and i ended up with a 25 year detour my dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost <unk> but then i had this big detour first <unk> . the coursework at caltech <unk> then when i graduated from caltech <unk> the ibm pc came out <unk> and i got addicted to the. <unk> a natural language interface to 1 2 3 i started an educational software company after i joined lotus <unk> and then i started idealab so i could have a roof under which i could build multiple companies in succession <unk>. much later in two thousand very recently the new california energy crisis what was purported to be a big energy crisis was coming. and i was trying to figure out if we could build something that. <unk> capitalize on that and get people backup energy in case the crisis really came <unk> . and i started looking at how we could build battery backup systems that could give people five hours ten hours maybe even a full day or three days <unk> ' worth of backup power i 'm glad you heard earlier today batteries are unbelievably. lack density. compared to fuel so much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries you 'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space. just to give yourself four hours of battery backup <unk> . and i concluded after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy flywheels different formulations of batteries it just wasn 't practical to store energy <unk> . so what about making energy <unk> maybe we could make energy <unk> i tried to figure out maybe solar 's become attractive it 's been twenty five years since i was doing this let me go back and look at what 's been happening with solar cells . and the price had gone down from ten dollars a watt to. <unk> about four or five dollars a watt but it stabilized <unk> and it needed to get much lower to be cost effective . i studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells and was looking for ways we could make solar cells more inexpensively. a lot of new things are happening to do that but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy some people say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life if we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells. that will become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take silicon put it in an oven at one thousand six hundred f for seventeen hours to make the cells a lot of people are working to try and reduce <unk>. <unk> that but i didn 't have anything to contribute so i tried to figure out what other way could we try to make cost effective solar electricity <unk> what if we collect the sun with a large reflector like i had been thinking. <unk> in high school <unk> but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper. concentrate it to a small converter <unk> and then the conversion device wouldn 't have to be as expensive because it 's much smaller rather than solar cells which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from . this seemed practical now because a lot of new technologies had come in the twenty five years since i had last looked at it there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques not to mention really cheap miniature motors brushless motors servomotors stepper motors that are used in printers and scanners. of course inexpensive microprocessors. and a very important breakthrough genetic algorithms i 'll be very short on genetic algorithms it 's a powerful way of solving intractable problems. using natural selection you take a problem that you can 't solve with a pure mathematical answer <unk> you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing <unk> . you add sex where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations. and you use natural selection to kill off. solutions usually with a genetic algorithm on a computer today with a three gigahertz processor . you can solve many many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes <unk> so we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms. to create a new type of concentrator and i 'll show you what we came up with traditionally concentrators look like this those shapes are parabolas . they take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot <unk> they have to track the sun. <unk> they have to point directly at the sun <unk> they usually have a one degree acceptance angle once they 're more than a degree off none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus <unk> so we tried to come up with a <unk>. collector that would gather much more than one degree of light with no moving parts <unk> so we created a genetic algorithm to try this out we made a model in excel of a multisurface reflector and an amazing. <unk> from trying a billion cycles a billion different attempts . with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light from the most angles over a day from the sun <unk> and this is the shape that evolved <unk> . it 's this non tracking collector with these six tuba like horns <unk> . and each of them collect light in the following way if the sunlight strikes right here it might bounce right to the center the hot spot directly <unk> but if the sun is off axis and comes from the. <unk> it might hit two places and take two bounces <unk> so for direct light it takes only one bounce for off axis light it might take two and for extreme off axis it might take three . your efficiency goes down with more bounces because you lose about ten percent with each bounce <unk> but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle . so about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component . solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though on an average adjusted day a solar cell because the sun 's moving across the sky. <unk> the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off axis angles it collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day <unk> so even this although it was great with no moving parts <unk>. we could achieve high temperatures wasn 't enough we needed to beat solar cells <unk> so we took a look at another idea <unk> we looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track <unk> so what you see here is twelve separate petals that each could be controlled with individual. <unk> microprocessors that would only cost a dollar <unk> you can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes <unk>. for a dollar <unk> so we can control all twelve of these petals for under fifty dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more but only move the petals the whole system would have a much lower profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours. <unk> a day now that we have concentrated sunlight what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity <unk> . so we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to convert sunlight <unk> or heat to electricity <unk> . and one of the great ones of all time <unk> james watt 's steam engine of one thousand seven hundred and eighty eight was a major major breakthrough <unk> james watt didn 't actually invent the steam. <unk> industrial revolution and ships and locomotives <unk> but they 're usually good to be large. <unk> so they 're not good for distributed power generation they 're also very high pressure so they 're dangerous another type of engine is the hot air engine and the hot air engine also was not invented <unk>. <unk> by robert stirling but robert stirling came along in one thousand eight hundred and sixteen and radically improved it this engine because it was so interesting it only worked on air no steam. <unk> came along and also he didn 't invent the internal combustion engine <unk> he just refined it he showed it in paris in one thousand eight hundred and sixty seven and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up you could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space . and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications so once you have mobility. you 're making a lot of engines because you 've got lots of units as. <unk> this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn 't so because it went into mass production costs were reduced one hundred years of refinement emissions were reduced . tremendous production value there have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built compared to thousands of stirling engines built and not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore only large ones for big operations <unk> . so after looking at these three and forty seven others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the. <unk> best one to use i want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works <unk> so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because. it was practical. weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around but if you 're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn 't matter so much we also discovered that efficiency doesn 't matter so much if your energy source is. normally efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine <unk> . but if your fuel source is free <unk> then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine <unk> so you don 't want to optimize for efficiency you want to optimize for power per dollar <unk> . so using that new twist with the new criteria we thought we could relook at the stirling. <unk> and also bring genetic algorithms in basically robert stirling didn 't have gordon moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power <unk> so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to <unk>. <unk> make that concentrator which didn 't work out for us to optimize the stirling engine and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar <unk> . <unk> works <unk> the simplest heat engine or hot air engine of all time would be this take a box a steel canister with a piston put a flame under it the piston moves up . take it off the flame and pour water on it or let it cool down the piston moves down that 's a heat engine that 's the most fundamental heat engine you could have . the problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent. <unk> you 're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time . and you 're only getting power from the air that 's heating at the same time but you 're wasting energy heating and cooling the metal <unk> so someone came up with a very clever idea instead of heating and cooling the whole cylinder what about if you put a displacer inside a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth <unk> . you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you 're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end. the air . that allows you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent <unk> and then robert stirling came along with this genius idea <unk> which was well i 'm still not heating the metal now with this <unk>. <unk> kind of engine <unk> but i 'm still reheating all the air <unk> i 'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time what about if i put a thermal sponge in the middle in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold . <unk> fine wires and cracked glass and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge so when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end it puts some heat into the sponge <unk> and then <unk>. <unk> when the air comes back after it 's been cooled it picks up that heat again <unk> so you 're reusing your energy five or six times <unk> . <unk> genius invention of robert stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical like i found out when i made the real simple version in high school to very potentially possible <unk> . once you get the efficiency up if you can design this to be low enough cost <unk> so we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible <unk> we built a huge mathematical model of how a stirling engine works <unk> we applied the genetic algorithm . we got the results from that for the optimal engine. <unk> we built engines so we built one hundred different engines over the last two years we measured each one we readjusted the model to what we measured and then we led that to the current prototype . it led to a very compact inexpensive engine and this is what the engine looks like let me show you what it looks like in real life <unk> . so this is the engine it 's. just a small cylinder down here <unk> which holds the generator inside and all the linkage <unk> and it 's the hot cap the hot cylinder on the top. this part gets hot this part is cool. <unk> comes out. <unk> the exact converse is also true if you put electricity in . this will get hot and this will get cold you get refrigeration <unk> so it 's a complete reversible cycle a very efficient cycle and quite a simple thing to make . so now you put the two things together <unk> so you have the engine what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center the petals track and the engine. <unk> the concentrated sunlight takes that heat and turns it into electricity this is what the first prototype of our system looked like with the petals and the engine in the center <unk> this is being run out in the sun <unk> and now i want to show you what the <unk>. <unk> actual thing looks like . <unk> so this is a unit with the twelve petals these petals cost about a dollar each they 're lightweight injection molded plastic <unk> aluminized <unk> . the mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one <unk> . there are thermocouples on the engine little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it . when the sun comes out in the morning the petals will seek the sun. find it by searching for the highest temperature about a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start. and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day. six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky . a critical part that we can take advantage of is that we have these inexpensive microprocessors and each of these petals is autonomous and each of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user setup <unk> so you don 't have to tell what latitude longitude you 're at what your roof slope angle is. <unk> orientation it doesn 't really care what it does is it searches to find the hottest spot it searches again a half an hour later <unk> a day later a month later it basically figures out where <unk>. <unk> on earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves <unk> so you don 't have to actually enter anything about that . <unk> we have. ac and dc get twelve volts dc <unk> so that could be used for certain applications we have an inverter in there so you get one hundred and seventeen volts ac . and you also get hot water the hot water 's optional you don 't have to use it it will cool itself <unk> but you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher because some of the heat that you 'd normally be rejecting you can now use as useful energy whether it 's for a pool or hot water <unk> . let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running. this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking <unk> and what they do is step . very coarsely at first and very finely afterward once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the sun <unk> they slow down and do a fine search <unk> then the petals will move into position <unk> and the engine will start. <unk> we 've been working on this for the last two years we 're very excited about the progress we have a long way to go though <unk>. this is how we envision it would be in a residential installation you 'd probably have more than one unit on your roof it. could be on your roof your backyard or somewhere else . you don 't have to have enough units to power your entire house you just save money with each incremental one you add <unk> so you 're still using the grid potentially in this type of application to be your backup supply of. <unk> use these at night and you can 't use these on cloudy days <unk> but by reducing your energy use . pretty much at the peak times usually when you have your air conditioning on or other times like that. this generates the peak power at the peak usage time so it 's very complementary in that sense <unk> this is how we would envision a residential application <unk> we also think there 's very big potential for energy farms . <unk> especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun it 's a really good combination of those two factors it turns out there 's a lot of powerful sun all around the world obviously but in. <unk> special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these. and also in many more places where there is high wind power <unk> so an example of that is here 's the map of the united states pretty much everywhere that 's not green or blue is a really <unk>. <unk> ideal place but even the green or blue areas are good just not as good as the places that are red orange and yellow <unk> but the hot spot right around las vegas and death valley. <unk> that you couldn 't use solar energy you could use it anywhere on earth it just affects the payback period if you 're comparing to grid supplied electricity <unk> but if you don 't have grid supplied electricity <unk> then the question of payback is a different <unk>. one entirely it 's just how many watts do you get per dollar and how could you benefit from that to change your life in some way. <unk> this is the map of the whole earth . <unk> you can see a huge swathe in the middle <unk> where a large part of the population is there 's tremendous chances for solar energy and of course <unk> look at africa <unk>. <unk> the potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable and i 'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that so in conclusion i would say my journey <unk>. has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light <unk> . and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists <unk> . we believe we 're getting very close. <unk> to something practical and affordable our short term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and our longer term goal is to be. less than a five year payback and at less than a five year payback <unk> this becomes very economic <unk> so you don 't have to just have a feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of these it just makes economic <unk>. <unk> sense right now solar paybacks are between thirty and fifty years if you get it down below five years then it 's almost a no brainer because the interest to own it. <unk> else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one <unk> so that 's our real powerful goal that we 're really shooting for in the company two other things that i learned that were very surprising to me. one was. how casual we are about energy <unk> i was walking from the elevator over here and even just looking at the stage right now. <unk> lights right now there 's ten thousand watts of light pouring on the stage one horsepower is seven hundred and forty six watts at full power so there 's basically fifteen horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit . not to mention the two hundred horses that are probably running right now to keep the air conditioning going . and it 's just amazing <unk> walk in the elevator and there 's lights on in the elevator of course now i 'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by. <unk> everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it 's so cheap <unk> . and it 's cheap because we 've been subsidized by energy that 's been concentrated by the sun <unk> basically <unk> oil is solar energy concentrate it 's been. pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it and we don 't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are i think and it would be great if we could. <unk> make our energy usage renewable where as we 're using the energy we 're creating it at the same pace <unk> and i really hope we can get there.
