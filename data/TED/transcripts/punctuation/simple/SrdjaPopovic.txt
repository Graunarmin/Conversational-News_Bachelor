 <unk> proud to be here at tedxkrakow i 'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and actually is changing the world <unk> . and whose name is people power i. <unk> or for those of you who are monty python lovers a monty python type of sketch here it is . it is december fifteen two thousand and ten . somebody gives you a bet <unk> you will look at a crystal ball <unk> and you will see the future the future will be accurate <unk> but you need to share it with the world <unk> ok <unk> curiosity killed the cat <unk> . <unk> you take the bet <unk> you look at the crystal ball one hour later <unk> you 're sitting in a building of the. <unk> national tv in a top show <unk> and you tell the story before the end of two thousand and eleven ben ali and mubarak and. gaddafi would be down and prosecuted <unk> . saleh of yemen and assad of syria would be either challenged <unk> or already on their knees <unk> . osama bin laden would be dead <unk> and ratko mladic would be in the hague now. the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face <unk> and then on top of it you add. <unk> people from athens madrid and new york will demonstrate for social justice claiming they are inspired by arabs . next thing you know <unk> two guys in white appear they give you the strange t shirt . take you to the nearest mental institution so i would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon. which is behind what already. seems to be a very bad year for bad guys <unk> and this phenomenon is called people power well. people power has been there for a while it helped gandhi kick the brits from india <unk> it helped martin luther king win his historic racial struggle <unk> . it helped a local lech walesa to kick out one million soviet troops from poland and in beginning the end of the soviet union as we know it. <unk> so what 's new in it what seems to be very new which is the idea i would like to share with you today is that there is a set of rules and skills. which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle if this is true we can help these movements <unk> . well the first one analytic skills i 'll try where it all started in the middle east <unk> and for so. <unk> we were living with a completely wrong perception of the middle east <unk> it was looking like the frozen region . literally a refrigerator <unk> and there were only two types of meal there . steak <unk> which stands for a mubarak ben ali type of military police dictatorship or a potato which stands for a tehran type of theocracies <unk> . and everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions. <unk> mainly secular people stepped out to do the change guess what they didn 't watch the demographics . what is the average age of an egyptian twenty four how long was mubarak in power thirty one so . this system was just obsolete <unk> they expired <unk> and young people of the arab world have awakened one morning <unk> and understood that power lies in their hands <unk> the rest is the year in front of us. <unk> with their rules with their tools with their games and with their language which sounds a little bit strange to me i 'm <unk> thirty eight now <unk> and. can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe it seems that generation y is. coming <unk> now <unk> . let me set another example i 'm meeting different people throughout the world <unk> and they are you know academics and professors and doctors <unk> and they will always talk conditions <unk> they will say. <unk> people power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive they will say people power will work if the annual income of the country is between x and z they will say people power <unk>. <unk> will work only if there is a foreign pressure they will say people power will work only if there is no oil and i mean there is a set of conditions <unk> . <unk> the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions <unk> namely the skills of unity planning and maintaining nonviolent discipline <unk> let me give you an example <unk> i <unk>. come from a country called serbia it took us ten years to unite eighteen opposition party leaders <unk> with their big egos behind one single candidate against <unk>. the balkan dictator slobodan milosevic guess what that was the day of his defeat <unk> . <unk> get rid of their individual symbols <unk> they appear on the street only with the flag of egypt <unk> i will give you a counter example you see nine presidential candidates running against lukashenko <unk> you all know the outcome <unk> . so unity is a big thing <unk> and this can be achieved same with planning <unk> somebody has lied to you about the successful and. spontaneous nonviolent revolution . that thing doesn 't exist in the world whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military somebody was thinking about it before <unk> . now at the end nonviolent discipline <unk> and this is probably the game changer if you maintain nonviolent discipline <unk> you 'll exclusively win <unk> . you have one hundred thousand people in a nonviolent march one idiot or. <unk> guess what takes all the cameras that one guy one single act of violence can literally destroy. your movement <unk> now <unk> . let me move to another place it 's the selection of strategies and tactics there are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow first you start small second you pick the battles you can win <unk> . it 's only two hundred of us in this room we won 't call for the march of a million but what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night. <unk> over krakow the city will know <unk> so we pick tactics accommodated to the event <unk> especially this thing we call the small. tactics of dispersion they 're very useful. in. violent oppression we are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used it was on tahrir square. <unk> international community was constantly frightened that you know the. islamists will overtake the revolution what they organized. christians protecting muslims where they are praying a coptic wedding cheered by thousands of muslims the world has just changed the picture but somebody was thinking about this previously <unk>. <unk> so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place <unk> shouting <unk> and you know showing off in front of the security forces. <unk> dynamic <unk> and this is a dynamic that analysts normally don 't see this is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side <unk> and enthusiasm and humor on another <unk>. <unk> side so it works like in a video game <unk> you have the fear high <unk> you have status quo <unk> you have the enthusiasm higher <unk> . <unk> from the police in egypt <unk> you can tell that something is happening there <unk> and then it 's about the humor . humor is such a powerful game changer and of course it was very big in poland you know. we were just a small group of crazy students in serbia when we made this big skit we put the big petrol barrel with a. portrait of mr president on it in the middle of the main street there was a hole in the top so you could literally come put a coin. <unk> in get a baseball bat and. hit his face . sounds loud and within minutes <unk> we were sitting in a nearby caf having coffee <unk> and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing well . that 's just the beginning of the show the real show starts when the police appears . what will they do. <unk> were nowhere to be seen we were like three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar. arrest the shoppers <unk> with kids doesn 't make sense of course you could bet <unk> they did the most stupid thing <unk> they arrested the barrel . and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policemen dragging it to the police car that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have . so i mean these are the things you can do <unk> and you can always use humor there is also one big thing about humor. <unk> really hurts <unk> because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously when you start to mock them <unk> it hurts <unk> . now <unk> everybody is talking about his majesty the internet and it is also a very useful skill. but don 't rush to label things like a facebook revolution twitter revolution don 't. <unk> with the substance . it is true that the internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper they also make it a bit safer for the participants because they give partial anonymity <unk> . we 're watching the great example of something else the internet can do <unk> it can put the price tag of state sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester this is the famous group we are all khaled said. <unk> made by wael ghonim in egypt and his friend this is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police this is how he became known to the public <unk> and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel 's back <unk> . but here is also the bad news <unk> the nonviolent struggle is won in the real world in the streets . you will never change your society towards democracy or you know the economy if you sit down and. <unk> there are risks to be taken <unk> and there are living people who are winning. the struggle. <unk> well the million dollar question what will happen in the arab world <unk> . and though young people from the arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators <unk> shaking the region <unk> . kind of persuading the clever kings from jordan and morocco to do substantial reforms <unk> it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome <unk> . whether the egyptians and tunisians will make it through the transition. or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts <unk> whether the syrians. will maintain nonviolent discipline. <unk> faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war . <unk> the transitions and democracy or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds <unk> we cannot tell the. same works for the western sector where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world occupying this occupying that . are they going to become the world wave are they going to find their skills their enthusiasm and their strategy. to find what they really want and push for the reform. or will they just stay complaining about the endless list. of the things they hate <unk> . this is the difference between the two paths now <unk> what do the statistics have my friend maria stephan 's book. talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle and there are some shocking. <unk> years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy <unk> you will see that out of sixty seven different cases in fifty of these cases it was nonviolent struggle. which was the key power this is one more reason to look at this phenomenon this is one more reason to look at generation y . enough for me to give them credit <unk> . <unk> and hope. that they will find their skills. and their courage to use nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world <unk> thank you.
