 <unk> was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future . he had a vision <unk> . when he got out he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision <unk> . he 'd spent ten thousand dollars to buy a. <unk> website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . it was my first week in federal prison <unk> . and i was learning quickly that it wasn 't what you see on tv in fact it was teeming with smart <unk> ambitious men. business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate . now <unk> ninety five percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside but when they talked about what they did . they talked about it. in a different jargon but the business concepts that they talked about weren 't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton. <unk> you never charge a first time user. focus grouping new product launches <unk> territorial expansion <unk> . but they didn 't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days for the most part <unk> everyone was just trying to survive <unk> . it 's a lot harder than you might think <unk> contrary to what. most people think people. don 't pay <unk> taxpayers don 't pay for your life when you 're in prison you 've got to pay for your own life you 've got to pay for your soap your deodorant <unk> toothbrush toothpaste all of it and it. 's hard for a couple of reasons first everything 's marked up thirty to fifty percent from what you 'd pay on the street and second <unk> . you don 't make a lot of money <unk> i unloaded trucks <unk> that was my full time job unloading trucks at a food warehouse. all kinds of hustles there 's legal hustles <unk> you pay everything in stamps those are the currency you charge another inmate to clean his cell . there 's sort of illegal hustles <unk> like you run a barbershop out of your cell . there 's pretty illegal hustles <unk> you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell and there 's very illegal hustles <unk> which you smuggle. <unk> and just as in the outer world there 's a risk reward tradeoff so the riskier the enterprise the more profitable it can potentially be <unk> you want a cigarette in prison <unk> . three to five dollars <unk> . you want an <unk> <unk> old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head three hundred bucks <unk> . <unk> you want a dirty magazine <unk> well it can be as much as one thousand dollars <unk> . so as you can probably tell one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity <unk> . whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse <unk> . sculpting people 's hair with toenail clippers or constructing. weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs. <unk> prisoners learn how to make do with less and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they 've learned to the outside. and start restaurants <unk> barber shops <unk> personal training businesses <unk> but. there 's no training nothing to prepare them for that no rehabilitation at all in prison <unk> no one to help them write a business plan . figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into. <unk> legal enterprises <unk> no access to the internet even . and then <unk> when they come out most states don 't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background. <unk> so none of us should be surprised that two out of three. within five years <unk> . <unk> i lied to the feds <unk> i lost a year of my life. from it . but when i came out . i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with didn 't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
