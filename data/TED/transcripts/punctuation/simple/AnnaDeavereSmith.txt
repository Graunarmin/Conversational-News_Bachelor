 <unk> a word often enough it becomes you . and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland. <unk> i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder thank god for technology to interview people thinking that if i walked in their words which is also why i don 't wear shoes when i perform. if i walked in their words that i could sort of absorb america i was also inspired by walt whitman who wanted to absorb america and have it absorb him so these four characters are going to be from that. work that i 've been doing for many years now and. well over i don 't know a. couple of thousand people i 've interviewed anybody out here old enough to know studs terkel <unk> that old radio man <unk> so i thought he would be the perfect person to go to. <unk> to ask about a defining moment in american history you know he was born in one thousand nine hundred and twelve the year the titanic sank greatest ship every built hits the tip of an iceberg <unk>. <unk> and bam <unk> it went down <unk> it went down and i came up wow <unk> some century . laughter so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history. <unk> defining moment in american history i don 't think there 's one you can 't say hiroshima that 's a big one i can 't think of any one moment i would say is a defining moment the gradual slippage <unk>. <unk> ' slippage ' is the word used by the people in watergate moral slippage it 's a gradual kind of thing combination of things you see . <unk> tell you a funny little play bit the atlanta airport is a modern airport <unk> and they should leave the gate there these trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination <unk>. and these trains are smooth <unk> and they 're quiet and they 're efficient and there 's a voice on the train <unk> you know the voice was a human voice <unk> you see in the old days we had robots. <unk> got this voice on this train <unk> concourse one <unk> omaha <unk> lincoln concourse two dallas fort worth same voice . just as a train is about to go a young couple rush in and they 're just about to close the pneumatic doors <unk> and that voice <unk> without losing a beat says ' because of late entry. ' just then everybody 's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple 's going like this you know shrinking well i 'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before <unk>. <unk> boarding i do that to steel my nerves and so i imitate a train call holding my hand on my ' george orwell <unk> your time has come. silence and so suddenly they 're looking at me so here i am with the couple the three of us shrinking at the foot of calvary about to be up you know . just then. i see a baby a little baby in the lap of a mother . i know it 's hispanic because she 's speaking spanish to her companion <unk> so i 'm going to talk to the baby <unk> so i say to the baby. <unk> my hand over my mouth because my breath must be one hundred proof <unk> . i say to the baby ' sir or madam what is your considered opinion. of the human species <unk> ' and the baby looks you know the way babies look at you clearly <unk> starts laughing <unk> starts busting out with this crazy little laugh i say ' thank god for a. <unk> of course was tremendous <unk> remember that great scene on the raft remember what huck did you see here 's huck he 's an illiterate. <unk> 's had no schooling but there 's something in him . and the official truth <unk> the truth was the law was that a black man was a property was a thing you see <unk> and huck gets on the raft with a property named jim a slave <unk>. see <unk> and he hears that jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman woman who owns them and huck. <unk> slavers caught up guys chasing slaves looking for jim ' anybody up on that raft with. <unk> goodness of huck that stuff that huck 's been made of you see <unk> all been buried it 's all been buried <unk> so the human touch you see <unk> it 's disappearing <unk> so you ask about a defining moment ain 't no defining moment in american <unk>. <unk> history for me it 's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now where trivia becomes news. <unk> and more and more less and less awareness of the pain. of the other huh you know <unk> i don 't know if you could. use this or not but i was quoting wright morris a writer from nebraska who says ' we 're more and more into communications. and less and less into communication ' okay kids i got to scram got. <unk> talk about risk taking <unk> i 'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want. to do characters that that are likeable well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people. but since this was called risk taking i 'm doing somebody who i never do. because she 's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in . and i 'm doing her because i think we think of risk at a conference like this as a good thing <unk> . but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who 's a wonderful. philosopher who 's as old as studs and was the head of a philosophy great. big philosophy kind of an organization. i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn 't. know that she still wants to know and she said well personally i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university <unk> . and i still feel as though i 've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i 've outlived most of them . and she said and then intellectually <unk> i don 't know enough about the negative imagination and september. <unk> certainly taught us that that 's a whole area we don 't investigate so. this piece is about a negative imagination . it raises questions about what nature is what mother nature is . and about what a risk can be and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women everything i do is word for word off a tape <unk> and i title things because i think people speak in. <unk> this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins . i began to learn how to cover it up . because i didn 't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home . i want everybody to think we were a normal family i mean we had all the materialistic things <unk> but that didn 't make my children pain. <unk> any less that didn 't make their fears subside <unk> . i ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises i didn 't. had no more excuses <unk> and he beat me too <unk> but that didn 't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare <unk> . and i failed them dramatically because i allowed it to go on and on and on but the night that. <unk> myesha got killed and the intensity just. just grew and grew and grew <unk> until one night we came home from getting drugs <unk> . and he got angry with myesha and he started beating her and he put her in a bathtub <unk> oh he would use a belt he had a belt because he had this. warped perverted thing that myesha was having sex. <unk> little brother and they was fondling each other that would be his reason i 'm just. talking about the particular night that she died . and so he put her in the bathtub <unk> and i was in the bedroom with the baby and four months before this happened four months before myesha died <unk> i thought i could really fix this man <unk> so i had a baby by him insane. thinking that if i gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone and it. <unk> didn 't work <unk> and i ended up with three children houston myesha and dominic who was four months old when i came to jail . and i was in the bedroom like i said he had her in the bathroom and he he every time he hit her she would fall and. she would hit her head on the tub . it happened continuously repeatedly i could hear it . but i dared not to move i didn 't move i didn 't even go and see what was happening i just sat there and listened. and then he put her in the hallway he told. her just set there and so she set there for about four or five hours <unk> . and then he told her get up and when she got up she says she couldn 't see <unk> her face was. <unk> had a black eye <unk> all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of its own size . i told him ' let her go to sleep '. he let her go to sleep . the next morning she was dead . he went in to check. <unk> i knew immediately that she was dead <unk> i didn 't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i went in and i put a mirror to her mouth there was no thing nothing . coming out of her mouth <unk> he said <unk> he said <unk> he said ' we can 't we can 't let nobody find out about this ' he say ' you 've got to help me ' i agree <unk> i agree . i mean i 've been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret. so we went to the mall. and we told a police that we had like <unk> lost her that she was missing <unk> we told a security guard. that she was missing . though she wasn 't missing <unk> . and we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard. that we had put on her and then we got the baby and my other child <unk> and we drove out to like. i was so petrified and so numb all i could look was. right on the shoulder of the highway . my own child <unk> . i let that happen to . so that 's an investigation of the negative imagination. <unk> when i started this project called on the road a search for an american character with my tape recorder i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects bull riders cowboys pig farmers. <unk> drum majorettes but i sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show about a race riot. <unk> i went to both two race riots one of which was the los angeles riot and this next piece. is from that because this is what i would say i 've learned the most about race relations from this piece. <unk> it 's a kind of an aria i would say and in many tapes that i have <unk> everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened. because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king it was captured on videotape technology and it was played all over the world everybody thought the four cops would go to jail they did not so there were riots. what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by george bush <unk> sr and. that trial came back with two. two cops going to jail and two. cops declared innocent i was at that trial <unk> and i mean the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot <unk> explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way <unk> . so there was a community that didn 't the korean americans . whose stores had been burned to the ground. <unk> and so this woman mrs young soon han i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race and she asks also a question. that studs talks about this notion of the official truth to question the official truth . so what she 's questioning here she 's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society and this is called . swallowing the bitterness. <unk> the best i watched in korea many luxurious hollywood. lifestyle movie i never saw any poor man any black . until one thousand nine hundred and ninety two i used to believe america was the best i still do i don 't deny that because i. <unk> we were in such turmoil <unk> and having all the financial problems <unk> and all the mental problems <unk> i began to really realize that koreans are <unk>. <unk> completely left out of this society. <unk> who never work. got minimum amount of money to survive <unk> we didn 't get any because we have a car. and. <unk> probably think that they won by the trial <unk> i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the day they were having a party they celebrated all of south. <unk> central all the churches and they say ' well finally justice has been done in this society '. well what about victims ' rights . they got their rights by destroying innocent korean merchants. <unk> of respect as i do for dr martin king <unk> . he is the only model for black community i don 't care jesse jackson <unk> . he is the model of. <unk> they destroyed innocent people. and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way <unk> . i was. swallowing the bitterness <unk> sitting here alone and watching them they became. <unk> so hilarious but i was happy for them i was glad for them. rights. for. over two centuries and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities hispanic asian we would suffer more. in the mainstream that 's why i understand that 's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict but. i wish that i wish that i wish that i could be part. of the enjoyment <unk> i wish that i could live together with black people . but after the riot it 's too much difference. <unk> the fire. <unk> is still there how do you. <unk> the other reason that i don 't wear shoes. is just in case i really feel like i have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else 's shoes <unk> and i told you that in you know i didn 't give you the. <unk> i thought that i was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and i got sidetracked on race relations <unk> . finally <unk> i did find a bull rider two years ago and i 've been going to the rodeos with him and we 've bonded <unk> and. he 's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he 's a republican i won 't say anything about my party affiliation but. anyway so this is. <unk> this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do i think there 's a real lesson in this and this is called toughness . i 'm an optimist i mean basically i 'm an optimist i mean you know i mean it 's like my wife jolene her family 's always saying you know you ever think he 's just a born loser it seems like he has so much. <unk> but then when that bull stepped on my kidney you know i didn 't lose my kidney i could have lost my kidney i kept my kidney so i don 't think i 'm a born loser i think that 's good luck . and i mean funny things like this happen i was in a. doctor 's office last cat scan and there was a reader 's digest <unk> october two thousand and two it was like ' seven ways to get lucky ' and it says if you want to get lucky <unk> you know you 've got to be around positive people <unk> . i mean like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me. <unk> she 's just talking she 's just being nice to you she 's not going to do that ' and then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the internet she said ' look who she is you 're not even going to be able to answer her questions ' . and she was saying you 're going to make me look like an idiot because i 've never been to college and i wouldn 't be talking professional or anything i said ' well look the woman talked to me for four hours you know if i wasn 't talking you. <unk> me to talk i don 't think she would even come out here ' . confidence <unk> well i think i ride more out of. out of determination than confidence i mean confidence is like you know you 've been on that bull before you know you can ride him i mean confidence is kind of like being cocky but in a good way <unk> but determination you know it. <unk> always said when i was a boy he say ' you know you got more try than any kid i ever seen ' and try and determination is the same thing determination is like you 're going to hang on that bull even if you 're riding upside down determination 's like you 're going to ride till your head hits the back. <unk> think i know what beauty is well you know i guess that 'd have to be the rodeo too i mean look how we are the roughy family palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me it 's like you know <unk> racking up. our credit cards on entry fees and gas we ride together we you know we we eat together and we sleep together <unk> i mean i can 't even imagine what it 's going to be like the last. <unk> i have my ranch and everything but i actually don 't even want to think the day that comes i mean i guess it just be like i guess it be like the day my brother died . toughness <unk> . well <unk> we was in west jordan utah and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a you know. busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital and they had to sew me up and straighten my nose. <unk> to put me under. anesthesia or whatever you call it and so. they sewed my face up and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didn 't because i guess. i have a high tolerance for pain . but the good thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose. <unk> out i could breathe <unk> and i hadn 't been able to breathe since i broke my nose in the high school rodeo.
