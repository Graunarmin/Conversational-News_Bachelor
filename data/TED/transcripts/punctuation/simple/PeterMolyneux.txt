 <unk> when i saw a piece of technology called kinect it was called natal. i was inspired and i thought for a moment <unk> maybe it 's possible to address that one problem. <unk> to create a character which seemed alive which noticed me that could look me in the eyes. and feel real <unk> and sculpt a story about our relationship <unk> and so. a year ago <unk> i showed this off at a computer show called. e3 and this was a piece of technology with someone called claire interacting with this boy <unk> and there was a huge row. <unk> online. about hey this can 't be real and so i waited till now. to have an actual demo of the real tech now this tech. incorporates three big elements the first is a kinect camera which will be out in november <unk> some incredible. ai that was hidden in the dusty vaults. <unk> collecting dust in microsoft . plus our quite crude attempts at ai at a company called lionhead . mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea . to create. a real <unk> living being in a computer. <unk> be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick <unk> . but it 's a trick that actually works <unk> so why don 't we go over and have a look at. the demo now this is dimitri dimitri just waggle your. arm around now you notice he 's sitting there are no controllers no keyboards. <unk> just going to use his hand his body and his voice just like humans interact with their hands body and voice <unk> so let 's move forward <unk> . you 're going to meet milo for the first time . we had to give him a problem. because when we first created milo we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat to be honest with you he was quite a know it all and he wanted to kind of make you laugh. <unk> laugh <unk> so the problem we introduced to him was this he 's just moved house <unk> he 's moved from london. to new england over in america his parents are too busy. to listen to his problems <unk> and that 's when he starts almost conjuring you up <unk> so here he is walking through. <unk> and you 're able to interact with his world the cool thing is what we 're doing is we 're changing the mind of milo constantly . that means no two people 's milos can be the same you 're actually sculpting a human being here <unk> . so he 's discovering the garden you 're helping him discover the garden by. just. pointing out these snails. <unk> at the start by the way if you are a boy <unk> it 's snails if you 're a girl it 's butterflies because what we found was that. girls hate snails . so remember this is the first time you 've met him and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious . <unk> by the way is fully ai driven we have complete control over his blush responses. the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress . we actually do something called body matching if you 're leaning forward <unk> he will try and slightly change the neuro linguistic nature of his of his face . because we went out with this strong idea how can we make you believe that something 's real. now we 've used the hand the other thing to use is your body. <unk> why not just instead of. pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad why not use your body just to lean on the chair again <unk> relaxed <unk> you can lean back . but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way. <unk> so dimitri 's now going to use he 's used his hand he 's used his body he 's now going to use the other thing which is essential and that 's his voice now . the thing about voice is <unk> our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful isn 't it . it never works you order an airline ticket you end up in timbuktu. so we 've tackled. <unk> squashing a snail may not seem important but remember <unk> even this choice will affect how milo develops . do you want milo to squash it when you see the microphone. <unk> we 're using there is we 're using something a piece of technology called tellme it 's a company that microsoft acquired some years ago <unk> we 've got a database of words which we recognize we pick those words out . we also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of. of dimitri 's voice or the user 's voice. <unk> now we need to have a bit more engagement and again <unk> what we can do is we can look at the body. very very interesting that that men more than women tend to be more competitive here. <unk> they 're fine with teaching milo for the first few throws but then they want to beat milo <unk> where women. <unk> they 're more nurturing about this. <unk> this is skimming stones <unk> how do you skim <unk>. stones <unk> you stand up <unk> and you. skim the stone it 's that simple . just recognizing your body recognizing the body 's motions the tech <unk> understanding that you 've gone from sitting down to standing up. <unk> again all of this is done in the way us humans do things and that 's crucially important. if we want milo to appear real. <unk> see if you to do any better. <unk> milo 's being called back in by his parents giving us time to be alone. and to help him out basically the bit that we missed at the start his parents had asked him to clean up his room and we 're going to help him with this now but this is going to be an introduction <unk>. and this is all about the deep psychology that we 're trying to use we 're trying to introduce you. to what i believe is the most wonderful part <unk> you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo . now to do that we needed a set up like a magician <unk>. <unk> we did was we needed to give milo this big problem. <unk> just spilled. a plate of sausages on the floor on the brand new carpet we 've all done it as parents we 've all done it as children . now 's a chance for dimitri to kind of reassure and calm milo down it 's all been too much for him he 's just moved house he 's got no friends . now is the time when we open. <unk> that portal and allow you to talk to milo female voice why. don 't you try saying something encouraging to cheer milo up dimitri . come on milo you know what parents are like they 're always getting stressed milo . what do they want to come here for anyway <unk> we don 't know. <unk> you 've got a new school to go to you 're going to meet loads of cool new friends milo i. just really miss my old house that 's all dimitri well this. is a pretty awesome house milo you 've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. <unk> he recognizes you and i promise you if you 're sitting in front of this screen that is a truly wonderful moment . <unk> and we 're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life and it goes on <unk> and he has you know . many adventures some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging he 's got to go to school . the cool thing is that we 're doing as well <unk> as you interact with him you 're able to put things into his world he recognizes objects . his mind is based in a cloud . that means milo 's mind. millions of people use it will get smarter and cleverer he 'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words <unk> . but for me this is a wonderful opportunity where technology at last can be connected with <unk> . where i am no longer restrained by the finger i hold in my hand as far as a computer game 's concerned. or by the blandness of not being noticed if you 're watching a film. <unk> or a book and i love those revolutions and i love the future that milo brings <unk> thank you very much.
