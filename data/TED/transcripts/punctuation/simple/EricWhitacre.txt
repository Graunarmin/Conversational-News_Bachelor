 <unk> i had. maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life i was in the third year of my seven year undergraduate degree . i took a couple victory laps in there and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california. <unk> and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus and we we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains . and there were crickets and and birds and frogs making noise and as we sat there . over the mountains coming in from the north were these steven spielbergian clouds. rolling toward us <unk> and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley <unk> so help me god every single animal in that. <unk> place stopped making noise at the same time . this electric hush as if they could sense what was about to happen <unk> and then the clouds came over us <unk> and then <unk> boom this massive thunderclap and. sheets of rain it was just extraordinary and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz. <unk> decided to set it to music a piece for choir called cloudburst which is the piece that we 'll perform for you in just a moment now. fast forward to just three years ago <unk>. and we released to youtube this the virtual choir project one hundred and eighty five singers from twelve different countries <unk> you can see my little video there. conducting these people <unk> . <unk> alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home two years ago on this very stage <unk> we premiered. virtual choir two . two thousand and fifty two singers from fifty eight different countries. <unk> this time performing a piece that i had written called sleep and then just last spring we released virtual choir three . <unk> had written this time nearly four thousand singers from seventy three different countries . and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this . he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could could we do this. <unk> in real time could we have people singing. together in real time and with the help of skype that is what we are going to attempt today <unk> . now we 'll perform cloudburst for you the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage <unk> i 'm joined by. singers from cal state long beach cal state fullerton. and riverside community college some of the best amateur choirs in the country and. <unk> and in the second half of the piece the virtual choir will join us <unk> thirty different singers from thirty different countries <unk> now <unk> we 've pushed the technology as far as it can go but there 's still <unk>. less than a second of latency but in musical terms that 's a lifetime we deal in milliseconds <unk> so what i 've done is i 've adapted cloudburst so that it embraces the. <unk> performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together so with deep humility and for your approval we present. so. the. <unk> no. <unk> in real time. <unk> no. <unk> so. <unk> far. <unk> into. the. <unk> time.
