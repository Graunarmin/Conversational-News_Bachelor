 <unk> a scientist who works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants i 've been doing this for a long time . and i want to tell you these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will. but also these cultures <unk> these indigenous cultures are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves . and the greatest and most endangered species in the amazon rainforest is not the jaguar it 's not the harpy eagle . it 's the isolated and uncontacted tribes. <unk> now four years ago i injured my foot in a climbing accident. and i went to the doctor <unk> she gave me heat <unk> she gave me cold <unk> aspirin <unk> narcotic painkillers. cortisone shots it didn 't work . several months later <unk> i was in the northeast amazon <unk> walked into a village <unk> and the shaman said you. <unk> and i 'll never forget this as long as i live <unk> he looked me in the face and he said take off your shoe and give me your machete . he walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern <unk> threw it in the fire <unk> applied it to my foot <unk> . threw it in a pot of water <unk> and had me drink the tea <unk> the pain disappeared. for seven months when it came back i went to see the shaman again he gave me the same treatment <unk> and i 've been. <unk> cured for three years now who would you rather be treated by now. make no mistake western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised but there 's. plenty of holes in it where 's the cure for breast cancer where 's the cure for schizophrenia where 's the cure for acid reflux where 's the cure for insomnia. <unk> fact is that these people can sometimes sometimes sometimes cure things we cannot . here you see a medicine man in the northeast amazon treating leishmaniasis a really nasty protozoal disease. that afflicts twelve million people around the world western treatment are injections of antimony <unk> they 're painful <unk> they 're expensive. <unk> and they 're probably not good for your heart it 's a heavy metal <unk> this man cures it with three plants from the amazon rainforest <unk> this is the magic frog . my colleague the late great loren mcintyre discoverer of the source lake of the amazon laguna mcintyre in the peruvian andes was lost on the peru brazil border about thirty years ago <unk> . he was rescued by a group of isolated indians called the matss . they beckoned for him to follow them into the forest which he did there they took out palm leaf. <unk> baskets there they took out these green monkey frogs these are big suckers they 're like this and they began licking them . it turns out they 're highly hallucinogenic . mcintyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of high times magazine you see <unk>. <unk> have friends in all sorts of strange cultures <unk> this guy decided he would go down to the amazon and give it a whirl or give it a lick. <unk> and he did . and he wrote my blood pressure went through the roof <unk> i lost full control of my bodily functions <unk> i passed out in a heap <unk> . i woke up in a hammock six hours later <unk> felt like god for two days . an italian chemist read this and said i 'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog what 's this about the change in blood pressure. who 's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog <unk> and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug resistant staph aureus . how ironic if these isolated indians and their magic frog prove to be one of the cures <unk> . here 's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest amazon in the middle of a yage ceremony <unk> i took him to los angeles to meet a foundation. <unk> officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture this fellow looked at the medicine man and he said you didn 't go to medical school did you. and the spirit <unk> western medicine can 't touch those <unk> i cure them . but all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines <unk> this is a viper from brazil <unk> the venom of which was studied at the universidade de so paulo here . <unk> this is a frontline treatment for hypertension hypertension <unk> causes over ten percent of all deaths on the planet every day this is a $ four billion. industry based on venom from a brazilian snake and the brazilians did not get a nickel <unk> . this is not an acceptable way of doing business <unk> . the rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on earth <unk> there 's a saying in suriname that i dearly love. <unk> hold answers to questions we have yet to ask . but as you all know it 's rapidly disappearing here in brazil in the amazon <unk> around the world <unk> . i took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the xingu indigenous reserve in the state of mato grosso to the northwest of here . the top half of the picture you see where the indians live <unk> the line through the middle is the eastern. <unk> border of the reserve top half indians <unk> bottom half white guys <unk> . top half wonder drugs <unk> bottom half just a bunch of skinny ass cows <unk> . top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs <unk> bottom half. carbon in the atmosphere where it 's driving climate change in fact. <unk> the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere. is forest destruction <unk> . but in talking about destruction <unk> it 's important to keep in mind that the amazon is the mightiest landscape of all . it 's a place of beauty and wonder . the biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest tips the scale at ninety pounds <unk> the goliath bird eating spider is the world 's largest spider it 's found in the amazon as well. <unk> well the harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet <unk> and the black cayman. these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton <unk> they 're known to be man eaters . the anaconda <unk> the largest snake <unk> the capybara <unk> the largest rodent a specimen. from here in brazil tipped the scale at two hundred and one pounds. let 's visit where these creatures live the northeast amazon <unk> home to the <unk> akuriyo tribe <unk> uncontacted peoples. hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination <unk> . these are the people who know nature best these are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature. <unk> by our standards some would dismiss these people as primitive they don 't know how to make fire or they didn 't when they were first contacted . but they know the forest far better than we do . the akuriyos have <unk> thirty five words for honey <unk> and other indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm . here you see the face of my friend pohnay . when i was a teenager rocking out to the rolling stones in my hometown of new orleans pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the. <unk> northeast amazon in a small band . looking for game <unk> looking for medicinal plants looking for a wife <unk> in other small nomadic bands <unk> . but it 's people like these that know things that we don 't <unk> . and they have lots of lessons to teach us <unk> . however if you go into most of the forests of the amazon <unk> there are no indigenous peoples <unk> this is what you find. rock carvings which indigenous peoples <unk> uncontacted peoples used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe <unk> these cultures that once danced <unk> . made love <unk> sang to the gods <unk> worshipped the forest all that 's left is an imprint in stone as you see here . let 's move to the western. <unk> which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples <unk> each of these dots represents a small uncontacted tribe and the big reveal today is we believe there <unk>. <unk> are fourteen or fifteen isolated groups in the colombian amazon alone . <unk> and i think it is their human right to remain so why are these the tribes that hide from man here 's why <unk> obviously some of this was set off in <unk>. but at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade . the demand for natural rubber which came from the amazon <unk> set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush . rubber for bicycle tires <unk> rubber for automobile tires. <unk> rubber for zeppelins <unk> . it was a mad race to get that rubber <unk> and the man on the left julio arana is one of the true thugs of the story. his people his company <unk> and other companies like them. killed massacred <unk> tortured <unk> butchered indians like the witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide <unk> . even today when people come out of the forest the story seldom has a happy ending these are nukaks they were contacted in the. 80s within a year everybody over forty was dead and. remember these are preliterate societies the elders are the libraries <unk> every time a shaman dies it 's as if. a library has burned down they have been forced off their lands <unk> the drug traffickers have taken over the nukak lands. <unk> live as beggars in public parks in eastern colombia . from the <unk> nukak lands i want to take you to the southwest to the most spectacular landscape in the world <unk> chiribiquete national park . it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the colombian government and colombian colleagues it has now. expanded it 's bigger than the state of maryland it is a treasure trove of botanical diversity. <unk> by my mentor richard schultes seen here atop the bell mountain the sacred mountains of the <unk> karijonas and let me show you what it looks like today <unk> . flying over <unk>. realize that these lost world mountains are still lost no scientist has been atop them in fact nobody has been atop the bell mountain since <unk>. <unk> end up here with the bell mountain just to the east of the picture let me show you what it looks like. <unk> today . not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity not only is it home to three isolated tribes <unk> but it 's the greatest treasure trove of pre colombian art in the world . over two hundred thousand paintings <unk> the dutch scientist thomas van der hammen described this as the sistine chapel. of the amazon rainforest but. <unk> down to the southeast again in the colombian amazon remember the colombian amazon is bigger than new england . the amazon 's a big forest and brazil 's got a big part of it but not all of it moving down to these two national parks cahuinari and pur. in the colombian amazon that 's the brazilian border to the right. it 's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples to the trained eye you can look at the roofs of these. these longhouses . and see that there 's cultural diversity these are in fact different tribes . as isolated as these areas are let me show you how the outside world is crowding in . here we see trade and transport increased in putumayo with the diminishment of the civil war in colombia <unk> the outside world. is showing up to the north we have illegal gold mining also from the east from brazil. <unk> 's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes <unk> . we see illegal logging coming from the south <unk> and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into brazil . this in the past is why you didn 't mess with isolated indians and if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry <unk> here 's why. <unk> this looks like a hangar from the brazilian amazon <unk> this is an art exhibit in havana cuba . a group called los carpinteros this is their perception of why you shouldn 't mess with uncontacted indians . but the world is changing <unk> these are mashco piros on the brazil peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners. and timber people and in peru there 's a very nasty business <unk> it 's called human safaris <unk> they will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture of. course when you give them clothes when you give them tools you also give them diseases we call these inhuman safaris . these are indians again on the peru border who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries <unk> they want to get in there and turn them into christians. we know how that turns out what 's to be done . introduce technology to the contacted tribes not the uncontacted tribes <unk> in a culturally sensitive way <unk> this. is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology we 've done this now. <unk> over thirty tribes <unk> . mapped managed and increased protection of over seventy million acres of ancestral rainforest . so this allows the indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny <unk> . they also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out . <unk> trained as indigenous park rangers <unk> patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay <unk> . this is a picture of actual contact . these are chitonahua indians on the brazil peru border they 've come out of the jungle asking for help <unk> . they were shot at. <unk> is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today and it has to stop . but let me conclude by saying . this work can be spiritually rewarding but. it 's difficult. and it can be dangerous two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash. <unk> of a small plane they were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes <unk> . so the question is in conclusion is what the future holds . these are the uray people in brazil what does the future hold for them and what does the future hold for us <unk> . let 's think differently <unk> let 's make a better world. <unk> the climate 's going to change <unk> let 's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse <unk> let 's live on a planet. full of luxuriant vegetation in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation can maintain that mystery. and that knowledge if they so choose <unk> let 's live in a world. where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us. <unk> with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs thanks again.
