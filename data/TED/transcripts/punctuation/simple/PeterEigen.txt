 <unk> am going to speak about corruption but i would like to. juxtapose. two different things one is the large global economy the large globalized. <unk> the other one is the small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions. to govern to shape <unk> this economy <unk> because there is. this. this asymmetry <unk> which. creates basically failing governance failing governance in many areas in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of. <unk> the environment in the area of exploitation of women and children <unk> in the area of. climate change in all the areas in which we really need. a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into. <unk> in a worldwide. arena . and i think corruption . and the fight against corruption and the impact of corruption is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate. what i mean with this failure of governance <unk> let me talk about my own experience <unk> i used to work as. the director of the world bank office in nairobi for. <unk> africa <unk> . at that time <unk> i noticed that corruption <unk> that grand corruption <unk> that systematic corruption <unk> . was undermining everything we were trying to do . and therefore <unk> i began to not only try to protect. the work of the world bank our own projects our own programs against corruption <unk> but in general i thought. <unk> a system to protect the people in this part of the world. from the ravages of corruption . and as soon as i started this work . i received a memorandum from the world bank <unk> from the legal department first in which they said you are not allowed to do this you are meddling in the internal affairs of our. <unk> this is forbidden by the charter of the world bank so i want you to stop your doings in the meantime i was. chairing donor meetings for instance <unk> in which the various donors <unk> and many of them like to be. in nairobi it is true it is one of the unsafest. cities of the world but they like to be there because the other cities are even less. <unk> and in these donor meetings i noticed that many of the worst projects which were put forward by our clients by the governments . by promoters <unk> . many of them representing suppliers from the north. that the worst projects were realized first <unk> . let me give you an example a huge power project three hundred million dollars . to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable and one of the. <unk> most beautiful areas of. western kenya <unk> . and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits . it had no clients nobody would buy the the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation projects . to the contrary we knew that this project would destroy the environment it would. <unk> which were the basis for the survival of. nomadic groups the samburu and. the turkana in this area so everybody knew this is a not a useless project this is an absolute damaging a terrible project. not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars <unk> and the siphoning off. of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like. <unk> schools like hospitals and so on . and yet we all rejected this project <unk> . none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it and it was the first project to be implemented <unk> . the good projects which we as a donor community would take under our wings <unk> they took years you know you had. too many studies and. very often they didn 't succeed <unk> but these bad projects. <unk> were absolutely damaging for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be resettled they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks . of supplier agencies of. insurance agencies like in germany <unk> hermes <unk> and so on and they came back very very quickly driven by an unholy alliance between. the. powerful elites in the countries there. and the suppliers from the north . now these suppliers were our big companies they were the actors of this global market which i mentioned in the beginning . they were the siemenses of this world <unk> . coming from france from. <unk> from japan from canada from germany and they were systematically driven by systematic large scale corruption <unk> . we are not talking about. fifty thousand dollars here or one hundred thousand dollars there <unk> or one million dollars there <unk> no we are talking about ten million twenty million dollars. on the swiss bank accounts on the bank accounts of liechtenstein of. the president. <unk> this was the reality which i saw and not only one project like that i saw <unk> i would say <unk> over the years i worked in africa i saw hundreds of projects like this <unk> . and so i became convinced. that it is this systematic corruption. which is perverting economic policy making in these countries which. <unk> the conflicts for the violence for the desperation in many of these countries. <unk> that we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line that we have. more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world <unk> twice that number. more than two billion people without sanitation and so on and the consequent illnesses of. <unk> mothers and children <unk> . still <unk> child mortality of more than ten million people every year children dying before they are five years old . the cause of this is to a large extent grand corruption <unk> . now why did the world bank. not let me do this work. <unk> found out afterwards <unk> after i left under a big fight the world bank . the reason was that the members of the world bank thought that foreign bribery was okay <unk> including germany <unk> . in germany foreign bribery was allowed it was even tax deductible . no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany <unk> but also in france and the uk and scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed not all of. and. this is. the phenomenon which i call failing governance <unk> . because when i then came to germany and started this little ngo here in berlin <unk> at the villa borsig <unk>. we. were told you cannot stop our german exporters from bribing <unk> because we will. <unk> we will lose to the french we will lose to the swedes we 'll lose to the japanese and therefore there was a indeed a prisoner 's dilemma <unk> which made it very difficult. for an individual company an individual exporting country to say we are not going to continue this. deadly <unk> disastrous habit of. large companies to bribe. <unk> so this is what i mean with. a failing governance structure <unk> because even the powerful government which we have in germany comparatively . was not able to say we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad . they needed help <unk> . and the large companies themselves have this dilemma <unk> . many of them didn 't want to bribe many of the german companies for instance believe that they are really producing a. at a good price so they are very competitive they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are <unk> but. they were not allowed to show their strengths <unk> because the world was. eaten up by grand corruption <unk> and. this is why i 'm telling you this civil society rose. <unk> occasion <unk> we had this small ngo transparency international they began to think of. an escape route from this prisoner 's dilemma <unk> and. we developed concepts of collective action <unk> . basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them. how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing. and to make a long story short we managed to eventually. get germany to sign together with the other oecd countries and a few other exporters in <unk>. a convention <unk> under the auspices of the oecd which obliged everybody to change their laws. <unk> in doing this we had to sit together. with the companies <unk> we had here in berlin <unk> at the aspen institute on the wannsee <unk> we had sessions with about twenty captains of industry <unk> . and we discussed with them. what to do about international bribery <unk> in the first session we had three sessions over the course of two years and president von. weizscker by the way <unk> chaired one of the sessions the first one to take the fear away from the. entrepreneurs who were not used to deal with non governmental organizations <unk> and. in the first session they all said this is not bribery what we are doing this is customary there this is what these other cultures demand they even applaud it. <unk> says this today and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing <unk> . but in the second session they admitted already that they would never do this what they are doing in these other countries . here in germany <unk> or in the u k and so on <unk> cabinet ministers would admit this and in the final. <unk> at the aspen institute we had them all sign an open letter to the kohl government at the time requesting that they participate in the oecd convention <unk> . and. this is in my opinion an example of soft power because we we were able to convince them that they had to go with us <unk> we had a longer term. time perspective <unk> we had a broader <unk> geographically much. <unk> constituency we were trying to defend and that 's why the law has changed that 's why siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that 's why <unk>. in some other countries the oecd convention is not yet properly enforced and again civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment . in london for instance where the. <unk> got away with a huge corruption case <unk> which the. serious fraud office tried to prosecute . one hundred million british pounds every year for ten years to one particular official of one particular friendly country . who then bought for for forty four billion pounds of military equipment <unk> . this case <unk> they are not prosecuting in the uk why because they consider this as. contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain civil society is. <unk> pushing civil society is trying to to get a solution to this problem . also in the u k and also in japan <unk> which is not properly enforcing <unk> and so on in germany we are pushing the ratification of the un convention <unk> which is a subsequent convention <unk> . we are germany is not ratifying why because. it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of. deputies in germany we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe. a civil servant <unk> but you are allowed to bribe a deputy <unk> . this is <unk> under german law allowed <unk> . and the members of our parliament don 't want to change this and this is why they can 't sign the u n convention against foreign bribery one of they very very few. <unk> we managed to get on the books with about one hundred and sixty countries all over the world <unk> i see my time is ticking <unk> let me just try to. draw some conclusions from what has happened <unk> i believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting. <unk> one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance . by now the united nations is totally on our side the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus. <unk> under wolfensohn they became i would say the strongest anti corruption agency in the world . most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against. bribery and so on and this is possible because. <unk> society joined. the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem <unk> in the development of remedies in the implementation of reforms <unk> . and then later in the monitoring of reforms . of course <unk> if civil society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into. this responsibility not all civil society. <unk> organizations are. good . the ku klux klan is an ngo so we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself <unk> . they have to have a much more. transparent financial governance they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society. <unk> we also need much more competence of civil society leaders this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin <unk> because we believe. most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general do not focus enough yet . on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society <unk> . but what i 'm saying from my very practical. <unk> civil society does it right and and joins the other actors in particular governments governments and. their international institutions but also large international actors in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility. then in this magical triangle. between civil society government and private sector there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better.
