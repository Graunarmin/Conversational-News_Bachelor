 <unk> if you 're at all like me this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in san francisco <unk> you build experimental kite powered hydrofoils capable of more than thirty knots. <unk> and you realize that there is incredible power in the wind <unk> and it can do amazing things. <unk> and one day a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record <unk> . but kites aren 't just toys like this kites i 'm going to give you a brief history and tell you about the magnificent future of every child 's favorite plaything <unk> . so kites are more than a thousand years old and the chinese used them for military applications and even for. <unk> so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights i 'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man . in one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven a fellow called george pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the english countryside <unk> . then of course at the dawn of aviation <unk> all of the great inventors of the time like hargreaves like langley even alexander graham bell inventor of the telephone who was flying this kite were doing so in the pursuit of aviation. then these two fellows came along <unk> . and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight <unk> so this is of course orville and wilbur wright <unk> and the wright flyer <unk> . and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion where we powered up and took off for the <unk>. <unk> and that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation <unk> but unfortunately it relegated kites once again to be considered children 's toys that was until the 1970s where we had the last energy crisis <unk> . and a fabulous man called miles loyd who lives on the outskirts of san francisco <unk> wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the journal of energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity . the real key observation. <unk> he made is that a free flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a <unk> fixed wing turbine <unk> . so turbines grew and they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height <unk> but they can 't really go a lot higher <unk> and more height is where the more wind is and more power as much as twice as much . so cut to now we still have an energy crisis and now we have a climate crisis as well. <unk> well you. know so humans generate about twelve trillion watts or twelve terawatts from fossil fuels <unk> . and al gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets <unk> . and in reality what that means is in the next thirty to forty years we have to make ten. trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar. <unk> terawatts more than enough to supply humanity two hundred times over the majority of it is in the higher altitudes above three hundred feet where we don 't have a technology as yet to get there <unk> . so this is the dawn of the new age of kites this is our test site on maui flying across the sky i 'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power. by every child 's favorite plaything. <unk> as you can tell you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours it makes you a little nauseous <unk> . and here we 're actually generating about ten kilowatts so enough to power probably five united states households with a kite not much larger than this piano <unk> . and the real significant thing here is we 're developing the control systems as did the wright brothers that. <unk> it doesn 't hurt to do it in a location like this either <unk> . so this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow that 's tracing your name in the sky . and this is where we 're actually going so we 're beyond the 12 second steps <unk> and we 're working towards megawatt scale machines that fly at two thousand feet. and generate tons of clean electricity <unk> so you ask how big are those machines. <unk> this paper plane would be maybe a. oop that would be enough to power your cell phone your cessna would be two hundred and thirty killowatts . if you 'd loan me your gulfstream i 'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt if. you give me a seven hundred and forty seven i 'll make six megawatts which is more than the largest wind turbines today <unk> and the spruce goose would be a 15 megawatt wing <unk> . so that is audacious you say <unk> i agree <unk> but audacious is what has happened many times before in history <unk> this is a refrigerator factory. <unk> factory <unk> churning out airplanes for world war ii prior to world war ii they were making one thousand planes a year by one thousand nine hundred and forty five they were making one hundred thousand . with this factory and one hundred thousand planes a year we could make all of america 's electricity in about ten years.
