 <unk> name is amy webb and a few years ago i found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion <unk> . and i. <unk> what 's wrong with me i don 't understand why this keeps happening <unk> so i asked everybody in my life what they thought. i turned to my grandmother who always had. plenty of advice and she said stop being so picky you 've got to date around <unk> and most importantly true love will find you. when you least expect it now as it turns out <unk> i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about. <unk> i am constantly swimming in numbers formulas and charts. <unk> i also have a very tight knit family and i 'm very very close with my sister and as a result i wanted to have the same type of family when i grew up <unk> so i 'm at the end of this bad breakup i 'm thirty years old . i figure. i 'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months. before i 'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of. <unk> have to do that for a while before we can get engaged <unk> . and if i want to start having children by the time i 'm thirty five that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago <unk> . so that wasn 't going to work if my strategy was to least expect my way into true love then the variable that i had to deal with was serendipity. <unk> in short i was trying to figure out what 's the probability of my finding mr right well . <unk> the time i was living in the city of philadelphia and it 's a big city <unk> and i figured. in this entire place there are lots of possibilities <unk> so again i started doing some math . population of philadelphia it. has one point five million people i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to seven hundred and fifty thousand i 'm. looking for a guy between the ages of thirty and thirty six which. was only four percent of the population so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of thirty thousand men i was looking for somebody who was jewish because. <unk> and that was important to me that 's only two point three percent of the population. i figure i 'm attracted to maybe one out of ten of those men and there was no way i was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer. <unk> so that basically meant there were thirty five men for me that i could. possibly date. in the entire city of. <unk> in the meantime my very large jewish family. was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children and i felt like i was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already . so i have two possible strategies at this point i 'm sort of figuring out one i can take my grandmother 's advice and sort of. <unk> my way into maybe bumping into the one. <unk> city of philadelphia or. i could try online dating . now i like the idea of online dating because it 's predicated on an algorithm <unk> and that 's really just a simple way of saying i 've got a problem i 'm going to use some data run it through a system and get to a solution . so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other. <unk> but as it turns out algorithms have been around for thousands of years. in almost every culture <unk> in fact in judaism there were matchmakers a long time ago and though they didn 't have an explicit algorithm per se they definitely were running through formulas in their heads like . is the girl going to like the boy are the families going to get along what 's the rabbi going to say are they going to start having children right away. the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this put two people together and that would be the end of it <unk> so in my case i thought. <unk> well <unk> will data. and an algorithm lead me to my prince charming <unk> . so i decided to sign on now there was one small catch as i 'm signing on to the various dating websites . as it happens i was really really busy but that actually that actually wasn 't the biggest problem <unk> . the biggest problem is that i hate filling out questionnaires of any kind. and i certainly don 't like questionnaires that are like cosmo quizzes <unk> so i just copied. <unk> and pasted from my rsum . so in the descriptive part up top <unk> i said that i was an award winning journalist <unk>. and a future thinker when i was asked about fun activities and my ideal date i said monetization. <unk> obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward <unk> . but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates what turned out to be truly. awful dates there was this guy. <unk> the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data. and ' 80s music and so i agreed to go out with him <unk> . so steve the i t guy invited me out to one of philadelphia 's white table cloth extremely expensive restaurants . and we went in and right off the bat our conversation really wasn 't taking flight. but he was ordering a lot of food in fact he didn 't even bother looking at the menu he was ordering multiple appetizers multiple. <unk> me as well <unk> and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table also lots and lots of bottles of wine. <unk> so we 're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and i 've decided steve the i t guy and i are really just not meant for each other but we 'll part ways as friends . when he gets up to go to the bathroom . and in the meantime <unk> the bill comes to. <unk> i 'm a modern woman i am totally down with with splitting the bill but then steve the i t guy didn 't come back and. that was my entire month 's rent audience. gasps so needless to say <unk> i was not having a good night <unk> . so i run home <unk> i call my mother <unk> i call my sister and as i do at the end of each one of these terrible. <unk> you 're just being too picky . so i said fine from here on out i 'm only going on dates where i know there 's wi fi and i 'm bringing my laptop i 'm. going to shove it into my bag <unk> i 'm going to have this email template <unk> and i 'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible. <unk> started tracking things like. really stupid awkward sexual remarks bad vocabulary . the number of times a man forced me to high five him . so i started to crunch some numbers <unk> and that allowed me to make some correlations <unk> so as it turns out. <unk> some reason men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately well . it turns out that these probably weren 't bad guys there were just bad for me <unk> and as it happens the algorithms that were setting us up . they weren 't bad either these algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do <unk> which was to take our. see the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and i don 't when confronted with blank windows where we 're supposed to input our information online . very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves <unk> . the other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like are you a dog person or a cat person. <unk> do you like horror films or romance films <unk> i 'm not looking for a pen pal i 'm looking for a husband right . so there 's a certain amount of superficiality in that data <unk> so i said fine <unk> i 've got a new plan i 'm going to keep using these online dating sites but i 'm going to treat them as databases . and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up i think i 'm going to try <unk>. <unk> this entire system <unk> so knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people. <unk> decided instead to ask my own questions what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate <unk> so i started writing. and writing. and writing . and at the end i had amassed seventy two different data points <unk> i wanted somebody was jew ish so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and. thoughts on our culture but wasn 't going to force me to go to shul every. <unk> friday and saturday <unk> . i wanted somebody who worked hard . because work for me is extremely important but not too hard for me <unk> the hobbies that i have are really just new work projects that i 've launched. <unk> i also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that i do <unk> so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three. <unk> maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it . so things like that but i also wanted somebody who would go to far flung exotic places like petra jordan <unk> . i also wanted somebody who would weigh twenty pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed . so i now have these seventy two different data points <unk> which to be. <unk> so what i did was i went through and i prioritized that list i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points. <unk> and i ranked everything starting at one hundred. and going all the way down to ninety one . and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart who would challenge and stimulate me <unk> and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points. <unk> these things were also important to me but not. <unk> had all this done i then built a scoring system <unk> because. what i wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not i thought the guy that i found online would be a match with me . i figured there would be a minimum of seven hundred points before i would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message . for nine hundred points i 'd agree to go out on a date <unk> and i wouldn 't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the one thousand five hundred point threshold. well as it turns out <unk> this worked pretty well <unk> so i go back online now i found. who 's incredibly good looking incredibly well spoken he had hiked mt fuji <unk> he had walked along the great wall he likes to travel as long as it doesn 't involve a cruise ship and i thought <unk> . done it i 've cracked the code i have just found the jewish prince charming. of my family 's dreams there was only one problem <unk> . he didn 't like me back <unk> . and i guess the one variable that i haven 't considered is the competition who are all of the other women on these dating sites <unk> . <unk> as teacher she said she is silly nice and friendly she likes to make people laugh alot . at this moment i knew <unk> clicking profile after profile after profile that looked like this that i needed to do some market research <unk> so. i created ten fake male profiles now before i lose all of you . <unk> that i did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system <unk> i didn 't carry on crazy catfish style relationships with anybody <unk> . i really was just scraping their data <unk> but i didn 't want everybody 's data <unk> i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really really wanted to marry. when i released these men into the wild i did follow some rules <unk> so i didn 't reach out to any woman first. <unk> just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract . and mainly what i was looking at was two different data sets so i was looking at qualitative data <unk> so what was the humor the tone <unk> the voice the communication style that these women shared in common <unk>. and also quantitative data <unk> so what was the average length of their profile how much time was spent between messages <unk> . <unk> i wanted to figure out how to maximize my own. profile online well one month later <unk> i had. a lot of data and i was able to do another analysis <unk> and as it turns out <unk> content matters a lot so smart people tend to write a lot three thousand four thousand five thousand words about. <unk> which may all be very very interesting the challenge here though is that the popular men and women are sticking to ninety seven words on average. that are written very very well <unk> even though it may not seem like it all the time. <unk> the other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they 're using non specific language <unk> so in my case the english patient is my most favorite movie ever. <unk> but. it doesn 't work. <unk> to use that in a profile because that 's a superficial data point and somebody may disagree and decide they don 't want to go out because they didn 't like sitting through the three hour movie . also optimistic language matters a lot so this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women words like fun and girl and love . and what i realized was not that i had to dumb down my own profile remember i 'm somebody who said that i speak fluent. <unk> and i know javascript and i was okay with that the difference is that it 's about being more approachable. and and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you . and as it turns out timing is also really really important just because you have access to somebody 's mobile phone number or their instant message account. and it 's two o 'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake doesn 't mean that that 's a good time to to communicate with those people the popular women on on these online sites. spend an average of twenty three hours in between each communication. and that 's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship <unk> and finally. there were the photos all of the women who were popular showed some skin. they all looked really great <unk> which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had uploaded . <unk> as it turns out. <unk> telling them about this fabulous news and they say this is wonderful how soon are you going out . i said actually i 'm not going to go out with anybody because remember in my scoring system they have to reach a minimum threshold of seven hundred points and none of them have done that they said . what you 're still being too damn picky well not too long after that i found this guy . <unk> and he said that he was culturally jewish <unk> he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter <unk> which i thought was very clever. he talked. in detail about travel he made a lot of really interesting cultural references he looked and talked exactly like what i wanted . and immediately he scored eight hundred and fifty points it was enough for a date . three weeks later we met up in person for. <unk> that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant and when he dropped me back off at my house that night i re scored him [ one thousand and fifty points ]. thought you know what this entire time i haven 't been picky enough well a year and a half after that we were non cruise ship traveling. through petra jordan <unk> when he got down on his knee and. <unk> year after that we were married and about a year and a half after that our daughter petra was born audience oh [ what it means. obviously i 'm having a fabulous life so . the question is what does all of this mean for you well <unk> as it turns out <unk> there is an algorithm for love it 's just not the ones that we 're being presented with online <unk> in fact. it 's something that you write yourself so whether you 're looking for a husband or a wife or you 're trying to find your passion or you 're trying to start a business . all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules and feel free to be as picky as you want . well on my wedding day i had a conversation again with my grandmother and she said . all right maybe i was wrong it looks like you did come up with a really really great system. <unk> now your matzah balls <unk> they should be fluffy not hard and i 'll take her advice on.
