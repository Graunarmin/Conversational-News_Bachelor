 <unk> by focusing on the world 's most dangerous animal . now when you talk about dangerous animals most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks <unk> but of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito . the mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature. in human history in fact probably adding them all together the mosquito has killed more humans <unk> and the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague <unk> . and you would think would you not that with all our science with all our advances in society with better towns better civilizations better. <unk> we would get better at controlling mosquitos and hence reduce this disease <unk> . and that 's not really the case <unk> . if it was the case we wouldn 't have between two hundred and three hundred million cases of malaria every year <unk> and we wouldn 't have. a million and a half deaths from malaria <unk> and we wouldn 't have. <unk> a disease that was relatively unknown fifty years ago. now suddenly turned into the largest mosquito borne virus threat that we have and that 's called dengue fever <unk> . so fifty years ago <unk> pretty much no one had heard of it no one certainly in the european environment <unk> . but dengue fever now according to the world health organization infects between fifty and one hundred million people every year so that 's equivalent to the whole of the population of the <unk> u k being infected every year. other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections and. dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally in the last fifty years the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold . now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is for those who don 't know now let 's assume you go on holiday let 's assume you go to the caribbean. or you might go to mexico you might go to latin america asia africa. <unk> anywhere in saudi arabia you might go to india <unk> the far east it doesn 't really matter it 's the same mosquito and it 's the same disease you 're at risk . and let 's assume you 're bitten by a mosquito that 's carrying that virus <unk> well <unk> you could develop. <unk> they could be quite mild <unk> you could develop nausea <unk> headache your muscles could feel like they 're contracting <unk> and you could actually feel. like your bones are breaking <unk> and that 's the nickname given to this disease it 's called breakbone fever <unk> because that 's how you can feel . now the odd thing is is that once you 've been bitten by this mosquito and you 've had this disease your body develops antibodies . so if you 're bitten again. with that strain. it doesn 't affect you . but it 's not one virus it 's four <unk> and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before. actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three <unk> . so the next time you get dengue fever if it 's a different strain <unk> you 're more susceptible you 're likely to get worse symptoms. <unk> and you 're more likely to get the more severe forms. <unk> fever or shock syndrome <unk> so you don 't want dengue once and you certainly don 't want it again <unk> so why is it spreading. so fast . and the answer is this thing this is aedes aegypti now this is a mosquito that came like its name suggests out of north africa <unk> . and it 's spread round the. <unk> in fact a single mosquito will only travel about two hundred yards in its entire life they don 't travel very far . what they 're very good at doing is hitchhiking particularly the eggs they will lay their eggs in clear water any pool any puddle . any birdbath any flower pot <unk> anywhere there 's clear water they 'll lay their eggs <unk> and if that clear water is near freight it 's near a port . if it 's anywhere near transport those eggs will then get transported around the world. and that 's what 's happened mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world . and these insects have infested over one hundred countries and there 's now two point five billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides . to give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened in the. <unk> about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it trying to control it just one one species of mosquito . two days ago or yesterday i can 't remember which. i saw a reuters report that said madeira had had their first cases of dengue about fifty two cases with about four hundred. <unk> first got the insect in two thousand and five . and here we are a few years later first cases of dengue <unk> so the one thing you 'll find is that where the mosquito goes dengue will follow . once you 've got the mosquito in your area <unk> anyone coming into that area with dengue mosquito will bite them mosquito will bite somewhere else <unk> somewhere else. <unk> we must be good at killing mosquitos i mean that can 't be very difficult well there 's two principle ways. <unk> the first way is that you use larvicides you use chemicals you put them into water where they breed . now in an urban environment that 's extraordinarily difficult you 've got to get your chemical into every puddle every birdbath every tree trunk it. 's just not practical the second way you can do it. trying to kill the insects as they fly around this is a picture of fogging . here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment <unk> . you could do the same with a space spray this is really unpleasant stuff <unk> and if it was any good we wouldn 't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn 't have this massive increase in. <unk> so it 's not very effective <unk> but it 's probably the best thing we 've got at the moment <unk> having said that actually your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long sleeve shirt. and a little bit of deet to go with it so let 's. start again let 's design a product right from the word go <unk> and decide what we want . well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population there. <unk> point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can 't get the disease transmission . clearly the product you 've got has got to be safe to humans we are going to use it in and around humans it has to be safe . we don 't want to have a lasting impact on the environment <unk> we don 't want to do anything that you can 't undo. <unk> maybe a better product comes along in twenty thirty years <unk> . fine <unk> we don 't want a lasting environmental impact . we want something that 's relatively cheap. or cost effective because there 's an awful lot of countries involved and some of them are emerging markets some of them emerging countries <unk> low income . and finally you want something that 's species specific you want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue <unk> but you don 't really want to get all the other insects some are quite beneficial some are important to your. <unk> ecosystem this one 's not it 's invaded you but you don 't want to get all all of the insects you just want to get this one . and most of the time you 'll find this insect lives in and around your home so this. whatever we do has got to get to that insect it 's got to get into people 's houses into the bedrooms into the kitchens now there are two. features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project. <unk> and that is firstly males don 't bite it 's. only the female mosquito that will actually bite you the male can 't bite you won 't bite you doesn 't have the mouth parts to bite you it 's just the female <unk> . and the second is a phenomenon. that males are very very good at finding females if there 's a male mosquito that you release and if there 's a female around that male will find the female. so basically we 've used those two factors <unk> . so here 's a typical situation . male meets female lots of offspring a single female will lay about up to one hundred eggs at a time up to about five hundred. in her lifetime now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the. <unk> of the offspring then the offspring don 't survive and instead of having five hundred mosquitos running around you have none <unk> . and if you can put more i 'll call them sterile that. the offspring will actually die at different stages but i 'll call them sterile for now if you put more sterile males out into the environment <unk> . then the females are more likely to find a sterile male than a fertile one <unk> . and you will bring that population down. <unk> so the males will go out they 'll look for females they 'll mate if they mate successfully then no offspring if they don 't find a female <unk> . then they 'll die anyway they only live a few days <unk> . and that 's exactly where we are . so this is technology that was developed in oxford university a few years ago <unk> the company itself oxitec we 've been working for the last ten years very much on a sort of similar. <unk> development pathway that you 'd get with a pharmaceutical company so about ten years of internal. evaluation testing to get this to a state where we think it 's actually ready <unk> . and then we 've gone out into the big outdoors <unk> always with local community consent always with the necessary permits <unk> . so we 've done field trials now in the cayman islands a small one in malaysia <unk> and. two more. now in brazil. and what 's the result <unk> well the result has been. very good in about four months of release we 've brought that population of mosquitos. <unk> about two thousand three thousand people that sort of size starting small we 've taken that mosquito. <unk> the numbers after that get those get very difficult to count because there just aren 't any left <unk> . so that that 's been what we 've seen in cayman it 's been what we 've seen in brazil. <unk> in those trials <unk> . and now what we 're doing is we 're going through a process to scale up to a town of about fifty thousand so we can see this work at big scale <unk> . and we 've got a production unit in oxford or just south of oxford where we actually produce these mosquitos. <unk> we can produce them in a space a bit more than this red carpet i can produce about twenty million a week . we can transport them around the world it 's not very expensive <unk> because it 's a coffee cup something the size of a coffee cup will hold about three million eggs . so freight costs aren 't our biggest problem . <unk> we 've got that you could call it a mosquito factory <unk> . and for brazil where we 've been doing some trials the brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory far bigger than ours and we 'll use that. for scaling up in brazil . there you are we 've sent mosquito eggs we 've separated the males from the females the males have been put in little pots. and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go it 's actually. <unk> little bit more precise than that you want to release them so that you get good coverage of your area <unk> so you take a google map you divide it up work out how far they can fly <unk> and make sure you 're releasing such that you get coverage of the area <unk> . and then you go back and within a very short space of time you 're bringing that population right the way down . we 've also done this in agriculture . we 've got several different species of. <unk> coming along <unk> and i 'm hoping that soon we 'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back. and start looking at malaria <unk> so that 's where we stand at the moment <unk> and i 've just got a few final thoughts which is that. this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area. <unk> these biological approaches are coming in. in very different forms <unk> . and when you think about genetic engineering we 've now got enzymes for industrial processing enzymes genetically engineered enzymes in food . we have g m crops <unk> we have pharmaceuticals <unk> we have new vaccines all using roughly the same technology but with very different outcomes <unk> . and i 'm in favor actually of course i am. <unk> favor <unk> of particularly where the older technologies don 't work well or have become unacceptable and. although the techniques are similar the outcomes are very very different and if you take our approach for example and you compare it to say g m crops <unk> . both techniques are. trying to produce a massive benefit <unk> both have a side. <unk> which is that we reduce pesticide. use tremendously. <unk> but whereas a g m crop is trying to protect the plant for example <unk> and give it it an advantage what we 're actually doing. is taking the mosquito. and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have rendering it unable to reproduce effectively <unk> so for the mosquito it 's a dead end.
