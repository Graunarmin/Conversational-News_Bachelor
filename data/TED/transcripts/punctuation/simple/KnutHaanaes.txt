 <unk> here are two reasons companies fail <unk> they only do more of the same . or they only do what 's new to me the real. <unk> quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities exploration and exploitation . both are necessary <unk> but it can be too much of a good thing . consider facit . i 'm actually old enough to remember them. facit was a fantastic company <unk> they were born deep in the swedish forest <unk> and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world. <unk> used them <unk> . and what did <unk> facit do when the electronic calculator came along they continued doing exactly the same . in six months they went from maximum revenue <unk> and they were gone <unk> . gone to me the irony. about the. <unk> did too much exploitation . but exploration can go wild too a few years back i worked closely alongside a european biotech company let 's call them. applications that promised to diagnose even cure <unk> certain forms of blood cancer . every day was about creating something new <unk> they were extremely innovative <unk> . and the mantra was when we only get it right or even we want it perfect . the sad thing is before they became perfect even. good enough. <unk> enough they became obsolete. <unk> oncosearch did too much exploration <unk> i first heard about exploration and exploitation. about fifteen years ago when i worked as a visiting scholar at stanford university <unk> the founder of the idea is is jim march. <unk> and to me the power of the idea is is its practicality . exploration . exploration is about coming up with what 's new <unk> . it 's about search it 's about discovery it 's about new products it 's about new innovations . it 's about. changing our frontiers our heroes are people who have done exploration . <unk> i come from norway all our heroes are explorers <unk> and they deserve to be . we all know that exploration is risky <unk> we don 't know the answers <unk> we don 't know if we 're going to find them <unk> and we know that the risks are high . exploitation is the opposite exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good. <unk> better exploitation is about making our trains run on time it 's about making good products faster and cheaper . exploitation is not risky. in the short term <unk> but if we only exploit it 's very risky in the long term <unk> . and i think we all have memories of the. famous pop groups who keep singing the same. <unk> songs again and again <unk> until they become obsolete or even pathetic that 's the risk of exploitation . so if we take a long term perspective <unk> we explore . if we take a short term perspective <unk> we exploit <unk> small children they explore all day all day it 's about exploration. <unk> as we grow older <unk> we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on . the same goes for companies . companies become by nature less innovative as they become more competent <unk> . and this is of course a big worry to ceos <unk> and i hear very often questions phrased in different ways. <unk> example how can i both. effectively run and reinvent my company . or how can i make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis . so doing one well is difficult doing both well as the same time is art pushing both exploration and exploitation. <unk> so one thing we 've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time in parallel <unk> . but when they do the payoffs are huge <unk> . so we have lots of great examples we have. <unk> we have lego going into animated films <unk> toyota creating the hybrids <unk> unilever pushing into sustainability there are lots of examples <unk> and the benefits are huge. <unk> why is balancing so difficult i think it 's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are . so i 'll talk about two but there are many. <unk> so let 's talk about the perpetual search trap <unk> . we discover something but we don 't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work <unk> so instead of staying with it we create something new <unk>. <unk> but the same goes for that then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated. <unk> in companies <unk> we see this in the public sector as well we all know that any kind of effective reform of. education research <unk> health care even defense takes ten <unk> fifteen maybe twenty years to work <unk> . but still we change much more often . we really don 't give. <unk> the success trap <unk> . they literally held the future in their hands <unk> but they couldn 't see it they were simply so good at making what they loved doing that they wouldn 't change . we are like that too when we know something well it 's difficult to change. <unk> bill gates has said success is a lousy teacher it seduces us into thinking we cannot fail . that 's the challenge with success <unk> . so i think there are some lessons <unk> and i think they apply to us <unk> and they apply to our companies. the first lesson is get ahead of the crisis <unk> . and any company that 's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance. in the future . netflix they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution <unk> but they always and i think they will always keep pushing for the next battle . i see other companies that say i 'll win the next innovation cycle <unk> whatever it takes . <unk> second one think in multiple time scales <unk> i 'll share a chart with you and i think it 's a wonderful one . any company we look at taking a one year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company <unk> innovation typically accounts for only about thirty percent <unk> . so when we think one year <unk> innovation isn 't really that important <unk> . move ahead take a 10 year perspective on the same company. <unk> ability to renew account for seventy percent <unk> . but companies can 't choose they need to fund the journey and lead the long term <unk> . third <unk> . invite talent <unk> . i don 't think it 's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves <unk> i think it 's a team sport <unk> i think we need to allow challenging . i think. the mark. of a great company is being open to be challenged <unk> and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge <unk> . i think that 's also what good parenting is about . last one be skeptical of success <unk> . maybe it 's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in rome when the generals after a big. <unk> victory were given their celebration riding into rome on the carriage <unk> they always had a companion. whispering in their ear remember you 're only human . so i hope i made the point <unk> balancing exploration and exploitation. has a huge payoff <unk> but it 's difficult <unk> and we need to be conscious. i want to just point out two questions that i think are useful first question is <unk> looking at your own company . in which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps . of just going on autopilot <unk> . and what can. <unk> second question is when did i. explore something new last <unk> and what kind of effect did it have on me . is that something i should do more of in my case yes <unk> . so let me leave you with with this whether you 're an explorer. by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know . don 't forget the beauty is in the balance . thank you.
