 <unk> i 've actually been waiting by the phone for a call from ted for years <unk> . and in fact in two thousand i was ready to talk about ebay but no call . <unk> i was ready to do a talk about the skoll foundation and social entrepreneurship no call. <unk> in two thousand and four i started participant productions and we had a really good first year and no call . and finally i get a call last year. <unk> and then i have to go up after j j abrams . you 've got a cruel sense of humor ted when i first moved to hollywood from silicon valley. <unk> i had some misgivings <unk> but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood . and in fact some advantages to owning your own media company . and i also found that hollywood and silicon valley have a lot more in common than i would have dreamed <unk> hollywood has its sex symbols <unk> . and the valley has its sex symbols . hollywood has its rivalries <unk> and the valley. <unk> its rivalries <unk> . hollywood gathers around power tables <unk> and the valley gathers around power tables so it turned out there was a lot more in common than than i would have dreamed <unk> . but i 'm actually here today to tell a story and part of it is a personal story <unk> . when chris invited me to speak he said people think of you as a bit of an. <unk> and they want to know what drives you a bit . and what really drives me is is a vision of the future that i think we all share it 's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability . and. when we when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days <unk> . ed wilson and and the pictures of james nachtwey i think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that i like to. <unk> it 's also something that. resides in each of us to close what i think are the two big calamities in the world today one is. the gap in opportunity. this gap that president clinton last night called uneven unfair and unsustainable and out of that comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all. <unk> evils that we see around us . but perhaps the other bigger gap is what we call the hope gap and someone at some point came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn 't make a difference in the world and i think that 's just a horrible thing <unk> . and so chapter one really begins today with all of us because within each of us is the power to. equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps and if the men and women of ted can 't make a difference in the. <unk> world <unk> i don 't know who can . and for me a lot of this started when i was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate new york and there really wasn 't much to do there for the summer except get beaten up by my sister or. or read books <unk> and so i used to read authors like james michener and james clavell and ayn rand and. their stories made the world seem a very small and. and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all and maybe engage them to make a difference. <unk> i didn 't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living . so i decided to to go on a path to become. financially independent so i could write these stories as quickly as i. <unk> could . i then had a bit of a wake up call when i was fourteen and my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer <unk> . and it looked pretty bad <unk> and what he said was he wasn 't so much afraid that he might die <unk> but that he hadn 't done the things that he wanted to. with his life . <unk> knock on wood he 's still alive today <unk> many years later but for a young man that made a real impression on me that one never knows how much time one really has so i set out in a hurry. <unk> i studied engineering i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom. <unk> one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move which is very well named because people kept stealing the computers. <unk> i needed to learn a little bit more about business so i went to stanford business school and studied there . and while i was there i made friends with a fellow named pierre omidyar who is here today <unk> and pierre i apologize for this this is a photo from the old days <unk> . and just after i 'd graduated pierre came to me <unk> with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other <unk> and with the wisdom of my stanford degree i said pierre what a stupid idea. needless to say i was right . but right after that pierre in ' ninety six pierre and i left our full time jobs to build ebay as a company and the rest of that story you know <unk>. the company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world. <unk> i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources and i wanted to figure out how i could take the blessing of these resources and and share it with the world . and around that time <unk> i met john gardner who is a remarkable man he was the architect of the great society programs under lyndon johnson. <unk> in the 1960s . and i asked him what he felt was the best thing i could do or anyone could do to make a difference in the long term issues facing humanity and john said . bet on good people doing good things bet on good people doing good things and that really resonated with me <unk> i started a foundation. to bet on these good people doing good things these leading innovative. <unk> folks who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems . people today we call social entrepreneurs . and to put a face on it people like muhammad yunus <unk> who started the grameen bank . has lifted one hundred million people plus out of poverty around the world <unk> . won the nobel peace prize <unk> but there 's also a lot of people that you don 't know folks like ann cotton who started a group called camfed in africa <unk> . <unk> felt girls ' education was lagging and she started it about ten years ago <unk> and today she educates. over a quarter million african girls <unk> . and somebody like dr victoria hale who started the world 's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company and whose first drug. will will be fighting. <unk> also known as black fever . and by two thousand and ten she hopes to eliminate this disease which is really a scourge in the developing world . and so this is this is one way to bet on on good people doing good things and a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that i find really. is powerful it 's what we call invest connect and celebrate and invest if you see good people doing good. <unk> invest in them invest in their organizations <unk> or in business invest in these folks. <unk> connecting them together through conferences like a ted brings so many powerful connections or through. the world forum on. social entrepreneurship that my foundation does at oxford every year. <unk> and celebrate them tell their stories because not only are there good people doing good work <unk> but their stories can help close these gaps of hope <unk> . and it was this last part of the mission the celebrate part that really got. <unk> me back to thinking. when i was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all . and a light bulb went off which was first that i didn 't actually have to do the writing myself i could find writers <unk> and then the next light bulb was better than just writing what about film and tv to get out to people in a big way <unk> . and i thought about the films that inspired me films like. <unk> 's list and i wondered who was doing these kinds of films today <unk> and there really wasn. 't a specific company that was focused on the on the public interest <unk> so in two thousand and three i started to make my way around los angeles. to talk about the idea of a pro social media company. and i was met with a lot of. <unk> one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you who think you 're going to come to this town and make movies . and then of course there was the other adage the surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business . undeterred in january of two thousand and four i started participant productions with the vision to be a global media company. <unk> focused on the public interest and our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change <unk> . and we don 't just want people to see our movies and say that was fun <unk> and forget about it we want them to actually get involved in the issues . in two thousand and five we launched our our first slate of films murder ball north country syriana. <unk> good night and good luck and much to my surprise they were noticed <unk> we ended up with eleven oscar nominations for these films . and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy <unk> . perhaps more importantly <unk> tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs. that we created to go around the movies and we had an online component of that our community sect called <unk>. <unk> with our social sector partners like the aclu and pbs and the sierra club and the nrdc . once people saw the film there was actually something they could do to make a difference. <unk> one of these films in particular called north country was actually kind of a. box office disaster <unk> but it was a film that starred charlize theron and it was about women 's rights women. <unk> domestic violence and so on <unk> and we released the film at the same time that the congress was debating the renewal of the violence against women act . and with screenings on the hill <unk> and discussions and with our social sector partners like the national organization of women . the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal. <unk> that to me spoke volumes because it 's the film started. about a true life story about a woman who was harassed . sued her employer . led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act and the violence against women act and others <unk> and then the movie about this person doing these things then led to this greater. renewal <unk> and so again it goes back to betting on good people doing. <unk> speaking of which our fellow tedster al i first saw al do his slide show presentation on global warming. in may of two thousand and five . at that point i thought i knew something about global warming i thought it was a thirty to fifty year problem . and after we saw his slide show it became clear that it was much more urgent <unk> . and so right afterwards <unk> i met backstage with with al and with lawrence bender who was there and laurie david and. davis guggenheim. <unk> who was running. documentaries for participant at the time <unk> . and with al 's blessing we decided on the spot to turn it into a film because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly. than having al go around the world <unk> . speaking to audiences of one hundred or two hundred at a time <unk> and you know there 's another adage in hollywood that nobody knows nothing about anything. <unk> and i really thought this was going to be a. straight to pbs charitable initiative <unk> and so it was it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest. <unk> and today is mandatory viewing in schools in england and scotland and most of scandinavia <unk> we 've sent fifty thousand dvds to. high school teachers in the. <unk> and it 's really changed the debate on global warming it. was also a pretty good year for this guy <unk> we now call al the george clooney of global warming . laughter and for participant this is just the start everything we do looks at the major issues in the world <unk> and we have. ten films in production right now and dozens others. in development i 'll quickly talk about a few coming up one is charlie wilson 's war with tom hanks and julia roberts. and it 's the true story of congressman charlie wilson and how he funded the taliban to fight the russians in afghanistan <unk> . and we 're also doing a movie called the kite runner based on the book the kite runner . also about afghanistan and we think once people see these films they 'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the middle east in general . we premiered a film called the chicago ten at sundance this year it 's based on. the protesters at the democratic convention in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight abby hoffman and crew and again a story about a small group of individuals who who did make change in the world . and a documentary that we 're doing on jimmy carter and his mid east peace efforts over the years and in particular we 've been following him on his. <unk> in closing i 'd like to say that. everybody has the opportunity to make change in their their own way . and all the people in this room have have done so through their business lives or their philanthropic work <unk> or their other interests . and one thing that i 've learned is that there 's never one right way to make change one can do it as a tech. <unk> person or as a finance person or a nonprofit person or as an entertainment person <unk> but every one of us is all of those things and more.
