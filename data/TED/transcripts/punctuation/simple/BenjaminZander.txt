 <unk> probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to africa in the 1900s they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes and they wrote telegrams back to manchester <unk>. <unk> and one of them wrote situation hopeless stop they don 't wear shoes and the other one wrote . glorious opportunity they don 't have any shoes yet . now there 's a similar situation in the classical music world <unk> because there are some people who think that classical music is dying <unk> . and there are some of us who think you ain 't seen nothing yet <unk> . and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing. <unk> the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight. <unk> not really an experiment because i know the outcome but it 's like an experiment <unk> now <unk> before we start . before we start i need to do two things one is i. want to remind you of what a <unk> seven year old child sounds like when he plays the piano maybe you have this child at home he sounds something like this. <unk> some of you recognize this child <unk> now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he 's now eight and he sounds like this . he practices for another year and takes lessons he 's nine. <unk> if you 'd waited for one more year you would have heard this. <unk> what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit. puberty <unk> or whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced you see the first time <unk> he was playing with an impulse on every note . <unk> can see it by looking at my head. <unk> i 'm going to move my shoulder over move my body no the music pushed me over <unk> which is why i call it one buttock <unk>. can be the other buttock . you know a gentleman was once watching. a presentation i was doing when i was working with a young pianist he was the president of a corporation in ohio <unk> i was working with this young pianist and said the trouble with you. <unk> player <unk> you should be a one buttock player i moved his body while he was playing and suddenly the music took off it took flight the audience gasped when they heard the difference <unk> then i got a letter <unk>. <unk> from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one buttock company . now the other thing i wanted to do is to tell you about you there are one thousand six hundred people i believe. <unk> my estimation is that probably forty five of you are absolutely passionate about classical music you adore classical music your fm is always on <unk>. <unk> that classical dial <unk> you have cds in your car and you go to the symphony your children are playing instruments you can 't imagine your life without classical music <unk> . you 've come home from a long day and you take a glass of wine and you put your feet up a little vivaldi in the background doesn 't do any harm <unk> . that 's the second group <unk> now comes the third group <unk> people who never listen to classical music it 's just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport <unk>. <unk> when you come into the hall but otherwise you never hear it that 's probably the largest group and then there 's a very small group <unk> these are the people who who think they 're <unk> tone deaf. amazing number of people think they 're tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf . actually you cannot be tone deaf nobody is tone deaf if you were tone deaf you couldn 't change the gears on your car in a stick shift car <unk> . you couldn 't tell the difference between. somebody from texas and somebody from rome <unk> and the telephone. <unk> the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone <unk> she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she 's in. <unk> you have a fantastic ear <unk> everybody has a fantastic ear <unk> so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it doesn 't work for me. to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and are passionate about classical music. <unk> and those who have no relationship to it at all the tone deaf people they 're no longer here <unk> but even between those three categories it 's too wide a gulf so i 'm not going to go on until <unk>. every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking . <unk> that 's what we 're going to do now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt. in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face right . it 's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading to realize whatever he 's dreaming <unk> . imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course i 'm not sure they 'll be up to it. <unk> all right so i 'm going to take a piece of chopin this is a beautiful prelude by chopin some of you will know it. <unk> piece is long and you 've had a long day you might. <unk> drift off. then your. companion will dig you in the ribs and say wake up it 's culture and then you feel even worse . but has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while i was playing why is he using so many impulses if i 'd done this with my head you certainly. <unk> the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you 'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses <unk> . so let 's see what 's really going on here we have a <unk> b this is a <unk> b . the next note is a <unk> c and the job of the c is to make the b sad <unk> and it does. <unk> two notes . but basically it 's just a b with four sads . now it goes down to a now to <unk> g and then to <unk> f so we have b. <unk> nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every hamlet in china. <unk> who 's expecting that e chopin didn 't want to reach the e there because what will have happened . it will be over like hamlet do you remember act one scene three he finds out his uncle killed his father he keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him <unk> . and then he backs away he goes up to him again almost kills him <unk> the critics sitting in the back row there they have to have an opinion so they say hamlet is a procrastinator . or they say hamlet has an oedipus. <unk> complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid . that 's why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet ophelia going mad the play within the play and yorick 's skull and the gravediggers that 's in order to delay. until act five he can kill him <unk> it 's the same with the chopin he 's just about to reach the e. <unk> finally he goes down to e but it 's the wrong chord because the chord he 's looking for is this one and. instead he does now we call that a deceptive cadence <unk> because it deceives us i tell my students if you have a deceptive. <unk> it 's the wrong chord now he tries e again. <unk> comes home after a long day <unk> turns off the key in his car and says aah . i 'm home because we all know where home is <unk> . so this is a piece which goes from away to home i 'm going to play it all the way through and you 're going to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to. f almost goes to e but otherwise the play would be over he goes back up to b he gets very excited goes to f sharp goes to e it 's the wrong chord it 's the wrong chord. <unk> and finally goes to e <unk> and it 's home and what you 're going to see is <unk>. because for me to join the b to the e i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long long line. <unk> you know we were just in south africa and you can 't go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for <unk>. what was he thinking about lunch no he was thinking about the vision. for south africa and for human beings <unk>. this is about vision this is about the long line like the bird who flies over the field and doesn 't care about the fences. <unk> so now you 're going to follow the line all the way from b to <unk> e and i 've one last request before i play this piece all the way through . would you think of somebody who you adore . who 's no longer there . a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in your life who you love with all your heart . but that person is no longer with you . bring that. person into your mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e <unk> and you 'll hear everything that chopin had to say. <unk> thing. <unk> you may be wondering why i 'm clapping well i did this at a school in boston with about seventy seventh graders <unk> 12 year olds i. <unk> busy people involved in all sorts of different things listening understanding and being moved by a piece. <unk> is something am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i can 't be sure but i 'll tell you what happened to me in ireland. during the troubles ten years ago <unk> and i was working with some catholic and protestant kids. on conflict resolution <unk> and i did this with them a risky thing to do because they were street kids <unk> and one of them came to me the next morning. <unk> i 've never listened to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece . he said my brother was shot last year and i didn 't cry for him <unk> . but last night when you played that piece he was the one i was thinking about . and i felt the tears streaming down my face and it felt really good to cry for my brother so i made up my mind at that moment. <unk> the music profession doesn 't see it that way they say three percent of the population likes classical music <unk> if only we could move it to four percent our problems would be over . laughter how would you walk how would you talk how would you be. <unk> three percent of the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent how would you walk or talk how would you be if you thought everybody loves classical music they just haven 't found out about it yet . see these are totally different worlds <unk> . now <unk> i had an amazing experience i was forty five years old i 'd been conducting for twenty years <unk> and i suddenly had a realization . the conductor of an orchestra doesn 't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the cd. but the conductor doesn 't make a sound he depends for his power on his ability to make other people powerful <unk> . and that changed everything for me <unk> it was totally life changing people in my orchestra said ben what happened that 's what happened i realized my job was to. <unk> and of course i wanted to know whether i was doing that how do you find out you look at their eyes <unk> if their eyes are shining <unk> you know you 're doing it . you could light up a village with this guy 's eyes. <unk> right so if the eyes are shining you know you 're doing it <unk> if the eyes are not shining you get to ask a question <unk> and this is the question who am i being. <unk> that my players ' eyes are not shining <unk> we can do that with our children too who am i being . that my children 's eyes are not shining <unk> that 's a totally different world now we 're all about to end this magical. on the mountain week we 're going back into the world <unk> and i say <unk> it 's appropriate for us to ask the question who are. we being. as we go back out. into the world <unk> . and you know i have a definition of success for me it 's very simple it 's not about wealth and fame and power <unk> it 's about how many shining eyes i have around me <unk> . so now <unk> i have one last thought <unk> which is that it really makes a difference what we say. the words that come out of our mouth i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to auschwitz when she was fifteen years old. and and. her brother was eight and the parents were lost <unk> and. she told me this she said . we were in the train going to auschwitz <unk> and i looked down and saw my brother 's shoes were missing <unk> i said ' why are you. <unk> can 't you keep your things together for goodness ' sake ' the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother . unfortunately it was the last thing she ever said to him because she never saw him again <unk> he did not survive . and so when she came out of auschwitz she made a vow she told me this she said i walked out of auschwitz into life. and i made a vow <unk> and the vow was i will never say anything that couldn 't stand as the last thing i ever say. now <unk> can we do that no and we 'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong <unk> but it is a possibility to live into.
