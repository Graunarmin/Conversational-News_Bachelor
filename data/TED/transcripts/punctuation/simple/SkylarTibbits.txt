 <unk> today i 'd like to show you the future of the way we make things. i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self assembling replicating and repairing themselves <unk> so i 'm going to show you what i believe is the current state. <unk> and then compare that to some natural systems <unk> . so in the current state of manufacturing <unk> we have skyscrapers two and a half years [ of assembly time ] five hundred thousand to a million parts <unk> fairly complex new exciting technologies in steel concrete glass . we have exciting machines that can take us into space five years [ of assembly time ] two point five million parts <unk> . but on the other side if you look at the natural systems <unk> we have proteins. that have two million types. can fold in ten thousand nanoseconds or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate. in roughly an hour <unk> so. there 's all of this complexity in our natural systems <unk> but they 're extremely efficient far more efficient than anything we can build far more complex than anything we can build . they 're far more efficient in terms of energy they hardly ever make mistakes <unk> and they can repair themselves for longevity <unk> so there 's. <unk> something super interesting about natural systems and if we can translate that into our built environment . then there 's some exciting potential for the way that we build things <unk> and i think the key to that is self assembly . so if we want to utilize self assembly in our physical environment i think there 's four key factors the first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build so our buildings and machines and we need to decode that into simple sequences. <unk> dna of of how our buildings work then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence. and use that to fold up or reconfigure . we need some energy that 's going to allow that to activate allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program <unk> . and we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have. successfully built what we want so i 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this. the first two are the macrobot and decibot <unk> so these projects are large scale reconfigurable robots eight ft twelve <unk> ft long proteins they 're embedded with mechanical electrical devices <unk> sensors . you decode what you want to fold up into into a sequence of angles so negative one hundred and twenty negative one hundred and twenty zero zero one. <unk> something like that so a sequence of angles or turns and you send that sequence through the string each unit takes its message so negative one hundred and twenty. it rotates to that checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor <unk> . so these are the brilliant scientists engineers designers that worked on this project and. i think it really brings to light is this really scalable i mean thousands of dollars lots of man hours. <unk> made to make this eight foot robot can we really scale this up can we really embed robotics into every part . the next one questions that and looks at passive nature <unk> . or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability but it goes a step further and it tries to have actual computation . it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing the digital logic gate directly into your parts <unk> . so this is a nand gate you have one tetrahedron which is the gate that 's going to do your computing <unk> and you have two input. <unk> tetrahedrons . one of them is the input from the user as you 're building your bricks the other one is from the previous brick that was placed and then it gives you an output in 3d space . so what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do . and now it starts moving in three dimensional space so up or down so on the. <unk> equals zero output which goes down on the right hand side [ zero ] input is a one output . which goes up . and so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build so they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed so that means that we can have some form of self replication in. this case i call it <unk> self guided. <unk> because your structure contains the exact blueprints if you have errors you can replace a part all the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it . so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one it 's directly embedded there 's no external instructions so the last project i 'll show is called biased chains. and it 's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of of passive self assembly systems so it takes the reconfigurability and programmability. and makes it a completely passive system. <unk> so basically you have a chain of elements each element is is completely identical <unk> . and they 're biased so each chain <unk> or each element wants to turn right or left <unk> . so as you assemble the chain you 're basically programming it you 're telling each unit if it should turn right or left <unk> . so when you shake the chain <unk> . it then folds up into any configuration that you 've programmed in so in this case a spiral. <unk> or in this case . two cubes next to each other so you can basically program any <unk> three dimensional shape or. up into this chain completely passively so what does this tell us about the future i think that it 's telling us that there 's new possibilities for self assembly replication repair in our physical structures our buildings machines . there 's new programmability in these parts. <unk> and from that you have new possibilities for computing we 'll have spatial computing imagine if our buildings our bridges machines all of our bricks could actually compute that 's amazing parallel and distributed computing power . new design possibilities so it 's exciting potential for this so i think these projects i 've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future . if we implement these new technologies for a new.
