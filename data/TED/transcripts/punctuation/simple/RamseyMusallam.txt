 <unk> more than just explosions chemistry is everywhere have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over some people nodding yes. <unk> yes recently i showed this to my students <unk> and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened . the questions and conversations that followed were fascinating <unk> check out this video that maddie from my period three class sent me that evening. <unk> as maddie 's chemistry teacher i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class . but what fascinated me more is that maddie 's curiosity took her to a new level . if you look inside that beaker you might see a candle maddie 's using temperature to. <unk> extend this phenomenon to a new scenario you. know questions and curiosity like maddie 's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers <unk> and they transcend. all technology or buzzwords in education but if we place these technologies before student inquiry. <unk> we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers our students ' questions . for example <unk> flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time but if it is the focus of our students ' experience . it 's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing <unk> . but if instead we have the guts to confuse our students perplex them and evoke real. <unk> questions <unk> through those questions we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust. and informed methods of blended instruction <unk> so. <unk> lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside the truth is i 've been teaching for thirteen years now . <unk> to snap me out of ten years of pseudo teaching and help me realize. that student questions are the seeds of real learning . not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information . in may of two thousand and ten at thirty five years old <unk> . with a two year old at home and my second child on the way i was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta . <unk> to open heart surgery this is the actual real email from my doctor right there <unk> now when i got this i was press caps lock. absolutely freaked out okay but i found surprising moments of comfort. in the confidence that my surgeon embodied where did this guy get this confidence the audacity of it. <unk> so when i asked him he told me three things. <unk> he said first <unk> his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure about what worked and what didn 't work <unk> . second . he embraced and didn 't fear the messy process of trial and error the inevitable process of trial and error <unk> . and third <unk> through intense reflection he gathered the information that he needed. to design and revise the procedure and then with a steady. <unk> hand he saved my life . now i absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom and before i went back into the classroom that fall i wrote down three rules of my own. that i bring to my lesson planning still today . rule number one curiosity comes first . questions can be windows to great instruction but not the other way around . rule number two. <unk> two embrace the mess we. 're all teachers we know learning is ugly <unk> . and just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section one point two of chapter one of the one that we all skip okay . trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every. <unk> day at sacred heart cathedral in room two hundred and six . and rule number three . practice reflection what we do is important it deserves our care <unk> but it also deserves our revision . can we be the surgeons of our classrooms as if what we are doing one day will save lives our students our worth it . and each case is different all right . <unk> chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on so these are my daughters on the right <unk> we have little emmalou. southern family and on the left riley now riley 's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here she 's going to be four years old <unk> . and anyone who knows a four year old knows that they love to ask . why yeah <unk> . <unk> i could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything we all were at that age <unk> . but the challenge is really for riley 's future teachers the ones she has yet to meet <unk> how will they grow this curiosity . you see i would argue that riley is a metaphor for all kids <unk> . and i think dropping out of school comes in many different forms. to the senior who 's checked out before the year 's even begun or that empty. <unk> desk in the back of an urban middle school 's classroom but if we as educators leave behind. this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm. as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry <unk> we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day and spark their imagination thank you very much.
