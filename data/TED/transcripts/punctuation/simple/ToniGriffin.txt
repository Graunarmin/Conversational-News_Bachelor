 <unk> detroit had become the poster child for an american city in crisis <unk> there was a housing collapse an auto industry collapse <unk> . and the population had plummeted by twenty five percent between two thousand. <unk> thousand and two thousand and ten <unk> and many people were beginning to write it off as it had topped the list of american shrinking cities . by two thousand and ten i had also been asked by the kresge foundation and the city of detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process. for the city to create a shared vision for its future. i come to this work as an architect and an urban planner <unk> . and i 've spent my career working in other contested cities like chicago my hometown <unk> harlem which is my current home washington. and newark new jersey . all of these cities to me still had a number of unresolved issues related to urban justice issues of equity <unk> inclusion and access <unk> . now by two thousand and ten <unk> as well <unk> popular design magazines were also beginning to take a closer look at cities like detroit <unk> and devoting whole issues to. <unk> i was asked by a good friend fred bernstein to do an interview for the october issue of architect magazine . and he and i kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title can this planner save detroit . so i 'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now because obviously it 's completely absurd that a single person let alone a planner could save a city . but i 'm also smiling because i thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession. <unk> role in helping the city to think about how it would recover from its severe crisis <unk> . so i 'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city a little bit about detroit <unk> . and i want to do that through the voices of detroiters <unk> so we began our process in september of two thousand and ten <unk> it 's just after a special mayoral election . and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide. <unk> planning process which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among detroiters . we had planned to hold a number of community meetings in rooms like this to introduce the planning process <unk> and people came out from all over the city including areas <unk>. <unk> that were stable neighborhoods as well as areas that were beginning to see a lot of vacancy <unk> . <unk> city at that time . so obviously we have a q & a portion of our program <unk> and people line up to mics to ask questions many of them step very firmly to the mic <unk> put their hands across their chest and go . i know you people are trying to move me out of my house right . so that question is really powerful and it was. certainly powerful to us in the moment. <unk> when you connect it to the stories that some detroiters had and actually a lot of african americans ' families have had that are living in midwestern cities like detroit <unk> . many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great grandparents who were one of one point six million people who migrated from the rural south to the industrial north. <unk> as depicted in this painting by jacob lawrence the great migration . they came to detroit for a better way of life . many found work in the automobile industry the ford motor company as depicted in this mural by diego rivera in the detroit institute of art . the fruits of their labors would afford them a home for many the first piece of property that they would ever know and a community with other <unk>. <unk> home buyers the first couple of decades of their life in the north is quite well. up until about one thousand nine hundred and fifty <unk> which coincides with the city 's peak population at one point eight million people . now it 's at this time that detroit begins to see a second kind of migration a migration to the suburbs <unk> between one thousand nine hundred and fifty and two thousand the region grows by thirty percent <unk> . <unk> in place as families and businesses flee the city <unk> leaving the city pretty desolate of people as well as jobs <unk> during that same period between one thousand nine hundred and fifty <unk>. and two thousand two thousand and ten the city loses sixty percent of its population and today it hovers at above seven hundred thousand . <unk> many tell us that they 're one of only a few homes on their block that are occupied <unk> and that they can see several. abandoned homes from where they sit on their porches <unk> citywide there are eighty thousand vacant homes . they can also see vacant property they 're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties. <unk> and they know that because the city has lost so much population . their costs for water electricity <unk> gas are rising because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need <unk> . citywide there are about one hundred thousand vacant parcels <unk> now to quickly give you all a sense of a scale because i know that sounds like a big number but i don 't think. <unk> quite understand until you look at the city map so the city is one hundred and thirty nine square miles you can fit boston san francisco <unk> and the island of manhattan within its footprint <unk> . so if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together it looks like about twenty square miles and that 's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we 're sitting on today <unk>. manhattan at twenty two square miles so it 's a lot of vacancy <unk> . <unk> happening in their communities <unk> . and many of them are banding together to take control of some of the vacant lots <unk> and they 're starting community gardens <unk> which are creating a great sense of community stewardship but they 're very very clear to tell us that this is not enough . that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them . now there 's been a lot of speculation. <unk> ten about what to do with the vacant property and. a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening or what we call urban agriculture <unk> . so many people would say to us what if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland it can provide fresh foods and it can put detroiters back to work too . when i hear that story i always imagine the folks from the great migration rolling over in their graves <unk> . because you can imagine that they didn 't sacrifice moving from the south to the north to create a. <unk> better life for their families only to see their <unk> great grandchildren return to an agrarian lifestyle <unk> . especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the american dream steady work and a home that they owned . now there 's a third wave of migration happening in detroit a new ascendant of cultural. <unk> entrepreneurs . these folks see that same vacant land and those same abandoned homes as opportunity for new entrepreneurial ideas and profit <unk> so much so that former models can move to detroit <unk> . buy property start successful businesses and restaurants and become successful community activists in their neighborhood bringing about very positive change <unk> . similarly we have small manufacturing. <unk> companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city . this company shinola which is a luxury watch and bicycle company <unk> deliberately chose to relocate to detroit and they they quote. themselves by saying they were drawn to the global brand of detroit 's innovation <unk> . and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things now we have community. stewardship happening in neighborhoods . we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises <unk> and we have businesses relocating and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all . a city that 's under the control of an emergency manager <unk> and just this july filed for chapter nine. <unk> we started this process and by two thousand and thirteen we released detroit future city which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence. not what it was but what it could be looking at new ways of economic growth . new forms of land use more sustainable and denser neighborhoods a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system and a heightened. <unk> capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change <unk> . three key imperatives were really important to our work one was that the city itself wasn 't necessarily too large <unk> but the economy was too small . <unk> there are only twenty seven jobs per one hundred people in detroit <unk> very different from a denver or an atlanta or a philadelphia that are anywhere between. <unk> people . secondly <unk> there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come . it wasn 't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before . and urban agriculture <unk> while a very productive and successful intervention happening in detroit <unk> was not the only answer . that what we had to do is look at these areas where we. <unk> had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population. of what could be new productive innovative and entrepreneurial uses that could stabilize those communities <unk> where still nearly three hundred thousand residents lived <unk> so <unk>. we came up with one neighborhood typology there are several called a live make neighborhood . <unk> abandoned structures. and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises with a specific emphasis on looking at the again <unk> majority eighty two percent african american population . so they too could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the. communities with which they resided . then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses so that it could. <unk> be used for storm water management for example by using surface lakes and retention ponds that created neighborhood amenities places of recreation <unk> and actually helped <unk>. <unk> to elevate adjacent property levels <unk> or we could use it as research plots where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils. <unk> or we could use it to generate energy <unk> . so the descendants of the great migration could either become precision watchmakers at shinola like willie h who was featured in one of their ads last year <unk>. or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like shinola the good news is there. <unk> a future for the next generation of detroiters <unk> both those there now and those that want to come . so no thank you mayor menino who recently was quoted as saying i 'd blow up the place and start over there are very important people . business and land assets in detroit and there are real opportunities there so while detroit might not be what it was detroit will not die <unk> thank you.
