 <unk> for the next few minutes we 're going to talk about energy and it 's going to be a bit of a varied talk i 'll try to spin a story about energy and oil 's a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil 's a good place to start. and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight. eight or so carbon atoms about twenty hydrogen atoms you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very <unk>. and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it 's great stuff <unk> now <unk> as far as it goes . there 's a lot of oil out there in the world <unk> here 's my little pocket map of where it 's all located . a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the. <unk> oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about one hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today <unk> . now that 's just one story about oil <unk> and we could end it there and say well oil 's going to last forever because well there 's just a lot of it but there 's actually more to. story than that oh by the way if you think you 're very far from some of this oil one thousand meters below where you 're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world <unk> . come talk to me about it i 'll fill in some of the details if you want . so that 's one of the stories of oil <unk> there 's just a lot of it <unk>. but what about oil where is it in the energy system <unk> . here 's a little snapshot of one hundred and fifty years of oil <unk> and it 's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those one hundred and fifty years. <unk> little secret i 'm going to tell you about . for the last twenty five years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems . there was one kind of peak oil in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five when oil represented fifty percent of global energy supply now it 's about thirty five percent it 's been declining and i believe it will continue to. <unk> probably peaked in two thousand and seven and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role. every year <unk> and so twenty five years ago <unk> there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak coal . and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood <unk> . this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what 's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas. and a little bit of nuclear for starters <unk> and what goes on in the future well <unk> i think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas . and beyond that peak renewables now i 'll tell you another little very important. story about this picture now i 'm not pretending that energy use in total isn 't increasing it is that 's another part of the story come talk to me about it we 'll fill in some of the. <unk> details but there 's a very important message here . this is two hundred years of history and for two hundred years we 've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system . energy systems of the world becoming progressively year on year decade on decade century on century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we 're developing today <unk> reaching maybe thirty percent of primary energy. by mid century . now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but i think actually there 's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story and this is looking out say two thousand one hundred. and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy <unk> well we have to take a little excursion and we. 'll start in central texas <unk> here 's a piece of limestone i picked it up outside of marble falls texas. <unk> four hundred million years old and it 's just limestone nothing really special about it <unk> . now here 's a piece of chalk i. picked this up at mit it 's a little younger <unk> . and it 's different than this limestone <unk> you can see that you wouldn 't build a building out of this stuff <unk> and you wouldn 't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this yeah it 's very different no it 's not different it 's not different . <unk> what 's different is how the molecules are put together <unk> . now <unk> if you think that 's kind of neat the story gets really neat right now <unk> off the coast of california. comes this <unk> it 's an abalone shell <unk> . now <unk> millions of abalone every year make this shell <unk> oh by the way just in case you weren 't already guessing. <unk> 's calcium carbonate <unk> . it 's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this . but it 's not the same stuff it 's different <unk> it 's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher. than this and why because the lowly abalone. is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers <unk> making this beautiful iridescent. mother of pearl very specialized material that the abalone. every day every year this is pretty incredible stuff <unk> all the same what 's different <unk> how the molecules are put together . now what does this have to do with energy <unk> . here 's a piece of coal <unk> and i 'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk <unk> . now <unk> whether we 're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries. <unk> or fuel cells . nature hasn 't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn 't need to . nature didn 't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn 't depend on building those materials <unk> until maybe now. when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy <unk> imagine what would it be like. <unk> like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this. just by rearranging the molecules differently . and so that is my story . the oil will never run out it 's not because we have a lot of it <unk> . it 's not because we 're going to build a bajillion windmills <unk> it 's because <unk> well <unk> . thousands of years ago. <unk> people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the stone age ended . not because we ran out of stones . laughter it 's ideas <unk> it 's innovation it 's technology that will end the age of oil <unk> long before we run out of oil <unk> thank you very much.
