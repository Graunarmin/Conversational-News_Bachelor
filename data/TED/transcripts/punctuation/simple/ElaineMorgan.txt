 <unk> all over the world <unk> eminent evolutionists. <unk> anxious to celebrate this and what they 're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect. of darwin and his life and how he changed our thinking . i say almost every aspect because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on <unk> and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something. <unk> so i 'm going to talk about it it 's the question of why are we so different from the chimpanzees . we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related hardly any genes of difference very very closely related . and yet <unk> when you look at the phenotypes there 's a chimp there 's a man they 're. astoundingly different. <unk> measurable physical differences they that one is hairy and walking on four legs <unk> that one is a naked biped why <unk> . i mean . laughter if i 'm a good darwinist i 've got to believe. there 's a reason for that if we changed so much. <unk> something must have happened <unk> what happened . now fifty years ago that was a laughably simple question <unk> everybody knew the answer they knew what happened <unk> . the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees . our ancestors went out onto the plain <unk> . that explained everything we had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass or to chase after animals or to free our hands for weapons. <unk> and we got so overheated in the chase. that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away <unk> . everybody knew that <unk> for generations <unk> but then in the ' 90s something began to unravel <unk> . the paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna. that lived in the same time. and place as the hominids <unk> . and they weren 't savanna species <unk> . and they looked at the herbivores <unk> and they weren 't savanna herbivores <unk> and then they were so clever they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen . shock horror <unk> . the fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation some of it even came from lianas those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle. so we 're left with a situation where. we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees <unk> . before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence . this is not something i 've made up it 's not a minority theory everybody agrees with it <unk> professor tobias came. <unk> over from south africa. and spoke to university college london he said everything i 've been telling you for the last twenty years <unk> forget about it <unk> it was wrong <unk> . we 've got to go back to square one and start again . it made him very unpopular they didn 't want to go back to square one <unk> . <unk> a terrible thing to happen you 've got this beautiful paradigm . you 've believed it through generations nobody has questioned it <unk> you 've been constructing fanciful things on top of it <unk> relying on it to be as solid as a rock <unk> and now it 's whipped away from under you . what do you do . what does a scientist do in that case well we know the answer because. thomas. <unk> he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails. is guess what they carry on as if nothing had happened . if they haven 't got a paradigm they can 't ask the question so they say yes it 's wrong but. <unk> only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions . so that is what they have done now that 's why you don 't hear them talking about it it 's yesterday 's question <unk> . some of them have even elevated it into a principle it 's what we ought to be doing <unk> aaron filler from harvard said isn. <unk> time we stopped talking about selective pressures i mean <unk> why don 't we talk about well there 's chromosomes and there 's genes and we just record what we see . charles darwin must be spinning in his grave . he knew all about that kind of science and he called it hypothesis free science <unk> and he despised it from the bottom of his heart <unk> . and. if you 're going to say i 'm going to stop talking about selective pressures you can take the origin of species and throw it out of. <unk> window for it 's about nothing else but selective pressures <unk> . and the irony of it is that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn 't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up . there was one waiting in the wings <unk> it had been waiting there since one thousand nine hundred and sixty. when alister hardy a marine biologist said . <unk> our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time . he kept it to himself for thirty years but then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose all his colleagues said this is outrageous you 've. exposed us to public ridicule <unk> you must never do that again . and at that time it became set in stone the aquatic theory. should be dumped. with the ufos and the. <unk> yetis <unk> as part of the lunatic fringe of science <unk> well i don 't think that i think that hardy had a lot going for him i 'd like to talk about just. a handful of what have been called the. hallmarks of mankind the things that made us different from everybody else and all our relatives let 's look at our naked skin. <unk> it 's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair mammals without body hair . are aquatic ones like the dugong <unk> the walrus <unk> the dolphin <unk> the hippopotamus the manatee <unk> and a couple of. like the babirusa <unk> and you 're tempted to think well. <unk> could that be. why we are naked i suggested it and people said no no no i mean look at the elephant you 've forgotten all about the elephant haven 't you . so back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two i said well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor . peals of merry laughter that crazy woman she 's off again she 'll say anything won 't she but by now <unk> everybody agrees that the elephant. <unk> round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros last year in florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said seems to have spent most of its time in the water . so this is a. close connection between nakedness and water as an absolute connection it only works one way. <unk> you can 't say all aquatic animals. are naked because look at the sea otter but you can say. that every. animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water in its own lifetime or the lifetime of its ancestors <unk> i think this is significant the only exception. is the naked somalian mole rat which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground and take bipedality <unk> here you can. anybody to compare it with. <unk> because we. 're the only animal that walks upright on two legs <unk> but you can say this . all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs if they want to for a short time there is only one circumstance in which they always all of them walk on two legs and that is when they are wading through water . do you think that 's significant. <unk> david attenborough thinks it 's significant <unk> as the possible beginning of our bipedalism . look at the fat layer we have got under our skin a layer of fat all over . nothing in the least like that in any other primate <unk> . why should it be there <unk> well they do know that if you look at other aquatic. <unk> land mammals is deposited inside the body wall around the kidneys and the. intestines and so on has started to migrate to the outside <unk> and spread out in a layer. inside the skin in the whale it 's complete no fat inside at all all in blubber outside . we cannot avoid the suspicion that in. <unk> case it 's started to happen we have got skin lined with this layer it 's the only possible explanation of why. humans if they 're very unlucky . can become grossly obese in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate <unk> physically impossible something very odd. matter of factly never explained . the question of why we can speak <unk> we can speak <unk> and the. nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that purely has to do with its. conscious control of its breath you can 't even train. a gorilla to say ah on request the only. creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds <unk> it was an absolute precondition. for our being able to speak <unk> and then again <unk> there is the fact. that we are streamlined trying to imagine a diver diving into water hardly makes a splash <unk> try to imagine a gorilla. performing the same. maneuver <unk> and you can see that compared with gorilla we are halfway to being shaped like a fish i am trying to suggest that for. <unk> aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe and it is not lunatic fringe and the ironic thing about it is that. they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own which they 've all agreed on and they love there is nothing there they are staving off the. <unk> how do they react when i say these things . one very common reaction i 've heard about twenty times is . but it was investigated <unk> they conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning when hardy. <unk> years i 've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind and i 've concluded. that that 's one of the urban myths it 's never been done i ask people sometimes <unk>. <unk> the aquatic theory <unk> everybody likes the aquatic theory of course they don 't believe it <unk> but they like. everybody i talk to says it 's rubbish <unk> and they can 't all be wrong can they . the answer to that <unk> loud and clear is yes they can all be wrong history is strewn with the cases when they 've all got it wrong . and if you 've got a scientific problem like. solve it by holding a head count and saying more of us say yes than say no . apart from that some of the heads count more than others. <unk> some of them have come over <unk> there was professor tobias he 's come over <unk> daniel dennett <unk> he 's come over <unk> sir david attenborough . <unk> now we 've got to look to the future <unk> ultimately one of three things is going to happen <unk> . either they will go on for the next forty years fifty years sixty years yeah well we don 't talk about that let 's talk about. <unk> that would be very sad <unk> the second thing that could happen. is that some young genius will arrive <unk> and say i 've found it <unk> it was not the savanna <unk> it was not the water <unk> it was this . no sign of that happening either <unk> i don 't think there is a third option so the third thing that might happen. is a very beautiful thing if you look back at the early years of the last century. <unk> lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in mendel and the believers in darwin it ended with a new synthesis . darwin 's ideas and mendel 's ideas blending together <unk> . and i think the same thing will happen here you 'll get a new synthesis . hardy 's ideas and darwin 's ideas will be blended together. <unk> and we can move forward from there <unk> and really get somewhere <unk> that would be a beautiful thing . it would be very nice for me if it happened soon . <unk> because i 'm older now than george burns was when he. <unk> that belongs with the ufos and the yetis and it 's not easy to change their minds <unk> . the professional journals. won 't touch it with a barge pole <unk> . the textbooks don 't mention it the syllabus doesn 't mention even the fact that we 're naked <unk> let alone look for a reason to it . horizon which takes its cue from the academics won 't touch it with a barge pole. so we never hear the case put for it except. in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe <unk> i don 't know quite. where this diktat comes from somebody up there is issuing. the. <unk> thou shalt not believe. in the aquatic theory <unk> . and if you hope to make progress in this profession <unk> and you do believe it you 'd better keep it to yourself <unk> because it will get in your way . so i get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are. morphing into a kind of priesthood <unk> . but you know . that makes me feel good <unk> because richard dawkins has told. <unk> us how to treat a priesthood . he says firstly <unk> you 've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence. it 's been trained to receive right i 'll go ahead with that and secondly <unk> he says you must never be afraid to rock the boat.
