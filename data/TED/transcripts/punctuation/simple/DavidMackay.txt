 <unk> when the industrial revolution started the amount of carbon sitting underneath britain in the form of coal. was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under saudi arabia in the form of oil. <unk> this carbon powered the industrial revolution it put the great in great britain and led to britain 's temporary world domination <unk> . and then in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen . coal production in britain peaked <unk> and has declined ever since . in due course britain started using oil and gas from the north sea <unk> and in the year two thousand oil and gas production from the north sea also peaked <unk>. <unk> and they 're now on the decline . these observations about the finiteness of easily accessible local <unk> secure fossil fuels. is a motivation for saying well <unk> what 's next <unk> what is life after fossil fuels going to be like shouldn 't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels another motivation of course . is climate change . and when people talk about life after fossil fuels and climate change action <unk> i think there 's a lot of. fluff a lot of greenwash a lot of misleading advertising . and i feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions that really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do add up <unk> . let me illustrate this with what physicists call a. <unk> down some numbers and get an answer it may not be very accurate <unk> but it may make you say hmm so here 's a question <unk> . imagine if we said oh yes we can get off fossil fuels we 'll use biofuels problem solved transport <unk> we don 't need oil anymore well <unk> . what if we grew the biofuels for a road. on the grass verge at the edge of the road how wide. <unk> wide would the verge have to be for that to work out ok. so let 's put in some numbers let 's have our cars go at sixty miles per hour <unk> let 's say they do thirty miles per gallon that 's the. european average for new cars let 's say the productivity of biofuel plantations is one thousand two hundred liters of biofuel per hectare per year that 's true of european. <unk> and let 's imagine the cars are spaced eighty meters apart from each other and they 're perpetually going along this road <unk> the length of the road doesn 't matter because the longer the road the more biofuel plantation . what do we do with these numbers take the first number <unk> divide by the other three and get eight kilometers <unk> and that 's the answer <unk> that 's how wide the plantation would have to be given these assumptions . and maybe that makes you say hmm . maybe this isn 't going to be quite so easy. <unk> and it might make you think <unk> . perhaps there 's an issue to do with areas <unk> and in this talk i 'd like to talk about land areas <unk> and ask is there an issue about areas <unk> the answer is going to be. yes but it depends which country you are in so let 's start in the united kingdom since that 's where we are today . the energy consumption of the united kingdom the total energy consumption not just transport. <unk> everything i like to quantify it in lightbulbs it 's as if we 've all got one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs on all the time one hundred and <unk>. per day per person is the energy consumption of the uk <unk> so there 's forty lightbulbs ' worth for transport forty lightbulbs ' worth for heating and forty lightbulbs <unk>. ' worth for making electricity and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish. <unk> 's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well <unk> . and ninety percent of this energy <unk> today <unk> still comes from fossil fuels and ten percent only from other <unk> greener possibly greener sources like nuclear power and renewables <unk> . so that 's the. <unk> the population density of the uk is two hundred and fifty people per square kilometer <unk> i 'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures on the vertical axis <unk> i 'm going to show you how <unk>. many lightbulbs what our energy consumption per person is we 're at one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs per person and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area of the united kingdom. <unk> two hundred and fifty people per square kilometer <unk> let 's add european countries in blue <unk> and. you can see there 's quite a variety i should emphasize both of these axes are logarithmic as you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you 're going up a factor of ten . next let 's add asia in red the middle east and north africa in green. sub saharan africa in blue. <unk> we have north america <unk> australia and new zealand <unk>. you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions countries are different from each other top left <unk> we have canada <unk>. <unk> and australia with enormous land areas very high per capita consumption two hundred or three hundred lightbulbs per person. <unk> population densities top right <unk> bahrain has the same energy consumption per person roughly as canada. over three hundred lightbulbs per person <unk> but their population density is a factor of three hundred times greater one thousand people per square kilometer <unk> bottom right <unk> bangladesh has the same population density. as bahrain but consumes one hundred times less per person <unk> bottom left. <unk> no one but there used to be a whole load of people here 's another message from this diagram i 've added on little blue tails behind sudan <unk> libya <unk> china india bangladesh that 's. <unk> fifteen years of progress <unk> where were they fifteen years ago and where are they now and the message is <unk> most countries are going to the right <unk> and they 're going up up and to the right <unk> bigger population density and higher per capita consumption so we may be off in the top. <unk> corner slightly unusual the united kingdom accompanied by germany <unk> japan south korea the netherlands and a bunch of other slightly odd countries . but many other countries are coming up and to the right to join us so we 're a picture if you like of. what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too. <unk> i 've also added in this diagram now some pink lines that go down and to the right <unk> those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area <unk> which i measure in watts per square <unk>. <unk> meter <unk> so for example the middle line there zero point one watts per square meter <unk> is the energy consumption per unit area of saudi arabia <unk> norway <unk> mexico in purple and bangladesh fifteen years ago <unk>. the united kingdom is consuming one point two five watts per square meter <unk> so is germany <unk> and japan is consuming a bit more . so . let 's now say why this is relevant <unk> why is it relevant well we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units. renewables is one of the leading. <unk> ideas for how we could get off our ninety percent <unk> fossil fuel habit <unk> . so here come some renewables energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter in european climates . what does that mean <unk> you might have anticipated that that result given what i told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago <unk> well <unk> we consume one point two five watts. <unk> what this means is even if you covered the whole of the united kingdom with energy crops you couldn 't match today 's energy consumption . wind power produces a bit more two point five watts per square meter <unk> but that 's only twice as big as one point two five watts per square meter <unk> . so that means if you wanted literally to produce. total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms you need wind farms half the area of the uk <unk> i 've got data to. <unk> back up all these assertions by the way <unk> . next let 's look at solar power . solar panels when you put them on a roof deliver about twenty watts per square meter in england <unk> . if you really want to get a lot from solar panels you need to adopt adopt the traditional bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof <unk> and coat the. <unk> solar parks because of the gaps between the panels deliver less they deliver about five watts per square meter of land area <unk> and here 's a solar park in vermont with real data <unk> delivering four point two watts per square meter <unk> . remember where we are one point two five watts per square meter <unk> wind farms two point five solar parks about five . so whichever of those renewables you pick. <unk> whatever mix of those renewables you 're using if you want to power the uk on them you 're going to need to cover something like twenty percent or twenty five percent. of the country with those renewables <unk> i 'm not saying that 's a bad idea we just need to understand the numbers i 'm absolutely not anti renewables i love renewables but i 'm also <unk>. concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area because you don 't have the problem of clouds. <unk> this facility delivers fourteen watts per square meter <unk> this one ten watts per square meter <unk> and this one in spain five watts per square meter <unk> being generous to concentrating solar power <unk> i think it 's perfectly <unk>. <unk> credible it could deliver twenty watts per square meter <unk> so that that 's nice of course <unk> britain doesn 't have any deserts. laughter so here 's a summary so far all renewables much as i love them. <unk> diffuse they all have a small power per unit area <unk> and we have to live with that fact <unk> and. that means if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the united kingdom on the scale of today 's consumption you need to be imagining renewable facilities. that are country sized not the entire country but a fraction of the country a substantial fraction there are. <unk> other options for generating power as well <unk> which don 't involve fossil fuels so there 's nuclear power and on this ordinance survey map <unk> you can see there 's a sizewell b inside a blue square <unk>. <unk> kilometer that 's one gigawatt in a square kilometer <unk> which works out to one thousand watts per square meter <unk> so by this particular metric nuclear power isn 't as intrusive. and nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems <unk> but the same goes for renewables as well here 's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of penicuik just. just outside edinburgh <unk> and you can see the children of penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill so . people are anti everything and we 've got to keep all the options on the table what can a country like the. <unk> uk do on the supply side well <unk> the options are i 'd say these three power renewables <unk> and recognizing that they need to be close to country sized . other people 's renewables so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left hand side of the diagram and say uh . we don 't want renewables in our backyard but um please could we put them in yours instead and that 's a serious option it 's a way for the world to. <unk> to handle this issue so countries like australia <unk> russia <unk> libya <unk> kazakhstan could be our best friends for renewable production. and a third option is is nuclear power <unk> so that 's some supply side options . in addition to the supply levers that we can push and remember we need large amounts because at the moment we get ninety percent of our energy from fossil fuels. in addition to those levers. <unk> could talk about other ways of solving this issue <unk> namely we could reduce demand <unk> and that means reducing population i 'm not sure how to do that. or reducing per capita consumption <unk> . so let 's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side first transport here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy. consumption of transport. people often say technology can answer everything we can make vehicles that are one hundred times more efficient and that 's almost true let me show you . the energy consumption of this typical tank here is eighty kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers that 's the. average european car eighty kilowatt hours can we make something one hundred times better by applying the physics principles i just listed yes here it is . <unk> it 's eighty times better in energy consumption and it 's powered by biofuel by weetabix . and there are other options in between because maybe the lady in the tank would say no that 's a lifestyle change don 't change my lifestyle please we could persuade her to take a train still a lot more efficient than a car but that might be a lifestyle change or there 's the <unk>. <unk> it comfortably accommodates one teenager and it 's. 's shorter than a traffic cone and it 's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at. fifteen miles per hour <unk> . in between perhaps some more realistic options on the transport lever are electric vehicles so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol powered tank . next <unk> there 's the heating lever heating is a third of our energy consumption. <unk> and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings doing space heating and water heating <unk> . so here 's a typical crappy british house <unk> it 's my house with a ferrari out front . what can we do to it well the laws of physics are written up there <unk> which describe how the power. the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control the. <unk> you can control are the temperature difference between the inside and the outside there 's this remarkable technology called a thermostat you grasp it rotate it to the left <unk> and your energy consumption in the home will decrease <unk> i 've tried it it works some people call it a lifestyle change . laughter you can also get the. fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building put fluff in the walls fluff in the roof a new front door and so forth. <unk> the sad truth is this will save you money that 's not sad that 's good. <unk> but the sad truth is it 'll only get about twenty five percent of the leakiness of your building if you do these things which are good ideas . if you really want to get a bit closer to swedish building standards with a crappy house like this . you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in london . you can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity. to move heat from your garden into your house <unk> . the third demand side option i want to talk about the third way to reduce energy consumption is <unk> read your meters . people talk a lot about smart meters but you can do it yourself use your own eyes and be smart <unk> read your meter <unk> . and if you 're anything like me it 'll change your life here 's a graph i made i was writing a book about sustainable energy and a friend asked me how much energy do you use at home. <unk> embarrassed i didn 't actually know <unk> and so i started reading the meter every week the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph and then two thousand and seven is shown in green at the bottom <unk>. <unk> that was when i was reading the meter every week <unk> and my life changed because i started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference my gas consumption plummeted because i started tinkering with the thermostat <unk>. <unk> and the timing on the heating system <unk> and i knocked more than half off my gas bills there 's a similar story. <unk> for my electricity consumption . where switching off the dvd players the stereos the computer peripherals that were on all the time <unk> and just switching them on when i needed them knocked another third off my electricity bills too . so we need a plan that adds up i 've described for you six big levers <unk> we need. big action because we get ninety percent of our energy from fossil fuels and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers <unk> . most of these levers have popularity problems <unk> and if there is a lever you don 't like the the use of well <unk> please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers . so i 'm a strong advocate of advocate of having grown up conversations that are based on numbers and. <unk> and i want to close with this map that just visualizes for you. the. requirement of land and so forth in order to get just sixteen lightbulbs per person from four of the big possible sources <unk> . so <unk> if you wanted to get sixteen lightbulbs remember <unk> today our total energy consumption is one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs ' worth if you wanted sixteen from wind . this map visualizes a solution for the uk it 's got one hundred and sixty wind farms each one hundred square. <unk> kilometers in size <unk> and that would be a twentyfold increase over today 's amount of wind . nuclear power to get sixteen lightbulbs per person <unk> you 'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map that 's a fourfold increase. over today 's levels of nuclear power <unk> . biomass to get sixteen lightbulbs per person <unk> you 'd need a land area something like three and a half wales ' worth <unk> either in our country. or in someone else 's country possibly ireland possibly somewhere else . and a fourth supply side option <unk> concentrating solar power in other people 's deserts . if you wanted to get sixteen lightbulbs ' worth then we 're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right the total area of those hexagons is two greater london 's. <unk> power lines all the way across spain and france to bring the power from the sahara. to surrey we need a plan that adds up <unk> we need to stop shouting and start talking <unk> . and. if we can have a <unk> grown up conversation make a plan that adds up and get building maybe this low carbon revolution will actually be fun <unk> thank you very much for listening.
