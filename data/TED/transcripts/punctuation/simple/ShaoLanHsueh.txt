 <unk> growing up in taiwan. as the daughter of a calligrapher <unk> . one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty the shape and the form of chinese characters . ever since then i was fascinated by this incredible language. <unk> but to an outsider <unk> it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china <unk> . over the past few years <unk> i 've been wondering if i can break down this wall so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so . i started thinking about how a new fast method of learning chinese might be useful . <unk> of five i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence <unk> . i learned new characters every day during the course of the next fifteen years <unk> . since we only have five minutes it 's better that we have a fast and simpler way . a chinese scholar would understand twenty thousand characters you only need one thousand to understand. the basic literacy <unk> the top two hundred will allow you to comprehend forty percent of basic literature. enough to read road signs <unk> restaurant menus to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers <unk> . today i 'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works you are ready <unk> . open your mouth as. <unk> wide as possible until it 's square you get a mouth <unk> this is a person. going for a walk person . if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides as if she was yelling frantically. <unk> originally from the shape of the flame but i like to think that way <unk> whichever works for you this is a tree tree <unk> . this is a mountain <unk> . the sun . <unk> symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west . i call these eight characters radicals . they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters . a person if someone walks behind that. <unk> company <unk> three is a crowd . if a person stretched their arms wide this person is saying it was this big . the person inside the mouth <unk> the person is trapped <unk> he 's a prisoner <unk> just like jonah inside the whale <unk> . one tree is a tree <unk> two trees together <unk> we have the woods <unk> three trees together. <unk> we create the forest <unk> . put a plank underneath the tree <unk> we have the foundation <unk> put a mouth on the top of the tree that 's idiot . easy to remember since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. <unk> remember fire two. <unk> i get really hot <unk> three fires together <unk> that 's a lot of flames <unk> set the fire underneath the two trees it 's burning . for us <unk> the sun is the source of prosperity <unk> two suns together <unk> prosperous <unk> three together <unk> that 's sparkles <unk> . put the sun and the moon shining together <unk> it 's brightness <unk> it also means tomorrow after a day and a night <unk> . the sun is coming up above the horizon sunrise. <unk> a door <unk> put a plank inside the door it 's a door bolt <unk> . put a mouth inside the door <unk> asking questions knock knock is anyone home . this person is sneaking out of a door <unk> escaping <unk> evading . on the left we have a woman two women together <unk> they have an argument. <unk> be careful it 's adultery . so we have gone through almost thirty characters <unk> . by using this method the first eight radicals will allow you to build thirty two the next group of eight characters will build an extra <unk> thirty two . so with very little effort you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters which is the same as a chinese. <unk> so after we know the characters we start building phrases for example <unk> the mountain and the fire together <unk> we have fire mountain <unk> it 's a volcano . we know japan is the land of the rising sun this is a sun placed with the origin because japan lies to the east of china <unk> . so a sun . <unk> we build japan a person behind japan what do we get a. japanese person <unk> . the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other . in ancient china <unk> that means in exile <unk> because chinese emperors <unk> they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains <unk> . nowadays exile has turned into. <unk> getting out a mouth which tells you where to get out. is an exit <unk> this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage <unk> thank you.
