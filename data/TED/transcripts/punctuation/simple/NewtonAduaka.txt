 <unk> very strange for me because im not used to doing this i usually stand on the other side of the light and now i 'm feeling the pressure i put other people into. <unk> and it 's hard. <unk> really painted a very good background as to. the impulse behind my work and what drives me and my sense of of loss and trying to find. the answer to the big questions <unk> but this for me i mean coming here to do this feels. <unk> sculptor that i like very much <unk> giacometti who after. many years of living in france and learning <unk> you know <unk> studying and. working he returned home and he was asked what did you produce what have you. done with so many years of being away and he sort of he showed a handful of figurines and. obviously they were is this what you spent years doing and we expected. huge. masterpieces. what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a mans life search . thought everything just. <unk> in a reduced small version in a way i feel like that i feel like im coming home to. talk about what ive been away doing for for twenty years <unk> and i will start with a. brief taster of what ive been about a handful of films nothing much two feature films and a handful of short films. <unk> mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to nigeria. <unk> you is a waste of time marcus. <unk> like me not getting a break in life marcus so what solutions do you offer <unk> i mean the job of a poet is. <unk> a sure sign of his inability to express himself. <unk> can you not shut up now you talk straight to me. <unk> do you think about your movie d1 my movies they are ok <unk> fine they are better than making documentaries no one ever sees. <unk> trying to capture what cinema is for me and where i 'm coming from in terms of cinema <unk> the first piece <unk> was . really there 's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling she 'll be happy there. <unk> the sentiments of someone that 's been away from home and that was something that i went through you know and i 'm still going through i 've not been home for quite a while for about five years now i 've been away. twenty years in total . and so its its really it 's really. how suddenly you know <unk> this was made in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven which is the time of abacha the military. <unk> for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is . how and it 's sort of . perhaps romantic but i think <unk> i think beautiful because you you just need something to hold on to especially in a society where you feel. <unk> which takes us to the next piece where the young man talks about lack of opportunity <unk> living as a as a black person in europe. <unk> the glass ceiling that we all know about that we all talk about <unk>. and his reality <unk> again this was my this was me talking about this was again the time of multiculturalism in in the united kingdom <unk> and there was this buzzword and it. <unk> trying to say what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people and what what would a child. what does a child like jamie the young boy think i mean with all this anger that 's. built up inside of him <unk> what happens with that what of course happens with that is violence <unk> which we see when. we talk about the ghettos and we talk about <unk> you know. <unk> and manifests itself as riots <unk> like the one in france two years ago where i live which shocked everybody because everyone thought oh well france is a liberal society but. i lived in england for eighteen years i 've lived in france for about four and i feel actually thrown back twenty years living in france. <unk> and then the third piece <unk> the third piece for me is the question what is cinema to you what do you do with cinema there. 's a young director hollywood director with his friends fellow filmmakers. talking about what cinema means i suppose that will take me to. <unk> my last piece what cinema means for me <unk> my life started as a. i started life in one thousand nine hundred and sixty six a few months before the biafran which lasted for three years and it was three years of war so. that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece. <unk> to school with your brother. this. <unk> injection made us not to have mind. <unk> of rufus you are ezra the coward hes not taking care of his troops troop . <unk> the diamonds end up in his pocket. <unk> help of others that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war more than. <unk> begin a healing process and finally to as an act of closure to a terrible period in this countrys history the beginning of hope. <unk> like to remind you youre not on. trial here for any crimes you committed e we were fighting for our freedom . if killing in a war is a crime then you have to charge every soldier. <unk> the world war is a crime yes <unk> but i did not start it you too are a retired general not so cc yes . correct e so you too must stand trial then . our government was corrupt lack of education. was their way to control power <unk> if i may ask do you pay for school in your country. you are richer than us but we pay for school . your country talks about democracy but you support corrupt governments. like my own why because you want our diamond . <unk> to say that my point really here is that while were making all these huge advancements. for me you know i think we should. africa should move forward but we should remember so we do not go back here again thank you emeka okafor . thank you newton . one of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched. is this sense of. the psychological trauma. of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers <unk> and. considering where you are coming from and when we consider the extent to which its not. taken as seriously as it should be what would you have to say about that na in the process. <unk> of my research i actually spent a spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this <unk> and i remember i met a lot of. child soldiers <unk> <unk> ex combatants as they. like to be called i met psychosocial. psychosocial workers. <unk> the flight back on my last trip i remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself. if any kid in the west in the western world went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through. <unk> they will be. in therapy for the rest of their natural lives. <unk> so for me the thought that we have all these children its a generation we have a whole generation of children who have. who have been put through so so much psychological psychological trauma or damage and africa has to live with that but im just saying to factor. <unk> that in factor that in with all this great advancement all this pronouncement of great achievement . thats really my thinking eo well we thank you again for coming to the ted stage that was a very moving piece.
