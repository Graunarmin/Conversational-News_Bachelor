 <unk> and killed a man <unk> i was a young drug dealer with a quick temper. <unk> but that wasn 't the end of my story in fact it was beginning and the twenty three years since. is a story. of acknowledgment <unk> apology. and atonement <unk> but it didn 't happen in the way that you might imagine or think . these things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising. <unk> especially to me see like many of you . growing up <unk> i was an honor roll student a scholarship student with dreams of becoming a doctor <unk> . but things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated. and eventually divorced <unk> . <unk> i got shot three times standing on the corner of my block in detroit . my friend rushed me to the hospital <unk> doctors pulled the bullets out . patched me up and sent me back to the same neighborhood where i got shot. <unk> throughout this ordeal <unk> no one hugged me <unk> no one counseled me. <unk> no one told me i would be okay <unk> . no one told me that i would live in fear that i would become paranoid or. that i would react <unk> hyper violently to being shot . no one told me that one day i would become the person behind the trigger . fourteen months later at. i fired the shots that caused a man 's death . when i entered prison. i was bitter. i was angry <unk> i was hurt i didn 't want to take responsibility <unk> i blamed everybody from my parents to the. <unk> 's better to be the shooter. than the person getting shot as i sat in my cold cell <unk> i felt helpless <unk> unloved. and abandoned <unk> i felt like nobody cared. and i reacted with hostility to my confinement. <unk> myself getting deeper and deeper into trouble <unk> i ran black market stores <unk> i loan sharked . and i sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison i. had in fact become what the warden of the michigan reformatory called the worst of the worst . <unk> i landed in solitary confinement for seven and a half years out of my incarceration <unk> . now as i see it solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself but. find myself i did . one day i was pacing my cell <unk> when an officer. came and delivered. <unk> i looked at a couple of letters before i looked at the letter. that had my son 's squiggly handwriting on it . and anytime i would get a letter from my son it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine <unk> . and on this particular day i opened this letter. <unk> and in capital letters he wrote my mama told me why you was in prison. <unk> jesus watches what you do pray to him . now i wasn 't religious at that time nor am i religious now <unk> but it was something so profound. about my son 's words . they made me examine things about my life that i hadn 't considered it was the first time in my life that i had actually thought about the fact. that my son would see me as a murderer. <unk> i sat back on my bunk. and i reflected on something i had read in [ plato ] . where socrates stated in apology that the unexamined life isn 't worth living . at that point is when the transformation began <unk> . but it didn 't come easy. <unk> of the things i realized which was part of the transformation was that there were four key things . the first thing was i had great mentors now. i know some of you all are probably thinking how did you find a great mentor in prison <unk> but in my case . some of my mentors who are serving life sentences. were some of the best people to ever come into my life. <unk> because they forced me to look at my life honestly and they forced me to challenge myself about my decision making <unk> . the second thing was literature <unk> . prior to going to prison <unk> i didn 't know that there were so many brilliant black poets <unk> authors and philosophers <unk> . and then i had the great fortune. of encountering malcolm x 's autobiography. and it shattered every stereotype i had about myself <unk> . the third thing was family for nineteen years my father stood by my side. with an unshakable faith because he believed that i had what it took to turn my life around i also met an amazing woman. who is now the mother. she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way <unk> . the final thing was writing <unk> when i got that letter from my son i began to write a journal. about things i had experienced in my childhood and in prison <unk> . and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement. <unk> earlier in my incarceration i had received a letter from. one of the relatives of my victim <unk> and in that letter . she told me she forgave me because she realized i was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships. and just made a series of poor decisions <unk> it was the first time in my life. that i ever felt. open to forgiving myself. one of the things that happened after that experience is that. i thought about the other men who were incarcerated alongside of me and how much i wanted to share this with them and so i started talking to them about. some of their experiences <unk> and i was devastated to realize that most of them came from the same abusive environments <unk> and most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it. <unk> around <unk> but unfortunately the system that currently holds two point five million people in prison is designed to warehouse. as opposed to rehabilitate or transform so i made it up in my mind that if i was ever released from prison. that i would do everything in my power. to help change that. <unk> i walked out of prison for the first time after two decades <unk> now imagine if you will fred flintstone. walking into an episode of the jetsons . that was pretty much what my life was like . for the first time i was exposed to the internet <unk> social media cars that talk like kitt from knight rider. <unk> fascinated me the most was phone technology see when i went to prison our car phones were this big. and required two people to carry them so imagine what it was like when i first grabbed my little blackberry. and i started learning how to text <unk> but the thing is the people around me they didn 't realize that i had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant like lol. <unk> with one of my friends via text. and i asked him to do something and he responded back k . and i was like what is k and he was like k is okay so in my head i was like well what the hell is wrong. <unk> and then he texts back and he asks me why was i cussing him out <unk> and i said lol fu as in i finally understand . and so fast forward three years i 'm doing relatively good i have a fellowship at mit media lab <unk> i work for an. <unk> i teach at the university of michigan <unk> but it 's been a struggle. because i realize that there are more men and women coming home. who are not going to be afforded those opportunities <unk> i 've been blessed to work with some amazing men and women . helping others reenter society and one of them is my friend named calvin evans . he served twenty four years for a crime. <unk> 's currently enrolled in college <unk> . and one of the things that we talked about is the three things that i found important in my personal transformation the first being acknowledgment i. had to acknowledge that i had hurt others i also had to acknowledge that i had been hurt <unk> . the second thing was apologizing <unk> . i had to apologize to the people i had hurt <unk> even though i had no expectations of them accepting it it was important to do because it was the right thing but i also had to apologize. <unk> thing was atoning for me atoning meant going back into my community. and working with at risk youth who were on the same path <unk> but also becoming at one with myself . through my experience of being locked up one of the things i discovered is this <unk> the majority of men and women who are incarcerated are. <unk> fact is ninety percent of the men and women who are incarcerated will at some point return to the community . and we have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community . my wish today. is that we will embrace a more empathetic approach toward how we deal with mass incarceration <unk> that we. <unk> my journey is a unique journey <unk> but it doesn 't have to be that way <unk> anybody can have a transformation. if we create the space for that to happen so what i 'm asking today is that you envision. a world where men and women aren 't held hostage. to their pasts where misdeeds and mistakes don 't define you for the rest of your life. i think collectively we can create that reality <unk> and i hope you do too.
