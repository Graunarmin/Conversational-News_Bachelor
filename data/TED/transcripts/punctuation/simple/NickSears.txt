 <unk> fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope it was a 200 foot diameter geodesic sphere. to be suspended suspended over the east river in new york city in full view of the united nations it was a big idea for sure <unk> and it was one that. he he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through. through animations of of global data <unk> trends and other information regarding the globe on this sphere <unk> . and today forty five years later we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity. <unk> what we do have is improved technology today we don 't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display we can use <unk>. <unk> are smaller they 're cheaper they 're longer lasting they 're more efficient . most importantly for this they 're faster <unk> and this speed combined with today 's <unk> high performance micro controllers allows us to actually simulate . in this piece over seventeen thousand. <unk> and the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision but as this ring rotates at about one thousand seven hundred rpm that 's <unk> twenty eight times per second . the equator 's speed is actually about sixty miles per hour. there are four <unk>. that each time this ring rotates it as it passes the rear of the display it picks up a position signal and from that . <unk> can extrapolate the position of the ring. at all points around the revolution. and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations but this is really just the beginning . in addition to higher resolution versions of this display <unk> my father and i are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon. it achieves this by rotating leds about two axes so as you can see here this is a eleven inch diameter circuit board these blocks represent. <unk> you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis it will create. a disc of light that we can control that 's nothing new that 's a propeller clock that 's. the rims that you can buy for your car but what is new is that when we rotate this disc about this axis. this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light and so we can control. <unk> and create a fully volumetric three dimensional display with just two hundred and <unk>. now this piece is currently in process due out in may. but what we 've done is we 've put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere <unk>. i 've got a little video to show you but. keep in mind that this is with no electronic control <unk> and this is also with only four. <unk> this is actually only about one point five percent of what the final display will be in may so take a look <unk> . and here you can see it 's rotating about the vertical axis only creating circles <unk> . and then as the other axis kicks in those actually blur into a volume and. the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case <unk> but this piece is due out in may it 'll be on display at the interactive telecommunications spring show in. <unk> greenwich village in new york city that 's open to the public definitely invite you all to come and attend it 's a fantastic show there are. hundreds of student innovators with with fantastic projects . this piece actually <unk> will be on display down in the sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show so i 'd. love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a closer look it. 's an honor to be here thanks very much.
