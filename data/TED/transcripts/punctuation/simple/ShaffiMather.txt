 <unk> anger in me against corruption. made me to make a big career change last year becoming a full time practicing lawyer my experiences. over the last eighteen months as a lawyer has seeded in me a new. entrepreneurial idea which i believe is indeed worth spreading <unk> . so i share it with all of you here today though the idea itself is getting crystallized and i 'm still writing up the business plan of course it helps. that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed. increases <unk> i 've been a huge. <unk> fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since one thousand nine hundred and ninety three . i 've explored <unk> experienced and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart 's content <unk> . i built <unk> along with my two brothers . the leading real estate company in my home state kerala <unk> and then worked professionally with two of india 's biggest businessmen but in their startup enterprises. <unk> two thousand and three when i stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so called social sector issues <unk> . i definitely did not have any grand. strategy or plan to pursue and find for profit solutions. to addressing pressing public issues <unk> when life brought about a series of death and. experiences within my close circle which highlighted the need. for an emergency medical response service in india similar to nine hundred and eleven in usa to address this i along with four friends <unk> founded ambulance access for all . to promote life support ambulance services in india . for those from the developing world <unk> there is nothing absolutely nothing new in this idea. <unk> idea <unk> but as we envisioned it we had three key goals <unk> providing world class life support ambulance service which is fully self sustainable from its own revenue streams . and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency <unk> irrespective of the capability to pay . the service which grew out of this <unk> . with one ambulance in two thousand and four now has a hundred plus ambulances in three states <unk> and has transported over one hundred thousand patients and victims since inception . the service is fully self sustainable. from its own revenues <unk> without accessing any public funds <unk> and the cross subsidy model actually works. <unk> the rich pays higher <unk> poor pays lower and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge . the service responded effectively and efficiently during the unfortunate twenty six eleven mumbai terror attacks. and as you can see from the visuals . the service was. responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off. the incident. <unk> locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike . we ended up being the first medical response team in every. incident location and transported one hundred and. <unk> over the last one year <unk> we have actually helped a pakistani ngo aman foundation to set up. life support ambulance service in karachi <unk> facilitated. <unk> it 's a small message from us in our own small way. to the enemies of humanity of islam . of south asia of india <unk> and of pakistan that humanity will continue to bloom <unk> irrespective of such. <unk> two other social enterprises one is education access for all setting up schools in small town india <unk> and the other is moksha yug access which is integrating rural supply chain. on the foundations of <unk>. microfinance i guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right <unk> because diligent investors and venture funds. have committed over seven point five million dollars in funding with the significance being. <unk> these funds have come in as a qt capital not as grant or as philanthropy <unk> . now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i 'm exploring corruption bribes and lack of transparency you may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their. <unk> bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless. common man and the demand side being mostly politicians bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them <unk> . according to world bank estimate one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year <unk> worsening the condition of the already worse off . yet if you analyze the common man. he or she does not wake up every day and say hmm let me see who i can pay a bribe to today or let me see who i can corrupt today . often it is the constraining or the back to the wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe . in the modern day world where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably. <unk> tough the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life now. let me ask you another question <unk> imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day to day life to get something done <unk> what do you do . of course you can call the police but what is the use if the police department is in itself. steeped in corruption . most definitely you don 't want to pay the bribe <unk> but you also don 't have the time resources <unk> expertise or wherewithal to fight this . unfortunately . many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in pay a fee <unk> and. <unk> such a service simply do not exist . one image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother seventy plus years being harassed by the bureaucrats. <unk> in the town planning office all she needed was permission to build three steps to her house from ground level making it easier for her to enter and exit her house <unk> . yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe . even though it pricked my conscience then i could not or rather i did not tend to her or assist her <unk> because i was busy building my real estate company i don 't want to be haunted by such images any more . a group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address. individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement <unk> and in all forty two cases where we have pushed back such demands. using existing and legitimate tools like the right to information act . video <unk> audio or peer pressure we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe and with the cost of these tools being substantially. <unk> lower than the bribe demanded i believe that these tools that worked in these forty two pilot cases can be consolidated. in standard processes. in a bpo kind of environment and made available on web call center and franchise physical offices for a fee to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe . <unk> market is as tempting as it can get it can be worth up to one trillion dollars being paid in bribes every year <unk> or equal to india 's gdp and it is an absolutely virgin market . i propose to explore this idea further to examine the potential of creating a. <unk> corruption i do realize that the fight for justice against corruption. is never easy it never has been and it never will be in my last eighteen months as a lawyer battling small and large scale corruption <unk> including the one perpetrated by india 's biggest corporate scamster <unk> through his charities. i have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass. <unk> and intimidation . the battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves our families our friends <unk> and even our kids <unk> yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place . what gives us the courage as my close friend replied when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project. that it is an impossible task and. <unk> are insane to chalk up their <unk> blue chip jobs i quote of course we cannot fail in this at least in our own minds for we are insane people <unk> trying to do an impossible task and an insane person does not know what an impossible task is. <unk> give us a sense of of the numbers here a typical bribe and a typical fee i mean what 's in your head sm so let me <unk> let me give you an example <unk> somebody who. <unk> who had applied for the passport <unk> the officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around three thousand rupees in bribes and. he did not want to pay <unk> so we actually used the right to information act which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states <unk> and. pushed back the officers. in this particular case <unk> and in all these forty two cases <unk> when we kept pushing them back there was three kinds of reaction a set of people actually say. <unk> just grant it to them and. run away from it some people actually come back and say oh you want to screw me . let me show you what i can do and he will he will push us back so you take the next step or use the next tool available in what what we are putting together <unk> . and then he relents by the. <unk> what fee would you have to charge and can you actually make the business work sm well actually the cost that we incurred was less than. two hundred rupees so it actually works ca that 's a high gross margin business i like. <unk> so these are provisional numbers <unk> no pricing guarantee <unk> if you can pull this off you will be a global hero i mean this could be huge <unk> thank you so much for sharing this idea.
