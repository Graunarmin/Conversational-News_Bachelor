 <unk> my name is marcin. farmer <unk> technologist. i was born in poland now in the u s . i started a group called open source ecology we 've identified the fifty most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist. things from tractors. bread ovens <unk> circuit makers then we set out to create an open source diy do it yourself version. that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost we call this the global village construction set so let me tell you a story so i finished my 20s. with a ph d in fusion energy and i discovered. i was useless <unk> i had no practical skills. world presented me with options and i took them <unk> i guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle <unk> so i started a farm. in missouri and learned about the economics of farming <unk> i bought a tractor. then it broke <unk> i paid to get it repaired then it broke again <unk> then pretty soon <unk> i was broke too <unk> . i realized that the truly. <unk> appropriate low cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and. settlement just didn 't exist yet <unk> . i needed tools that were robust modular <unk> . highly efficient and optimized low cost made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime not designed for obsolescence <unk> . i found that i would have to build them myself <unk> . so i did just that. and i tested them . and i found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale <unk> . so then i published the 3d designs schematics <unk> instructional videos and budgets on a wiki <unk> . then contributors from all over the world began showing up <unk> prototyping new machines during dedicated. <unk> project visits <unk> so far we have prototyped eight of the fifty machines and now the project is beginning to grow on its own . we know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity . and the same is starting to happen with hardware too <unk> we 're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people 's lives in such tangible material ways. <unk> if we can lower the barriers to farming building manufacturing <unk> then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential that 's not only in the developing world . our tools are being made for the american farmer builder <unk> entrepreneur maker we 've seen lots of excitement from these people who can now start a construction business <unk> parts manufacturing. <unk> just selling power back to the grid <unk> our goal is a repository of published designs so clear so complete that a single burned dvd. is effectively a civilization starter kit <unk> . i 've planted a hundred trees in a day <unk> . i 've pressed five thousand bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet. and built a tractor in six. <unk> days from what i 've seen this is only the beginning . if this idea is truly sound then the implications are significant . a greater distribution of the means of production <unk> . environmentally sound supply chains <unk> and a newly relevant diy maker culture. can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. <unk> we 're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology <unk> thank you.
