 <unk> this wish to think about when you 're a little kid and all your friends ask you if a genie could give you one wish in the world what would it be . and i always answered well i 'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for. <unk> because you 'd know what to wish for and you 'd use up your wish and now since we only have one wish unlike last year they had three wishes i 'm not going to wish for that so let 's get to what i. would like which is world peace <unk> and i know what you 're thinking you 're thinking the poor girl up there she thinks she 's at a beauty pageant she 's not. <unk> but i really do think it makes sense. <unk> and i think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other i 've met a lot of different people over the years and i 've filmed some of them from a. dotcom executive in in new york who wanted to take over the world to a military press officer in qatar who would rather not take over the. <unk> what i 'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel to meet people in a different way than than. because you can 't travel all over the world at the same time and. <unk> a long time ago well about forty years ago my mom had. an exchange student and i 'm going to show you slides of the exchange student this is donna this is donna at the statue of liberty . this is my mother and aunt teaching donna how to ride a bike . this is donna eating ice cream and this is donna teaching my aunt how to do a filipino dance. <unk> i really think as the world is getting smaller it becomes more and more important that we learn each other 's dance moves that we meet each other we get to know each other we are able to figure out a <unk>. <unk> way to to cross borders to understand each other to understand people 's hopes and dreams what makes them laugh and cry and i know that we can 't all do exchange programs and i can <unk>. <unk> 't force everybody to travel i 've already talked about that to chris and amy and they said that there 's a problem with this you can. <unk> force people free will and i totally support that so we 're not forcing people to travel <unk> but i 'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn 't require a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera a projector. and a screen <unk> and. that 's what i 'm going to talk to you about. <unk> i was asked that i speak a little bit about where i personally come from and cameron i don 't know how you managed to get out of that one <unk> but i. i think that building bridges is important to me because of where i come from i 'm. the. daughter of an american mother <unk> and an egyptian lebanese syrian father so i 'm the living product of two cultures. <unk> american with a persian name the middle east peace crisis so maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together. a way to take the worlds with me a way to tell stories. visually <unk> it all kind of started that way but i think that i really realized the power of the image when i first went to the. garbage collecting village in egypt when i was about sixteen . my mother took me there <unk> she 's somebody who believes strongly in community service and decided that this was something that i needed to do and so i went there and. i met some amazing women there <unk> there there was a. center there where they were teaching people how to read and and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. and i began teaching there i taught english and i met some incredible women there i met. people that live seven seven people to a room <unk> . barely can afford their evening meal yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities <unk> i got drawn into this community and i began to take pictures there. i took pictures of. weddings. and. older family members things that they wanted memories of about two years after i started taking these pictures the <unk>. un conference on population and development asked me to show them at the conference so i was eighteen i was very. <unk> it was my first exhibit of photographs and. they were all put up there and. after about. two days . they all came down except for three people were very upset very angry that i was showing these dirty sides of cairo and why didn 't i cut the dead donkey out of the frame and as i sat there i got very depressed i looked at this. big empty wall with. three lonely photographs that were you know very pretty photographs and. i was like i failed at this but i was looking at this. intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out. of people just seeing these photographs here i was this 18 year old pipsqueak that nobody listened to and all of a sudden i put these photographs on the wall and there were arguments and they had to be taken down and i saw the power. <unk> of the image and it was it was incredible and i think the most important reaction that i saw there was actually from people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves that would never have seen that the human <unk>. <unk> spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances <unk> and i think it was at that point that i decided i wanted to use photography and film. <unk> a couple of music films but in two thousand and three when the war in iraq was about to start. <unk> it was a very surreal feeling for me because before the war started there was kind of this media war that was going on and i was watching television in new york and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across and <unk>. the the coverage went from the us state department to embedded troops and what was coming across on the news was that. there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings and the iraqis would be. <unk> the americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of baghdad <unk> . and i knew that there was a completely other story that was that was taking place in the middle east where my parents were i knew that there was a completely other story being told and i was thinking how <unk>. <unk> are people supposed to communicate with each other when they 're getting completely different messages and nobody knows what the other 's being told how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding. <unk> or know how to move together into the future <unk> so i knew that i had to go there <unk> i just wanted to be in the center i had no plan i had no funding. <unk> i didn 't even have a camera at the time i had somebody bring it there. <unk> because i wanted to get access to al jazeera george bush 's favorite channel <unk> and. a place which i was very curious about because it 's. disliked by many. <unk> governments across the arab world and also. called the mouthpiece of osama bin laden by. some people in the us government so i was thinking <unk> this station that 's hated by so many people has to be doing something right i 've got to go. see what this is all about. <unk> and i also wanted to go see central command which was ten minutes away and that way i could get access to how this news was being created. on the arab side reaching the arab world and on the us and western side reaching the us and when i went there and sat there and met these people that were in the center of it . and sat with these characters. i met some surprising very complex people and i 'd like to share with. <unk> of that experience of of when you sit with somebody and you film them and you listen to them and you allow them more than a. <unk> to change the arab nightmare into the american dream . i still have that dream maybe i will never be able to do it but. <unk> have plans for my children . when they finish high school i will send them to america to study there <unk> i will pay for their study <unk> . and they will stay there josh rushing . the night they showed. the pows and the dead soldiers al jazeera showed them it was powerful because america doesn 't show those kinds of images. <unk> most of the news in america won 't show really gory images and this showed american soldiers in uniform strewn about a floor a cold tile floor <unk> and it was. revolting <unk> it was absolutely revolting it made me sick at my stomach <unk> and then what hit me was the night before <unk> . there had been some kind of bombing in basra <unk> . and al jazeera had shown. images of the people. and they were equally if not more horrifying the images were <unk> and i remember having seen it in the al jazeera office and thought to myself <unk>. that 's bad and then going away and probably eating dinner or something and it didn 't affect me as much so the impact that had on me me. <unk> al jazeera office must have felt the way i was feeling that night <unk> and it upset me. on a profound level that i wasn 't as bothered as much the night before. it makes me hate war <unk> . but it doesn 't make me believe that we 're in a world that can live without war yet jehane noujaim i was overwhelmed by the response of the film we didn 't know whether it would be able to get out there we had no funding for it we were incredibly lucky. <unk> that it got picked up <unk> and when we showed the film. in both the united states and the arab world we had such incredible reactions it was amazing to see how people were moved by this film in the arab world. <unk> and it 's not really by the film it 's by the characters i mean <unk> josh rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things and. <unk> i showed the film in the middle east people wanted to meet josh he kind of redefined us as an american population people started to. ask me where is this guy now al jazeera offered him a job . laughter and samir on the other hand was also quite an interesting character for the arab world to see because it brought out the complexities of this. <unk> that the arab world has with the west <unk> in the united states i was blown away <unk>. <unk> by the motivations the positive motivations of the american people when when they 'd see this film <unk> you know we 're criticized abroad for <unk>. believing we 're the saviors of the world in some way but the flip side of it is that actually when people do see what is happening abroad and people. <unk> reactions to some of our policy abroad we feel this this power that we need to we feel like we have to get the power to change things and i saw this with audiences this woman <unk> woman came up to me after the screening and said . you know i know this is crazy i saw the bombs being loaded on the planes i saw the military going out to war but you don 't understand people 's anger towards. <unk> us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war and how do we get out of this bubble how do we understand what the other person. is thinking now <unk> i don 't know whether a film can change the world but <unk>. i know the power of it i know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world <unk> now i 'm not a philosopher so i feel like i shouldn 't go. <unk> great depth on this but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world because i believe that film has the ability to take you across borders i 'd. like you to just sit back. and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world and these couple clips take you inside. of two of the most difficult conflicts that we 're faced with today. <unk> i showed. the. <unk> to get. that <unk>. <unk> the streets fighting screaming free nelson mandela it 's about. those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom. <unk> what i 'd like to talk about today is. <unk> robert wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person 's humanity then they will have an appreciation for ours <unk> and that 's what this is about . it 's about connecting people through film getting these independent voices out there <unk>. <unk> who are trying to use film for change and there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already . there 's witness <unk> that you heard from earlier <unk> there 's just vision that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace and documenting that process and <unk>. <unk> getting interviews out there and using this film to take to congress to show that it 's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who 's had her. <unk> daughter killed in an attack and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this there 's. working films and there 's current tv which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put. their yeah it 's amazing <unk> i 've watched it and i 'm blown away by it and its potential to bring bring voices from around the world independent voices from around the world and create a truly. <unk> democratic global television <unk> . so what can we do to create a platform for these organizations to create some momentum to get everybody in the world involved in this movement . i 'd like for us to imagine for a second imagine a day. when you have everyone coming together from around the world. you have towns and villages and. theaters. all from around the world <unk> getting together <unk> and sitting in the dark and sharing a communal experience. of watching a film <unk> or a couple of films together <unk> watching a film which maybe highlights a character that. <unk> fighting to live or just a character that defies stereotypes makes a joke sings a song comedies documentaries shorts . this amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together to cross borders and have people feel like they 're having a communal experience <unk> . so if you imagine this day when all. <unk> and places where we project films if you imagine projecting from times square to tahrir square square in cairo <unk> the same film in ramallah the same film in jerusalem. <unk> you know we 've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the great pyramid and the great wall of china. <unk> in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience <unk> . and i believe that this one day if we can create it this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices <unk> there <unk>. <unk> an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there and yet i 'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other. <unk> having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders and if film can do that and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together. this could be an incredible day <unk> so we 've already made a partnership <unk> set up through somebody from the. <unk> introduced me to steven apkon from the jacob burns film center <unk> and we started calling up everybody and in the last week there have been so many people that have responded to us from. as close as palo alto <unk> to mongolia and to india there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there. now we 've thought about a name for this day <unk> . and i 'd like to share this with you now the most amazing part of this whole process has been. sharing sharing ideas and wishes and so i invite you to give brainstorms onto <unk>. how does this day echo into the future how do we use technology to make this day echo into the future so that we. <unk> can build community and have these communities working together through the internet. <unk> there was a time many many years ago when all of the continents were stuck together <unk> . and we call that landmass pangea <unk> so what we 'd like to call this day of film is pangea cinema day <unk> . and if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching. then. i think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better <unk> i know that it 's very intangible touching people 's hearts and souls <unk> but the only <unk>. <unk> way that i know how to do it the only way that i know how to reach out to somebody 's. <unk> and that 's my wish i guess i 'm supposed to give you my my <unk>. <unk> wish but we 're way out of time chris anderson that is an incredible wish . pangea cinema the day the world comes together jn it 's more tangible than world peace and it 's certainly more immediate <unk> but. it would be the day that the world comes together through film.
