 <unk> three years ago <unk> i was standing about a hundred yards from chernobyl nuclear reactor number four . my geiger counter dosimeter which measures radiation was going berserk and the closer i got. <unk> i was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world 's worst nuclear accident as you can see by the look on my face reluctantly so <unk> . but with good reason because the nuclear fire that burned for eleven days back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six released four hundred times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on. <unk> and the sarcophagus which is the the covering over reactor number four which was hastily built twenty seven years ago <unk> now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation <unk> . so i was filming <unk> . i just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast but. then i looked into the distance and i saw some smoke. coming from a farmhouse <unk> and i 'm thinking who could be living here. <unk> after all chernobyl 's soil water and air are among the most highly contaminated on earth and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone <unk> or dead zone <unk> . and it 's a nuclear police state complete with border guards you have to have dosimeter at all times clicking away you have to have a government minder <unk> and there 's draconian radiation rules and. constant contamination. <unk> the point being no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone <unk> but they are . it turns out an unlikely community of some two hundred people are living inside the zone they 're called <unk> self settlers and almost all of them are women. the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol cigarettes <unk> if not radiation <unk> . <unk> hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident <unk> but not everybody accepted that fate <unk> the women in the zone now in their <unk>. are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and it would seem common sense and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone <unk> . they did so illegally as one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time . shoot me and dig the grave <unk> otherwise i 'm going home. <unk> why would they return to such deadly soil i mean were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them <unk> or both <unk> . the thing is they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently <unk> . now around chernobyl there are scattered ghost villages eerily silent strangely charming <unk> bucolic <unk> . <unk> many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident. but a few are left like this kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy <unk> . others have a few residents in them <unk> one or two babushkas or babas which are the russian and ukrainian words for grandmother <unk> another village might have six or <unk>. <unk> seven residents so this is the strange demographic of the zone isolated. <unk> and when i made my way to that piping chimney i 'd seen in the distance i saw hanna zavorotnya and i met her . she 's the self declared mayor of kapavati village population eight . and she said to me when i asked her the obvious radiation doesn 't scare me <unk> starvation does and. you have to remember these women. <unk> the worst atrocities of the 20th century <unk> stalin 's enforced famines of the 1930s the holodomor <unk> killed millions of ukrainians and they faced the nazis in the ' 40s who. came through slashing burning raping and in fact many of these women were shipped to germany as forced labor <unk> . so when a couple decades into soviet rule chernobyl happened they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible . so they returned to their villages. <unk> and are told they 're going to get sick and die soon <unk> . but five happy years their logic goes is better than ten stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of kiev separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies <unk> . the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon . for them <unk> environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation it turns out this holds true for. <unk> other species as well . wild boar <unk> lynx moose they 've all returned to the region in force the very real very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans . the dead zone <unk> it turns out is full of life <unk> . <unk> a kind of heroic resilience a kind of. plain spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at five a m pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes their only. company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka <unk> . and there 's a patina of simple defiance among them they told us our legs would hurt <unk> and they do so what. <unk> what about their health the benefits of of hardy physical living but an environment made toxic by a complicated little understood enemy radiation it. 's incredibly difficult to parse health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught the world health organization puts the number of. <unk> organizations put that number in the tens of thousands . now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high and that chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere . higher levels of anxiety depression alcoholism unemployment and importantly <unk> disrupted social networks <unk>. <unk> like many of you <unk> i have moved maybe twenty twenty five times in my life home is a transient concept. i have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil <unk> . so it 's hard for us to understand but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka <unk> and connection to the land is. <unk> and perhaps because these ukrainian women were schooled under the soviets and versed in the russian poets. <unk> aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time if you leave you die . those who left are worse off now they are dying of sadness motherland is motherland i will never leave . what sounds like faith soft. <unk> may actually be fact . because the surprising truth i mean there are no studies but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on earth for the <unk>. <unk> last twenty seven years have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation . how could this be here 's a theory could it be that those ties to ancestral soil. the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms actually affect longevity <unk> . the power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative . home and community are forces that rival even radiation <unk> . now radiation or not these women are at the end of their lives in the next decade. <unk> the zone 's human residents will be gone <unk> and it will revert to a wild <unk> radioactive place <unk> . full only of animals and occasionally. daring flummoxed scientists <unk> . but the spirit and existence of the babushkas whose numbers have been halved in the three years i 've known them . will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with about. the relative nature of risk about transformative connections to home and about the magnificent. tonic of personal agency and.
