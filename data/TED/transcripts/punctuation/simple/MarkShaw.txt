 <unk> i 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at you 're about to experience. a new <unk> available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives what i have here is a cinder block. <unk> that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material <unk> it 's called ultra ever dry <unk> and. when you apply it to any material it turns into a superhydrophobic shield <unk> . so this is a cinder block <unk> uncoated <unk> and you can see that it 's porous it absorbs water . <unk> so what 's superhydrophobic . superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface the rounder it is the more hydrophobic it is . and if it 's really round it 's superhydrophobic . a freshly waxed car the water molecules slump to about ninety degrees. <unk> a windshield coating is going to give you about one hundred and ten degrees <unk> but what you 're seeing here is one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy five degrees and anything over one hundred and fifty is superhydrophobic <unk> . so as part of the demonstration what i have is a pair of gloves <unk> and we 've coated one of the gloves. with the nanotechnology coating <unk> and let 's see if you can tell which one and i 'll give you a hint. <unk> you guess the one that was dry <unk> . when you have nanotechnology and and. nanoscience what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits and we. 're talking really small here the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers <unk> and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter <unk> and to put some scale to that. <unk> you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick <unk> and you put it side by side and you had fifty thousand of them you 'd be the width of a human hair <unk> . so very small <unk> but very useful . and it 's not just water that this works with it 's a lot of. you can see the difference <unk> . moving onto the next demonstration we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating . and we 're going to pour this <unk> green tinted water inside the middle <unk> and you 're going to see it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would except when it hits the coating. <unk> it stops <unk> and i can 't even coax it to leave <unk> . it 's that afraid of the water . so what 's going on here what 's happening well <unk> the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles <unk>. <unk> that form a very rough and craggly surface you 'd think it 'd be smooth but it 's actually not and it has. <unk> and those spaces. along with the nanoparticles <unk> reach up and grab the air molecules and cover the surface with air it 's an umbrella of air all across it <unk> . and that layer of air is what the water hits the mud hits the concrete hits <unk> and it glides right off <unk> . so if i put this inside this water here you can see a silver reflective. <unk> coating around it and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that 's protecting the water from touching the paddle <unk> and it 's dry. so what are the applications i. mean many of you right now are probably going through your head everyone that sees this gets excited and says oh i could use it for this and this and this . the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's <unk> anti wetting we 've certainly seen that today <unk> . it could be anything that 's. because if you don 't have water you don 't have ice <unk> it could be <unk>. no water <unk> no corrosion <unk> it could be <unk>. without water the bacteria won 't survive <unk> and it could be things that need to be. <unk> field of work <unk> and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration <unk> but before i do that i would like to say thank you and think small. <unk> about us cutting out the design from ted.
