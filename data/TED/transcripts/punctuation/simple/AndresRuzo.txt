 <unk> as a boy in lima my grandfather told me a legend of the spanish conquest of peru <unk>. atahualpa emperor of the inca had been captured and killed <unk> . pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich and tales of their conquest and glory had reached spain and. <unk> bringing new waves of spaniards hungry for gold. and glory . they would go into towns and ask the inca . where 's another civilization we can conquer where 's more gold and the inca <unk> out of vengeance told them . go to the amazon you. 'll find all the gold you want there in fact there is a city. <unk> dorado in spanish made entirely of gold the spanish set off into the jungle but the few that return. come back with stories stories. of powerful shamans . of warriors with poisoned arrows . of trees so tall they blotted out the sun <unk> spiders that ate birds <unk> snakes that swallowed. <unk> men whole and a river that boiled . all this became a childhood memory and years passed i 'm working on my phd at smu . trying to understand peru 's geothermal energy potential <unk> when i remember this legend <unk> . and i began asking that question . <unk> could the boiling river exist . i asked colleagues from universities <unk> the government <unk> oil gas and mining companies and the answer was a unanimous no <unk> . and. this makes sense . you see boiling rivers do exist in the world but they 're generally associated with volcanoes . you need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal. <unk> as you can see from the red dots here <unk> which are volcanoes <unk> . we don 't have volcanoes in the amazon <unk> nor in most of peru so it follows <unk> we should not expect to see a boiling river. <unk> telling this same story at a family dinner my aunt tells me but no <unk>. <unk> been there i 've swum in that river. <unk> then my uncle jumps in no andrs she 's not kidding you see you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain <unk> and. it 's protected by a powerful shaman your aunt she 's friends with his wife. <unk> aunt over seven hundred kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center <unk> and. well honestly <unk> mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary warm stream of the amazon . but then <unk> i heard something a low surge. that got louder and louder. as we came closer <unk> . it sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing <unk> and as we got closer i saw smoke vapor coming up through the trees and then <unk> . i saw this i immediately grabbed for my thermometer. <unk> the average temperatures in the river were. this is not quite the 100 degree c boiling but definitely. close enough the river flowed hot and fast <unk> i followed it upriver and was led. by actually the shaman 's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river and this is what 's bizarre it starts off as a cold stream and here at this site . is the home of the. <unk> yacumama mother of the waters a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water <unk> and here we find. a hot spring <unk> mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws. and thus bringing their legends to life <unk> the next morning i woke up and. <unk> i asked for tea . i was handed a mug a tea bag and well <unk> pointed towards the river <unk> to my surprise <unk> the water was clean. and had a pleasant taste which is a little weird for geothermal systems what. was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place <unk> and that i was by no means the first outsider to see. it was just part of their everyday life <unk> they drink its water they take in its vapor <unk> . they cook with it clean with it even make their medicines with it . i met the shaman and he seemed like an extension. of the river and his jungle <unk> he asked for my intentions. and listened carefully <unk> then to my tremendous relief i was freaking out to be honest with you. a smile began to snake across his face <unk> and he just laughed . laughter i had received the shaman 's blessing to study the river <unk> on the condition that after i take. <unk> the water samples and analyze them in my lab wherever i was in the world that i pour the waters back into the ground. so that as the shaman said the waters could find their way back home <unk> . i 've been back every year since that first visit in two thousand and eleven and the fieldwork has been exhilarating demanding and. <unk> times. dangerous <unk> one story was even featured in national geographic magazine i was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper. in sandals and board shorts in between an eighty degree c river and a hot spring that well <unk> looked like this close to boiling and on top of. <unk> couldn 't see a thing the temperature differential made it all white it was a whiteout <unk> intense <unk> . now after years of work i 'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical. studies for publication <unk> . and i 'd like to share today with all of you here on the ted stage for the first time some of these discoveries. first off <unk> it 's not a legend <unk> surprise . when i first started the research . the satellite imagery was too low resolution to be meaningful there were just no good maps <unk> thanks to the support of the google earth team <unk> i now have this. <unk> with the heat of the sun . indicating that i 'm not the first to wonder why the river boils <unk> . and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us. <unk> so. why does the. <unk> it actually took me three years to get that footage <unk> fault fed hot springs . as we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries so too the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults . where these arteries come to the surface these earth arteries we 'll get geothermal manifestations. <unk> springs and in our case the boiling river <unk> . what 's truly incredible though is the scale of this place <unk> next time you cross the road think about this . the river flows wider than a two lane road along most of its path <unk> it flows hot. for six point. <unk> there are thermal pools larger than this ted stage and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall and all with <unk>. water <unk> we mapped the temperatures along the river and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork <unk> and the results. were just awesome. <unk> geoscientist in me coming out and it showed this amazing trend you see the river starts off cold it. then heats up cools back down heats up cools back down heats up again <unk> and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river <unk> . now i understand not all of you are geothermal scientists so to put it in. more everyday. <unk> put in coffee shop terms the boiling river plots like this there you have your hot coffee . here you have your extra hot coffee and you can see that there 's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even. <unk> and these are average water temperatures we took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures <unk> . but there 's a magic number here that 's not being shown and that number is <unk>. <unk> c <unk> . because that 's where things start to hurt <unk> and i know this from very personal experience. <unk> above that temperature you don 't want to get in that water you need to be careful . it can be deadly <unk> . i 've seen all sorts of. <unk> animals fall in and what 's shocking to me is the process is. pretty much the same <unk> . so they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes <unk> eyes apparently cook very quickly they turn this milky white color the stream is carrying them they 're trying to swim out but their meat is cooking on the bone because it 's so hot so they 're losing power losing power until finally. finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out . a bit sadistic aren 't we jeez . leave them marinating for a little longer . what 's again <unk> amazing are these temperatures <unk> they 're similar to things that i 've seen on volcanoes all over the. <unk> but here 's the thing . the data. is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism <unk> . it 's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin <unk> . and again over seven hundred kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center <unk> how can a boiling river. <unk> exist like this <unk> i 've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years <unk> and i 'm still unable to find another. <unk> geothermal system of this magnitude <unk> it 's. unique <unk> it 's special on a global scale so still how does it work. <unk> where do we get this heat there 's still more research to be done. to better constrain the problem and better understand the system <unk> but from what the data is telling us now <unk> it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system . basically it works like this so the deeper you go into the earth the hotter it gets <unk> we refer to this as the geothermal gradient <unk> . the waters could be. <unk> coming from as far away as glaciers in the andes then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out. to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient . all due to this unique geologic setting now <unk> we found that in and around the river this is working with colleagues from. <unk> lifeforms living in and around the river and have found new lifeforms unique species living in the boiling river <unk> . but again <unk> despite all of these studies all of these discoveries and the legends . a question remains . what is the significance of the boiling river. what is the significance of this stationary cloud. that always hovers over this patch of jungle <unk> and what is the significance. of a detail in a childhood legend . to the shaman and his community. <unk> it 's a sacred site to me as a geoscientist <unk> it 's a unique geothermal phenomenon <unk> . but to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers <unk> it 's just another resource to exploit . and to the peruvian government <unk> it 's just another stretch. of. unprotected. land ready for development my goal is. <unk> to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river 's uniqueness and significance <unk> . because that 's the question <unk> . one of significance <unk> and the thing there is . we define significance <unk> it 's us we have that power <unk> we are the ones who draw that line. between the sacred and the trivial . and in this age where everything seems mapped measured and studied . in this age of information <unk> i remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black. void. of the unknown. but in the white noise. <unk> noise of overwhelming data . there remains so much to explore <unk> . we live in an incredible world <unk> so go out . be curious <unk> because we do live. in a world. where shamans still sing to the spirits. <unk> of the jungle <unk> where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life <unk> thank you very much.
