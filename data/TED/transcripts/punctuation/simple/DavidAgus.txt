 <unk> i 'm a cancer doctor and i walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital. three or four years ago <unk> and this was the cover of fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy <unk> . and so as a cancer doctor you look at this and you get a little bit downhearted. but when you start to read the article by. <unk> cliff who himself is a cancer survivor who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from new york city to upstate new york to get an. experimental therapy for at the time hodgkin 's disease which saved his life he makes remarkable points here <unk> . and the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology in our view of cancer. <unk> the last fifty years we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer not in controlling cancer <unk> . so this is an astounding table <unk> and this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that obviously we 've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease <unk>. <unk> but look at cancer <unk> the death rate in cancer in over fifty years hasn 't changed <unk> . <unk> wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia where we have a pill that can put one hundred percent of people in remission <unk> . but in general we haven 't made an impact at all in the war on cancer <unk> . so what i 'm going to tell you today is a little bit of why i think that 's the case <unk> and then go out of my comfort zone. and tell you where i think it 's going where a new approach. that we hope to. to push forward in terms of treating cancer <unk> because this is wrong . so what is cancer first of all well <unk> if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value you go to a doctor <unk> they stick a needle in they way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern. <unk> does it look normal <unk> . does it look abnormal so that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle <unk> this is a normal cell. <unk> this is a cancer cell that is the state of the art today in diagnosing cancer <unk> . there 's no molecular test <unk> there 's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday <unk> there 's no fancy looking at the chromosomes this. <unk> and how we do it. <unk> you know <unk> i know very well <unk> . as a cancer doctor <unk> i can 't treat advanced cancer <unk> . so <unk> as an aside <unk> i firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early <unk> . it is the only way you can start to fight cancer is by catching it early <unk> . we can prevent most cancers you know the previous talk alluded to. preventing heart disease we could do the same in cancer. <unk> company called navigenics where if you spit into a tube and we can look look at thirty five or forty genetic. markers for disease <unk> all of which are delayable in many of the cancers you start to identify. what you could get and then we can start to work to prevent them <unk> . because the problem is when you have advanced cancer we can 't do that much today about it as the statistics allude to. <unk> so the thing about cancer is is that it 's a disease of the aged <unk> . why is it a disease of the aged <unk> because evolution doesn 't care about us after we 've had our children see. evolution protected us. during our childbearing years and then after age thirty five or forty or forty five it said it doesn 't matter. <unk> because they 've had their progeny so if you look at cancers it is very rare extremely rare to have cancer in a child . on the order of thousands of cases a year as one gets older very very common <unk> . why is it hard to treat because it 's heterogeneous <unk> and that 's the perfect. substrate for evolution within the cancer. <unk> it starts to select out for those bad aggressive cells what we call clonal selection <unk> . but if we start to understand that cancer isn 't just a molecular defect it 's something more then we 'll get <unk>. to new ways of treating it <unk> as i 'll show you so one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that right now we describe it by a number of adjectives. <unk> you then have some anatomic descriptions you get that ct scan there 's a three centimeter mass in the liver . you then have some body part descriptions it 's in the liver in the breast in the prostate and that 's about it so our dictionary for describing <unk>. <unk> cancer is very very poor <unk> it 's basically symptoms it 's manifestations of a disease <unk> . <unk> has spent four hundred million dollars <unk> and they 've. allocated another billion dollars to what we call the cancer genome atlas project . so it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer and giving us a new lexicon . a new dictionary to describe it <unk> you know in the <unk> mid 1850 's in france <unk> they started to describe cancer by body part . that hasn 't changed in over one hundred and fifty. <unk> years <unk> . it is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate by breast . by muscle it makes no sense <unk> if you think about it <unk> . so <unk> obviously <unk> the technology is here today and over the next several years that will change you will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic <unk> . <unk> and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer <unk> so hopefully we will go from being the art of medicine. more to the science of medicine and be able to do what they do in infectious disease <unk> which is look at that organism <unk> that bacteria <unk> and then say this antibiotic makes sense because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it . when one is. <unk> exposed to. you take tamiflu and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease why <unk> . because we know what you have and we know how to treat it. although we can 't make vaccine in this country but that 's a different story <unk> the cancer genome atlas. <unk> is coming out now the first cancer was was done which was brain cancer . in the next month the end of december <unk> you 'll see ovarian cancer and then lung cancer will come several months after . there 's also a field of proteomics that i 'll talk about in a few minutes which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease <unk> . but remember i 'm not pushing. <unk> to be a reductionist . i 'm doing it so we can identify what we 're up against <unk> and there 's a very important distinction there that we 'll get to . in health care today <unk> we spend most of the dollars in terms of treating disease. most of the dollars in the last two years of a person 's life <unk> we spend very little if any dollars in terms of identifying what we 're up against <unk> . if you could start to move that to identify what you 're up against. <unk> to do things a hell of a lot better <unk> . if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease <unk> we can take it enormously the other direction and obviously that 's where we need to go going forward . so this is the website of the national cancer institute <unk> . and i 'm here to tell you it 's wrong <unk> . so the website of the national cancer institute says that cancer is a genetic disease. <unk> the website says if you look there 's an individual mutation and maybe a second and maybe a third <unk> and that is cancer . but as a cancer doc <unk> this is what i see this isn 't a genetic disease <unk> . so <unk> there you see <unk> it 's a liver with colon cancer in it and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded you see a ct scan. where cancer is in the liver. <unk> cancer is an interaction of a cell. that no longer is under growth control with the environment <unk> . it 's not in the abstract <unk> it 's the interaction with the environment <unk> it 's what we call a system <unk> . the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer and i think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades . is that we have strived to understand cancer. the goal is to control cancer and. that is a very different optimization scheme a very different strategy for all of us . i got up at the american association of cancer research one of the big cancer research meetings with twenty thousand people there . and i said we 've made a mistake. <unk> we 've all made a mistake myself included by focusing down by being a reductionist we need to take a step back and believe it or not there were hisses in the audience. people got upset but this is the only way we 're going to go forward you know i was very fortunate to meet. danny hillis a few years ago <unk> we were pushed together <unk> and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other . i said do i really want to meet a guy from disney who designed computers and he was saying does he really want to meet another doctor <unk> . but people prevailed on us and we got together and it 's been transformative in what i do. <unk> absolutely transformative . we have designed and we have worked on the modeling and much of these ideas came from danny and from his team the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system . and i 'll show you some data there where i really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it <unk> . the key is. <unk> when you look at these variables and you look at this data you have to understand the data inputs you know if i measured your temperature. over thirty days <unk> and i asked what was the average temperature and it came back at ninety eight point seven <unk> i would say great . but if during one of those days your temperature spiked to one hundred and two for six hours and you took tylenol and got better etc i would totally miss it <unk> . so one of the problems the fundamental problems in medicine is that you. <unk> and i and all of us we go to our doctor once a year <unk> we have discrete data elements we don 't have a time function on them <unk>. earlier it was referred to this direct life device <unk> . you know <unk> i 've been using it for two and a half months it 's a staggering device not because it tells me how many kilocalories i do every day <unk> but because it looks over. <unk> what i 've done in a day <unk> and i didn 't realize that for three hours i 'm sitting at my desk and i 'm not moving at all . and a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here. are really. different than we understand them because we 're not measuring them dynamically <unk> and so <unk> if you think of cancer. as a system <unk> there 's an input and an output and a state. <unk> are equivalent classes of history <unk> and the cancer patient the input is the environment <unk> the diet <unk> the treatment <unk> the genetic mutations . the output are our symptoms . do we have pain is the cancer growing do we feel bloated <unk> etc most of that state. is hidden so what we do in our field is we change and input we give. <unk> did that output get better did that pain improve <unk> etc . and so <unk> the problem is that it 's not just one system <unk> it 's multiple systems on multiple scales <unk> it 's a system of systems <unk> . and so when you start to look at emergent systems you can look at a neuron under a microscope a neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here <unk> . but when you start to put them together in a complex. <unk> system and you start to see that it becomes a brain <unk> and that brain can create intelligence . what we 're talking about in the body and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system <unk> . well <unk> the bad news is that these robust and robust is a key word emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail <unk> . the good news is you can manipulate them . you can try to control them without. that fundamental understanding of every component . one of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in february in the new england journal of medicine <unk> . where they took women who were <unk> pre menopausal with breast cancer so about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get . they had gotten their chemotherapy <unk> and then they randomized them where half got placebo and half got a drug called zoledronic acid that. <unk> builds bone <unk> it 's used to treat osteoporosis and they got that twice a year <unk> . they looked and in these one thousand eight hundred women given twice a year a drug that builds bone you reduce the recurrence of cancer by <unk>. <unk> of cancer by a drug that doesn 't even touch the cancer <unk> so the notion you change the soil. the seed doesn 't grow as well <unk> you change that system <unk> . and you could have a marked effect on the cancer <unk> . nobody has ever shown and this will be shocking nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell <unk> . it 's never been shown there 's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes that if you give this cancer drug you can do this effect to the cell <unk> but the doses. in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body <unk> . if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called taxol every three weeks which is the standard . about forty percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug . and a response is fifty percent shrinkage well remember that 's not even an order of magnitude but that 's a different. <unk> i give them that same drug every week . another thirty percent will respond <unk> they then recur <unk> i give them that same drug over ninety six hours by continuous infusion . another twenty or thirty percent will respond . so you can 't tell me it 's working by the same mechanism in all three size <unk> it 's not we have no idea the mechanism . so the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system. <unk> like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence chemotherapy may work by that same exact way the wild thing about that trial. also was that it reduced new primaries so new cancers by thirty percent also <unk> . so <unk> the problem is yours and mine all of our systems are changing. <unk> they 're dynamic <unk> i mean this is a scary slide not to take an aside <unk> but it looks at obesity in the world and i 'm sorry if you can 't read the numbers they 're kind of small <unk> but if you <unk>. <unk> start to look at it that red that dark color there more than seventy five percent of the population of those countries are obese . look a decade. <unk> look two decades ago <unk> markedly different . so our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago <unk> so the diseases we have today <unk> . which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades are going to change. dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this . <unk> of the whole proteome so this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet <unk> and. we 're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body we can start to see that system <unk> . each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified the power of these magnets the power of what we can do here is that we. <unk> see an individual neutron. with this technology so . again this is stuff we 're doing with danny hillis and a group called applied proteomics <unk> where we can start to see individual neutron differences <unk> and we can start to look at <unk>. <unk> that system like we never have before so instead of a reductionist view we 're taking a step back . <unk> who had recurrent. lung cancer <unk> it was in her brain in her lungs in her liver <unk> she had gotten carboplatin taxol carboplatin taxotere. every drug we have she had gotten and that disease continued to grow she had three kids under the age of twelve . and this is her ct scan and so what this is. <unk> taking a cross section of her body here <unk> and you can see in the. middle there is her heart and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her untreated in a matter of weeks . she goes on a pill a day. that targets a pathway . <unk> and again i 'm not sure if this pathway was in the system in the cancer but it targeted a pathway <unk> and a month later pow that cancer 's gone . six months later it 's still gone <unk> . that cancer recurred and she passed away three years later from lung cancer <unk> but she got three years. from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne that. <unk> is that the clinical trial was done <unk> and we were a part of it . and in the fundamental clinical trial the pivotal clinical trial we call the phase three we refused to use a placebo <unk> . would you want your mother your brother your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live . and the answer obviously is not so it was done on this group of patients ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here . the drug went to the fda and the fda said without a placebo <unk> how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug . so the morning the fda was going to meet this was the. editorial in the wall street journal and so what do you know that drug was approved. <unk> the amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial where they gave half placebo and half the drug and we learned something important there what 's interesting is they did it in south america and canada where it 's more ethical to give placebos . they had to give it also in the u s to get approval so i think there were three u s patients in upstate new york who were part of the trial but they did that and what they found is that seventy percent. <unk> lived much longer and did better. than people who got placebo . so it challenged everything we knew in cancer is that you don 't need to get a response you don 't need to shrink the disease <unk> if we slow the disease <unk> . we may have more of a benefit on patient survival patient outcome how they feel than if we shrink the disease <unk> the problem is that if. i 'm this doc and i get your ct scan today and you 've got a two centimeter mass in your liver and you come back to me in three months and it 's three centimeters <unk> . did that drug help you or not . how do i know <unk> would it have been ten centimeters <unk> or am i giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost <unk> . so <unk> it 's a fundamental problem and again <unk> that 's where these new technologies. can come in <unk> and so the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor 's office. <unk> well <unk> the ultimate goal is is that you prevent disease <unk> . right the ultimate goal is is that you prevent any of these things from happening that is the most effective. cost effective best way we can do things today <unk> . but if one is unfortunate to get a disease you 'll go into your doctor 's office he or she will take a drop of blood and we will start to know how to treat your disease <unk> . the way. we 've approached. <unk> it is the field of proteomics again this looking at the system <unk> it 's taking a big picture <unk> the problem with technologies like this. is that if one looks at proteins in the body <unk> there are eleven orders of magnitude difference between the <unk> high abundant and the low abundant proteins <unk> . so there 's no technology in the world that can span eleven orders of. <unk> and so a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles try to bring the software we can start to look at different components along this spectrum <unk> . and so <unk> earlier was talked about cross discipline . about collaboration <unk> and i think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in yesterday the national cancer institute announced a new program. <unk> sciences and oncology where physicists <unk> mathematicians are brought in to think about cancer people who never approached it before . danny and i got sixteen million dollars they announced yesterday to try to attach this problem . a whole new approach <unk> instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by. <unk> to try to bring technology to get a picture of what 's actually happening. in the body <unk> . so <unk> just for two seconds how these technologies work because i think it 's important to understand it. <unk> what happens is every protein in your body is charged <unk> so the proteins are sprayed in the magnet spins them around <unk> and then there 's a detector at the end when it hit that detector is dependent on the mass. <unk> and so we can accurately if the magnet is big enough and your resolution is high enough you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding. of the individual system <unk> and so as a cancer doctor <unk> instead of having paper. in my chart in your chart and it being this thick <unk> this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices <unk> . where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data electronic data elements are. <unk> describing every aspect of the disease and certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter. and actually move forward <unk> . instead of just having encounter and encounter <unk> without fundamental learning so to conclude <unk> . we need to get away from reductionist thinking <unk> we need to start to think differently. and radically and so i implore everyone here. <unk> here think differently come up with new ideas tell them to me or anyone else in our field . because over the last fifty nine years <unk> nothing has changed <unk> we need a radically different approach <unk> you know andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel. and andy was one of my mentors. <unk> tough individual when andy stepped down he said no technology will win technology itself will win and i 'm a firm believer in the field of medicine. <unk> and especially cancer that it 's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the.
