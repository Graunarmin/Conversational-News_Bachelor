 <unk> really want to understand the problem that we 're facing. with the oceans you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics we can 't solve the problems unless we start. studying the ocean in a very much more interdisciplinary way. <unk> so i 'm going to demonstrate that through discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean we. 'll look at sea level rise we 'll look at ocean warming and then the last thing on the list there ocean acidification. if you were to ask me you know what do you worry about the most what frightens you for me <unk> it 's ocean acidification and this has come onto the. <unk> so i will spend a little time at the end . i was in copenhagen in december like a number of you in this room <unk> and i think we all found it simultaneously an eye opening and. a very frustrating experience . i sat in this large negotiation hall at one point for three or four hours without hearing the word oceans one time . it really wasn 't on the radar screen the nations that brought it up when we had the speeches. <unk> of the national leaders it tended to be the leaders of the small island states the low lying island states <unk> . and by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations <unk>. <unk> states like kiribati and nauru they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows you know they were marginalized. <unk> in the negotiation room one of the problems is coming up with the right target . it 's not clear what the target should be and how can you figure out how to fix something if you don 't have a clear target . now you 've heard about two degrees that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees <unk> but there 's not a lot of science behind that number . we 've also talked about. concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should it be four. <unk> should it be four hundred . there 's not a lot of science behind that one either most of the science that is behind these numbers these potential targets is based on studies on land <unk> . and i would say <unk> for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the targets should be we would argue that they must be much lower you. know from an oceanic perspective four hundred and fifty is way too high <unk> now there 's compelling evidence that it really needs to be three. <unk> we are right now at three hundred and ninety parts per million of co2 in the atmosphere <unk> . we 're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at four hundred and fifty so we 've got to accept we 're going to do an overshoot and the discussion as we go forward has to focus on. how far the overshoot goes and what 's the pathway back to three hundred and fifty . now why is this so complicated why don 't we know some of these things a little bit better well the problem is that we 've got. very complicated forces in the climate system there 's all kinds of natural causes. <unk> of climate change there 's air sea interactions here in galapagos <unk> we 're affected by el ninos and la nina <unk> but the entire planet warms up when there 's a big el nino. volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere that changes our climate . the ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet so anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet. and we know the solar output 's not constant through time so those are all natural causes of climate change <unk> and then we have the human induced causes of climate change as well <unk> we 're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land the reflectivity . we inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere and we have trace gases and not just carbon dioxide it 's methane <unk>. <unk> oxides of sulfur and nitrogen so here 's the thing it sounds like a simple question is <unk>. produced by man 's activities causing the planet to warm up but to answer that question to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide <unk> . you have to know something about all of these other. agents of change <unk> but the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things you know thousands of scientists have been working on. <unk> understanding all of these man made causes and the natural causes and we 've got it worked out and we can say yes. co2 is causing the planet to warm up now . now we have many ways to study natural variability i 'll show you a few examples of this now this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antarctic . it 's a scientific drilling vessel we go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed to recover sediments that tell us stories of climate change. like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time. to the last period where we had co2 double what it is today <unk> and so that 's what we 've done with this ship this was. this is south of the antarctic circle it looks downright tropical there one day. where we had calm seas and sun which was the reason i could get off the ship most of the time it looked like this we had. <unk> waves up to fifty ft and winds averaging about forty knots for most of the voyage and up to seventy or eighty knots . so that trip just ended. <unk> and i can 't show you too many results from that right now but we 'll go back one more year to another drilling expedition i 've been involved in this was led by. ross powell and tim naish it 's the andrill project and we made the very first bore hole through the largest. <unk> floating ice shelf on the planet this is a crazy thing this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm drilling at temperatures of minus forty <unk> . and we drilled in the ross sea <unk> that 's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there . so this huge floating ice shelf the size of alaska comes from west antarctica . now west antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor. <unk> much as two thousand meters deep so that ice sheet is partly floating <unk> and it 's exposed to the ocean to the ocean heat . this is the part of antarctica that we worry about because it 's partly floating you can imagine is sea level rises a little bit the ice lifts off the bed and then it can break off and float north when that ice melts sea level rises by six. <unk> so we drill back in time to see how often that 's happened <unk> and exactly how fast that ice can melt <unk> . here 's the cartoon on the left there . we drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf then through nine hundred meters of water and then one thousand three hundred meters into the sea floor so it 's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled it took about ten years to put this project together <unk> . and here 's what we. <unk> there 's forty scientists working on this project and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses <unk> . but it turns out you know the thing that told the best story was this simple visual description you know we saw this in the core samples as they came up . we saw these alternations between sediments that look like this. there 's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand <unk> that 's the kind of material in the deep sea it can only get there if it 's carried out by ice <unk> so we know there 's an ice shelf. <unk> overhead <unk> . and that alternates with a sediment that looks like this this is absolutely beautiful stuff this sediment is one hundred percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants . and these plants need sunlight so we know when we find that sediment there 's no ice overhead <unk> and we saw about thirty five alternations between open water. <unk> between gravels and these plant sediments so what that means is what it tells us. is that the ross sea region this ice shelf melted back and formed anew about thirty five times and this is in the past four million years. <unk> this was completely unexpected nobody imagined that the west antarctic ice sheet was this dynamic. <unk> the lore for many years has been the ice formed many tens of millions of years ago and it 's been there ever since and now we know that in our recent past it melted back <unk>. <unk> and formed again and sea level went up and down six meters at a time what caused it well we 're pretty sure that it 's very small changes in the amount of sunlight reaching antarctica just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the earth but here 's the key thing. <unk> the other thing we found out is that the ice sheet passed a threshold that the planet warmed up enough and the number 's about one degree to one and a half degrees centigrade the planet warmed up enough that it became . that ice sheet became very dynamic and was very easily melted and you know what we 've actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount. so many of us are convinced now that west. <unk> the west antarctic ice sheet is starting to melt we do expect to see a sea level rise on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century and it could be larger than that . this is a serious consequence for nations like kiribati you know where the average elevation is about. a little over a meter above sea level okay the second story takes place here in galapagos <unk> this is a bleached coral coral that died during the. <unk> about a meter tall pavona clavus colony <unk> . and it 's covered with algae that 's what happens when these things die <unk> immediately organisms come in and encrust and live on that that dead surface <unk> . and so <unk> when a coral colony is killed by an el nino event it leaves this indelible record you can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this . so one of the things thought of in the. 80s was to go back and take cores of coral heads throughout the galapagos and find out how often was there a devastating event and just so you know <unk>. that el nino killed ninety five percent of all the corals here in galapagos then there was similar mortality <unk>. and what we found after drilling back in time two to four hundred years was that these were unique events we saw no. other mass mortality events so these events in our recent past really are unique . so they 're either just truly monster el ninos or they 're just very strong el ninos that occurred. against a backdrop of global warming either case it 's bad news for the corals of the galapagos islands . here 's how we sample. <unk> this is actually easter island look at this monster this coral is eight meters tall right <unk> . and it been growing for about six hundred years . now sylvia earle turned me on to this exact same coral and she was diving here with john lauret i think it was one thousand nine hundred and ninety four and collected a little nugget and sent it to me <unk> . and we started working on it and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean from analyzing a coral like this . so we have a diamond drill. <unk> not killing the colony we 're taking a small core sample out of the top the core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone <unk> . and that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it you can see some of. the coral cores there on the right so we 've done that all over the eastern pacific we 're starting to do it in the western pacific as well i. 'll take you back here to the galapagos islands and we 've been working at this fascinating uplift here in urbina bay <unk> that. <unk> this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly <unk> and it was lifted up about six to seven meters <unk> . and so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet if you go on the ground there <unk> it looks like this and this is the grandaddy coral it 's eleven meters in diameter <unk> . and we know that it started growing in the year <unk>. imagine that and that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters until. <unk> and fifty four when the earthquake happened now the reason we know it 's one thousand five hundred and eighty four is that these corals have growth bands when you. cut them slice those cores in half and x ray them you see these light and dark bands each one of those is a year we know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year <unk> and we just count on down to the bottom . then their other attribute is. <unk> that they have this great chemistry we can analyze the carbonate that makes up the coral <unk> and there 's a whole bunch of things we can do but in this case we measured the different isotopes of oxygen their ratio tells us the water temperature . in this example here we had monitored this reef in galapagos with temperature recorders <unk> . so we know the temperature of the water the coral 's growing in then after we harvest a coral we measure this ratio and. now you can see those curves match perfectly in this case at these. corals are. <unk> recorders of change in the water . and of course our thermometers only take us back fifty years or so here the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years <unk> . so what we do <unk> we 've merged a lot of different data sets it 's not just my group there 's maybe thirty groups. <unk> records of temperature change that go back hundreds of years <unk> and we put them together . here 's a synthetic diagram there 's a whole family of curves here <unk> but what 's happening we 're looking at the last thousand years of temperature on the planet <unk> and there 's five or six different compilations there but each one of those compilations reflects. input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals we do similar things with ice cores we work with tree rings. and that 's how we discover what is truly natural and how different is the last century right and i chose this one. because it 's complicated and messy looking right <unk> this is as messy as it gets you can see there 's some. signals there some of the records show lower temperatures than others some of them show greater variability but they all. <unk> all. tell us. what the natural variability is some of them are from the northern hemisphere some are from the entire globe <unk> . but here 's what we can say <unk> what 's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down . it was cooling down until about one thousand nine hundred or so <unk> . and there is natural variability caused by the sun caused by el. <unk> and we know the magnitude it 's about two tenths to four tenths of a degree centigrade . but then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black and <unk> there 's the temperature up there in two thousand and nine you know we 've warmed the globe. about a degree centigrade in the last century <unk> and there 's nothing. in the natural part of that record that resembles what we 've seen in the last century you know that 's the strength of our argument that we are doing something that. <unk> 's truly different <unk> so. i 'll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification . i like it as a component of global change to talk about because even if you are a hard bitten global warming skeptic and i talk to that community fairly often . you cannot deny the simple. <unk> pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere from fossil fuels from cement production right now about a third of that carbon dioxide is dissolving straight into the sea right. and as it does so it makes the ocean more acidic . so you cannot argue with that that is what 's happening right now <unk> and it 's a very different issue than the global warming issue . it has many consequences. <unk> for carbonate organisms . there are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate plants and animals both the main framework material of coral reefs is is calcium carbonate . that material is more soluble in. acidic fluid <unk> so one of the things we 're seeing is organisms are having to spend more metabolic energy to build and maintain. <unk> their shells at some point as this transience as this co2 uptake in the ocean continues . that material 's actually going to start to dissolve and on coral reefs where some of the main framework organisms disappear <unk> . we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity <unk> . but it 's not just the carbonate producers that are affected. <unk> there 's many physiological processes that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean so many reactions involving enzymes and proteins are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean so . all of these things. greater metabolic demands <unk> . reduced reproductive success changes in respiration and metabolism you know these are things that we have good physiological reasons to. <unk> to see stressed caused by this transience so. we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co2 levels in the atmosphere going back millions of years we used to do it just with ice cores but in this case we 're going back <unk>. twenty million years <unk> and we take samples of the sediment and it tells us the co2 level. fifteen million years to find. a time when co2 levels were about what they are today <unk> you have to go back about thirty million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today now. what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean . with co2 levels lower than they are today <unk> that 's the reason that they 're not able to respond or adapt to this. rapid acidification that 's going on right now. so charlie veron came up with this. statement last year the prospect of ocean acidification may well be the most serious of all of the predicted outcomes of anthropogenic co2 release . and i think that may very well be true <unk> so i 'll close with this you know . we do need the protected areas absolutely but for the sake of the oceans we have to cap or limit co2 emissions as soon as possible <unk> . thank you very much.
