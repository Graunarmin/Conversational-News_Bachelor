 <unk> want to start by doing an experiment i 'm. going to play three videos of a rainy day <unk> . but i 've replaced the audio of one of the videos and instead of the sound of rain i 've added the sound of bacon frying. <unk> so i want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is. <unk> my point here isn 't really to make you hungry every time you see a rainy scene but it 's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies. we 're not looking for accuracy <unk> so. on the subject of deception i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors in <unk>. <unk> the decay of lying . oscar wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic. <unk> comes from lying and deceiving <unk> and telling beautiful untrue things <unk> so. when you 're watching a movie. and a phone rings it 's not actually ringing <unk> . it 's been added later in postproduction in a studio all of the sounds you hear are fake <unk> everything apart from the dialogue is. <unk> fake when you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings . they haven 't really recorded the bird it sounds a lot more realistic if you record a sheet. or shaking kitchen gloves . the burning of a cigarette up close. it actually sounds a lot more authentic. if you take a small saran wrap ball and release it. <unk> no one was really harmed it 's actually breaking celery or frozen lettuce. as easy as a trip to the supermarket and going to the vegetable section but it 's often a lot more complicated than that so let 's <unk>. <unk> together the creation of a sound effect one of my favorite stories comes from frank <unk>. he 's a contributor to our library and a great sound designer. <unk> of the paramount team that won the oscar for best sound for the hunt for red october in this cold war classic . in the ' 90s they were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine so they had a small problem they couldn 't really find a submarine in west hollywood . so basically. <unk> what they did is . they went to a friend 's swimming pool <unk> and frank performed a cannonball or bomba . they placed an underwater mic and an overhead mic outside the swimming pool so here 's what the underwater mic sounds like. <unk> pitched it one octave down sort of like slowing down a record . and then they removed a lot of the high frequencies . and pitched it down another octave . and then they added a little bit of. <unk> and by looping and repeating that sound they got this . churns so creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion that we 're inside. <unk> you 've created your sounds and you 've synced them to the image you want those sounds to live in the world of the story <unk> . and one the best ways to do that is to add reverb <unk> . so this is the first audio tool i want to talk about reverberation or reverb is the. persistence of the. sound after the original sound has ended so it 's sort of like. the all the reflections from the materials the objects and the walls around the sound take for example the sound of a gunshot <unk> the original <unk>. <unk> sound is less than half a second long . by adding reverb <unk> we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom gunshot reverbs in bathroom. <unk> gives us a lot of information about the space between the listener and the original sound source if the sound is the taste then. reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound but reverb can do a lot more listening. <unk> to a sound with a lot less reverberation than the on screen action is going to immediately signify to us that we 're listening to a commentator <unk>. to an objective narrator that 's not participating in the on screen action <unk> . <unk> in cinema are often heard with zero reverb because that 's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear . on the completely other side <unk> adding a lot of reverb to a voice is going to make us think that we 're listening to a flashback . or perhaps that we 're inside the head of a character. or that we 're listening to the voice of god or even more powerful. <unk> what are some other tools or hacks that sound designers use <unk> . well <unk> here 's a really big one . it 's silence a few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention . and in. the western. <unk> world we 're not really used to verbal silences they 're considered awkward or rude <unk> . so silence preceding verbal communication. can create a lot of tension <unk> but imagine a really big hollywood movie <unk> where it 's full of explosions and automatic. automatic guns loud stops being loud anymore. <unk> after a while so in a yin yang way silence needs loudness and loudness needs silence for either of them to have any effect <unk> . but what does silence mean well <unk> it depends how it 's used in each film . silence can place us inside the head of a character or provoke thought <unk> we often. <unk> being deep in thought <unk> . but. apart from having one meaning <unk> silence becomes a blank canvas upon which. the viewer is invited to the paint their own thoughts <unk> but i want to make it clear <unk> there is no such thing as. <unk> and i know this sounds like the most pretentious ted talk statement ever <unk> but. even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation and zero external sounds you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood <unk> . and in cinema traditionally <unk> there was never a silent moment because of the sound of the projector . and even in today 's dolby world . there 's not really any moment of silence. <unk> you listen around you . there 's always some sort of noise . now since there 's no such thing as silence what do filmmakers and sound designers use <unk> well <unk> . as a synonym they often use. are the unique background sounds that are specific to each location each location has a unique sound. and each room has a unique sound which is called room tone so here 's a recording of a market in morocco voices . music and here 's a recording of times square in new york. <unk> inside the room the ventilation <unk> the heating the fridge here 's a recording of my apartment in brooklyn. so <unk> birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality . perhaps because as a species <unk> we 've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years birds. on the other hand industrial sounds. have been introduced to us a little more recently . even though i really like them personally they 've been used by one of my heroes david lynch <unk> and his sound designer alan <unk> splet industrial sounds often carry negative connotations . now sound effects can tap into our emotional memory. occasionally they can be so significant that they become a character in a movie . the sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger . church bells can remind us of the passing of time or perhaps our own mortality. ring and breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship. or a friendship. played very loud may remind us. of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear. <unk> be seen that 's what we call offscreen sounds or <unk>. <unk> sounds. well <unk> the term acousmatic comes from pythagoras in ancient greece <unk> who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years not revealing himself to his disciples <unk> . i think the mathematician and philosopher thought that . in that way. his students might focus more on the voice and his words and its meaning <unk> rather than the visual of him speaking so sort of like the wizard of oz or one. thousand nine hundred and eighty four 's big brother <unk> separating the voice from its. <unk> separating cause and effect sort of creates a sense of ubiquity or. and therefore authority <unk> there 's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound nuns in monasteries. in rome and venice used to sing in rooms up in galleries. close to the ceiling creating the illusion that we 're listening to angels up in the sky. <unk> wagner famously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience <unk> and one of my heroes <unk> aphex twin famously hid in dark corners of clubs . i think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source you create a sense of mystery this has been seen in cinema over and over with hitchcock and ridley scott in. <unk> without knowing its source is going to create some sort of tension <unk> . also <unk> . it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have and can show something that wasn 't there during filming <unk> . and if all this sounds a little theoretical i wanted to play a little video. sort of trying to to demonstrate with these tools. is that sound is a language <unk> it can trick us by transporting us geographically <unk> . it can change the mood it can set the pace it. can make us laugh or it can make us scared. on a personal level i fell in love with that language a few years ago <unk> and somehow managed to make it into some sort of. <unk> profession <unk> and i think with our work through the sound library we 're trying to kind of. expand the vocabulary of that language and. in that way <unk> we want to offer the right tools to sound designers <unk> filmmakers and video game and. <unk> to keep telling even better stories and creating even more beautiful lies <unk> so thanks for listening.
