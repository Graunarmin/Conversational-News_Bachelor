 <unk> i 'm going to try to give you. a view of the world as i see it <unk> the problems and the opportunities that we face <unk> and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or. <unk> let you in on a secret which is why i am an incurable optimist <unk> let me start off. showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before now you 've all seen inconvenient. truth this is a little more inconvenient man . extremely dangerous questions because with our present. <unk> we have no idea what would happen . even now <unk> man may be unwittingly changing the world 's climate through the waste products of his civilization . due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide which helps air absorb heat from the sun. our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer <unk> this is bad well. it 's been calculated a few degrees ' rise in the earth 's temperature would melt the polar ice caps. and if this happens an inland sea would fill a good portion of the mississippi valley <unk> . tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of miami through one hundred and fifty feet of tropical. <unk> not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters <unk> . but with life itself larry brilliant should we feel good or should we feel bad. that fifty years of foreknowledge accomplished so little well it depends really on. what your goals are <unk> and i think <unk> as my goals i always go back to gandhi 's talisman. <unk> mahatma gandhi was asked how do you know if the next act that you are about to do. is the right one or the wrong one . he said consider the face of the poorest most vulnerable human being. that you ever chanced upon <unk> and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that. <unk> person <unk> and if it will be it 's the right thing to do and if not rethink it . for those of us in this room it 's not just the poorest. and the most vulnerable individual <unk> it 's the community <unk> it 's the culture <unk> it 's the world itself and the trends. the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society who are the poorest and the most vulnerable. the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism <unk> . but there 's also a wonderful case for optimism let 's review them both <unk> . first of all the megatrends . there 's two degrees or three degrees of climate change baked into the system <unk> . it will cause rising seas <unk> it will cause. saline. deposited into wells and into lands <unk> it will disproportionately harm the poorest. and the most vulnerable as will the increasing. rise of population even though we 've dodged paul ehrlich 's population bomb and we will not see twenty billion people. <unk> in this decade as he had forecast we eat as if we were twenty billion <unk> and we consume so much. that again a rise of six point five billion to nine point five billion in our grandchildren 's lifetime. will disproportionately hurt the poorest. and the most vulnerable that 's why they migrate to cities that 's why in june of this year we passed as a species. fifty one percent of us. living in cities and bustees and slums <unk> and shantytowns <unk> . the rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did the green revolution never reached africa . and with desertification <unk> sandstorms the gobi desert the. <unk> we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare. to produce as many calories as it did even fifteen years ago <unk> . so humans are turning more towards animal consumption in africa last year africans ate. six hundred million wild animals and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat and every kilogram of bush meat. contained hundreds. <unk> of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted <unk> the genomic sequences of which we don 't know their fitness. for creating pandemics. we are unaware of but we are ripe for. most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth <unk> but it has a dark side. <unk> one percent of us own forty percent of all the goods and services <unk> what will happen. if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day. <unk> rise to three billion in the next thirty years . the one percent will own even more than forty percent of all the world 's goods and services not because they 've grown richer <unk> . but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer . last week bill clinton. <unk> 's lots of reason for pessimism <unk> darfur is at its origin a resource war . last year there were eighty five thousand. riots in china two hundred and thirty a day that required police or military intervention most of them were about resources. <unk> we are facing an unprecedented number scale of disasters some are <unk>. related epidemics <unk> and the newly emerging diseases may make. <unk> and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come <unk> it 's a destabilized world. <unk> and unlike destabilized world in the past it will be broadcast to you on youtube . you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones. <unk> what will that lead to for some it will lead to anger <unk> religious and sectarian violence. and terrorism for others. <unk> where does it take us as social activists and entrepreneurs <unk> as we look at these trends do we become despondent . or will we become energized let 's look at one case the case of bangladesh. <unk> carbon dioxide emissions stopped today global warming would continue <unk> and even with global warming. if you can see these blue lines <unk> the dotted line shows that even if. emissions. of greenhouse gasses stopped today <unk> the next decades will see rising sea levels a minimum. of twenty to thirty inches. of increase in sea levels. is the best case that we can hope for and it could be ten times that . what will that do to bangladesh let 's take a look . so here 's bangladesh <unk> seventy percent of bangladesh. is at less than five feet above sea level. <unk> 's go up and take a look at the himalayas and we 'll watch as. global warming makes them melt more water comes down the deforested areas here in the tarai . will be unable to absorb the effluent because trees are like straws. that suck up the extra seasonal water <unk> now we 're looking down south through the kali gandaki many of you i think have probably trekked here. <unk> and we 're going to cruise down and take a look. at bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin. increases in water coming from the north <unk> and in the seas rising. from the south <unk> looking at the five major rivers. that feed bangladesh and now let 's look from the south <unk> looking up and let 's see this in. <unk> relief a. minimum of twenty to forty inches of. increase in seas <unk> coupled with increasing flows. from the himalayas <unk> and take a look at this . as many as one hundred million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate. into india and into china this is. the difficulty that one country faces <unk> but if you look at the globe all around. the earth <unk> wherever there is low lying area <unk> populated areas near the. <unk> you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life sub saharan africa <unk> and even our own san francisco. bay area <unk> we 're all in this together . this is not something that happens far away to people that we don 't know global warming is something. that happens to all of us all at once . <unk> as are these newly emerging communicable diseases <unk> . names that you hadn 't heard twenty years ago ebola lhasa fever monkey pox with the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans <unk> . we live in each other 's viral environment . do you remember twenty years ago no one had ever heard of west nile fever and then we watched as. one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year <unk> westwardly do you remember. <unk> one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in central africa from it <unk> . it 's just the beginning unfortunately there have been thirty novel. emerging communicable diseases. that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last thirty years it 's more than enough reason for pessimism. but now let 's look at the case for optimism . enough of the bad news <unk> . human beings have always risen to the challenge you just need to look at the list of nobel laureates to remind ourselves . we 've been here before <unk> paralyzed by fear <unk> . <unk> when some probably one of you in this room. jumped into the breach and created an organization like physicians for social responsibility <unk> which fought against. the nuclear threat . medicins sans frontieres . that renewed our commitment to disaster relief <unk> mohamed elbaradei <unk> and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us and our own. muhammad yunus. <unk> we 've seen the eradication of smallpox <unk> . we may see the eradication of polio this year <unk> last year there were only two thousand cases in the world <unk> . we may see the eradication of guinea worm. next year. there are only thirty five thousand cases left in the world <unk> twenty years ago <unk> there were three and a half. <unk> we 've seen a new disease not like. the thirty novel. emerging communicable diseases this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome . it 's an amazing phenomenon . all throughout the technology world we 're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome <unk> . but they 're using their wealth. in a way that their forefathers never did. <unk> they 're not waiting until they die to create foundations . they 're actively guiding their money their resources their hearts their commitments to make the world a better place <unk> . certainly nothing can give you more optimism. than that more reasons to be optimistic in the ' 60s and i am a creature of the. <unk> there was a movement <unk> we all felt that we were part of it that a better world was right around the corner that we were watching the birth. of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice . today there 's another kind of movement <unk> it 's a movement to save the earth <unk> it 's just beginning . five weeks ago a group of activists from the business community. gathered together to stop a texas utility. <unk> from building nine coal fired electrical plants. that would have contributed to destroying the environment <unk> six months ago <unk> a group of business activists. gathered together to join with the republican governor in california to pass ab thirty two the most far reaching legislation. in environmental history al gore. made presentations in the house and the senate. as an expert witness can you imagine we 're seeing an entente cordiale. between science and religion that five years ago i would not have believed as the evangelical community. has understood the desperate situation of. <unk> warming <unk> and now four thousand churches have joined the environmental movement it is something to be greatly optimistic about . the european <unk>. <unk> plan is an amazing breakthrough something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon. <unk> there will be step up day <unk> where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the united states on protest. against legislation. pushing for legislation to stop global warming and on july 7th around the world i learned only yesterday there will be global live. <unk> and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air now that doesn 't mean that people understand. that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most . that means that people are beginning the first step which is acting out of their own self interest . but i am seeing in the major funders in care rockefeller rockefeller brothers. fund <unk> hewlett mercy corps you guys. <unk> so many other organizations . a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming <unk> . but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming. on the poorest and the most vulnerable <unk> but for me i have another reason. to be an incurable optimist <unk> and you 've heard so many inspiring. <unk> stories here <unk> and i heard so many last night. that i thought i would share a little bit of mine . my background is not exactly conventional medical training <unk> . and i lived in a himalayan monastery <unk> and i studied with a very wise teacher <unk> who kicked me out of the. monastery one day and told me. <unk> it was my destiny it felt like yoda it is your destiny. to go to work for <unk> who and to help eradicate smallpox <unk> at a time when there was no smallpox program <unk> . it should make you optimistic. that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history <unk> in the last century. that 's the one that was seven years ago. half a billion people died from smallpox <unk> more than all the. <unk> wars in history <unk> more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world in the summer of love <unk>. two million people children died of smallpox <unk> it 's not ancient history <unk> when you read the biblical plague. <unk> of boils that was smallpox <unk> . pharaoh ramses the fifth whose picture is here <unk> died of smallpox to eradicate smallpox <unk> . we had to gather the largest united nations army in history <unk> we visited every house in india searching for smallpox. one hundred and twenty million houses <unk> once every month for nearly two years . in a cruel reversal after we had almost conquered smallpox and this is what you must learn. as a social entrepreneur the realm of the final inch when we had almost eradicated smallpox <unk> it came back again <unk> . because the company town of tatanagar drew laborers <unk> who could come there and get employment <unk> . and they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox . <unk> they went home to die and when they did they took smallpox to ten other countries. and reignited the epidemic and we had to start all over again <unk> . but in the end <unk> we succeeded and the last case of smallpox <unk> . this little girl rahima banu. barisal <unk> in bangladesh when she coughed or breathed and the last. <unk> virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun. killed that last virus <unk> thus ended a chain of transmission. of history 's greatest horror.
