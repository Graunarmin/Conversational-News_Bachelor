 <unk> as a kid i always loved. information that i could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers <unk> i remember <unk> growing up i 'd be frustrated at how my own parents would lie to. <unk> if i 've told you once i 've told you a thousand times no dad you 've only told me seventeen times. and twice it wasn 't my fault . i think that is one of the reasons i got a ph d in statistics i always wanted to know what are people trying to hide with numbers. as a statistician <unk> i want people to show me the data. so i can decide for myself. donald and i were pregnant with our third child and we were at about forty one and a half weeks <unk> what some of you may refer to as being overdue <unk> . statisticians we call that being within the ninety five percent confidence interval . laughter and at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby and this is just routine it tests whether or not the baby. <unk> is feeling any type of undue stress . and you are rarely if ever seen by your actual doctor just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day <unk> . so we go in for a stress test and after twenty minutes the doctor comes out and he says . your baby is under stress <unk> we need to induce you. <unk> show me the data . so then he proceeds to tell us the baby 's heart rate trace went from eighteen minutes the baby 's heart rate was in the normal zone and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be my heart rate zone. and i said is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate i was moving around a little bit it 's hard to lay still on your back. forty one weeks pregnant for twenty minutes <unk> maybe it was shifting around he said well we don 't want to take any chances . i said okay <unk> i said <unk> what if i was at thirty six weeks with this same data would your decision be to induce . well no i would. wait until you were at least <unk> thirty eight weeks but you are almost forty two there is no reason to leave that baby inside let 's get you a room. why don 't we just do it again we can collect more data i can try to be really still for twenty minutes <unk> we can average the two and see what. that means. <unk> just don 't want you to have a miscarriage . that makes three of us . and then he says your chances of having a miscarriage double. when you go past your due date let 's get you a room wow <unk> so now as a statistician. <unk> where are we here with this miscarriage thing and he goes <unk> not quite but it doubles <unk> and we really just want what 's best for the baby. <unk> pregnant women how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date and then he looks at me. and looks at donald and he goes about one in one thousand i said okay <unk> so of those one thousand women how many are going. <unk> so you are telling me that my chances go from a <unk>. <unk> chance to a <unk>. okay <unk> so at this point the data is not convincing us that we need to be induced <unk> and so then we proceed to have a conversation about how inductions lead to a higher rate of cesarean sections and if at all possible we 'd like. <unk> to avoid that and then i said and i really don 't think my due date is accurate and so. this really stunned him. and he looked sort of puzzled and i said <unk> you may not know this but pregnancy due dates are calculated assuming that you have a standard 28 day cycle and my cycle ranges. <unk> and i have been collecting the data to prove it . laughter and so. we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced we actually had to sign a waiver to walk out of the hospital . and i 'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors because even with our first child we were induced at. <unk> fluid was low i 'm not <unk>. <unk> intervention <unk> but why were confident to leave that day <unk> well we had data that told a different story <unk> we had been collecting data. for six years <unk> i had this temperature data and it told a different story in fact. <unk> a story you want to tell at your kid 's wedding. reception i remember like it was yesterday . my temperature was a sizzling ninety seven point eight degrees as i stared into your father 's. <unk> confident to leave because we had been collecting data now what does that data look like here 's a standard chart. of a woman 's waking body temperature. during the course of a cycle so from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next you. 'll see that the temperature is not random. clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her. <unk> cycle so what 's happening here what is that data telling you . well ladies . at the beginning of our cycle the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature . and at ovulation your body releases an egg. and progesterone takes over. <unk> anticipation of housing this new little fertilized egg <unk> so why this temperature jump . well think about when a bird sits on her eggs <unk> why is she sitting on them . she wants to keep them warm protect them and keep them warm <unk> ladies this is exactly what our bodies do every month they heat up in anticipation of keeping a new little life warm <unk> . and. if nothing. <unk> happens if you are not pregnant then estrogen takes back over and that cycle starts all over again <unk> . but if you do get pregnant <unk> sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months that 's why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot. <unk> because their temperatures are high . here 's a chart that we had about three or four years ago we were. <unk> really very excited about this chart you 'll see the low temperature level and then a shift. and for about five days that 's about the time it takes for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant <unk> . and then you see those temperatures start to go up a little bit <unk> and in fact <unk> we had a second temperature shift <unk> confirmed. with a pregnancy test that were indeed pregnant with our first child very. <unk> exciting until a couple of days later i saw some spotting. and then i noticed heavy blood flow <unk> and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage. had i not been taking my temperature i really would have just thought my period was late that month <unk> but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby. <unk> even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives it was information that we could then take to our doctor so if there was a fertility issue or some problem <unk> i had data to show look <unk> we <unk>. <unk> got pregnant our temperature shifted <unk> we somehow lost this baby <unk> what is it that we can do to help prevent this problem . <unk> tell us a lot of things for instance did you know that taking your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid . so your thyroid works a lot like the thermostat in your house <unk> . there is an optimal temperature that you want in your house you set your thermostat when it gets too cold in the house your thermostat kicks in and says hey we need to blow. <unk> or if it gets too hot your thermostat registers turn the a c on cool us off that. 's exactly how your thyroid works in your body. <unk> your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body <unk> if it gets too cold your thyroid says hey we need to heat up if it gets too hot your thyroid cools you down <unk> . but what happens when your thyroid is not functioning well <unk> . when it doesn 't function then it shows up in your body temperatures they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic. and so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid . now <unk> what is it if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood . fine <unk> but the problem with that test is it doesn 't tell you how active the hormone is in. <unk> so you might have a lot of hormone present <unk> but it might not be actively working to regulate your body temperature so just by collecting your temperature every day <unk> you get information about the condition of your thyroid <unk> . so what if you don 't want to take your temperature every day <unk> i advocate that you do but there are tons of other things you could take you could take your blood pressure you could take your weight. yeah who 's excited about taking their weight every day . early on in our marriage <unk> donald had a stuffy nose. <unk> and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to. relieve his stuffy nose . to no avail <unk> and so that night he comes and he wakes me up and he says honey <unk> i can 't breath out of my nose . and i roll over and i look and i said well can you breath out of your mouth. <unk> i can 't breath out of my nose and so like any good wife i rush him to the emergency room. at two o 'clock in the morning and the whole time i 'm driving and i 'm thinking <unk> you can 't die on me now. we just got married <unk> people will think i killed. <unk> and so we get to the emergency room and the nurse sees us and he can 't breath out of his nose <unk> and so she brings us to the back and and the doctor says what seems to be the problem and he goes i can 't breath out of my nose and he said . you can 't breath out of your nose <unk> no <unk> but he can breath out of his mouth <unk>. he takes a step back and he looks at both of us and he says sir i think i know the problem. <unk> a heart attack i 'm going to order an ekg and a cat scan for you immediately . <unk> not a heart attack he can breathe just. out of his mouth <unk> no no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> and so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect. <unk> and so fortunately for us this doctor was at the end of the shift. so this new doctor comes in he sees us clearly distraught with a husband who can 't breath out of his nose . and he starts asking us questions he says well <unk> . <unk> what was donald doing just before so donald goes into this slew of medications. <unk> i took this decongestant and then i took this nasal spray and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says oh <unk> you should never mix this decongestant with this nasal spray <unk> . clogs you up every time here take this one instead he gives us a prescription <unk>. we 're looking at each other and i looked at the doctor and i said why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition but this previous doctor wanted to order an ekg. <unk> man walks in the emergency room and says he can 't breath you assume he 's having a heart attack and you ask questions later . now emergency room doctors are trained to make decisions quickly <unk> but not always accurately <unk> . and so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him maybe we would have gotten a better diagnosis the first time. <unk> i want you to consider the following chart of systolic blood pressure measurements from october two thousand and ten to july two thousand and twelve you. 'll see that these measurements start in the <unk>. hypertension zone <unk> but over about the course of a year and a half they move into the normal zone this is about the heart rate of a healthy. <unk> telling you . obviously it 's the data from someone who 's made a drastic transformation <unk> . and fortunately for us that person happens to be here today <unk> . so that 350 pound guy that walked into the emergency room with me is now an even sexier and healthier. blood pressure trace <unk> so over the course of that year and a half. donald 's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed and his heart rate responded his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body.
