enough seats. to accommodate them to meet the demand . they will take a placement test they will pass it <unk> but they still won 't have access because there are no places available . these are the reasons. i founded. <unk> to give an alternative to create an alternative to those who have no other an alternative that will be affordable. and scalable an alternative that will disrupt. the current
