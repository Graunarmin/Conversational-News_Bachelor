 <unk> to tell you from the bottom of. <unk> thank you so very very much do you know to date the als association has raised one hundred and <unk>. million dollars woo hoo . it takes me back to the summer of <unk>. my family my kids had all grown up we were officially empty nesters and we decided let 's go on a family vacation jenn my daughter. and my son in law came down from new york my youngest andrew <unk> he came down from his home in charlestown where he was working in boston <unk> and my son pete <unk> who had played at. <unk> boston college baseball had played baseball professionally in europe <unk> and had now come home and was selling group insurance he also joined us and one night i found myself having a beer with pete . you know mom <unk> i don 't know selling group insurance is just not my passion he said . i just don 't feel i 'm living up to my potential <unk> i don 't feel this is my mission in life . and he said you know <unk> oh by the way mom <unk> i have to leave early from vacation because my inter city league team that i play for. <unk> made the playoffs <unk> and i have to get back to boston because i can 't let my team down i 'm just not as passionate about my job. as i am about baseball so off pete went and left the family vacation break a mother 's heart. and he. went and we followed four days later to see the next playoff game we 're at the playoff game pete. <unk> plate and a fastball 's coming in and it hits him on the wrist oh pete . his wrist went completely limp like this <unk> . so for the next six months . pete went back to his home in southie kept working that unpassionate job . and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back <unk> . six months later in march. <unk> called my husband and me and he said oh mom and dad we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist do. you want to come with the doctor 's appointment with me i said sure we 'll come in . that morning pete <unk> john and i all got up got dressed got in our cars. three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor 's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist we walked into the neurologist. <unk> 's office sat down four doctors walk in and the head neurologist sits down . and he says well pete we 've been looking at all the tests <unk> and i have to tell you it 's not a sprained wrist it. 's not a broken wrist it 's not nerve damage in the wrist <unk> it 's not an infection <unk> it 's not lyme. <unk> up and i was thinking to myself <unk> where is he going with this . then he put his hands on his knees he looked right at my 27 year old kid and said i don 't know how to tell a. <unk> at my husband he looked at me and then we looked at the doctor and we said als okay <unk> what treatment let 's go what do we do . let 's go and he looked at us and he said <unk>. i 'm sorry to tell you this but there 's no treatment. and there 's no cure we were the worst culprits we didn 't even understand that it had been. seventy five years since lou gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against als . so we all went home and jenn and dan flew home from wall street <unk> andrew came home from charlestown . and pete went to b c to pick up his then girlfriend julie and brought her home and six hours later after diagnosis we 're sitting around having a family dinner. and we 're having small chat <unk> i don 't even remember cooking dinner that night <unk> but then our leader <unk> pete <unk> . set the vision . and talked to us just like we were his new team <unk> he said there will be no wallowing people he goes we 're not looking. <unk> looking forward what an amazing opportunity we have to change the world . i 'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of. <unk> going to move the needle and i 'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like bill gates . and that was it we were given our directive so in the days and months. <unk> that followed within a week we had. our brothers and sisters and our family come to us that they were already creating team frate train <unk> . uncle dave he was the webmaster <unk> uncle artie <unk> he was the accountant <unk> auntie dana she was the graphic artist <unk> . and my youngest son <unk> andrew <unk> quit his job <unk> left his apartment in charlestown and says i 'm going to take care of pete and be his. <unk> that pete had inspired throughout his whole life <unk> . the circles of pete all started intersecting with one another and made team frate train <unk> . six months after diagnosis pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy. <unk> got up and gave a very eloquent speech . and at the end of the speech there was a panel and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and. i 'm sitting there and i 'm listening to them and most of the content. went straight over my head i avoided every science class i ever could . but i was watching these people and i was listening to them and they were saying i i do this i do that and there was a. <unk> unfamiliarity between them <unk> . so at the end of their talk the panel <unk> they had questions and answers and boom my hand went right up <unk> . and i get the microphone <unk> and i look at them and i say thank you thank you so much for working in als it means so very much to us i said but i do have to tell you that i 'm watching <unk>. <unk> your body language and i 'm listening to what you 're saying it just doesn 't seem like there 's a whole lot of collaboration going on here. <unk> not only that where 's the flip chart with the action items and the <unk> follow up and the accountability what are you going to do after you leave this room . and then i turned around. and there was about two hundred pairs of eyes. just staring at me <unk> . <unk> and it was that that point that i realized. that i had talked about the elephant in the room <unk> thus my mission had begun . so over the next couple of years. <unk> pete we 've had our highs and our lows pete was put on a compassionate use drug it was hope in a bottle for the whole als community it was in a phase iii trial . then six months later the data comes back no efficacy. <unk> were supposed to have therapies overseas <unk> and the rug was pulled out from under us <unk> . so for the next two years <unk> we just watched my son be taken away from me little by little every day. two and a half years ago pete was hitting home runs at baseball fields . <unk> pete 's completely paralyzed <unk> he can 't hold his head up any longer he 's confined to a motorized wheelchair <unk> . he can no longer swallow or eat <unk> he has a feeding tube <unk> . he can 't speak <unk> . he talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device and we 're watching his lungs because his diaphragm. <unk> eventually is going to give out. and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not als robs the human of all their physical. parts but the brain stays intact <unk> so july <unk>. fourteen 75th year of lou gehrig 's inspirational speech. <unk> and pete is asked by mlb com to write an article in the bleacher report <unk> . and it was very significant because he wrote it using his eye gaze technology <unk> . twenty days later the ice started to fall . on july <unk>. pete 's roommate in new york city <unk> wearing. <unk> a quinn for the win shirt signifying pat quinn another als patient known in new york and b c shorts. said i 'm taking the als ice bucket challenge . picked up the ice put it over his head and i 'm nominating and he sent it up to boston . and that was on july <unk>. <unk> the next couple of days our news feed was full of family and friends <unk> if you haven 't gone back <unk> the nice thing. <unk> about facebook is that you have the dates you can go back you 've got to see uncle artie 's human bloody mary. <unk> i 'm telling you it 's one of the best ones <unk> and that was probably in day two . by about day four <unk> uncle dave the webmaster <unk> he isn 't on facebook <unk> and i get a text from him. <unk> what the hell is going on . uncle dave gets a hit every time pete 's website is gone onto and his phone was blowing up <unk> . so we all sat down and we realized money is coming in how amazing <unk> so we knew awareness would lead to funding <unk> we just didn 't know it would only take a couple of days <unk> . so we got together put our best five hundred and. <unk> on pete 's website and off we went so week one boston media <unk> . week two national media it was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor saying i think you people might need food in there. <unk> my husband did japanese television it was interesting. <unk> nuns of dublin <unk> who 's seen that one. <unk> it 's absolutely fantastic <unk> j t justin timberlake that 's when we knew that was a real. i go back on my texts and i i can see. <unk> and the als patients you know what their favorite ones are and their families ' . all of them . because this misunderstood and underfunded rare disease <unk> they just sat and watched people saying it over and over <unk>. it was. <unk> and those naysayers let 's just talk a couple of stats <unk> shall we . okay so the als association they think by year end it 'll be one hundred and sixty million dollars. <unk> in cambridge they raised three million dollars well guess what they had a. clinical trial for a drug that they 've been developing it was on a three year track for funding. <unk> has reported that over one hundred and fifty countries have posted ice bucket challenges for als and facebook . two point five. million videos <unk> and i had. <unk> the awesome. adventure visiting the facebook campus last week and i said to them i know what it was like in my house i can 't imagine what it was like around here . all she said was <unk>. and my family 's favorite video <unk> . <unk> because the night pete was diagnosed <unk> he told us. that he was going to get als in front of philanthropists like bill gates <unk> . and he did it goal number one <unk> check now on to the treatment and cure. <unk> we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of ice water over your head <unk> and i really would like to leave you with a couple of things that i 'd like you to remember <unk> . the first thing is . every morning when you wake up you can choose to live your day in positivity. <unk> would any of you blame me if i just was in the fetal position and pulled the. covers over my head every day no i don 't think anybody would blame me <unk> . but pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be positive and proactive i actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals that 's. <unk> i had to get away from the negativity <unk> . the second thing i want to leave you with is the person at the middle of the challenge has to be willing to have the mental toughness to put themselves out there . pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his teammates in the dugout <unk> . and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages you 'll see the. <unk> kids they 're up there hanging it up pete is that okay yup and then they put it right into his stomach <unk> . because he wants them to see what the reality of this is and how he 's never ever going to give up . and the third thing i want to leave you with if you ever come across a situation that you see. <unk> i want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it. <unk> i know that i 'm running over but i 've got to leave you with this <unk> the gifts that my son has given me <unk> i have had twenty nine years. of having the honor of being the mother of pete frates . pete frates has been inspiring and leading his whole life <unk> he 's thrown out kindness and all that kindness has come back to him <unk> . he walks the face of the earth right. <unk> now and knows why he 's here <unk> what a gift <unk> . the second thing that my son has given me is he 's given me my mission in life <unk>. now i know why i 'm here i 'm going to save my son <unk> . and if it doesn 't happen in time for him i 'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what i 'm going through. and the third thing and last but not least gift that my son has given me as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of august two thousand and fourteen . that girlfriend that he went to get on the night of diagnosis is now his wife <unk> . <unk> and pete and julie have given me my granddaughter. <unk> so let me leave you with pete 's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates <unk> coworkers and teammates . be passionate . be genuine be hardworking <unk> and don 't. forget to be great.
