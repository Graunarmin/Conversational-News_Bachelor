 <unk> i heard about a high school in chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate <unk> and if they didn 't pass a course they got the. <unk> i thought that was fantastic because if you get a failing grade you think i 'm nothing i 'm nowhere <unk> but if you get the grade not yet you understand <unk>. that you 're on a learning curve it gives you a path into the future . <unk> to see how children coped with challenge. and difficulty so i gave <unk> 10 year olds problems that were slightly too hard for them . some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way they said things. <unk> you know i was hoping this would be informative they understood. that their abilities could be developed <unk> they had what i call a growth mindset . but other students felt it was tragic catastrophic <unk> . from their more fixed mindset perspective . their intelligence had. <unk> been up for judgment and they failed . instead of luxuriating in the power of yet <unk> they were gripped in the tyranny. of now <unk> so what do they do next i 'll tell you what they do next in one. <unk> they told us they would probably cheat the next time. instead of studying more if they failed a test in another study after a failure <unk> . they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves <unk> . and in study after study <unk> they have run from difficulty. <unk> the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error . on the left you see the fixed mindset students there 's hardly any activity they run from the error <unk> . they don 't engage with it but on the right you have the students with the growth mindset the idea that abilities can be developed . <unk> engage deeply their brain is on fire with yet <unk> they engage deeply <unk> . they process the error <unk> they learn from it and they correct it . how are we raising our children are we raising them for now instead. <unk> are we raising kids who are obsessed obsessed with getting as . are we raising kids who don 't know how to dream big dreams . their biggest goal is getting the next a or the next test score <unk> . and are they carrying this need for constant validation with them. into their future lives <unk> maybe because employers. <unk> are coming to me and saying we have already raised a generation. of young workers who can 't get through the day without an award . so what can we do how can we build that bridge to yet <unk> here are some things we can do first of all we can praise wisely. not praising intelligence or talent that has failed don 't do that anymore but praising the process that kids engage in . their effort their strategies their focus their perseverance their improvement . this process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient . there are other. <unk> ways to reward yet <unk> we recently teamed up with game scientists. from the university of washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet <unk> . in this game students were rewarded for effort strategy and progress. <unk> the usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now <unk> but this game rewarded process . and we got. more effort . more strategies . more engagement over longer periods of time and more perseverance when they hit really really hard problems. <unk> into the future that creates greater persistence. and. we can actually change students ' mindsets . in one study we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone. to learn something new and difficult. <unk> the neurons in their brain can form new stronger connections <unk> and over time they can get smarter <unk> look what happened <unk>. in this study <unk> students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school. <unk> but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades we have. shown this now this kind of improvement with thousands and thousands of kids . especially struggling students . so let 's talk about. equality in our country there are groups of students who. <unk> chronically underperform for example children in inner cities . or children on native american reservations and they 've done so poorly for so long. that many people think it 's inevitable but. when educators create. <unk> and here are just a few examples in one year a kindergarten class in harlem new york. scored in the <unk> 95th percentile on the national achievement. <unk> of those kids could not hold a pencil. when they arrived at school in one year. fourth grade students in the south bronx . way behind became the number one fourth grade class in the state of new york. on the state math test in a year to a year and a half native. <unk> american students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district. to the top <unk> and that district included affluent sections of seattle so. the native kids. <unk> this happened. because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed <unk> . before effort and difficulty. made them feel dumb <unk> made them feel like giving up but now effort and difficulty. <unk> that 's when their neurons are making new connections stronger connections that 's when they 're getting smarter <unk> . i received a letter recently from a <unk>. boy <unk> he said dear professor dweck <unk> . i appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research. <unk> that 's why i decided to put it into practice <unk> i put more effort into my schoolwork . into my relationship with my family <unk> and into my relationship. with kids at school and i experienced. great improvement. in all of those areas <unk> i now realize i 've wasted most of my life. let 's not waste any more lives <unk> . because once we know. that abilities are capable of such growth <unk> it becomes a basic human right. for children all children to live in places. that create that growth.
