 <unk> i am a phd student <unk> and that means i have a question <unk> how can we make. digital content graspable <unk> because you see on the one hand there is the digital world and. <unk> many things are happening there right now <unk> and for us humans it 's not quite material it 's not really there it 's virtual . on the other hand <unk> we 're humans <unk> we live in a in a physical world it 's rich <unk> it tastes good it feels good it smells good <unk> . so the question is how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical that 's my question . if you look at the iphone with its touch and the wii with its bodily activity you can see the tendency it 's getting physical the question is what 's next. <unk> now i have three options that i would like to show you the first one is mass . as humans we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy <unk> so could we use that in mobile phones . let me show you the weight shifting mobile <unk> it is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside which we can move around. <unk> can feel where it 's heavy <unk> we shift the gravitational center of it . for example we can augment digital content with physical mass <unk> so you move around the content on the display but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device . another thing it 's good for is navigation <unk> it can guide you around in a city it can tell you by its weight ok move right walk ahead . <unk> make a left here and the good thing about that is you don 't have to look at the device all the time you have your eyes free to see the city <unk> now mass is the first thing the second thing . that 's shape we 're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in our hands <unk> . so if i download an e book and it has twenty pages well they could be thin right but if it has five hundred pages i want to feel that harry potter it 's thick . so let me show you. <unk> it 's a mobile phone shaped box and this one can change its shape . we can play with the shape itself for example it can be thin in your pocket <unk> which we of course want it to be but then if you hold it in your hand it can <unk>. <unk> lean towards you be thick <unk> it 's like tapered to the downside if you change the grasp it can adjust to that it. another thing is <unk> sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone that are bigger than the phone itself <unk> in that case like here there 's an app that 's bigger than the phone 's screen. the shape of the phone could tell you ok <unk> off the screen right here <unk> there is more content you can 't see it but it 's there and you can feel it because it 's thicker at that edge the. shape is the second thing the third thing operates on a different level. as humans we are social we are empathic <unk> and that 's great wouldn. 't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive <unk> think of a hamster in the pocket well i can feel it it 's doing all right i don 't have to check it . let me show you the living mobile phone <unk> so once again a mobile phone shaped box <unk> . but this one. <unk> how do we calm it down you give it a pat behind the ears and. everything is all right again <unk> that 's very intuitive and that 's what we want . so what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us and i think making it physical. is a good way to do that . what 's behind that is a postulation namely not that humans should get much more technical in the future <unk> rather than that technology a bit more human.
