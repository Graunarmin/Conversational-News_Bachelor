 <unk> joined the united states air force and was assigned to mountain home air force base and was a part of the air police squadron upon first. <unk> arriving there the first goal that i had. was for me to identify an apartment so i could bring my wife and my new baby melanie out to join me in idaho <unk> . i immediately went to the personnel office <unk> . and talking with the guys in personnel they said hey <unk> no problem finding an apartment in mountain home <unk> idaho <unk> the people down there love us because they <unk>. <unk> know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent one of their apartments they 'll always. <unk> get their money and that was a really important thing he said so here is a list of people that you can call and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want . so i got the list . i made the call the lady answered on the other end and i told her what i wanted she said oh great you called <unk> we have four or five apartments. <unk> 's not talk about that just come on down select the apartment that you want we 'll sign the contract and you 'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away . so i was excited i jumped in my car i went downtown. and knocked on the door <unk> when i knocked on the door the woman came to the door <unk> and she looked at me. <unk> i was just coming down to make my selection she said you know what i 'm really sorry <unk> but my husband rented those apartments and didn 't tell me about them . i said you mean he rented all five of them in one hour she didn 't give me a response and what she said was this <unk> she said why don 't you leave your number . <unk> needless to say <unk> i did not get a call from her . nor did i get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where i could get apartments . so as a result of that and feeling rejected i went back to the base and i talked to the squadron commander his name was. <unk> we can 't make people rent to folks that they don 't want to rent to . and besides we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don 't want to damage that he said so maybe this is what you should do. why don 't you let your family stay home because you do know that you <unk>. so once a year you can go home to your family spend thirty days and then come on back. <unk> to say that didn 't resonate for me so after leaving him <unk> i went back to personnel <unk> and talking to the clerk he said jim i think i have a solution for you. there 's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer if you noticed in mountain home there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place you can buy his trailer and you 'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town. <unk> care of your problem <unk> and that would provide the solution for you . so i immediately jumped in my car went downtown saw the trailer it was a small trailer <unk> . but under the circumstances i figured that was the best thing that i could do <unk> so i bought the trailer and then i asked him <unk> can i just leave the trailer here <unk> and that would take care <unk>. <unk> of all my problems i wouldn 't have to have to find another trailer park he said <unk> before i say yes to that i need to check with management. so i get back to the base he called me back and management said <unk> . no you can 't leave the trailer here because we had promised that slot to some other people and that was strange to me because there were several other slots that were open <unk> but it just so happened that he had promised that slot to someone else . so what i did. <unk> list. of going to trailer parks i went to one after another after another and i got the same kind of rejection there that i received when i was looking for the apartment . and. as a result <unk> the kind of comments that they made to me in addition to saying that they didn 't have any slots open one. <unk> the reason why we can 't rent to you we already have a negro family in the trailer park he said and it 's not me because i like you people. <unk> discouraging <unk> it didn 't stop me i kept looking and i looked at the far end of of the town in mountain home <unk> and there was a small trailer park <unk> . i mean a really small trailer park <unk> it didn 't have any paved roads in it it didn 't have the concrete slabs <unk> it didn 't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot from other trailer <unk>. slots <unk> it didn 't have a laundry facility <unk> but the conclusion i reached at that moment was that i didn 't have. <unk> a lot of other options <unk> so i called my wife and i said we 're going to make this one work and we moved into it and we became homeowners in mountain home <unk> idaho and of course eventually things settled down . four years after that i received papers to move from mountain home <unk> idaho to a place called goose bay <unk> labrador <unk> we won 't even talk about that. <unk> was another great location . so my challenge then was to get my family from mountain home <unk> idaho to sharon pennsylvania that wasn 't a problem because we had just purchased a <unk> brand new automobile . my mother called and said she 'll fly out she 'll be with us as we drive she 'll help us manage the children . so she came out. <unk> her and alice put a lot of food together for the trip that morning we left at about five a m . great trip having a great time good conversation somewhere around six thirty seven o 'clock <unk> we got a little bit tired and we said why don 't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning . so we were looking at a number of the motels as we drove down the road and we saw one it was a great big bright flashing light that said . <unk> so we stopped in they were in the parking lot i went inside when i walked inside the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks . some other people were coming in behind me and so i walked to the counter <unk> and she said <unk> how can i help you i said i would like to get a motel for the evening for my family . she said you know <unk> i 'm really sorry <unk> i just rented the last one we will not have. <unk> and she reached over and turned the light off she looked at me and i looked at her there were other people in the room she kind of looked at them <unk> no one said anything . so i just got the hint and i left and went outside to the parking lot <unk> and i told my mother and i told my wife and and also melanie and i said. <unk> looks like we 're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight . and we did drive down the road but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot guess what happened . the light came back on and it said vacancies <unk> vacancies <unk> vacancies we were able to find a nice place. <unk> but it was secure and it was clean and so we had a great sleep that night . the piece that 's important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from idaho all the way through to pennsylvania <unk> where we were rejected from hotels <unk>. motels and restaurants <unk> but we made it to pennsylvania we. <unk> bay <unk> labrador <unk> which is another story right . here it is. years later i now have nine grandchildren. five of the grandchildren are boys i have master 's ph d undergrad. <unk> they 're almost there but not quite i have one who has been in college now for eight years . he doesn 't have a degree yet but he wants to be a comedian <unk> so we 're just trying to get him to stay. in school <unk> because you never know just because you 're funny at home does not make you a comedian right . <unk> all good kids no drugs <unk> no babies in high school <unk> no crime . so with that being the backdrop i was sitting in my tv room watching tv and they were talking about ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on . and all of a sudden one of the news commentators got on the air and she said . in the last three months . <unk> for some reason at that moment it just all hit me i said what is it . it is so insane what is the hatred that 's causing people to do these kinds of things just then one of my. <unk> i 'm just so confused we do everything we do <unk> but it seems that driving while black <unk> walking while black <unk> talking while black it 's just dangerous <unk>. what can we do we do everything that you told us to do when stopped by the police <unk> we place both hands on the steering wheel at the twelve o 'clock position if asked to get identification. <unk> we tell them ' i am slowly reaching over into the glove compartment to get my i d ' when pulled out of the car to be searched <unk> when laid on the ground to be <unk>. <unk> searched <unk> when our trunks are opened to be searched <unk> we don 't push back <unk> we don 't challenge because we know you 've told us ' don 't you challenge the police after it 's over. <unk> and this is the piece that really bugs me our white friends our buddies we kind of hang together <unk> when they hear about these kinds of things happening to us they say ' why. do you take it <unk> . you need to push back <unk> you need to challenge <unk> you need to ask them for their identification ' and here 's what the boys have been taught to tell them we know that you can do that but <unk>. please do not do that while we 're in the car because the consequences for you. <unk> you are significantly different than the consequences for us and so as a grandparent what do i tell my grandsons . how do i keep them safe <unk> how do i keep them alive . as a result of this people have come to. <unk> of being angry <unk> . and i also know the consequences of being enraged so therefore the only thing that i can do is take my collective intellect. and my energy and my ideas and my experiences and dedicate myself to challenge at any point in time <unk> anything that looks. <unk> like it might be racist so the first thing i have to do is to educate <unk> . the second thing i have to do is to unveil racism and the last thing i need to do is do everything within my power to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary <unk> . the second thing i do is this <unk> i want to appeal. to americans <unk> i want to appeal to their humanity to their dignity to their civic pride. <unk> and ownership. to be able. to not react. to these heinous crimes in an adverse manner <unk> . but instead . to elevate your level of societal knowledge your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness. to then collectively come together all of us come together. to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity any kind of insanity. that makes it okay to kill unarmed. people. <unk> their diversity makeup.
