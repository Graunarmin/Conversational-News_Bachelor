 <unk> i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make i 'm here to tell you the secret to successful. <unk> sandwich . that 's right according to scientists a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions how do i know . i 'm the scientist who did the study . a few years ago my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people 's decisions. <unk> in social situations specifically we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react. when they 're treated unfairly <unk> so we did an experiment we manipulated people 's serotonin levels by giving them this really <unk>. artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain this is the amino acid tryptophan <unk>. <unk> so what we found was when tryptophan was low people were more likely to take revenge when they 're treated unfairly . that 's the study we did and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards. <unk> thing myself when these came out because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate we gave people this horrible tasting drink. that affected their tryptophan levels <unk> but it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate <unk> . and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you. <unk> that 's sure to grab people 's attention <unk> so there you have it the evolution of a headline . when this happened a part of me thought well <unk> what 's the big deal <unk> so the media oversimplified a few things but in the end . it 's just a news story <unk> . and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude <unk> . but the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time <unk> and it affects not just the stories you read in the news. but also the products you see on the shelves when the headlines rolled <unk> what happened was the marketers came calling . would i be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood boosting bottled water . or would i go on television to demonstrate in front of a live audience that comfort foods really do make you feel better . i think these folks meant well but. had i taken them up on. <unk> offers i would have been going beyond the science and good scientists are careful not to do this . but nevertheless neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing here 's one example neuro drinks . a line of products <unk> including nuero bliss here <unk> which according to its label helps reduce stress enhances. <unk> provides focused concentration <unk> and promotes a positive outlook i have to say this sounds awesome . laughter i could totally have used this ten minutes ago. <unk> so when this came up in my local shop naturally i was curious about some of the research backing these claims . so i went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials. <unk> but i didn 't find any <unk> trial or no trial these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain <unk> . and it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties . a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article for half the people the article included a brain. <unk> and for the other half it was the same article but it didn 't have a brain image. at the end you see where this is going people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article <unk> . so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image <unk> . and this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image <unk> . so the take home message here is do you want to sell it . put a brain on it . let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades <unk> and we 're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain. <unk> like just a couple of weeks ago neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain . really cool stuff. but the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations. and some overblown unproven claims <unk> so what i 'm going to do is show you how to spot. a couple of classic moves <unk> dead giveaways really for what 's variously been called. <unk> 's thoughts and emotions here 's a study. published by a team of researchers as an op ed in the new york times <unk> the headline you love your iphone <unk> literally . it quickly became the most emailed article on the site . so how 'd they figure this out they put sixteen people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iphones. the brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula <unk> a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion <unk> . so they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula this meant the subjects loved their iphones <unk> . now there 's just one problem with this line of reasoning <unk> and that 's that the insula does a lot sure. <unk> it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion <unk> but it 's also involved in tons of other processes like memory <unk> language attention <unk> . even anger <unk> disgust and pain <unk> . so based on the same logic <unk> i could equally conclude you hate your iphone <unk> . the point here is when you see activation in the insula you can 't just pick and choose. your favorite explanation from off this list <unk> . and it 's a really long list <unk> my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published . so chances are really really good that your insula is going off right now. <unk> but i won 't kid myself to think this means you love me. <unk> so speaking of love and the brain . there 's a researcher <unk> known to some as dr love who claims that scientists have found. the glue that holds society together the source of love and prosperity this time it 's not a cheese sandwich . <unk> it 's a hormone called oxytocin you 've probably heard of it. so dr love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people 's oxytocin this increases their trust . empathy and cooperation <unk> . so he 's calling oxytocin the moral molecule now these studies are scientifically valid <unk> and they 've been replicated <unk> but they 're not the. <unk> other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy it increases gloating . oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group. at the expense of other groups and in some cases oxytocin can even decrease cooperation <unk> . so based on these studies <unk> i could say oxytocin is an immoral. <unk> all over the headlines we see it in supermarkets on book covers what about the clinic . spect imaging is a <unk> brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain . for the bargain price of a few thousand dollars there are clinics. in the u s that will give you one of these spect scans. and use the image to help diagnose your problems these scans the clinics say can help prevent alzheimer 's disease <unk> . solve weight and addiction issues <unk> overcome marital conflicts and. treat of course a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to. this sounds great a lot of people agree some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business . there 's just one problem. <unk> the broad consensus in neuroscience is that we can 't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan <unk> . but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date <unk> many of them children. <unk> and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection so exposing people to radiation potentially harmful <unk> . i am more excited than most people as a neuroscientist about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness. and even maybe to make us better. <unk> and if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions <unk> count me in . but we 're not there yet . we haven 't found a buy button inside the brain . we can 't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans . and we can 't turn sinners into saints with hormones <unk> . maybe someday we will but until then we have to be. <unk> careful that we don 't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that 's playing a much longer game <unk> . so here 's where you come in if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it don 't just take them at their word <unk> . ask the tough questions <unk> ask to see the evidence ask for the part of the story that 's not being told. <unk> the answers shouldn 't be simple because the brain isn 't simple <unk> but that 's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.
