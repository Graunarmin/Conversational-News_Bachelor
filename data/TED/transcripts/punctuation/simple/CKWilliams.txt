 <unk> i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age i was. sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually the first one is dedicated to spencer. and his grandmother who was shocked by his work my poem is. <unk> called dirt . my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap <unk> . half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar . all because of a word i said not even said really only repeated but. <unk> i know now her life was hard she lost three children as babies then her husband died too leaving young sons and no money . she 'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet but oh her soap might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet . the street she lived on was unpaved. <unk> her flat two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me <unk> . dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again she lived to a hundred even then . all along it was the sadness the squalor but i never until now loved her again. <unk> when that was published in a magazine i got an irate letter from my uncle . you have maligned a great woman it took some. diplomacy <unk> this is called the dress it 's a longer poem . in those days those days. <unk> which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now <unk> . when often the first sound you 'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block . and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car having worked late again <unk> always late and going. <unk> heavily down to the cellar to the furnace to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed. in those long ago days women my mother <unk> my friends ' mothers our neighbors all the women i knew wore often much of the day what were called housedresses. <unk> shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and when you had to go look for a child hang wash on the line or run down <unk>. <unk> to the grocery store on the corner under a coat <unk> the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed dangling beneath . <unk> their hair in preparation for some great event a ball one would think that never came to pass . more than the way most women 's faces not only were never made up during the day but seemed scraped <unk> bleached and with their plucked eyebrows scarily masklike . more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding. adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access <unk> and boys no conception . only later would i see the dresses also as a proclamation that <unk>. in your dim kitchen your laundry your bleak concrete yard what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation your real sensual nature. <unk> veiled in those sexless vestments was utterly your dominion . in those days one hid much else as well grown men didn 't embrace one another <unk> unless someone had died and not always then you shook hands or at a ball game thumped your friend 's back. <unk> and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection . once out of childhood you 'd never again know the shock of your father 's whiskers on your cheek not until mores at last had evolved <unk> and <unk>. <unk> you could hug another man <unk> then hold on for a moment <unk> then even kiss . how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then . we knew so little in those days as little as now i suppose about healing those hurts. <unk> their best dresses with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices even in lipstick and mascara their hair aflow could only stand wringing <unk>. <unk> their hands begging for peace <unk> while father and son like thugs like thieves like romans <unk> simmered and hissed and hated <unk> . <unk> through the kiss and embrace <unk> bleeding from brother to brother into the generations . in those days there was still countryside close to the city <unk> farms <unk> cornfields cows even not far from our building with its <unk>. <unk> blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests . empty lot into the bushes like a creature of leaves you 'd lurk <unk> crouched crawling <unk> simplified savage alone . already there was wanting to be simpler wanting when they called you never to go back. <unk> this is another longish one about the old and the young <unk> it actually happened right at the time we met part of the poem takes place. in space we shared and time we shared it 's called the neighbor. <unk> her five horrid <unk> deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window <unk> . her cats <unk> god knows how many who must piss on her rugs her landing 's a sickening reek <unk> . her shadow once fumbling the chain on her door then the door slamming fearfully. <unk> only the barking and the music jazz filtering as it does day and night into the hall <unk> . the time it was chris connor singing lush life . how it brought back my college sweetheart my first real love <unk> who till i left her played the same record and head on my. <unk> shoulder hand on my thigh <unk> sang sweetly along of regrets and depletions she was too. <unk> young for as i was too young later to believe in her pain it startled then bored then repelled me . my starting to fancy she 'd ended up in this fire trap in the village that my neighbor was her <unk> my thinking we 'd meet <unk> recognize one another <unk> become friends that i 'd accomplish a penance <unk> . my seeing her. it wasn 't her . at the mailbox gray yellow hair army pants under a nightgown her turning away <unk> hiding her ravaged face in her hands muttering an inappropriate hi . sometimes there are frightening goings on in the stairwell a man shouting. <unk> the dogs frantically snarling claws scrabbling <unk> then her her voice hoarse <unk> harsh hollow <unk> almost only a tone <unk> incoherent <unk>. <unk> a note <unk> a squawk <unk> bone on metal metal gone molten calling them back come back darlings <unk> come back dear ones my sweet angels come back . <unk> on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape <unk> passersby flowing around her her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream <unk>. <unk> silently though as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted <unk> a cry so pure <unk> practiced

the step to the street droning not looking at me can you help me . taking my arm <unk> leaning lightly against me <unk> . her wavering step into the world her whispering. <unk> wouldn 't it be nice i think <unk> when the. <unk> in the doctor 's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts just a little and violently blushes . wouldn 't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before. <unk> for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence because not an hour ago while we were on our walk my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking . and that brought back to me the stable i worked on weekends when i was twelve and a splendid piebald stallion who whenever he was mounted would buck just like. <unk> though more hugely of course enormous gleaming <unk> resplendent <unk> and the woman her face abashedly buried in her elle now <unk> reminded me

pugnaciously <unk>. <unk> wrathfully even when her bottle was empty . <unk> some repressed part of myself would go out of control and i 'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench . not excrement merely not merely surface and orifice going unwashed rediffusion of rum there was will in it and intention power and. <unk> ethical rage and rebellion. despair too though grief loss <unk> . sometimes i 'd think i should take her home with me <unk> bathe her <unk> comfort her dress her she wouldn 't have wanted me to i would think <unk> . instead i 'd step into my train how rich i would think is the lexicon of our <unk>. how enduring our bland fatal assurance that reflection. is righteousness being accomplished <unk> . the dance of our glances <unk> the clash pulling each other

smiling <unk> farther and farther though it takes less time than this really an instant and lets herself fall . herself fall <unk> . a casual impulse a fancy never thought of until now hardly thought of even now no more than impulse or fancy <unk> the girl knows what she 's doing the girl. <unk> means something the girl means to mean because it occurs to her in that instant that beautiful or not bright yes or no <unk> she 's not who <unk>. <unk> she is <unk> she 's not the person she is <unk> and the reason she suddenly knows . <unk> is <unk> it 's not her or not wholly her <unk> it 's a self

i desire and what i achieve <unk> . and the girl remembers in this infinite instant already now so many times divided. <unk> the sadness she felt once hardly knowing she felt it . to merely inhabit herself yes <unk> the girl falls absurd to fall <unk> even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that <unk>. <unk> falls must know that falling is absurd yet the girl falling isn 't myself or she is myself but a self i took of my own volition unto. <unk> read just one more i don 't usually say that i like to just end but i 'm afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me <unk>. <unk> says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand . but forget her breasts a lush fresh lipped blond skin glowing gold sprawls there resplendent
