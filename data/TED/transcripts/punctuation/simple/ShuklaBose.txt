 <unk> to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service. <unk> neither am i a veteran social worker i was twenty six years in the corporate world trying to make organizations profitable <unk> and then in two thousand and three. i started parikrma humanity foundation from my kitchen table the first thing that we did was walk through the slums. in bangalore who live in eight hundred slums <unk> we couldn 't go to all the. slums but we tried to cover as much as we could we walked through these slums <unk> identified houses. where children would never go to school <unk> we talked to the parents tried to convince them. about sending their children to school <unk> we played with the children and came. <unk> back home really tired exhausted but with images of bright faces twinkling eyes <unk> and. went to sleep we were all excited to start <unk> but. the numbers hit us then two hundred million children between four to fourteen that should be going to school but do not. <unk> million children who go to school but cannot read one hundred and twenty five million who cannot. do basic maths <unk> . we also heard that two hundred and fifty billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling <unk> ninety percent of it was spent on <unk>. teachers ' salary and administrators ' salary and yet india has nearly the. the highest teacher absenteeism in the in the world . with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year . those numbers were absolutely <unk>. overwhelming <unk> and we were constantly asked when will you start how many schools will you start. <unk> children will you get how are you going to scale how are you going to replicate . it was very difficult not to get scared not to get daunted <unk> but we dug our heels and said we 're not in the number game <unk> . we want to take one child at a time. and take the child right through school <unk> sent to college <unk> and get them. <unk> we started. parikrma the first parikrma school started in a slum. where there were seventy thousand people living. below the poverty line <unk> our first school was on a rooftop. of a building inside the slums a second story building the only second story building inside the. <unk> slums and that rooftop did not have. any ceiling only half a tin sheet . that was our first school one hundred sixty five children . indian academic year begins in june so june it rains so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof . waiting for the rain to stop my god what a bonding. <unk> exercise that was and all of us that were under that roof are still here together today . then came the second school the third school <unk> the fourth school and a junior college . in six years now we have four schools . <unk> very simple to send each of these kids get them prepared to be educated but also to live. peacefully contented in this. you have to talk english . and so all our schools are english medium schools <unk> but they know there is this myth that children from the slums. cannot speak english well no one in their family has spoken english no one in their generation has spoken english . <unk> i like those books because they have something special in them the vocabulary used in those. <unk> i mean like once i pick up one book i cannot put it down until i finish the whole book <unk> even if it takes me four and a half hours. <unk> girl that you saw. her father sells flowers on the roadside <unk> . and this little boy has been coming to school for five years but isn 't it strange that little boys all. <unk> he hasn 't seen one he hasn 't ridden one of course <unk> but he has done a lot of research through google search . you know <unk> when we started with our english medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible . the icse curriculum . and again there were people who laughed at me and said don 't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students they 'll never be able to. <unk> cope . not only do our children cope very well <unk> but they excel in it you should just come across to see how well our children do . there is also this myth that parents from. the slums are not interested in their children going to school <unk> they 'd much rather put them to work that 's absolute hogwash all parents all over the world. want their children to lead a better life than themselves <unk> but they need to believe that change is possible. <unk> we have eighty percent attendance for all our. <unk> meeting sometimes it 's even one hundred percent much more than many privileged schools <unk> fathers have started to attend it 's very interesting when we started our <unk>. the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register now they have started. writing their signature the children have taught them it 's amazing how much children can teach. <unk> we have a few months ago actually late last year we had a few mothers who came to us and said . you know we want to learn how to read and write can you teach us so we started an afterschool for our parents for our mothers we had twenty five mothers who came regularly after school to. <unk> we want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools <unk>. ninety eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics so you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from <unk> . we have to send the fathers to de addiction labs. and when they come back most times sober <unk> we have to find. a job for them so that they don 't regress <unk> we have about three. <unk> three fathers who have been trained to cook we have. taught them nutrition <unk> hygiene <unk> we have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children they. do a very good job because. their children are eating their food <unk> but most importantly this is the first. <unk> they have got respect and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile more than ninety percent of. <unk> staff are all parents and extended families we 've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. <unk> vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming. <unk> there is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream . take a look at this little girl who was one of the twenty eight children. from all privileged schools best schools in the country that was selected for the duke university talent identification program and was sent to iim ahmedabad. <unk> it was such a pride for us. <unk> even now we are in touch through facebook <unk> after this ahmedabad trip i 've been. <unk> i don 't even mingle or start speaking with someone so. <unk> working as a maid before she came to school <unk> and today she wants to be a neurologist <unk>. <unk> our children are doing brilliantly in sports. <unk> they are really excelling there is an <unk> inter school athletic competition that is held every year every year. in bangalore where five thousand children participate. from one hundred and forty best schools in the city. we 've got the best school award for three years successively <unk> and our children are coming back home with bags full of medals. <unk> lots of admirers and friends. last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school <unk> we also have. our very own dream team <unk> . why is this happening why this confidence is it the exposure <unk> we have. professors from mit. <unk> institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas <unk> experiments much beyond the classroom art music. are considered. therapy and mediums of expression <unk> we also believe that it 's the content. <unk> not the toilets not the libraries but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. <unk> creating an environment of learning of inquiry of exploration is what is true education <unk>. when we started parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking . we didn 't hire mckinsey to do a business plan. <unk> but. we we know for sure that what we want to do today is is take one child at a time not get bogged with numbers and actually see the child complete. the circle of life and unleash his total. <unk> we do not believe in scale because we believe in quality and scale and numbers will automatically happen <unk> . we have corporates that have stood behind us and we are able to now open more schools <unk> but we began with the idea of one child at a time . this is <unk> five year old parusharam he was begging. by a bus stop a few years ago got picked up and. <unk> is now in an orphanage has been coming to school for the last four and a half months he 's in kindergarten <unk> he has learned how to speak english we have a model by which. kids can speak english and understand english in three month 's time he can tell you stories in english of the thirsty. <unk> of the crocodile and of the giraffe <unk> and if you ask him. what he likes to do he will say i like sleeping <unk> i like eating <unk> i like playing and if you ask him what he wants to do he will say i want to horsing . now horsing is going for a horse ride so. <unk> parusharam. comes to my office every day he comes for a tummy rub because he believes that will give me luck. <unk> began with the idea of.
