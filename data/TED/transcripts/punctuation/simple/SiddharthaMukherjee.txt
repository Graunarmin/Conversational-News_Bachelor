 <unk> i want to talk to you about. the future of medicine but before i do that i want to talk a little bit about the past now <unk> throughout. much of the recent history of medicine we 've thought about illness and treatment. in terms of a profoundly. profoundly simple model <unk> in fact the model is so simple. that you could summarize it in six words have disease take pill <unk> kill something <unk> . now <unk> the reason for the dominance of this model. is of course the antibiotic revolution <unk>. <unk> many of you might not know this but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the united states but what you do know. is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative <unk> here you had. a chemical either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory <unk> and it would course through your body it would. <unk> its target lock into its target a microbe or some part of a microbe and then turn off a lock and a key. with exquisite deftness exquisite specificity <unk> . and you would end up taking a previously fatal lethal disease a pneumonia <unk> syphilis <unk> . tuberculosis and transforming that into a curable or treatable illness . you have a pneumonia. <unk> penicillin <unk> you kill the microbe and you cure the disease <unk> so seductive. was this idea <unk> so potent. the metaphor of lock and key and killing something that it really swept through biology it was a transformation like no other <unk> . and we 've really spent the last one hundred years. trying to replicate that model over and over again. in noninfectious diseases in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease <unk> and it 's worked <unk> but it 's only worked. partly <unk> let me show you <unk> you know <unk> if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body every chemical. <unk> that your body is capable of . most people think that that number is on the order of a million let 's call it a million <unk> . and now you ask the question what number or fraction of reactions can actually be targeted. by the entire pharmacopoeia all of medicinal chemistry that number is two hundred and fifty <unk> . the rest is chemical darkness <unk> in other words. <unk> zero point zero two five percent of all chemical reactions in your body are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism <unk> . you know if you think about. human physiology as a vast. global telephone network with interacting. nodes and interacting pieces . then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge the outer edge of that network. <unk> like. all of our pharmaceutical chemistry is a pole operator in. wichita <unk> kansas who is tinkering with about ten or fifteen telephone lines. so what do we do about this idea <unk> what if we reorganized this approach <unk> . in fact it turns out that the natural world gives us a sense of how one. <unk> one might think about illness in a radically different way <unk> rather than disease medicine <unk> target <unk> . in fact the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards not downwards but upwards <unk> and we begin. with a. <unk> and these organs coalesce to form things called humans <unk> and these organisms ultimately live. in environments <unk> which are partly self regulating and partly. what 's nice about this scheme this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards is that it allows us to think. <unk> about illness as well. in a somewhat different way <unk> take a disease like cancer <unk> . since the 1950s we 've tried rather desperately. to apply this lock and key model to cancer <unk> we 've tried to. kill cells using a variety of. chemotherapies or targeted therapies <unk> and as most of us know that 's worked. <unk> for diseases like leukemia it 's worked for some forms of breast cancer <unk> but eventually you run. to the ceiling of that approach <unk> and it 's only in the last ten years or so that we 've begun to think about using the immune system <unk> . remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn 't grow in a vacuum it actually grows in a human organism and could you use the. <unk> the fact that human beings have an immune system to attack cancer in fact it 's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer <unk> . and finally there 's the level of the environment isn 't there . you know we don 't think of cancer as altering the environment but let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment. it 's called a prison <unk> you take. loneliness you take depression you take confinement and you add to that. rolled up in a little white sheet of paper . one of the most potent neurostimulants that we know <unk> called nicotine and you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know <unk> . and you have a <unk>. <unk> environment <unk> but you can have anti carcinogenic environments too there are attempts to. <unk> change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer for instance <unk> we 're trying to change the metabolic milieu. for other forms of cancer or take another disease like depression <unk> again <unk> working upwards <unk> since the <unk>. <unk> we 've tried again desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells serotonin <unk> . dopamine and tried to cure depression that way and that 's worked <unk> . <unk> and we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ the brain <unk> rewire it remodel it . and that of course we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines pills . really is much more effective than either one alone. can we imagine. a more immersive environment that will change depression can you. lock out the signals that elicit depression <unk> again <unk> moving upwards. along this hierarchical chain of organization what 's really at stake perhaps here. is not the medicine itself but a metaphor <unk> rather than killing something <unk> in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases. kidney failure. <unk> maybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something <unk> and that 's the key perhaps to reframing our thinking about medicine now this idea. of changing . of creating a perceptual shift as it were came home to me to roost in a very very personal manner about ten years ago about ten years ago i 've been a runner most of my life i went. <unk> saturday morning run i came back and woke up and i basically couldn 't move my right knee was swollen up and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone . and one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own mris and. i had an mri the next week <unk> and it looked like that essentially the meniscus of cartilage. that is between bone had been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered now <unk> if you 're looking at me. <unk> feeling sorry let me tell you a few facts if i was to take an mri of every person in this audience . sixty percent of you would show signs of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this eighty five percent of all women. by the age of seventy would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration . fifty to sixty percent of the men in this audience would also have such signs so this is a very common disease well <unk> the second. <unk> perk of being a physician is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments <unk> so about ten years ago we began we brought this process into the laboratory <unk> . and we began to do simple experiments mechanically trying to fix this degeneration we tried to inject. chemicals into the knee spaces of animals to try to reverse. cartilage degeneration and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process. <unk> essentially it came to naught <unk> nothing happened . and then about seven years ago we had a research student from australia <unk> the nice thing about australians is that they 're habitually used to looking at the world upside down . and so. dan dan suggested to me you know maybe it isn 't a mechanical problem maybe it isn 't a chemical problem. <unk> it 's a stem cell problem . in other words he had two hypotheses number one there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton <unk>. bone cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton just like there 's a stem cell in blood just like there 's a stem cell in the nervous system and two that maybe that the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what 's causing. <unk> we looking for a pill when we should have really been looking for a cell <unk> . so we switched our models <unk> and now we began to look for skeletal stem cells <unk> . and to cut again a long story short about five years ago we found these cells <unk> . they live inside the skeleton here 's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them the white stuff is bone and these red. <unk> columns that you see and the yellow cells are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell columns of cartilage <unk> columns of bone coming out of a single cell . these cells are fascinating they have four properties <unk> . number one. is that they live where they 're expected to live they live just underneath the surface of the bone underneath cartilage you know in biology it 's location location location. <unk> appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage that 's one here 's an interesting property you can take them out. of the vertebrate skeleton <unk> you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory <unk> and they are dying to form cartilage remember how we couldn 't form cartilage for love or money these cells are dying to form cartilage they form their own furls of cartilage around themselves <unk> . <unk> number three the most efficient repairers of fractures that we 've ever encountered this is a little bone a mouse bone that we fractured. and then let it heal by itself these stem cells have come in and repaired in yellow the bone in white the cartilage almost completely . so much so that if you label them. with a fluorescent dye you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue coming into the area of a fracture. <unk> fixing it locally and then stopping their work now <unk> the fourth one is the most ominous and that is that their numbers. decline precipitously <unk> precipitously <unk> tenfold <unk> fiftyfold as you age <unk> . and so what had happened really is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift <unk> . we had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories <unk> and in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea cells. <unk> environments because we were now thinking about bone stem cells we were thinking about arthritis in terms of. a cellular disease <unk> . and then the next question was are there organs can you build this as an organ outside the body can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma <unk> . and perhaps most interestingly <unk> can you ascend right up and create. <unk> we know that exercise remodels bone but come on none of us is going to exercise so could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone. so that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage <unk> and perhaps more interesting and more importantly the question is can you apply this model more globally outside medicine what 's at stake as i said before is not. <unk> but growing something <unk> and it raises a series of i think some of the most interesting questions. about how we think about medicine in the future could your medicine be a cell. and not a pill <unk> . how would we grow these cells what we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells we heard about the problems of unleashing growth . <unk> implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing . could your medicine be an organ that 's created outside the body and then implanted into the body <unk> could that stop some of the degeneration . what if the organ needed to have memory. in cases of of diseases of of the nervous system. some of those organs had memory <unk> how could we implant those memories back in could we store these organs would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being and put back. <unk> and perhaps. most puzzlingly could your medicine be an environment <unk> . could you patent an environment <unk> you know. in every culture <unk> shamans have been using environments as medicines <unk> could we imagine that for our future i. 've talked a lot about models i began this talk with models so let me end with some thoughts about model building that 's what we do as. <unk> scientists you know <unk> when an architect. builds a model <unk> he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature <unk> . but when a scientist is building a model <unk> he or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor <unk> . he or she is trying to create a new way of seeing <unk> the former is a scale shift <unk> the latter is a perceptual shift. created such a perceptual shift. in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored distorted very successfully the way we 've thought about medicine for the last hundred years . but we need new models. to think about medicine in the future <unk> that 's what 's at stake <unk> you know there 's a popular trope. out there that the reason we haven 't had the transformative. impact on the treatment of illness is because we don 't have powerful enough drugs <unk> and that 's partly true <unk> . but perhaps the real reason is that we don 't have powerful enough ways of thinking about medicines <unk> . it 's certainly true that it would be lovely. to have. <unk> but perhaps what 's really at stake are three more intangible m 's mechanisms models <unk> . metaphors <unk> . thank you . chris anderson i really like this metaphor. how does it link in there 's a lot of talk. in. of medicine that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically your genome your current context. <unk> does that apply to this model you 've got here <unk>. we 've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics. <unk> that 's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor again to use that same word in medicine today. <unk> we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine but of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being as it were <unk> . that chain of being really the first organized unit of that is the cell so if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies. <unk> and then personalizing. organ or organismal therapies and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for for the environment so i think at every stage <unk> you know there 's that metaphor <unk> there 's turtles all the way <unk> well in this there 's personalization all the way ca so when you say. medicine could be a cell and not a pill. you 're talking about potentially your own cells sm absolutely ca so converted to stem cells perhaps tested against all kinds of. drugs or something and. <unk> 's no perhaps this is what we 're doing this is what 's happening and in fact <unk> . we 're slowly moving not away from genomics <unk> but incorporating genomics into what we call.
