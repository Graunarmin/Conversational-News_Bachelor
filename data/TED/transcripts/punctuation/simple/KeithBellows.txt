 <unk> the reason i put this up here is because when i was in africa. last year <unk> my wife and i were driving around we had this wonderful guide who showed us something. that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the. fascination that comes with the design of animals it turns out that in about the 1880s the missionaries came to africa. to spread the word of christianity to teach english to the natives <unk> and they brought blackboards and chalk and i 'd like you to imagine that. <unk> that 's a blackboard and i just used some chalk on there <unk> and. they brought quite a bit of this stuff but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk <unk> and. this is a real crisis for them <unk> and. that 's where the hyena comes in the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. <unk> enables the hyena to essentially. eat bones now <unk> the end product of that action. is up on the board here what the missionaries would do is they 'd walk around. and they 'd pick up hyena shit <unk> and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great. <unk> not what i 'm here to talk about but it is. a fascinating. aspect of animal design what i 'm here to talk about is the camel <unk> when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about . i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel . and we were in the desert. in a small jeep there were four of us two bedouin drivers <unk>. you can just imagine this expanse is <unk> an ocean of sand one hundred and five degrees one water bottle <unk> . and we were driving. in what they told us was their very very best jeep didn 't look like it to me and as we started to. <unk> go through the desert. <unk> the jeep broke down the guys got out they put the hood up they started working under the hood . got it going again about a hundred yards it broke down this went on about <unk> 6 7 times we were getting more and more alarmed we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert <unk> and. eventually <unk> our worst nightmare happened they flooded the engine <unk> and they said ah no problem <unk> we just get out and walk. <unk> and sure enough about half a mile we came over the crest of this hill and there was a huge gathering of bedouin with their camels the guy went up and started. dickering and ten dollars later we had four camels <unk> they went down like elevators <unk> we got on them <unk> they went back up and the bedouin. <unk> got behind each of the camels with a little whip <unk> and. they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping and if you 've ever been on a camel it is a very very uncomfortable ride . there 's also one other aspect about these camels about every ten steps <unk> they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg . so we kept on going and this camel camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. <unk> and eventually three miles later we arrived at our destination where a jeep was supposed to meet us <unk> and the camels come down again like elevators <unk> . we sort of clumsily get off and they <unk> obviously try to take another chunk out of my leg <unk> and i 've developed a very. wonderful relationship with this creature by this point <unk> and i 've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch and. much meaner by the way than the bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell. <unk> think we want to be bringing a camel and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. <unk> so i did the next best thing . i went to the washington zoo <unk> richard said i want you to get up close and personal with this camel <unk> . i want you to inspect its mouth look at its teeth go underneath it go above it. go around it <unk> pull its tail up take a look in there <unk> i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can so i got a. national geographic film crew <unk> we went down there <unk> and. i took one look at this camel <unk> it is a two thousand pound creature who is. <unk> if you 've ever seen a two thousand pound camel in rut it is a scary scary thing to behold <unk> and if. richard thought i was getting in the ring with that camel <unk> someone was smoking bedouin high grade so we. got as close to it as possible and i 'm going to share this chris if you want to roll this film then i 'm going to show you a little bit. <unk> more about the design of camels. <unk> 're similar to seals in the way. <unk> what i didn 't show you. <unk> you got that swinging thing going <unk> well. and you 're glad i didn 't show you this one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design. is that its penis points backwards that way the camel can dip its tail in the in the stream <unk> and just whacker the entire. area around him and that 's how he really marks his territory <unk> now <unk> what you also didn 't see was that. and you may have noticed in the pen beside him. and by the way the camel 's name is suki. <unk> the pen beside him is jasmine jasmine has been his mate for some time but on this particular occasion it was very very clear. that. as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it <unk> and so we started thinking well <unk>. if poor old suki is in search of a mate <unk> what would suki. <unk> show you another film but before i do i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort <unk>. <unk> of the suv of the sand <unk> the ship of the desert it 's so vital <unk>. to to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found largely mongolia and sahara <unk> that there are one hundred and sixty words in arabic to describe. <unk> and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it 's certainly been like no committee i 've ever been on so. here 's here 's what suki would do in search of a mate can you roll it please. <unk> i just want to leave you with one last thought which is probably the most important thing to take away <unk> . <unk> the animal are pretty lucky creatures because by and large <unk> we really don 't have to. adapt to our environment we adapt our environment to us and we 've seen that repeatedly through this conference not just this year but in past years <unk> . but this creature that you 've just seen. ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting i think when you look at the animal kingdom that is one of the most remarkable things . it doesn 't have an environment that adapts to it <unk> it has to adapt to the environment . ricky thank you very much for.
