 <unk> everyone is interested in other people everyone has relationships with other people and they 're interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons <unk> good relationships bad relationships <unk> annoying relationships <unk> . <unk> and what i 'm going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship <unk> so i 'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we 're all interested in interacting with other people <unk> . i 'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features <unk> and i 'm going to turn that object that simplified object into a scientific probe <unk> . <unk> and provide the early stages embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact. but before i do that let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible . the first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity. <unk> without needles and radioactivity <unk> without any kind of clinical reason <unk> we can go down the street and record from your friends <unk> ' and neighbors <unk> ' brains while they do a variety <unk>. <unk> of cognitive tasks and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging . <unk> probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation let me give you a two sentence version of it <unk> so we 've all heard of. use magnetic fields and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain or your knee or your stomach <unk> grayscale images that are frozen in time . in the <unk> 1990s it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode <unk> and in that mode you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds. <unk> of thousands of sites independently in the brain <unk> . okay so what in fact the so what is in the brain changes in neural activity <unk> the things that make your brain work the things that make your software work in your brain are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow . you make a blood flow movie you have an independent proxy of brain activity this has literally revolutionized cognitive science take any cognitive domain you want memory motor planning thinking about your. getting angry at people <unk> emotional response it goes on and on . put people into functional mri devices . and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity it 's in its early stages and it 's crude by some measures <unk> but in fact <unk> twenty years ago we were at nothing <unk> . you couldn 't do people like this you couldn 't do healthy people <unk> . that 's caused a literal revolution <unk> and it 's opened us up to a new experimental preparation neurobiologists as you well know. <unk> have lots of experimental preps worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this and now we have a new experimental prep . human beings <unk> we can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings and we have a few burgeoning biological measures <unk> . okay <unk> let me give you one example. <unk> of the kinds of experiments that people do <unk> and it 's in the area of what you 'd call valuation . valuation is just what you think it is you know if you went and you were valuing two companies against one another you 'd want to know which was more valuable . cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago if you want to compare oranges to windshields what do you do well you can 't compare oranges to windshields <unk>. they 're immiscible they don 't mix with one another so instead you convert them to a common currency scale put them on that scale <unk> and value them accordingly well. <unk> something just like that as well <unk> and we 're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation <unk> and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system. whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain . i won 't go through the details of it <unk> but that 's an important discovery <unk> and we know a good bit about that now. 's just a small piece of it <unk> but it 's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had parkinson 's disease <unk> . and they 're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse <unk> and that makes sense drugs of abuse would come in and they would change the way you value the world they change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice <unk> . and they make you value that over everything else here 's the key feature though . these neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas and i put some symbols up here that we assign value to. for various reasons. we have a behavioral superpower in our brain <unk> and it at least in part involves dopamine we can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea . for a mere idea no other species can do that in one. thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the cult heaven 's gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship. hiding in the tail of the then visible comet <unk> hale bopp waiting to take them to the next level it was. <unk> it was an incredibly tragic event <unk> more than two thirds of them had college degrees <unk> but the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival. using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive <unk> that 's a lot of control . okay <unk> one thing that i 've left out of this narrative is the obvious thing which is the focus of the. <unk> little talk and that is other people <unk> these same valuation systems are redeployed when we 're valuing interactions with other people <unk> . so this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs . that makes you freeze when you get parkinson 's disease that contributes to various forms of psychosis . is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you 're interacting with. <unk> let me give you an example of this . you bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it let. me just give you a few examples so here 's a baby she 's three months old she still poops in her diapers and she can 't do calculus . she 's related to me somebody will be very glad that she 's up here on the screen you can cover up one of her eyes and you can still read something in the other eye <unk> and i see sort of curiosity in one eye <unk> i see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other . here 's a couple they 're sharing a moment together. <unk> and we 've even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that they 're sharing it they 're sharing it sort of in parallel now the elements of the scene also communicate this to us <unk> but <unk>. <unk> you can read it straight off their faces and if you compare their faces to normal faces it would be a very subtle cue <unk> . and i 'm thinking i 'm not seeing love and admiration on the left . in fact i know this is his sister and you can just see him saying okay we 're doing this for the camera <unk> . and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face he 'll. kill me for showing. <unk> so what does this mean <unk> it means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem <unk> it engages deep systems in our brain in. dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex food and salt they keep you alive . it gives them the pie it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we 've called a superpower so how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe. <unk> and the short answer is games . economic games <unk> so what we do is we go into two areas . one area is called experimental economics the other area is called behavioral economics <unk> and we steal their games <unk> . and we contrive them to our own purposes so this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game . red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue . let 's say red wants to keep seventy <unk> and offers blue thirty so he offers a 70 30 split with blue . control passes to blue and blue says. <unk> in which case he 'd get the money <unk> or blue says i reject it in which case no one gets anything <unk> okay <unk> so. a rational choice economist would say well <unk> you should take all non zero offers what do people do people are indifferent at an 80 20 split . at 80 20 it 's a coin flip whether you accept that or not why is that you know because you 're pissed off you 're mad that 's an unfair offer and you know what an unfair. <unk> offer is this is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world <unk> that just gives you an example of the kind of thing that that. these games probe <unk> . the interesting thing is these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line <unk> you have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person <unk> . you have to be able to remember what you 've done you have to stand up in the moment to do that then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back and you have to do. <unk> something that. is interesting which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay <unk> that is you have to decide what that other person expects of you you have to send signals to manage your image in their mind like a job interview <unk> . you sit across the desk from somebody they have some prior image of you you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place. <unk> place where you want it to be we. 're so good at this we don 't really even notice it <unk> these kinds of probes exploit it <unk> okay <unk> . in doing this what we 've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges canaries used to be used. as kind of biosensors in mines when methane built up or carbon dioxide built up or oxygen. was diminished the birds would swoon before people would so it acted as an early warning system hey get out of the mine things aren 't going so well. come to the table and even these very blunt staged social interactions <unk> and they and there 's just numbers going back and forth between the people . and they bring enormous sensitivities to it so we realized we could exploit this and in fact as we 've done that and we 've done this now in many thousands of people i think on the order of <unk>. five or six thousand <unk> we actually to make this a biological probe need bigger numbers than that remarkably so. patterns have emerged <unk> and we 've been able to take those patterns convert them into mathematical models. <unk> and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges <unk> okay so what well the so what is that 's a really nice behavioral measure <unk> the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play we can compute that during the game <unk> . and we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior. <unk> here 's the cool thing. <unk> six or seven years ago we developed a team <unk> it was at the time in houston texas it 's now in virginia and london <unk> . and we built software that 'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices. up over the internet. i guess we 've done up to six machines at a time but let 's just focus on two so it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world <unk> we synchronize the machines set them. <unk> these staged social interactions and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains so for the first time we don 't have to look at just averages over single individuals. or have individuals playing computers or try to make inferences that way we can study individual dyads we can study the way that one person interacts with another person . turn the numbers up and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal. <unk> but more importantly <unk> we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses or brain damage into these social interactions and use these as probes of that . so we 've started this effort we 've made a few hits a few i think embryonic discoveries we think there 's a future to this <unk> but it 's our way of going in and redefining with a new lexicon . a mathematical one actually <unk> as opposed to. the standard ways that we think about mental illness <unk> characterizing these diseases by using the people. <unk> as birds in the exchanges <unk> that is we exploit the fact that the healthy partner playing somebody with major depression or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder <unk> or <unk>. <unk> playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder we use that as a kind of biosensor <unk> and then we use computer programs to model that person <unk> and it gives us a kind of assay of this . <unk> here are a few of our collaborating sites the hub ironically enough is centered in little roanoke virginia . there 's another hub in london now and the rest are getting set up. <unk> we hope to give the data away at some stage <unk> that 's a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world. <unk> but we 're also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings and so i would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software or even for guidance on how to move forward with that. <unk> to gain new insights into.
