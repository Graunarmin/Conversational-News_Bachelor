 <unk> let me show you something. <unk> describing what she sees in a series of photos . she might still have a lot to learn about this world <unk> but she 's already an expert at one very important task . to make sense of what she sees . our society is more technologically advanced than ever we send people. <unk> to the moon <unk> we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like . yet our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task <unk> . so i 'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision . one of the most frontier and. <unk> potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science <unk> . yes <unk> we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves <unk> . but without smart vision . they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road <unk> which can be run over and a rock that size <unk> which should be avoided <unk> . we have made fabulous megapixel cameras. <unk> we have not delivered sight to the blind <unk> . drones can fly over massive land but don 't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests . security cameras are everywhere <unk> but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool. <unk> photos and videos. are becoming an integral part of global life they 're being generated at a pace that 's far beyond what any human or teams of humans could hope to view and you and i are contributing to that at this ted <unk> . yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous. <unk> so in other words <unk> collectively as a society <unk> . we 're very much blind <unk> because our smartest machines are still blind . why is this so hard you may ask . cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two dimensional array of numbers known as pixels <unk> . but these are just lifeless numbers they do not carry meaning in themselves. <unk> just like to hear is not the same as to listen to take pictures is not the same as to see <unk> . and by seeing we really mean understanding . in fact it took mother nature five hundred and forty million years of hard work to do. <unk> and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains not the eyes themselves <unk> . so vision begins with the eyes <unk> but it truly takes place in the brain <unk> . so for fifteen years now starting from my ph d at caltech and then leading stanford 's vision lab . i 've been working with my mentors. <unk> students to teach computers to see . our research field is called computer vision and machine learning it 's part of the general field of artificial intelligence <unk> . so ultimately <unk> we want to teach the machines to see just like we do <unk> naming objects <unk> . <unk> geometry of things understanding relations <unk> emotions actions and intentions . you and i weave together entire stories of people <unk> places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them . the first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects <unk> the building block of the visual world . in its simplest terms. <unk> imagine this teaching process as showing the computers some training images of a particular object let 's say cats <unk> . and designing a model that learns from these training images . how hard can this be . after all a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors . and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling we 'd tell the computer algorithm. in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face a chubby body two pointy ears and a long tail <unk> and that looked all fine <unk> . but what about this cat it. 's all curled up now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model <unk> . but what if cats are hidden <unk> . what about these silly cats. now you get my point . even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model and. that 's just one object <unk> . so about eight years ago <unk> a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking . no one tells a child. <unk> how to see <unk> especially in the early years <unk> they learn this through real world experiences and examples <unk> . if you consider a child 's eyes as a pair of biological cameras <unk> . they take one picture about every two hundred milliseconds <unk> the average time an eye movement is made. <unk> so by age three a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world . that 's a lot of training examples <unk> . so instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms my insight. was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences. <unk> we know this we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images. than we have ever had before perhaps thousands of times more . and together with professor kai li at princeton university we launched the <unk> imagenet project in two thousand and seven <unk>. <unk> we didn 't have to mount a camera on our head and wait for many years <unk> we went to the internet . the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created <unk> . we downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the amazon mechanical turk platform to help us to label these images . at its peak. <unk> was one of the biggest employers of the amazon mechanical turk workers . together <unk> almost fifty thousand workers from one hundred <unk> and sixty seven countries around the world helped us to clean <unk> sort <unk>. and label nearly a billion candidate images . takes in in the early developmental years . in hindsight this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now <unk> . but back in two thousand and seven <unk> it was not so obvious we were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while . some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure. we were constantly struggling for research funding once. i even joked to my graduate students that i would just reopen my dry cleaner 's shop to fund imagenet after all that 's how i funded my college years <unk> . so we carried on in two thousand and nine the imagenet project delivered. a database of fifteen million images. across twenty two thousand classes of objects and things. organized by everyday english words in both quantity and quality <unk> this was an unprecedented scale . as an example in the case of cats <unk> we have more <unk> than sixty two thousand cats of all kinds of looks and poses. <unk> and across all species of domestic and wild cats <unk> we were thrilled to have put together <unk>. wanted the whole research world to benefit from it . so in the ted fashion we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free. <unk> now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain <unk> . we 're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves <unk> . as it turned out <unk> . the wealth of information provided by <unk> imagenet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called. <unk> just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons <unk> . a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron like node it takes input from other nodes. <unk> these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers also similar to the brain . in a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model <unk> it has twenty four million nodes one hundred and forty million parameters and fifteen. <unk> to train such a humongous model the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected <unk> . it became the winning architecture. to generate exciting new results in object recognition this is a computer. <unk> us this picture contains a cat. and where the cat is of course there are more things than cats <unk> so here 's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear <unk> . a dog <unk> a person and a small kite in the background <unk> or a picture of very busy things like a man a skateboard. <unk> sometimes when the computer is not so confident about what it sees <unk> . we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much just like we would do <unk> . but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are like the make model <unk> year of the cars. we applied this algorithm to millions of google street view images across hundreds of american cities <unk> . and we have learned something really interesting . first it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household. <unk> but surprisingly car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities <unk> . or voting patterns by zip codes <unk> . so wait a minute is that it has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities . not so fast <unk> . so far <unk> we have just taught the computer to see objects this is like a small. <unk> child learning to utter a few nouns <unk> it 's an incredible accomplishment but it 's only the first step <unk> . soon another developmental milestone will be hit and children begin to communicate in sentences <unk> . so instead of saying this is a cat in the picture you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed. <unk> so to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences <unk> . the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm has to take another step <unk> . now the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by. <unk> like the brain integrates vision and language we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences . about four months ago <unk> we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models. that is capable of generating a. when it sees a picture for the first time <unk> . now i 'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk. of course we 're still working hard to improve our algorithms and it still has a lot to learn . and the computer still makes mistakes. <unk> it thinks everything might look like a cat. <unk> the stunning beauty of nature like you and i do <unk> . so it has been a long journey . to get from age zero to three was hard . the real challenge is to go from three to thirteen and far beyond let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the. <unk> but there 's so much more to this picture than just a person and a cake . what the computer doesn 't see is that this is a special italian cake that 's only served during easter. <unk> given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to sydney . and you and i can all tell how happy he is and what 's exactly on his mind at that moment . this is my son leo . on my quest for visual intelligence i think of leo constantly and the future world he will live in . when machines can see doctors. and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients . cars will run smarter and safer on the road <unk> . robots not just humans will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded <unk> . we will discover new species better materials and. <unk> explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines . little by little <unk> we 're giving sight to the machines first we teach them to see <unk> . then they help us to see better . for the first time human eyes won 't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world we. will not only use the machines for their intelligence. we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine . this is my quest to give computers visual intelligence. and to create a better future for leo and for the world <unk> thank you.
