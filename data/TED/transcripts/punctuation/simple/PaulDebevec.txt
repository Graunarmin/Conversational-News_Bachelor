 biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo real digital human face and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that unlike. aliens and dinosaurs we look at human faces every day they are. <unk> important to how we communicate with each other as a result <unk> we 're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering . in order to believe whether these things are realistic <unk> and what i 'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably <unk>. <unk> face using some computer graphics technology we 've developed <unk> and also some collaborators at a company called image metrics and we 're going to try to do a photo real face of an actress named emily o 'brien who is right there <unk> and that 's actually a completely. <unk> by the end of the talk we 're going to see it move . the way that we did this is we tried to start with emily herself who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in marina del rey <unk> and sit for a session in light stage five this is a. face scanning sphere with one hundred and <unk> fifty six white leds all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions and the lighting that we use these days looks something like this we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds. and we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face and different principle directions of light from the light stage to figure out both <unk>. <unk> the coarse scale and the <unk> fine scale detail of her face if we zoom in on this photograph right here we can see it 's a really nice photograph to have of her because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the. same time to get a nice image of her facial texture and in addition <unk> we 've actually used polarizers on all the lights just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road polarizers <unk>. <unk> can block the shine off of the skin so we don 't get all those specular reflections to take this map now if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in <unk> and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point. <unk> just the shine off of emily 's skin i don 't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this <unk> and. this is very important light to capture <unk> because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin it doesn 't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out and as a result it 's a very good <unk>. <unk> cue to the detailed shape of the skin pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have the things that actually make us look like real humans <unk> so if we. <unk> use information that comes off of this specular reflection <unk> . we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore <unk>. <unk> structure and fine wrinkles and even more importantly since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture <unk> we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon in many different facial poses and. <unk> expressions <unk> so here you can see her moving her eyes around moving her mouth around and these we 're actually going to use to create a photo real digital character <unk> if you take a look at these scans that we have of emily <unk>. <unk> you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions <unk> you can see things. <unk> all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs you can see that. the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores. to the regular skin texture <unk> you can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there you can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that . in addition to this kind of high resolution geometry <unk>. since it 's all captured with cameras we 've got a great texture map to use for the face and by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination the red and the green and the blue <unk> diffuse the light differently <unk> we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer then instead of looking like a. plaster mannequin it actually looks like it 's made out of living human flesh <unk> and this is what we used to give to the company image metrics to create a rigged <unk> . <unk> version of emily we 're just seeing the coarse scale geometry here but they basically created a digital puppet of her where you can pull on these various strings <unk> and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely <unk>. <unk> consistent with the scans that we took and in addition to the coarse scale geometry <unk> they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called displacement maps that animate as well . these are the displacement maps here and you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates <unk> so the next process was then to animate her we actually. <unk> used one of her own performances to provide the source data <unk> so by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer generated performance <unk>. so what you 're going to see now <unk> after this is a completely photo real digital face we can turn the volume up a little bit if that 's available emily image metrics is a markerless <unk> performance driven animation company <unk> . <unk> image metrics is a markerless performance driven animation company. we specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films paul debevec . so if we break that down into layers here 's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide here is the specular component animating you can see all the wrinkles happening there <unk> . and there is the underlying wireframe. <unk> and that is emily herself.
