 <unk> mobile phone. gives you individual freedom . with a mobile phone <unk> you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria . with a mobile phone you can. tweet a message and start a. protest in egypt . with a mobile phone you can record a song <unk> load it up to soundcloud and become famous . all this is possible with your mobile phone <unk> . i 'm a child of one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and. i live in the city of berlin let 's go back to that. <unk> to this city . here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change . this is autumn one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine . and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change. had a mobile phone in their pocket <unk> who in the room has a mobile phone with you hold it up <unk> hold your phones up hold your phones up. <unk> hold it up an android a blackberry <unk> wow that 's a lot almost everybody today has a mobile phone <unk> but. today i will talk about me and my mobile phone <unk> and how it changed my life <unk> and. i will talk about. <unk> eight hundred and thirty lines of information <unk> raw data and. why are these informations there <unk> . because in the summer of two thousand and six the e u commission tabled a directive <unk> . this directive [ is ] called data retention directive <unk> this directive says. that each phone company in europe. <unk> each internet service company all over europe <unk> has to store a wide range of information about the users . who calls whom . who sends whom an email <unk> who sends whom a text message and if you use your mobile phone <unk> where you are . all this. <unk> stored for at least six months up to two years by your phone company or your internet service. provider . and all over europe <unk> people stood up and said we don 't want this . they said we don 't want this data retention we want <unk>. <unk> and we don 't want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about us <unk> . they were lawyers <unk> journalists <unk> priests they all said we don 't want this . and here you can see like ten thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said freedom not fear . and some even said <unk> this would be stasi two. <unk> stasi was the secret police in east germany <unk> and i. also ask myself <unk> does it really work can they really store all this information about us <unk> every time i use my mobile phone <unk> . so i. asked my phone company deutsche telekom which was at that time the largest phone company. <unk> and i asked them please send me all the information you have stored about me . and i asked them once and i asked them again <unk> and i got no real answer it was only blah blah answers. <unk> but then i said i want to have this information <unk> because this is my life you are protocoling <unk> so i decided. to start a lawsuit against them because i wanted. <unk> telekom said no we will not give you this information <unk> . so at the end i had a settlement with them . i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for because in the mean time the german constitutional court ruled. that the implementation of this e u directive into german law was. <unk> so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c d inside and on the c d this was on. thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. at first i saw it and i said okay it 's a huge file okay <unk> . but then after a while i realized <unk> this is my life <unk> this is six months of my life <unk> into this file. so i was a little bit skeptical <unk> what should i do with it <unk> because. you can see where i am where i sleep at night <unk> what i am doing <unk> . but then i said i want to go out with. <unk> i want to make them public <unk> because i want to show the people what does data retention mean <unk> so. together with zeit online and open data city i did this. this is a visualization of six months of my life . you can zoom in and zoom out you can wind back and fast forward <unk> you can see every step i take <unk> . <unk> you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne <unk> and how often i call in between . all this is possible with this information <unk> . that 's a little bit scary <unk> . but it is not only about me . it 's about all of us <unk> first it 's only like i call my wife. <unk> and she calls me and we talk to each other a couple of times . and then there are some friends calling me and they call each other <unk> . and after a while you are calling you and you are calling you and you have this great communication network . but you can see how your people are communicating with each other. <unk> what times they call each other when they go to bed. you can see all of this you can see the hubs like who are the leaders in the group . if you have access to this information <unk> you can see what your society is doing <unk> . if you have access to this information you can control your society. this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran. <unk> blueprint how to survey your society <unk> because you know who talks to whom who sends whom an email all this is. possible if you have. access to this information <unk> and this information is stored for at least six months in europe up to two years . like i said at. <unk> imagine that all those people on the streets of berlin in autumn of one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine had a mobile phone in their pocket and. the stasi would have known who took part at this protest <unk> and if the stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it. this may never have happened the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not [ have been ] there. <unk> and in the aftermath also not the fall of the iron curtain . because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us <unk> online and offline . they want to have the possibility to track our lives <unk> and they want to store them for all time . but. and living in the digital age is no contradiction. <unk> but you have to fight for your <unk>. <unk> today you have to fight for it every day <unk> so <unk> when you go home <unk> tell your friends. that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it 's not outdated <unk> . when you go home <unk> tell your representative. <unk> only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information they don 't have to do it <unk> . and if you don 't. believe me ask your phone company what information they store about you <unk> . so in the future every time you use your. <unk> mobile phone let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for <unk>. <unk> in the digital age <unk> thank you.
