 <unk> it has been one hundred and twenty eight years since the last country in the world abolished slavery. and fifty three years since martin luther king pronounced his i have a dream. <unk> we still live in a world. where the color of our skin. not only gives a first impression <unk> but a lasting one that remains <unk> . i was born in a family full of colors <unk> my father. is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate. <unk> tone . he was adopted by those who i know as my grandparents the matriarch my grandma <unk> has a porcelain skin. hair <unk> my grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone <unk> like my uncle and. <unk> of a native brazilian with a pinch of hazel and honey . and a man [ who is ] a mix of coffee with milk but with a lot of coffee . she has two sisters one in a toasted peanut skin and the other <unk> . also adopted more on the beige side like a pancake. <unk> growing up in this family color was never important for me <unk> . outside home however <unk> things were different soon . color had many other meanings <unk> i remember. my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings it was exciting. and creative but i never understood the unique. i was made of flesh but i wasn 't pink <unk> my skin was brown and people said i was black <unk> . i was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head . <unk> when i took my cousin to school i was usually taken for the nanny . by helping in the kitchen at a friend 's party people thought i was the maid . i was even treated like a prostitute. just because i was walking alone on the beach with european friends and many times <unk> visiting my grandma or. <unk> i was invited not to use the main elevator because. in the end with this color and this hair <unk> i cannot belong to some places . in some way <unk> i get to used to it and accept part of it . however <unk> something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling . years later. <unk> married a spaniard <unk> but not any spaniard <unk> i chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt . since then a new question started to chase me <unk> what will be the color of your children . as you can understand this is my last. <unk> thinking about it . with my previous background <unk> my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer <unk> . and that is how humanae was born. <unk> a pursuit to highlight our true colors <unk> rather than the untrue white <unk> red black. or yellow associated with race it 's a kind of game to question. <unk> question our codes it 's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history <unk> . i portray the subjects in a white background <unk> then i choose. <unk> square from the nose <unk> paint the background <unk> and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette pantone. <unk> i started with my family and friends then. more and more people joined the adventure thanks to public calls coming through the social media <unk> . i thought that the main space to show my work was the internet. because i want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer. <unk> and their brain . the snowball started to roll the project had a great welcome. invitations exhibitions <unk> physical formats <unk> galleries and museums <unk> just happened. <unk> when humanae occupies public spaces. and appears in the street it fosters a popular debate. and creates a feeling of community <unk> . i have portrayed more than three thousand people. <unk> nineteen different cities around the world just to mention some of them. from someone included in the forbes list to refugees who crossed the mediterranean by boat . in paris from the unesco headquarters to a shelter . and students both in switzerland and favelas in rio de janeiro <unk> . <unk> all kinds of beliefs gender identities or physical impairments . a newborn or terminally ill <unk> we all together build humanae . those portraits make us rethink how we see each other . when modern science is questioning the race concept <unk> what does it mean for us. <unk> is it the eye the nose the mouth the hair <unk> . or does it have to do with our origin nationality or bank account . this personal exercise turned out to be a discovery suddenly. <unk> that humanae was useful for many people . it represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label . it was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me <unk> . i have hundreds of that i will share with you too . a mother of eleven years. <unk> very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence as this past weekend. one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in norway <unk> . so your work has a very special place in my heart and it 's very important. <unk> woman shared her portrait on facebook and wrote all my life people from across the globe. had difficulties to place me in a group a stereotype a box <unk> . perhaps we should stop instead of framing <unk> ask the individual ' how would you label yourself. <unk> i grew up in a mixed family and i 'm a bisexual woman ' . besides these unexpected and touching reactions. <unk> new life in a different variety of fields just to show you some examples <unk> . illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches. <unk> 's a collection of faces <unk> . researchers in the fields of anthropology physics and neuroscience use humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity. face recognition or. <unk> one of the most important impacts of the project. is that humanae was chosen to be the cover of foreign affairs <unk> one of the most relevant political publications . and talking about foreign affairs <unk> i found the perfect ambassadors for my project . teachers <unk> they are the ones that use humanae. their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes <unk> but this time as a teacher myself . my students both adults and kids. <unk> as a photographer <unk> i realize. that i can be a channel. for others to communicate as an individual as anglica . every time i take a picture i feel. that i am sitting in front of a therapist all the. <unk> frustration <unk> fear and loneliness that i once felt <unk> becomes love . the last country. the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where i was born. <unk> have to work hard to abolish discrimination . that remains a common practice worldwide and that will not disappear by itself <unk> thank you.
