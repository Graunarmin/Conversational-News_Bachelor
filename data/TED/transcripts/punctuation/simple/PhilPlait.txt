 <unk> i want to talk to you about something kind of. <unk> a chunk of rock six miles across <unk> moving something like fifty times the speed of a rifle bullet <unk> slammed into the earth <unk> . it released its energy all at once <unk> and it was an explosion that was mind numbing . if you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the cold war <unk> lumped them together <unk> and blew them up at the same time <unk> that would be one. of the energy released at that moment <unk> . the dinosaurs had a really bad day ok <unk> . now a six mile wide rock is very large we all live here in boulder <unk> if you look out your window and see longs peak you 're probably familiar with it now <unk> scoop up longs peak and put it out in space <unk> . take. <unk> lump that in there and put that in space as well <unk> and mt everest and k2 and the indian peaks <unk> then you 're starting to get an idea of how much rock we 're talking <unk>. <unk> about ok <unk> we know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left <unk> . <unk> huge to give you a sense of the scale <unk> there you go <unk> . the scale here is fifty miles on top a hundred kilometers on the bottom this thing was three hundred kilometers across two hundred miles an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around. the globe and set fires all over the planet threw up enough dust to block out. <unk> percent of all species on earth <unk> . now <unk> not all asteroids are that big some of them are smaller . here is one that came in over the united states in. october of one thousand nine hundred and ninety two it came in on a friday night <unk> why is that important because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular and. <unk> parents would bring them to their kids ' football games to film their kids playing football and since this came in on a friday they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virginia maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that. to a car in new york now <unk> this is not a. <unk> crater <unk> but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right. <unk> about the size of a football that hit that car and did that damage <unk> now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in it broke up through atmospheric pressure <unk> it <unk>. <unk> crumbled <unk> and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage <unk> now you wouldn 't want that falling on your foot or your head <unk> . <unk> is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact if any of you have ever been to near winslow arizona there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called meteor crater . to give you a sense of scale <unk> this is about a mile wide if you look up at the top <unk> that 's a parking lot and. <unk> those are recreational vehicles right there <unk> . so it 's about a mile across six hundred feet deep the object that formed this was probably about thirty to fifty yards across <unk> so roughly the size <unk>. of macky auditorium here <unk> it came in at speeds that were tremendous slammed into the ground <unk> blew up and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20 megaton nuclear bomb a very hefty. <unk> this was fifty thousand years ago <unk> so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope or something like that out in the desert <unk> . but it probably would not have caused global devastation . it turns out that these things don 't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage <unk> now in one thousand nine hundred and eight over siberia near the tunguska region. for those of you who are dan aykroyd fans and saw ghostbusters when he talked about the greatest. <unk> that 's fine i can live with that . another rock came into the earth 's atmosphere. and this one blew up above the ground several miles up above the surface of the earth <unk> . the heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles. <unk> this did a huge amount of damage <unk> and again this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we 're sitting in in meteor crater it was made of metal and metal is <unk>. <unk> much tougher so it made it to the ground <unk> the one over tunguska was probably made of rock and that 's much more crumbly so it blew up in the air . <unk> do global ecological damage they 're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did they 're just not big enough but they will do global economic damage <unk> because <unk>. <unk> they don 't have to hit necessarily to do this kind of damage they don 't have to do. <unk> some of them we depend on more on the global economic basis that could do a huge amount of damage. to us as a civilization so now that i 've scared the crap out of you . what can we do about <unk> this <unk> this is a potential threat <unk> let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for sixty five million years they 're very rare . <unk> smaller ones happen more often <unk> but probably. on the order of a millennium every few centuries or every few thousand years <unk> but it 's still something to be aware of well. what do we do about them the first thing we have to do is find them <unk> this is an image of an asteroid that passed us in two thousand and nine <unk> . it 's right here <unk> but you can. <unk> if you can see that in the back row these are just stars <unk> . this is a rock that was about thirty yards across so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over tunguska and hit arizona fifty thousand years ago . these things are faint they 're hard to see and the sky is really big <unk> we have to find these things first well the good news is we 're looking for them <unk> nasa has. devoted money to this the national science foundation and other countries are interested in doing this we 're building telescopes that are looking for the threat. <unk> 's a great first step <unk> but what 's the second step the second step is if we see one heading toward us we have to stop it <unk> what do we do . you 've probably heard about the asteroid apophis if you haven 't yet <unk> you will. <unk> if you 've heard about the mayan two thousand and twelve apocalypse you 're going to hear about apophis because you 're keyed in to all the doomsday. networks anyway. <unk> apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in two thousand and four it 's roughly two hundred and fifty [ meters ] across so it 's pretty big bigger than a football stadium <unk> . and it 's going to pass by the earth in april of <unk>. and it 's going to pass us so close that it 's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites the earth 's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it 's just right if it passes through this region of space. the earth 's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on april thirteen which is a friday i 'll note in the year <unk>. you can 't plan that kind of stuff . apophis is going to hit us . and it 's two hundred and fifty meters across <unk> so it would do unbelievable damage <unk> the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million roughly very very low odds. so i personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all i don 't think apophis is a problem in fact . apophis is a blessing in disguise <unk> because it woke us up to the dangers of these things this thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now it won 't but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids we didn 't really necessarily understand. <unk> and now we do and it turns out that 's really important <unk> because how do you stop an asteroid like this <unk> well <unk> let me ask you what happens if you 're standing in the road and a car 's headed for you what do you do <unk>. you do this <unk> right move and the car goes past you <unk> but we can 't move the earth at least not easily <unk> but we can move a small asteroid and it turns out we 've even done it in the year two thousand and five <unk> nasa launched a probe called deep. <unk> slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet <unk> comets are very much like asteroids <unk> . the purpose wasn 't to push it out of the way <unk> the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet <unk> which we learned quite a bit about we did <unk>. <unk> move the comet a little tiny bit not very much but that wasn 't the point <unk> however think about this this thing is orbiting the sun at ten twenty miles per second we shot a space probe at it and hit it. <unk> imagine how hard that must be and we did it <unk> that means we can do it again <unk> if we see an asteroid that 's coming toward us headed right for us and we have two years to go <unk> boom we hit it <unk> you know . if you watch the movies . you might think <unk> why don 't we use a nuclear weapon well you can try that but the problem is timing shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you. <unk> miss it <unk> and there are a lot of other problems with that it 's very hard to do <unk> but just hitting something that 's pretty easy i think even nasa can do that and proved that they can . the problem is if you you hit this asteroid <unk> you 've changed the orbit <unk> you measure the orbit then you find out oh yeah <unk> we just pushed it into a keyhole and now it 's going to hit us in three years well. <unk> it 's not hitting us in six months that 's good now we have three years to do something else and you can hit it again that 's kind of ham fisted you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever <unk> so you don 't do that and this is the part it. 's the part i just love . after the big macho grr bam we 're gonna hit this thing in the face then we bring in the velvet gloves. 's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves the b612 foundation for those of you who 've read the little prince you understand that reference i hope the little prince lived on an asteroid called b612 . these are smart guys men and women astronauts like i said engineers rusty schweickart who was an apollo nine astronaut is on this <unk> dan durda my friend. <unk> who made this image works here at southwest research institute in boulder. on walnut street he created this image for this he 's actually one of the astronomers who works for them <unk> if we see an asteroid that 's going to hit the earth and we have enough time. <unk> we can hit it to move it into a better orbit <unk> but then what we do is launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two it doesn 't have to be huge a couple of tons not that big. and you park it near the asteroid you don 't land on it because these things are tumbling end over end it 's very hard to land on them instead you get near. <unk> it <unk> the gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe and the probe has a couple of tons of mass <unk> it has a little. tiny bit of gravity <unk> but it 's enough. that it can pull the asteroid <unk> . and you have your rocket set up you can barely see it here but there 's rocket plumes and <unk> these guys are connected by their own gravity <unk> and if you move the probe very slowly very very gently <unk> you can. very easily finesse. <unk> that rock into a safe orbit <unk> you can even put in orbit around the earth where we could mine it <unk> although that 's a whole other thing i won 't go into that . but we 'd be rich . so think about this <unk> right there are. <unk> giant rocks flying out there and they 're hitting us and they 're doing damage to us <unk> but we 've figured out how to do this and all the pieces are in place to do this <unk> we have astronomers with <unk>. <unk> telescopes looking for them we have very very smart people who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem <unk> and we have the technology to do this <unk> this probe actually <unk>. <unk> can 't use chemical rockets chemical rockets provide too much thrust too much push the probe would just shoot away <unk> we invented something called an ion drive which is a very very very. <unk> engine it generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand incredibly light <unk> but it can run for months and years <unk> providing that very gentle push . <unk> if anybody here is a fan of the original star trek they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive and spock said they 're very technically sophisticated they 're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive yeah <unk> we have an ion drive now we don 't have the enterprise but we 've. spock . so . that 's the difference that 's the difference between us and the dinosaurs this happened to them <unk> . it doesn 't have to happen to us the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and. <unk> we can vote <unk> and so we can change our future . we have the ability to change our future sixty five million years from now we don 't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum <unk> thank you very much.
