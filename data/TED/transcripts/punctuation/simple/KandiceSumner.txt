 <unk> i want to talk to you. about my kids now i know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic the most beautiful kid that ever lived . but mine really are. <unk> i have six hundred and ninety six kids and they are the most intelligent inventive . innovative <unk> brilliant and powerful kids that you 'll ever meet . any student i 've had the honor of teaching in my classroom. is my kid . however <unk> because their real parents aren 't rich and i argue because they are mostly of color . they will seldom get to see in themselves the awesomeness that i see in them. <unk> what i see in them is myself or what would have been myself i am the daughter of two hardworking. <unk> parents who chose careers. as public servants my father a minister my mother an educator wealth was never the primary ambition in our house <unk> . because of this lack of wealth we lived in a neighborhood that. <unk> lacked wealth <unk> and henceforth a school system that lacked wealth <unk> . luckily however we struck the educational jackpot in a voluntary desegregation program that buses inner city kids black and brown out to suburban schools rich and white . at five years old i had to take an. bus ride to a faraway place to get a better education . at five years old <unk> i thought everyone had a life just like mine <unk> . i thought everyone went to school and were the only ones using the brown crayons to color in their family portraits while everyone else was using the peach colored ones . at five years old <unk> i thought everyone was just like me but as i got older <unk> i started noticing things like . how come my neighborhood. friend don 't have to wake up at five o 'clock in the morning and go to a school that 's an hour away <unk> . how come i 'm learning to play the violin while my neighborhood friends don 't even have a music class why. were my neighborhood friends learning and reading material that i had done two to three years prior . <unk> as i got older <unk> i started to have this. unlawful feeling in my belly like i was doing something that i wasn 't supposed to be doing taking something. that wasn 't mine . receiving a gift <unk> but with someone else 's name on it . all these amazing things that i was being exposed to and experiencing i felt. i wasn 't really supposed to have i wasn 't supposed to have a library fully equipped. athletic facilities or safe fields to play in . i wasn 't supposed to have theatre departments with seasonal plays and concerts digital visual performing arts . i wasn 't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs school buses that brought me door to door . freshly prepared school lunches. or even air conditioning these are things my. <unk> kids don 't get . you see as i got older while i was grateful for this amazing opportunity that i was being given . there was this ever present pang of . but what about everyone else there are thousands of other kids just like me who deserve this too why doesn 't everyone. <unk> get this why is a high quality education only exclusive to the rich it was like i had some sort of. survivor 's remorse all of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wreck that i was. saved from through a bus ride i was like an educational moses screaming let my people go to high quality schools. <unk> i 'd seen firsthand how the other half was being treated and educated i 'd seen the educational promised land and i could not for the life of me justify the disparity . i now teach in the very same school system from which i sought refuge <unk> . i know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student. <unk> and now as a teacher i don 't have access to those same tools to give my students <unk> there have been countless nights when i 've cried. in frustration <unk> anger. and sorrow <unk> . because i can 't teach my kids the way that i was taught <unk> . because i don 't have access to the same resources or tools that were used to teach me . my kids deserve so much better . we sit and we keep banging our heads against this. <unk> term achievement gap achievement gap is. it really that hard to understand why these kids perform well and these kids don 't <unk> i mean really <unk> . i think we 've got it all wrong <unk> . i think we as gloria ladson billings says should flip our paradigm and our language and call it what it really is it. 's not an achievement gap. <unk> an education debt . for all of the foregone schooling resources that were never invested in the education of the black and brown child over time . a <unk> little known secret in american history is that the only american institution created specifically for. people of color is the american slave trade. and some would argue the prison system but that 's another topic for another ted talk . the public school system of this country was built bought and paid for using commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor. were enslaved and prohibited from schooling their labor established the very institution from which they were excluded . ever since then <unk> every court. <unk> case educational policy reform has been an attempt to retrofit the design rather than just stopping and acknowledging we 've had it all wrong from the beginning . an oversimplification of american educational history all right just bear with me . blacks were kept out you know the whole slavery thing with the help of philanthropic white. they built their own schools separate but equal was ok <unk> but while we all know things were indeed separate . they were in no ways equal enter brown <unk> v the board of education of topeka kansas in one thousand nine <unk>. legal separation of the races is now illegal but very few people pay attention. to all of the court cases since then. <unk> that have undone the educational promised land for every child that brown <unk> v board intended . some argue that today our schools are now more segregated than they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place . teaching my kids about desegregation. <unk> the little rock nine the civil rights movement is a real awkward moment in my classroom when i have to hear the voice of a child ask . if schools were desegregated in <unk>. <unk> are no white kids here . these kids aren 't dumb <unk> they know exactly what 's happening and what 's not they know that when it comes to schooling. <unk> black lives don 't matter and they never have . for years i tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading . i 'd amassed a modest classroom library of books i 'd accumulated from secondhand shops thrift stores <unk> attics you know <unk> . but whenever i said those dreadful. <unk> take out a book and read you 'd think i 'd just declared war it was torture . one day <unk> after i 'd heard about this website called donorschoose where classroom teachers create wish lists of items they need for their classroom. and anonymous donors fulfill them i figured i 'd go out on a limb. and just make a wish list of the teenager 's. <unk> over two hundred brand new books were sent to my room piece by piece every day there were new deliveries and my kids would exclaim with glee. <unk> the whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls as she peeled open a crisp paperback said ms sumner. you know <unk> i figured you bought these books ' cause you teachers are always buying us stuff <unk> but to know that a stranger. <unk> even know <unk> cares this much about me. is pretty cool knowing that strangers will take care of you. is a privilege my kids aren 't afforded . ever since the donation there has been a steady stream of kids signing out books to take home and then returning them with the exclamation. <unk> take out a book and read kids rush to my library it wasn 't that they didn 't want to read <unk> but instead they 'd gladly read. if the resources were there . institutionally speaking our public school system has never done right by the black and brown child . we keep focusing on the end results or test results and getting frustrated. <unk> get to a catastrophe and we wonder how did it get so bad how did we get here really . if you neglect a child long enough you no longer have the right. to be surprised when things don 't turn out well stop being perplexed or confused or befuddled. by the achievement gap <unk> the income gap <unk> the incarceration rates. <unk> rates or whatever socioeconomic disparity is the new it term for the moment the problems we have as a country. are the problems we created as a country . the quality of your education is directly proportionate to your access to college your access to jobs your access to the future. <unk> until we live in a world where every kid. can get a high quality education no matter where they live or the color of their skin there are things we can do. on a macro level . school funding should not be decided by property taxes or some funky economic equation where rich kids continue to benefit from state aid. <unk> while poor kids are continuously having food and resources taken from their mouths <unk> . governors <unk> senators mayors city council members. if we 're going to call public education public education then it should be just that . otherwise <unk> we should call it what it really is poverty insurance . public education keeping poor kids poor since. believe that education is the great equalizer then it should be just that . equal and equitable <unk> until then there 's no democracy in our democratic education . on a mezzo level <unk> . historically speaking the education of the black and brown child has always depended on the philanthropy of others and unfortunately today it still does. <unk> if your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor or little timmy down the street. goes to an affluent school challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom . close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter. <unk> when resources are shared they 're not divided they 're multiplied <unk> . and on a micro level <unk> if you 're a human being donate . time <unk> money resources opportunities. is in your heart there are websites like donorschoose that recognize the disparity and actually. want to do something about it . what is a carpenter with no tools what is an actress with no stage . what is a scientist with no laboratory what is a doctor. with no equipment i 'll tell you they 're my kids shouldn 't they be your kids.
