 <unk> monday morning . in washington <unk> . the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office <unk> assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda. in yemen at number ten downing street david cameron. is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs. in order to stave off a double dip recession in madrid <unk> maria gonzalez. is standing at the door listening to her baby crying and crying trying to work out whether she should let it cry. until it falls asleep. or pick it up and hold it and i. am sitting by my father 's bedside in hospital trying to work out whether i should let him drink the. <unk> bottle of water that his doctors just came in came in and said you must make him drink today my father 's been nil by mouth for a week. or whether by giving him this bottle i might actually kill him. <unk> we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives <unk> . and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions we talk things over with our friends <unk> we. scour the internet we search through books <unk> but. <unk> even in this age of google and tripadvisor and amazon recommends . it 's still experts that we rely upon most. especially when the stakes are high. and the decision really matters . because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity <unk> . we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can that they are able to come to better. <unk> conclusions than we could come to on our own <unk> and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening. or confusing <unk> we feel reassured by the almost <unk>. authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. <unk> but i believe that this is a big problem a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us. as a society as a culture. and as individuals . it 's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world of course they have the problem lies with us we 've become. <unk> addicted to experts <unk> we 've become addicted to their certainty their assuredness their definitiveness <unk> . and in the process we have ceded our responsibility <unk> substituting our intellect and our intelligence. for their supposed words of. <unk> we 've surrendered our power <unk> trading off our discomfort with uncertainty. for the illusion of certainty that they provide this. is no exaggeration in a recent experiment a group of adults. had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to. <unk> the results were quite extraordinary as they listened to the experts ' voices the independent <unk>. <unk> parts of their brains. switched off . it literally <unk> flat lined and they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice however right or wrong. <unk> but experts do get things wrong <unk> did you know. <unk> that studies show that doctors. misdiagnose. four times out of ten <unk> . did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself . you 're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you . <unk> and then there 's of course the example that we 're all too aware of financial experts getting it so wrong. that we 're living through the worst recession since the <unk>. for the sake of our health our wealth. and our collective security it 's imperative that we keep the independent. <unk> parts of our brains. switched on and i 'm saying this as an economist who over the past few years has focused my research on. what it is we think and who it is we trust and why <unk> but also. and i 'm aware of the irony here. as an expert myself as a professor as somebody who advises prime ministers <unk> heads of big companies. <unk> organizations but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change . that we need to become more open minded more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view . so in order to help you understand where i 'm coming from let me bring you into my. <unk> world the world of experts now there are of course <unk> exceptions <unk> wonderful. exceptions <unk> but what my research has shown me is that. experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps a dominant. <unk> perspective emerges that often silences opposition that experts move with the prevailing winds <unk> often <unk>. their own gurus <unk> alan greenspan 's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on. <unk> after the crisis of course you see <unk> . we also learn that experts are located are governed by the social and cultural norms of their times. whether it be the doctors in victorian england say who sent women to. <unk> expressing sexual desire or the psychiatrists in the united states who up until one thousand nine <unk>. were still categorizing homosexuality. as a mental illness and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift. <unk> and nuance are ignored. and also. that money talks because we 've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies. of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects or studies funded by food companies. of. of their new products massively exaggerating the health benefits. of the products they 're about to bring by market the study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study <unk> . and we 've also got to be aware that experts of course <unk> . also make mistakes they make mistakes every single day. mistakes born out of carelessness. <unk> study in the archives of surgery. reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries <unk> operating on the wrong side of the brain . carrying out procedures on the wrong hand <unk> elbow eye foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors . a common thinking error of radiologists for example. when they look at. ct scans. is that they 're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient 's problem to be . so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia say. <unk> what happens is that if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan they literally stop looking at it. thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient 's lungs . i 've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts these. <unk> only insights i could share but i hope they give you a clear sense at least. of why we need to stop kowtowing to them why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on . but how can we do this well for the sake of time i want to focus on just. <unk> got to be ready and willing to take experts on. and dispense with this notion of them as modern day apostles. this doesn 't mean having to get a ph d in every single subject you 'll be relieved to hear . but it does mean persisting in the face of their. <unk> we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand . why was it that when i had an operation my doctor said to me . beware ms hertz of hyperpyrexia . when he could have just as easily said watch out for a high fever. <unk> also being willing to dig behind their graphs their equations their forecasts their prophecies and being armed with the questions to do that. questions like what are the assumptions that underpin this . what is the evidence upon which this is based what has your investigation focused on . and what has it ignored. it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market. typically trial drugs first <unk> primarily on male animals. and then <unk> primarily on men it seems that they 've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world 's population are women. and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs. don 't work nearly as well on women as they do on men. and the drugs that do work well work so well that they 're actively harmful for women to take being a rebel. <unk> is about recognizing that experts ' assumptions and their methodologies. can easily be flawed <unk> . second . we need to create the space for what i call managed dissent if we are to shift paradigms if we are to make breakthroughs . if we are to destroy myths we need to create an environment in which. expert ideas are battling it out in which. <unk> we 're bringing in new diverse <unk> discordant <unk> heretical views into the discussion <unk> fearlessly in the knowledge. that progress comes about not only from the creation of ideas <unk> but also from their destruction. and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent. <unk> discordant <unk> heretical views all the research now shows us. that this actually makes us smarter <unk> . encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts . which are to surround ourselves with opinions. <unk> and advice. that we already believe or want to be true <unk> . and that 's why i talk about the need to actively manage dissent . google ceo eric schmidt is a practical. practitioner of this philosophy in meetings he looks out for the person in the room arms crossed looking a bit bemused. and draws them into the discussion <unk> trying to see if. <unk> they indeed are the person with a different opinion so that they have dissent within the room managing dissent. is about recognizing the value. of disagreement <unk> discord and difference . but we need to go even further we need to fundamentally redefine. who it is that experts. are the conventional notion is that experts are people with. advanced degrees <unk> fancy titles diplomas <unk> best selling books. <unk> individuals <unk> but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise. <unk> as some sort of elite cadre. and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise. whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo 's <unk> but also. yeah <unk> best buy <unk> the consumer electronics company <unk> gets all its employees. the cleaners the shop assistants the people in the back office <unk> not just its forecasting team. to place bets yes bets on things like whether or not. a product is going to sell well before christmas on whether customers ' new ideas. are going to be or should be taken on by the company on whether a project will come in on. <unk> time by. leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company <unk> best buy was able to discover for example that. the store that it was going to open in china its big grand store was not going to open on time because when it asked. <unk> all its staff to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not a group from the finance department. placed all their chips. on that not happening it turned out that they were aware as no one else within the company was of a technological blip. that neither the forecasting experts nor the experts on the ground in china were even aware of. the strategies that i have discussed this evening. embracing dissent <unk> taking experts on <unk> democratizing expertise rebellious strategies. are strategies. that i think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing. <unk> complex difficult times for if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on . if we challenge experts if we 're skeptical if we devolve authority if we are rebellious <unk> but also. if we become much more comfortable with nuance uncertainty. and doubt <unk> and if we allow our experts. to express themselves using those terms too we will set ourselves up much better. for the challenges of the 21st century <unk> . for now more than ever is not the time to be blindly following <unk> . blindly accepting. blindly trusting now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open. yes using experts to help us figure things out for sure. i don 't want to completely do myself out of a job here. but being.
