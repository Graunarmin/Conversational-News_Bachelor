 <unk> my name is lovegrove i only know nine lovegroves two of which are my parents <unk> they are first cousins and you know what happens when you know . so there 's a terribly weird. freaky side to me which i 'm fighting with all the time so to try and. get through today i 've kind of disciplined myself with an 18 minute talk i was hanging on to have a pee i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough that would guide me through the eighteen minutes . ok <unk> i am known as captain organic and that 's a philosophical. <unk> position as well as an aesthetic position. but today what i 'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people 's soul and emotion. <unk> not very long ago <unk> not many. thousands of years ago <unk> we actually lived in caves <unk> and i don 't think we 've lost that coding system . we respond so well to form <unk> . but i 'm interested in creating. <unk> intelligent form i 'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design <unk> this artificially induced consumerism i think it 's atrocious . my world is the world of people like amory lovins <unk> . janine benyus <unk> james watson <unk> i 'm in that world but i work. purely instinctively <unk> i 'm not a scientist i could have been perhaps. <unk> but i work in this world where i trust my instincts so i am a <unk>. translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with and we should be developing things we should be developing packaging for ideas. which elevate people 's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig. <unk> of the earth and translate into products for everyday use so . the water bottle i 'll. begin with this concept of what i call dna <unk> dna design nature art these are the three things that condition my world here is. a drawing by leonardo da vinci five hundred years ago <unk> before photography <unk> it shows how. <unk> and instinct work to create amazing art industrial design is the art form of the 21st century people like leonardo there. have not been many. had this amazingly instinctive curiosity . i work from a similar position i don 't want to sound pretentious saying that but this is my drawing made on a digital pad. a couple of years ago well into the. <unk> five hundred years later it 's my impression of water impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it one hundred million dollars easily for a monet <unk> . i use now a whole new process a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn . thom mayne zaha hadid <unk> rem koolhaas all these people that i think are persevering. and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create. <unk> this is all created digitally here you see the machining the milling of a block of acrylic <unk> this is what i show to the client to say that 's what i want to do at that point i don 't know if that 's possible at all <unk> <unk> it 's a seductor <unk> . but i just feel in my bones that that 's possible. <unk> so we go <unk> we look at the tooling we look at how that is produced these are the invisible things that you never see in your life <unk> this is the background. <unk> that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra it is more valuable than the product in my eyes <unk> i don 't have one when i do make some money i 'll have one machined for myself <unk> . this is the final product when they. sent it to me i thought i 'd failed it felt like nothing it has to feel like nothing <unk> it was when i put the water in that i realized that i 'd put a skin on water itself it 's an icon of water itself . <unk> it elevates people 's perception. of contemporary design each bottle is different <unk> meaning the water level will give you a different shape <unk> it 's mass individualism from a single product <unk> . it fits the hand it fits arthritic hands it fits children 's hands it makes the product strong the tessellation <unk> it 's a millefiori of ideas . in the future <unk> . they will look like that because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things perhaps in life. <unk> for materials will come into play in probably a decade it. doesn 't look as cool does it but i can live up to that i don 't have a problem with that i design for that condition biopolymers <unk> it 's the future <unk> . i took this video in cape town last year <unk> this is the freaky side coming out <unk> i have this special interest in things. <unk> which once existed and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking when i look at these things . they look pretty normal to me <unk> but these things evolved over many years and what we 're trying to do i get three weeks to design a telephone how the hell do i do. <unk> when you get these things. that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve how do you condense that it. comes back to instinct i 'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and i 'm not looking at designing architecture like that . i 'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates . how that flows through me and how that comes out. is what i 'm trying to understand <unk> this is a scan through the. <unk> human forearm <unk> it 's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure i have these in my office my office is a. mixture of the natural history museum and. a nasa space lab it 's a weird kind of freaky place <unk> this is one of my specimens <unk> this is made bone is made from a mixture of. <unk> i studied cooking in school for four years and in that in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science. qualification . actually i put marijuana in everything i cooked and. i had access to all the best girls it was fabulous all the guys in the rugby team couldn 't understand anyway. this is a meringue <unk> this is another sample i have a meringue is made exactly the. <unk> way in my estimation as a bone <unk> . it 's made from polysaccharides and proteins if you pour water on that it dissolves could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future <unk> . not a bad idea <unk> i don 't know <unk> i need to talk to janine and a few other people about that <unk> but i believe instinctively that that meringue can become something. <unk> i 'm also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things. so you 're not restricted by form at all these interrelated forms they do inspire everything i do although i might end up making something incredibly simple <unk> . this is a detail of a chair that i 've designed in magnesium <unk> it shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking <unk> shown pretty much. <unk> a bone structure any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object <unk> . it 's the world 's first chair made in magnesium it cost one point seven million dollars to develop it 's called go . by bernhardt usa <unk> it went into time magazine. in two thousand and one as the new language of the 21st century <unk> boy for somebody growing up in wales in a little village that 's. <unk> make one holistic form like the car industry <unk> and then you break up what you need this is an absolutely beautiful way of working it 's a godly way of working. <unk> it 's organic and it 's essential it 's an absolutely fat free design and when you look at it you see human beings <unk> . when that moves into polymers you can change the elasticity. <unk> polymer chair what nature does is it drills holes in things <unk> it liberates form it takes away anything extraneous <unk> . that 's what i do i make organic things which are essential <unk> and they look funky too. but i don 't set out to make funky things because i think that 's an absolute disgrace i set out to look at natural forms if you took the idea of. <unk> take a membrane shrinking it down constantly like nature does that could be a seat for a chair <unk> it could be a sole for a sports shoe it could be a car blending into seats wow . let 's go for it that 's the kind of stuff this is what exists in nature observation now allows us to. bring that natural process. into the design process every day that 's what i do <unk> this is a show that 's currently on in tokyo <unk> it 's called superliquidity it 's my sculptural investigation. it 's like 21st century henry moore <unk> when you see a henry moore <unk> still . your hair stands up there 's some amazing spiritual connect if he was a car designer . phew we 'd all be driving one in his day he was the highest taxpayer in britain <unk> that is the power of organic design <unk> it. contributes immensely to our. sense of being. our sense of relationships with things our sensuality and you know the sort of even the. sort of <unk> <unk> socio erotic side which is very important <unk> this is my artwork this is all my process these actually are sold as artwork they 're very big prints <unk> . but this is how i get to that object <unk> ironically that object was made by the killarney. <unk> which is a brand new process here for the 21st century and i can hear greg lynn laughing his socks off as i say that i 'll tell you about that later <unk> when i look into these these. data images i see new things it <unk>. diatomic structures radiolaria the things that we couldn 't see but we can do now these again are cored out they 're made virtually from nothing they 're made from silica <unk> . why not structures from cars like that <unk> coral all these natural forces. take away what they don 't need and they deliver. maximum beauty <unk> we need to be. in that realm i want to do stuff like that <unk> . this is a new chair which should come on the market in september it 's for a company called moroso in italy <unk> it 's a <unk> gas injected polymer chair . those holes you see there are very filtered down. <unk> versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures . it goes with the flow of the polymer and you 'll see there 's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing <unk> it 's great to have companies in italy who support this way of dreaming . if you see the shadows that come through that <unk> they 're actually probably more important than the product <unk> but it 's the minimum it takes the coring out of the back lets you breathe <unk> it takes away any material you don 't need and it actually. <unk> break into a dance then . this is some current work i 'm doing i 'm looking at single surface structures and how they stretch and flow <unk> . it 's based on furniture typologies but that 's not the. end motivation motivation <unk> it 's made from aluminum <unk> as opposed to aluminium and it. 's grown it 's grown in my mind and then it 's grown in terms of the the whole process that i. <unk> through this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry <unk> who build parts for bentleys and so on it 's being built as we speak. and it will be on show in phillips next year in new york i have a big show with phillips auctioneers. when i see these animations oh jesus i 'm blown away <unk> this is what goes on in my studio everyday i walk i 'm traveling i come back. <unk> some guy 's got that on a computer there 's this like oh my goodness <unk> so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio this kind of effervescent. fully charged. sense of soup that. delivers ideas single surface products furniture 's a good one . how you grow legs out of a surface <unk> i would love to build this one day and perhaps i 'd like to build it also out of. <unk> that 's the weird side coming out again. <unk> a lot of companies don 't understand that three weeks ago i was with sony in in tokyo <unk> they said give us the dream what is our dream how do we beat apple i said you don 't copy apple that 's for sure <unk> you get into biopolymers . they looked straight through me . <unk> i 'm delivering <unk> they 're not taking . i 've had this image twenty years i 've had this image of a water droplet for twenty years sitting on a hot bed . that is an image of a car for me that 's the car of the future <unk> it 's a water droplet <unk> i 've been banging on about this <unk> like i can 't believe . cars are all wrong <unk> i 'm going to show you something a bit weird now they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this the only place that didn 't laugh was moscow. <unk> cars are made from thirty thousand components how ridiculous is that couldn 't you make that from three hundred it 's got a <unk>. <unk> pan everything 's holistically integrated it opens and closes like a bread bin there is no engine there 's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels they 're fitted like formula one you take them. <unk> so you can see the people in there you drive different <unk> you see that thing <unk> you do you do <unk> and not anesthetized <unk> separated from life there 's a hole at the front. and there 's a reason for that <unk> it 's a city car <unk> you drive along you get out <unk> you drive on to a proboscis <unk> you get out . it lifts you up it presents the solar panel to the sun and at night <unk> it 's a street lamp. that 's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first and do the car second i can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages . floating around. on the ground <unk> driven by ai <unk> when i showed this in south africa everybody afterwards was going hey car on a stick . <unk> can you imagine a car on a stick . if you put it next to contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me and that 's what i do with my furniture i 'm not putting charles eames ' furniture in buildings anymore. i 'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture <unk> i 'm trying to build transportation systems i work on aircraft for airbus i do all this sort of stuff. trying to force these natural inspired by nature dreams home <unk> i 'm going to finish on two things <unk> this is the stereolithography of a staircase <unk> it 's a little bit of a. <unk> dedication to james <unk> james watson <unk> . i built this thing for my studio it cost me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to build this <unk> . most people go and buy the aston martin <unk> i built this <unk> this is the data that goes with that <unk> incredibly complex took about two years <unk> because i 'm looking for. <unk> composites it 's a single element which. rotates around to create a holistic element and this is a <unk> carbon fiber handrail which is only supported in two places modern materials allow us to do modern things <unk> . this is a shot in the studio this is how it looks pretty much every day <unk> you wouldn 't want to have a fear of heights coming down it there is. <unk> and it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength it 's this holistic integration that 's my studio <unk> it 's subterranean it 's in notting hill <unk> next to all the crap. the prostitutes and all that stuff it 's next to david hockney 's original studio <unk> it has a lighting system that changes throughout the day my guys go out for lunch the door 's open they come back in because it 's normally raining and they prefer to stay in . this is my studio. <unk> elephant skull from oxford university one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight i bought that last year they 're very difficult to find if anybody 's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me i 'll put it in the studio . so i 'm just going to interject interject a little bit with some of the things. that you 'll see in the video it 's a homemade video made it myself at three o 'clock in the morning just to show you. how my real world is you never see that you never see architects or designers showing you their real world this is called. <unk> a new bio polycarbonate chair i 'm doing in italy world 's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars <unk> we should all be riding one of these as china buys all these crappy cars we should be. riding things like this counterbalance <unk> . like i say it 's a cross between natural history museum and a nasa laboratory <unk> it 's full of prototypes and objects. <unk> the rare times when i 'm there i do enjoy it <unk> and i get lots and lots of kids coming i 'm a contaminator. for all those children of investment bankers wankers sorry . that 's a solar seed it 's a concept for new architecture that thing on the top is the world 's first. <unk> garden lamp. the first produced <unk> giles revell should be talking here today amazing photography of things you can 't see the first sculptural. model i made for that thing in tokyo <unk> . lots of stuff there 's a little leaf chair that golden looking thing is called leaf it 's made from kevlar . on the wall is my book called supernatural which allows me to remember what i 've done because i forget there 's an aerated brick i did in limoges last year in concepts for new ceramics in architecture. <unk> gernot oberfell working at three o 'clock in the morning. and i don 't pay overtime <unk> overtime is the passion of design so. join the club or don. 't no it 's true people like tom and greg we 're traveling like you can 't we fit it. <unk> next week i 'm at. electrolux in sweden <unk> then i 'm in beijing on friday <unk> you work that one out <unk> and when i see ed 's photographs i think why the hell am i going to china it 's true. 's true because there 's a soul in this whole thing <unk> we need to have a new instinct for the 21st century <unk> we need to combine all this stuff <unk> if all the people who were talking over this period. <unk> so there 's a new x light system i 'm doing in japan. there 's. tuareg shoes from north africa there 's a kifwebe mask these are my sculptures <unk> a copper jelly mold laughter. it sounds like some quiz show or something. thank you very much.
