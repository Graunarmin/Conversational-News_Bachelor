 <unk> we made this kindergarten to be a circle <unk> it 's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof. <unk> if you are a parent <unk> you know that kids. love to keep making circles <unk> this is how the rooftop looks and why did we design this the. principal of this kindergarten said no i don 't want a handrail i said it 's impossible but. <unk> how about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof <unk> so that it can catch the children falling off . i said it 's impossible and of course the government official said of course you have to. have a handrail but we could keep that idea around the trees there are three trees. <unk> were allowed to call. this rope. as a handrail <unk> but of course <unk> rope has nothing to do with them they fall into the net <unk> and you get more. <unk> he loves the tree so he is eating the tree . and at the time of an event they sit on the edge . it looks so nice from underneath monkeys in the zoo. <unk> we made the roof as low as possible <unk> because we wanted to see children on top of the roof not only underneath the roof <unk> . and if the roof is too high <unk> you see only the ceiling . and the leg washing place there are many kinds of water taps. <unk> to spray water to your friends <unk> . and the shower <unk> and the one in front is quite normal but if you look at this the boy is not washing his boots he 's putting water into his boots. <unk> there is no boundary between inside and outside <unk> so it means basically this architecture is a roof <unk> and also there is no boundary. between classrooms <unk> so there is no acoustic barrier at all <unk> <unk> when you put many children. in a quiet. <unk> there is no reason they get nervous because there is no boundary <unk> and the principal says. if the boy in the corner doesn 't want to stay in the room we let him go he will come back eventually because it 's a circle. <unk> in that kind of occasion usually children try to hide somewhere <unk> but here <unk> just. they leave and come back it 's a natural process <unk> and. secondly we consider noise very important <unk> you know that. children. <unk> up in the jungle with noise <unk> they need noise <unk>. <unk> and you know you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar . you are not supposed to be in silence <unk> and you know <unk> these days we are trying to. make everything under control you know it 's. completely open <unk> and you should know that. we can go skiing in minus twenty degrees in winter in summer. you go. <unk> swimming <unk> the sand is fifty degrees <unk>. and also you should know that you are waterproof <unk> you never melt. in rain <unk> so children are supposed to be outside <unk> so that is how we should treat them <unk>. this is how they divide classrooms they are. <unk> they talk to each other around the well <unk> and there are always. <unk> at least one skylight <unk> and this is where santa claus comes down at the time of christmas. <unk> the building. is only five meters tall. with seven floors <unk> and of course the ceiling height is very low <unk> so you have to consider safety <unk> . so we put our children. <unk> he hit his head. he 's okay his skull is quite strong he is resilient it 's my son . and he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off <unk> and then we put other children. <unk> traffic jam is awful in tokyo as you know the driver in front. she needs to learn how to drive now. these days <unk> kids need a small dosage of danger <unk> . and in this kind of occasion. <unk> to help each other this is society this is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days. <unk> so it 's not exactly small at all <unk> and this boy did six thousand meters in the morning <unk> . but the surprise is yet to come the. <unk> don 't train them we leave them on top of the. <unk> roof <unk> just like sheep . they keep running . my. point is don 't control them . don 't protect them too much <unk> . and they need to tumble sometimes <unk> they need to get some injury . that makes them learn how to live in this world <unk> . i think. architecture is capable of changing this world and people 's lives . and this is one of the attempts. to change the lives <unk> of children <unk> thank you very much.
