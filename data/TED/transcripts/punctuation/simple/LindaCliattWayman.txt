 <unk> my first day as a principal <unk> but hardly my first day. in the school district of philadelphia <unk> i graduated from philadelphia public schools. <unk> and i went on to teach special education for twenty years in a <unk>. <unk> school in north philadelphia <unk> where crime is rampant. and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation <unk> . shortly after i walked into my new school a huge fight. broke out among the girls. after things were quickly under control <unk> i immediately called a meeting. in the school 's auditorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal. <unk> the tone for my new students i started listing as forcefully as i could. my expectations for their behavior. and my expectations for what they would learn in school <unk> when all of a sudden a girl way in the back of the auditorium. <unk> do you keep calling this a school <unk> this. is not a school in one outburst <unk> ashley had expressed. what i felt and never quite was able to articulate. about my own experience when i attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood many many many years earlier . that school. was definitely not a school <unk> fast forwarding. a decade later to two thousand and twelve. <unk> i was to be strawberry mansion 's fourth principal in four years it was labeled. and persistently dangerous due to its low test scores. and high number of weapons <unk> drugs <unk> assaults. <unk> shortly as i approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter <unk> and found the door locked with chains . i could hear ashley 's voice in my ears going miss <unk> . miss <unk> . this is not a school . the halls were dim and dark from poor lighting there were tons of piles of broken old furniture and. <unk> desks in the classrooms and there were thousands of unused materials and resources this. was not a school as the year progressed i noticed. that the classrooms were nearly empty the students were just. <unk> scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen . scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food . they were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying this. was not a school . and then there were the teachers who were incredibly afraid for their own safety. <unk> they had low expectations for the students. and themselves <unk> and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school 's culture this. was the most troubling of all . you see ashley was right <unk> and not just about her school for far too many schools for. <unk> kids who live in poverty their schools are really not schools at all . but this can change let me tell you how it 's being done at strawberry mansion high school <unk> . anybody who 's ever worked with me will tell you. i am known for my slogans. <unk> i am going to use three. that have been paramount in our quest for change . my first slogan is if you 're going to lead lead i. always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal <unk> . i am the principal <unk> and having that title. required me to lead. <unk> i was not going to stay in my office <unk> . i was not going to delegate my work <unk> . and i was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children <unk> whether that made me liked. or not i am a leader <unk> so i know i cannot do anything alone <unk>. <unk> leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children and together <unk> . we tackled the small things like resetting every single locker combination by hand. so that every student could have a secure locker . we decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright <unk> colorful and positive messages <unk> . we took the chains off the front doors of the school we got the lightbulbs. <unk> replaced <unk> and we cleaned every classroom to its core . recycling every every textbook that was not needed <unk> and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture <unk> we used two dumpsters. per day and of course of course <unk> we tackled. <unk> entire school budget. so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff <unk> . we rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times <unk> . remediation <unk> . honors courses . <unk> and counseling all during the school day all during the school day <unk> . we created a deployment plan. that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day <unk> and we monitored. at every second. <unk> was a behavior system designed to promote positive behavior at all times the results . strawberry mansion was removed from the persistently dangerous list our first year. after being. after being on the persistently dangerous list for five consecutive years <unk> . leaders. make the impossible possible that brings me to my second slogan <unk> so what <unk> now what. <unk> we looked at the data <unk> and we met with the staff there were many excuses for why strawberry mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous . they said <unk> that only sixty eight percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis one hundred percent of them live in poverty . one percent of the parents participate many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes. percent of the students have special needs and the state data revealed. that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra and ten were proficient in literature. after they got through telling us all the stories of. <unk> how awful the conditions and the children were i looked at them <unk> . and i said so what <unk> now what what are we gonna do about <unk>. eliminating excuses. <unk> every turn became my primary responsibility . we addressed every one of those excuses through a mandatory professional development <unk> . paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning . after many observations what we determined. was that teachers knew what to teach. but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities. <unk> developed a lesson delivery model for instruction. that focused on small group instruction . making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom . the results <unk> . after one year <unk> state data revealed. that our scores have grown by one hundred and seventy one percent in algebra. <unk> and one hundred and seven percent in literature . we have a very long way to go . a very long way to go . but we now approach every obstacle with a so what now what attitude . and that brings me to my third and final slogan. if nobody told you. they loved you today <unk> you remember i do <unk> and i always will my students have problems . social emotional. and economic problems you could never imagine <unk> some of them are parents themselves <unk> and some are completely alone. if someone asked me my real secret. for how i truly keep strawberry mansion moving forward i would have to say that i love my students. and i believe in their possibilities unconditionally. <unk> when i look at them <unk> i can only see what they can become <unk> . and that is because. <unk> because. i am one of them <unk> . i grew up poor in north philadelphia too . i know what it feels like to go to a school that 's not a school <unk> . i know what it feels like to wonder if there 's ever going to be any way out of poverty <unk>. <unk> i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me so if. i 'm going to push my students toward their dream and their purpose in life <unk> . i 've got to get to know who they are . so i have to spend time with them. <unk> so i manage the lunchroom every day and while i 'm there i talk to them. about deeply personal things <unk> . and when it 's their birthday <unk> i sing happy birthday even though i cannot sing at all . i often ask them why do you want me to sing when i cannot sing at all. and they respond by saying because we like feeling special . we hold monthly town hall meetings. to listen to their concerns to find out what is on their minds they ask us. <unk> why can 't we just do what we want to do . they ask <unk> and i answer each question honestly <unk> . and this exchange in listening. helps to clear up any misconceptions every moment. <unk> in my rules and consequences. is their earned respect . i insist on it <unk> and because of this we can accomplish things together . <unk> they are clear about my expectations for them <unk> . and i repeat those expectations every day over the p a system i remind them . i remind them of those core values. of focus tradition <unk> . excellence <unk> integrity and perseverance <unk> and i remind them every day. how education can truly. <unk> change their lives <unk> and i end every announcement the same if nobody told you. they loved you today <unk> you remember i do <unk> and i always will ashley 's words. of miss <unk> miss <unk> this is not a school is forever etched in my mind. if we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty. then we have to make sure. that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school a school. <unk> them with knowledge. and mental training to navigate the world around them . i do not know all the answers <unk> but what i do know. is for those of us. who are privileged and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty <unk> we must truly lead. <unk> and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges <unk> we must stop and ask ourselves so what <unk> . now what what are we going to do about it . and as we lead <unk> we must never forget. that every single one of our students is just a child often scared by. the world tells them they should be <unk> . and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be. <unk> we should always provide them with hope . our undivided attention . unwavering belief in their potential <unk> . <unk> and we must tell them often . if nobody told them they loved them today <unk> remember we do <unk> and we always will <unk> thank you.
