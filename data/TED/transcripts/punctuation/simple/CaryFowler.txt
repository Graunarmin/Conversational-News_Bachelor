 <unk> i 've been fascinated with with crop diversity for about thirty five years from now <unk> ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure. academic article by a guy named jack harlan <unk> and he described the diversity within crops all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such as a. <unk> genetic resource <unk> . and he said this genetic resource . and i 'll never forget the words stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine . i figured he was either really on to something or he was one of these academic nutcases <unk> so i looked a little. <unk> and what i figured out was that he wasn 't a nutcase he was the most respected scientist in the field . what he understood was that biological diversity crop diversity. is the biological foundation of agriculture <unk> . it 's the raw material <unk> the stuff of evolution in our agricultural crops not a trivial matter <unk> and he also understood. that that foundation was crumbling <unk> literally crumbling. <unk> that indeed a mass extinction was underway. in our in our fields in our agricultural system . and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring . now i know that many of you don 't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and let 's face it that 's logical <unk> you don 't see it in the newspaper every. <unk> day <unk> and when you go into the supermarket you certainly don 't see a lot of choices there <unk> you see apples that are red yellow and green and that that 's about it <unk> . so <unk> let me show you a picture of one form of diversity . here 's some beans <unk> and. there are about thirty five or forty different varieties of beans on this picture now <unk> imagine each one of these. <unk> varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a great dane if i wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world <unk> . and i put thirty or forty of them on a slide it would take about ten slides because there about four hundred breeds of dogs in the world . but there are thirty five to forty thousand different varieties. <unk> going to show you all the beans in the world <unk> . and i had a slide like this <unk> and i switched it every second <unk> . it would take up my entire ted talk and i wouldn 't have to say anything <unk> . but the interesting thing is that this diversity and the tragic thing is. that this diversity is being lost <unk> we have about two hundred thousand different varieties of wheat and we have about. two to four hundred thousand. <unk> varieties of rice <unk> but it 's being lost <unk> and i want to give you an example of that it 's a bit of a personal example in fact in the united states in the <unk>. that 's where we have the best data farmers and gardeners were growing seven thousand one hundred named varieties of apples <unk> . <unk> hundred of those are extinct . no longer to be seen again <unk> . i used to have a list of these extinct apples and when i would go out and give a presentation i would pass the list out in the audience i wouldn 't tell them what it was but it was in alphabetical order <unk> . and i would tell them to look for their their names their family names their mother 's maiden name <unk> . and at the end of the speech i would ask how many people have found a name. <unk> and i never had fewer than <unk> two thirds of an audience hold up their hand <unk> and i said you know what . these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them. the greatest honor they could give them they gave them their name <unk> . the bad news is they 're extinct <unk> the good news is a third of you didn 't hold up your hand. <unk> your apple 's still out there <unk> find it <unk> make sure it doesn 't join the list . so i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple. is still out there <unk> and there 's an old book back here and i want to read a piece from it. <unk> the apples of new york and this is the second volume see we used to have a lot of apples <unk> and the fowler apple is described in here. i hope this doesn 't surprise you. as a beautiful fruit . i don 't know if we named the apple. <unk> us but . but . to be honest the description goes on and it says that it doesn 't rank high in quality however . and then he has to go even further it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size. <unk> and i guess there 's a lesson to be learned here <unk> and the lesson is so why save it <unk> i get this question all the time why don 't we just save the best one <unk> . and there are a couple of answers to that question one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one. <unk> today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease the other thing is. that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that 's not economical right now. has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we 're going to need for climate change. that the others don 't <unk> so it 's not necessary <unk> thank god that the fowler apple. <unk> best apple in the world it 's just necessary or interesting that it might have one. good unique trait and for that reason we ought to be saving it <unk> why as a raw material as. a trait we can use in the future think of diversity. as giving us options <unk>. <unk> of course are exactly what we need in an era of climate change. i want to show you two slides but first i want to tell you that we 've been working at the global crop diversity trust with a number of scientists particularly at stanford. and university of washington to. ask the question what 's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this . in short the answer is that. <unk> in the future in many countries <unk> the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter. than anything those crops have seen in the past <unk> the coldest growing seasons of the future <unk> hotter than the hottest of the past . is agriculture adapted to that i don 't know can fish play the piano <unk>. <unk> if agriculture hasn 't experienced that how could it be adapted . now <unk> the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world and the place where climate change ironically is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub saharan africa so i 've picked two examples here <unk> . and i want to show you . in the histogram before you now <unk> the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures going back. <unk> far as we have temperature data and you can see that there 's some difference between one growing season and another some are colder some are hotter and it 's a bell shaped curve <unk> the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most. number of growing seasons in the future <unk> later this century it 's going to look like the red <unk> . totally out of bounds <unk> the agricultural system and more importantly the crops in the field. in india have never experienced this before here 's. <unk> south africa the same story <unk> but the most interesting thing about south africa is we don 't have to wait for two thousand and seventy for there to be trouble by two. thousand and thirty if the maize or corn varieties which is the dominant crop fifty percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field. in two thousand and thirty we 'll have a thirty percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in. <unk> thirty percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population that 's a food crisis <unk> it 's global in nature <unk> we will watch children starve to death on tv . now <unk> you may say that twenty years is a long way off <unk> it 's two breeding cycles for maize <unk> we have two rolls of the dice to get this right . we have to get climate ready crops in the field and we have to do that rather quickly. <unk> now <unk> the good news is that we have conserved we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity agricultural diversity <unk> mostly in the form of seed . and we put it in seed banks which is a fancy way. of saying a freezer . if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers <unk> you dry it and then you freeze it. <unk> unfortunately these seed banks. <unk> are located around the world in buildings and they 're vulnerable disasters have happened in recent years we lost the gene bank the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan you can guess why <unk> . in rwanda in the solomon islands and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things. <unk> and every time something like this happens <unk> . it means extinction we lose diversity and i 'm not talking about losing diversity in in the same way that you lose your car keys i 'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs . actually losing it never to be seen again so . a number of us got together and decided that you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility. that can really offer protection. for our biological diversity of. maybe. <unk> not the most charismatic diversity you don 't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do. a panda bear <unk> but it 's very important diversity <unk> so we needed a really safe place and we went. quite. far north to find it to svalbard in fact this is above mainland norway you can see greenland there that 's. <unk> degrees north <unk> it 's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane <unk> . it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape i can 't even begin to describe it to you it 's otherworldly beautiful . we worked with the norwegian government and with the norgen the norwegian genetic resources program . to design this facility what you see is an artist 's conception of this facility. is built in a mountain in svalbard <unk> the idea of svalbard was that it 's cold <unk> so we we get natural freezing temperatures <unk> but. it 's remote <unk> it 's remote and accessible so it 's safe and we don 't depend on mechanical refrigeration. <unk> this is more than just an artist 's dream. <unk> it 's now a reality <unk> and this next picture. shows it in context in svalbard . and here 's the front door of this facility <unk> when you open up the front door . this is what you 're looking at it 's pretty simple it 's a hole in the ground it 's a tunnel and you go into the tunnel <unk> chiseled in solid rock about one hundred and thirty meters there. are now a couple of security doors so you won 't see it quite like this again. <unk> when you get to the back you get into an area that 's really my favorite place i think of it as sort of a cathedral <unk> and i know that this. tags me as a bit of a nerd but some of the happiest days of my life have been spent. <unk> you were to walk into. into one of these rooms. <unk> you would see this it 's not. very exciting but if you know what 's there it 's pretty emotional . we have now about four hundred and twenty five thousand samples of unique. crop varieties there 's seventy thousand samples of different. <unk> varieties of rice. in this facility right now . about a year from now we 'll have over half a million samples we 're going up to over a million and someday we 'll basically have samples about five hundred seeds. of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state. in this facility <unk> this is a backup system for world agriculture it 's a backup system for all the seed banks. storage is free <unk> it operates like a like a safety deposit box norway owns the mountain. and the facility <unk> but the depositors own the seed <unk> . and if anything happens <unk> then they can come back and get it this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states of. <unk> an international institution from syria <unk> i think it 's interesting in that. this facility i think is. almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries <unk> literally every country in the world because we have seeds from every country in the world. all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that 's both long term <unk> sustainable. and positive <unk> i can 't think of anything else that 's happened in my lifetime that way i can 't look you in the eyes. and tell you that i have a solution for climate change for. the water crisis agriculture takes seventy percent of fresh water supplies on earth <unk> . i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things or the energy crisis <unk> or world hunger or peace in conflict i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that but i can look you in the eyes. and tell you that we can 't solve any of those problems. if we don 't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of. an effective <unk> efficient <unk> sustainable. solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity because quite literally. <unk> agriculture doesn 't adapt to climate change <unk> neither will we and if crops don 't adapt. to climate change <unk> neither will agriculture <unk> neither will we . so this is not something pretty and nice to do there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it it is i agree a nice thing to do <unk> . <unk> a very real sense. i believe that we as an international community should get organized to complete the task <unk> . the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us <unk> but it 's not the complete answer . we need to collect the remaining diversity that 's out there <unk> we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer. those seeds to researchers in the future <unk> we need to catalog it it 's a library of life. <unk> now i would say we don 't have a card catalog for it and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that. while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university . we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat. <unk> thirty million dollars in an endowment. would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever <unk> so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms . and my final thought is that. we of course <unk> by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may . quite simply end up saving.
