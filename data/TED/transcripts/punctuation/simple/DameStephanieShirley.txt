 <unk> when i wrote my memoir the publishers were really confused was it about me as a child refugee <unk>. or as a woman who set up a. <unk> one that went public and eventually employed over eight thousand five hundred people . or was it as a mother of an autistic child <unk> . or as a philanthropist that 's now given away serious money well it turns out i 'm all of these so let me tell you my story <unk>. <unk> all that i am stems from when i got onto a train in vienna <unk> . part of the kindertransport that saved nearly ten thousand jewish children from nazi europe <unk> . i was five years old clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to what was going on what is england. <unk> i 'm only alive because so long ago <unk> i was helped by generous strangers <unk> . i was lucky <unk> and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents <unk> but . sadly <unk> i never bonded with them again <unk> . but i 've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train. <unk> would ever have dreamed possible <unk> . and i love england my adopted country with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel <unk> . i decided to make mine. a life that was worth saving <unk> and then <unk> i just got on with it. <unk> let me take you back to the early <unk>. to get past the gender issues of the time <unk> i set up my own software house at one of the first. such startups in britain but it was also a company of women a. <unk> and people laughed at the very idea because software at that time was given away free with hardware <unk> nobody would buy software certainly not from a woman . although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees. <unk> there was a glass ceiling to our progress. <unk> and i 'd hit that glass ceiling too often <unk> and i wanted opportunities for women. <unk> i recruited professionally qualified women who 'd left the industry on marriage or when their first child was expected. and structured them into a <unk>. <unk> organization we pioneered the concept of women going back into the. <unk> when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me . for years i was the first woman this <unk> or the only woman that and in those days. <unk> on the stock exchange i couldn 't drive a bus or fly an airplane. indeed i couldn 't open a bank account without my husband 's permission . my generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay <unk> . nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all. <unk> the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities <unk> and i couldn 't. really face that so i started to challenge the. conventions of the time <unk> . even to the extent of changing my name from stephanie to steve in my business development letters <unk> so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a. <unk> she . my company called freelance programmers and that 's precisely what it was . couldn 't have started smaller on the dining room table <unk> and financed by. the equivalent of one hundred dollars in today 's terms <unk> and financed by my labor and by. <unk> borrowing against the house my interests were scientific the market was commercial. things such as payroll which i found rather boring. so i had to compromise with operational research work which had the intellectual. <unk> lots of stock control <unk> and eventually the work came in . we disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by. <unk> offering fixed prices one of the very first to do so . and who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder of supersonic concord would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes. <unk> used was a simple trust the staff approach. and a simple telephone <unk> we even used to ask job applicants do you have access to a telephone . an early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols. <unk> and software was and still is a maddeningly. <unk> activity so that was enormously valuable. we used the standards ourselves <unk> we were even paid to update them over the years <unk> and eventually <unk> they were adopted by nato . our programmers remember only women <unk> including gay and transgender. worked with pencil and paper to develop. <unk> flowcharts defining each task to be done . and they then wrote code <unk> . usually machine code <unk> sometimes binary code <unk> which was then sent by mail to a data center. to be punched onto paper tape or card. and then. <unk> in order to verify it all this before it ever got near a computer that was programming in the early <unk>. thirteen years from startup equal opportunity legislation came in in britain and that made it illegal to. <unk> and as an example of unintended consequences my female company had to let the men in . when i started my company of women the men. said how interesting because it only works because it 's small . <unk> and later as it became sizable they accepted yes it is sizable now <unk> but of no strategic interest . and later when it was a. company valued at over three billion dollars <unk> and i 'd made seventy of the staff into millionaires <unk> they sort of said. <unk> you can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads they 're. flat on top for being patted patronizingly . and we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink . let me share with you two. <unk> secrets of success <unk> surround yourself with <unk>. <unk> people and people that you like <unk> and choose your partner very very carefully. because the other day when i said my husband 's an angel a woman complained. <unk> if success were easy <unk> we 'd all be millionaires <unk> . but in my case it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed <unk> crisis . our late son giles was an only child. beautiful contented baby <unk> and then at two and a half . like a changeling in a fairy story <unk> he lost the little speech that he had. and turned into a wild <unk> unmanageable toddler . <unk> not the terrible twos he was profoundly autistic and he never spoke again <unk> . giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism . and then there 's been a groundbreaking prior 's court school for pupils with autism. <unk> medical research charity again all for autism because whenever i found a gap in services <unk> i tried to help <unk> . i like doing new things and making new things happen <unk> and i 've just started. a three year think tank for autism . and so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems <unk> i 've also founded. the oxford internet institute and other it ventures. the oxford internet institute focuses not on the technology <unk> but on the social economic <unk> legal and ethical issues of the internet <unk> . giles died unexpectedly seventeen. <unk> and i have learned to live without him <unk> and i have learned to live without his need of me. philanthropy is all that i do now i need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me. <unk> it 's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise <unk> but as many people in this room will know making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy. and determination the courage to risk family and home and a. <unk> seven commitment that borders on the obsessive <unk> so it 's just as well that i 'm a workaholic . i believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in. humility . work is not just something i do when i 'd rather be doing something else . we live our lives forward. <unk> so what has all that taught me i learned. that tomorrow 's never going to be like today and certainly nothing like yesterday <unk> . and that made me able to cope with change indeed eventually to welcome change <unk> . though i 'm told i 'm.
