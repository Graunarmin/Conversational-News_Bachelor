 <unk> i work with a species called bonobo and i 'm happy most of the time because i think this is the happiest species on the planet . it 's kind of a <unk> well kept secret this species lives only in the congo. <unk> and they 're not in too many zoos <unk> because of their sexual behavior . their sexual behavior is too human like for most of us to be comfortable with but . actually <unk> we have a lot to learn from them because they 're. a very egalitarian society and they 're a very empathetic society . and sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they. sort of set aside it permeates their. <unk> entire life and it 's used for communication and it 's used for conflict resolution <unk> and. i think perhaps somewhere in our history. we sort of divided our lives up into lots of parts . we divided our world up with lots of categories <unk> and so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit <unk> . but i don 't think that we were that way initially . there are many. <unk> who think that the animal world is <unk> hard wired. and that there 's something very very special about man <unk> maybe it 's his ability to have causal thought <unk> . maybe it 's something special in his brain that allows him to have language <unk> . maybe it 's something special in his brain. <unk> i don 't know there were tasmanians. who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire . they had no stone tools to our knowledge they had no music <unk> . so when you compare them to the bonobo. <unk> the bonobo is a little hairier . <unk> doesn 't stand quite as upright <unk> but there are a lot of similarities <unk> and. i think that as we look at culture <unk> we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are . and i don 't really think it 's in our biology <unk> i think we 've attributed it to our biology <unk>. <unk> but i don 't really think it 's there so what i want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo <unk> . this is kanzi <unk> . he 's a bonobo right now he 's in a forest in georgia his mother originally came. from a forest in africa and she came to us when she was just at puberty about six or seven. <unk> years of age . now this shows a bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left <unk> clearly the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking . the bonobo <unk> although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright <unk> just as we are . this shows the bonobo compared to an australopithecine like lucy as you can see there 's not. <unk> a lot of difference between the way a bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked . as they turn toward us you 'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines. is a little flatter. and doesn 't have to rotate quite so much from side to side so the the bipedal gait is a little easier <unk> and now we see all. canopied trees as tall as forty meters one hundred and thirty feet <unk> grow densely in the area . it was a japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo <unk> almost three decades ago <unk>. <unk> by nature very gentle creatures long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them <unk> . one discovery was that wild bonobos often walk. <unk> go say hello to austin first and then go to the a frame ss . this is kanzi and i in the forest none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained. <unk> tricks they all happened to be captured on film spontaneously by nhk of japan. <unk> we need more sticks too . i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one . that 's a wasps ' nest you can get it out i. hope i have a lighter. <unk> can use the lighter to start the fire ss so kanzi. is very interested in fire <unk> he doesn 't do it yet without a lighter <unk> but i think. if he saw someone do it he might be able to do make a fire without a lighter <unk> he 's learning about how to keep a fire going he. <unk> very happy about this part you 've got to put some water on the fire you see the water. <unk> farther than we can hear <unk> . <unk> 's got the pedals down but not the wheel. <unk> she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel. <unk> knows that that individual in the mirror is her video narrator . by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human . and documenting their development across two decades . scientists are exploring how cultural. <unk> panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors in the wild. <unk> parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring. here panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to groom nyota . very impressive <unk> . subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this. <unk> nyota tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself. <unk> realizing that nyota might get hurt <unk> panbanisha like any human mother <unk> carefully tugs to get the scissors back. <unk> kanzi 's learned to make stone tools video kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them two and a half million years ago. by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other. <unk> he has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows <unk> he can make much larger sharper flakes . kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough . the tough hide is difficult to cut <unk> even with. <unk> is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making <unk> but difficult to handle <unk> requiring great skill . kanzi 's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two and a half million years ago . these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made <unk> the flat sharp edges are like knife. <unk> compare them to the tools our ancestors used . they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi 's . panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods. <unk> something we didn 't think they would do video for several days now panbanisha has not been outside ss . i normally talk about language video then panbanisha does something unexpected . ss but since i 'm advised not to do what i normally do i haven 't told you that these apes have language it 's a geometric language. <unk> she writing ss . she 's also saying the name of that with. her voice video now she comes up to dr sue and starts writing again ss these are her symbols on. her keyboard they speak when she touches them video panbanisha is communicating to dr sue where she wants to go. in the woods <unk> compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard. panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest. <unk> first we didn 't really realize what she was doing until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it video this lexigram. to a place in the woods <unk> the curved line is very similar to the lexigram. the next symbol panbanisha writes represents collar it indicates the collar that panbanisha must wear when she goes out. <unk> requirement video this symbol is not as clear as the others. but one can see panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines <unk> . researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk . panbanisha watched <unk> soon she began to write as well. the bonobo 's abilities have stunned scientists around the world . how did they develop ss we found that the most important thing for permitting bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them <unk> . it 's simply to use language around them <unk> . because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you. once you have that capacity <unk> the ability to produce language. comes rather naturally and rather freely . so we want to create an environment in which bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting we want to create an environment in which they have fun <unk> . and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them. <unk> this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha . panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica <unk> . until nyota now one year old steals it <unk> . then he peers eagerly into his mother. <unk> 's mouth is he looking for where the sound came from . dr sue thinks it 's important to allow such curiosity to flourish. this time panbanisha is playing the electric piano <unk> she wasn 't forced to learn the piano. <unk> saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. <unk> kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun filled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. <unk> stay away from them now . now you can chase them again time to chase. them now you have to stay away get away run away run . <unk> now we can chase them again. <unk> we 're learning how to become like them we 're learning how to communicate with them <unk> in really high pitched tones <unk> . we 're learning that they probably have a language in the wild <unk> and they 're learning to become like us because we believe that it 's not. <unk> it 's culture so we 're sharing tools and technology and language with another species.
