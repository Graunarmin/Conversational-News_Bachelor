 <unk> i live in south central . this is south central <unk> liquor stores <unk> . fast food . vacant lots <unk> so the city planners they get together and they figure they 're going to change the name south central to make it represent something. <unk> else <unk> so they change it to south los angeles <unk> like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city this. is south los angeles . liquor stores <unk> fast food vacant lots just like twenty six point. <unk> people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles <unk> for instance the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times. <unk> ten miles away. i got tired of of seeing this happening <unk> and i was wondering how would you feel. if you had no access to healthy food <unk> if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood <unk>. i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars <unk> i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks. <unk> i figured this has to stop <unk> <unk> so i figured that. the problem is the solution . food is the problem and food is the solution <unk> . plus i got tired of driving forty five minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn 't impregnated with pesticides <unk> . so what i did i planted a food forest in front of my house. <unk> a strip of land that we call a parkway it 's one hundred and fifty feet by ten feet thing is it 's owned by the city <unk> . but you have to maintain it so i 'm like cool . i can do whatever the hell i <unk>. <unk> 's my responsibility and i gotta maintain it and this is how i decided to. <unk> so me and my group l a green grounds we got together and we started planting my food forest fruit trees you know the whole nine <unk> vegetables what we do we 're a pay it forward kind of group . where it 's composed of gardeners from all walks of life from all over the city and it 's completely volunteer and everything we do is free . and the garden it was beautiful . and then somebody complained the city came down on. <unk> basically gave me a citation saying that i had to remove my garden which this citation was turning into a warrant and i 'm like come on really . a warrant for planting food on on a piece of land that you could care less about . and i was like cool bring it because this time it wasn 't coming up . <unk> got ahold of it steve lopez did a story on it and and. talked to the councilman <unk> and one of the green grounds members they put up. a petition on change org and with nine hundred signatures <unk> we were a success we had a victory on our hands <unk> my councilman even called in. and said how they endorse and love what we 're doing <unk> i mean come on why. <unk> the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns they own twenty six square miles. of vacant lots that 's twenty central parks that 's enough space to plant seven hundred and <unk>. <unk> million tomato plants why in the hell would they not okay this growing one plant will give you one thousand ten thousand. <unk> seeds <unk> when one dollar 's worth of green beans. will give you seventy five dollars ' worth of produce it 's my gospel when i 'm telling people grow your own food <unk> growing your own food is like printing your own money . <unk> i have a legacy in south central <unk> . i grew up there <unk> i raised my sons there <unk> . and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people and i 'm manufacturing my own reality . see i 'm an artist. <unk> gardening is my graffiti i grow my art . <unk> just like a graffiti artist . where they beautify walls me <unk> . i beautify lawns <unk> parkways <unk> . i use the garden the soil like it 's a piece of cloth and the plants and the trees <unk> that 's my embellishment for that cloth . you 'd be surprised what what. the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. <unk> you just couldn 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is. and how it affects people <unk> so what. what happened <unk> . i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood . to change the community you have to change the composition of the soil <unk> we are the soil. <unk> be surprised. how kids are affected by this gardening is the most. therapeutic and defiant act you can do. especially in the inner city <unk> plus you get strawberries . i remember this time. <unk> thirty at night and they were in my yard <unk> . and i came out and they looked so ashamed so i 'm like . man it made me feel bad that they were there and i told them <unk> you know you don 't have to do this like this . this is on the street for a reason <unk> . it made me feel ashamed to see people. that were this close to me that were hungry. <unk> the whole idea <unk> i want them to take it but at the same time i want them to take back their health . there 's another time when <unk>. i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles these are the guys they helped me. <unk> unload the truck it was cool <unk> and they just shared the stories about how. this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother and it was just cool to see how this how this changed them if it was only for for that one moment <unk> . so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe twenty gardens <unk> we 've had like. <unk> like <unk> fifty people come to our dig ins and participate and it 's all volunteers if kids grow kale <unk> kids eat kale . if they grow tomatoes <unk> . they eat tomatoes <unk> . but when none of this is is presented to them <unk> if they 're not shown how food affects the mind and the body they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. i see young people and. they want to work <unk> . but they 're in this thing where they 're caught up i see kids of color and they 're just on this track that 's designed for them. <unk> that leads them to nowhere <unk> so with with gardening i see an opportunity where we can train these kids. to have a sustainable life. and when we do this who knows we might produce the next george george washington <unk> carver but if we don 't change the composition of the soil <unk> we will never do this <unk> . now this is this is one of my plans this is what i want to do . i want to plant a whole. block of gardens. <unk> where people can share in the food in the same block <unk> i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. <unk> now don 't get me wrong i 'm not talking about no free shit <unk> because. free is not sustainable the. funny thing about sustainability <unk> you have to sustain it . i 'm talking about is putting people to work and. getting kids off the street and letting them know the joy the pride and the honor in growing your own food <unk> opening farmer 's markets. so what i want to do here <unk> we gotta make this sexy <unk> . so i want us all to become ecolutionary renegades <unk> gangstas gangsta gardeners. get gangsta with your shovel okay and let that be your weapon of choice. so basically <unk> if you want to meet with me <unk> . <unk> don 't call me if you want to sit around in in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit. where you talk about doing some shit <unk> if you want to meet with me come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit.
