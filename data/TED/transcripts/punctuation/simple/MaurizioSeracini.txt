 <unk> i met in florence a professor carlo pedretti my former. professor of art history <unk> and today a world renowned scholar. of leonardo da vinci <unk> well <unk> he asked me if i could find some technological way. to unfold. a five centuries old mystery. related to. a lost masterpiece by leonardo da vinci the battle of anghiari which is supposed to be located. in the hall of the five hundred in palazzo vecchio in florence <unk> well <unk> . in the mid ' 70s there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me <unk> especially in italy <unk> and so i decided with. some researchers from the united states and the university of florence to start probing. the murals. decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the five hundred searching for the lost leonardo <unk> unfortunately at that time. we did not know that. that was not exactly where we should be looking. because we had to go much deeper in <unk> and so the research came to a halt <unk> and it was only taken up in two thousand thanks to the. <unk> interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family <unk> well <unk> this time we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the five hundred was before the remodeling <unk> . and the so called sala grande <unk> which was built in one thousand four hundred and ninety four and to find out the original doors windows <unk> and. in order to do that we first created a. <unk> and then with thermography we went on to discover hidden windows these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande . we also found out about the height of the ceiling <unk> and we managed to reconstruct therefore all the layout of this original hall. the way it was before there came vasari <unk> and restructured the whole thing <unk> including. a staircase that that was very important in order to precisely place the battle of. on a specific area. of one of the two walls <unk> well <unk> we also learned that vasari <unk> who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the five hundred between one thousand five hundred and sixty <unk>. by the grand duke cosimo i of the medici family <unk> we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically. by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap. one that we [ see ] here masaccio the church of santa maria novella in florence . so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci and so. we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls. and searching for. an air gap <unk> and we did find. <unk> many on the right panel of the east wall an air gap <unk> and. that 's where we believe the battle of anghiari or at least the part that we know has been painted which is called the fight for the standard should be located <unk> well. from there <unk> unfortunately in two thousand and four the project. came to a halt <unk> many political reasons so i decided to go back to my alma mater and. <unk> the university of california san diego and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for. cultural heritage <unk> . and in two thousand and seven we created <unk> cisa3. as a research center for cultural heritage specifically art architecture and archaeology so students started to flow in and we started to build technologies because that 's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and go and do fieldwork. <unk> we came back in the hall of the five hundred in two thousand and eleven . and this time with a great group of students and my colleague professor falko kuester who is now the director at cisa3 . and we. came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left <unk>. <unk> we were confined though <unk> limited i should rather say for several reasons that it 's not worth explaining to endoscopy only of the many other options we had <unk> . and with a 4mm camera attached to it <unk> we were successful. in. documenting and. taking some fragments of. what it turns out to be a reddish. <unk> black color and there is some beige fragments that later on. we ran a much more sophisticated exams <unk> xrf <unk> x ray diffraction . and the results are very positive so far it seems to indicate that indeed. we have found some pigments and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about sixty years. <unk> those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to leonardo <unk> well <unk> we are searching for the highest. and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind <unk> as a matter of fact <unk> this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever. had and for doing. this great masterpiece he was named the number one artist influence at. <unk> i had also had the privilege since the last thirty seven years. to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me but basically to do what well to assess for example the state of conservation see here the face of the. madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another different lady . aged lady i should rather say there is a lot of varnish still sitting there. <unk> several retouches and some over cleaning <unk> it becomes very visible <unk> but also technology has helped to write new pages of our history or at least to update pages of our histories for example the lady with the unicorn another painting by rafael <unk> . well <unk> you see the unicorn a lot has been said and written about the unicorn <unk> but if you take an x ray of the unicorn it. <unk> with the scientific examination of this painting came out. that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog <unk> actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the. the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable . <unk> just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art . there would be a cultural revolution to say the least but also i would say a market revolution let me add take this example <unk> otto marseus <unk> nice painting. <unk> which is still life at the pitti gallery <unk> and just have an infrared camera peering through . and luckily for art historians it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus it even says. when it was made and also the location <unk> so that was a good result <unk>. <unk> not that good <unk> and so <unk> again authenticity and science. could go together and change the way . not attributions being made but at least lay the ground for a more objective <unk> or i should rather say. <unk> as it is done today <unk> but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination my admiration is. the incredibly vivid drawing under this. layer brown layer of the adoration of the magi here you see a handmade setting. xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it and just peering through this brown layer of this. <unk> masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath . well this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci <unk> and. look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries look at these portraits <unk> they 're magnificent you see leonardo at work. <unk> you see the geniality of his creation <unk> right. directly on the ground layer of the panel <unk> and see this cool thing <unk> finding i should rather say. an elephant because of this elephant <unk> over seventy new images came out never seen for centuries . this was an epiphany <unk> we came to understand and to prove. that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci <unk> which left us only. <unk> the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see so thanks only to. technology <unk> well <unk> the tablet <unk> well <unk> we thought well <unk> if we all have this pleasure this. privilege to see all this to find all these discoveries what about for everybody else so we thought of. an augmented reality application using a tablet let me show you just. <unk> simulating what we could be doing <unk> any of us could be doing <unk> in a museum environment . so let 's say that we go to a museum with a tablet okay . and we just aim. the camera of the tablet. to the painting that we are interested to see. <unk> and now. let me turn to you so the moment the the image or i should say the camera has locked in the the painting then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded <unk> . and so. see we can as we said we can zoom in then we can scroll . okay let 's go and. <unk> all we need is one finger just wipe off and we see the elephant . and then if we want we can continue the scroll to find out for example on the staircase the whole iconography is going to be changed. <unk> a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple <unk> and there are a lot of figures showing up see . this is not just a curiosity because it changes not just the iconography as you see it <unk> but the iconology <unk> the meaning of the painting . and. we believe this is a cool way easy way that everybody could have access to to become more the protagonist of your own. <unk> and not just be so passive about it as we are when we walk through. endless rooms of museums another concept is. the digital clinical chart <unk> which sounds very <unk>. <unk> obvious if we were to talk about real patients <unk> but when we talk about works of art unfortunately it 's never been tapped as an idea <unk> . <unk> that this should be the beginning the very first step to do real conservation <unk> and. allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation <unk> the technique materials and also if when and why we should. restore or rather to intervene on on the environment. surrounding the painting <unk> well <unk> our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance create a new discipline where engineering. <unk> heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together <unk> . we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work. and rediscover for us these values these cultural values that we badly need <unk> especially today.
