 <unk> it 's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don 't see and they say. <unk> how can i be a sociologist <unk> how can i understand those invisible forces and i say empathy start. with empathy <unk> it all begins with empathy take yourself out of your shoes <unk> put yourself into the shoes of another person here i 'll. give you an example . so i imagine my life. if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal <unk> and they found it. <unk> in fact they found lots of it right here and pretty soon they began shipping that coal . ton by ton railcar by railcar boatload by boatload back to china and elsewhere around the world . and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so and they built beautiful cities. all powered. on that coal <unk> and back. <unk> here. in the united states <unk> we saw economic despair deprivation this is what i saw i saw people struggling to get by . not knowing what was what and what was next <unk> . and i asked myself the question <unk> how is it possible that we could be so poor here in the united states because coal is such a wealthy resource. <unk> so much money and i realize because the chinese. ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the united states <unk> who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves <unk> . and the rest of us the vast majority of us <unk> struggle to get by <unk> . and the chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure. that people like me would not speak out against this relationship. <unk> this sound familiar <unk> . and they did things like train americans to help protect the coal . and everywhere there were symbols of the chinese everywhere a constant reminder <unk> . and back in china . what do they say in china nothing. <unk> i 'm not going to turn down my thermostat <unk> you can 't expect that and so i get angry <unk> and i get pissed as do. lots of average people and we fight back and it gets really ugly and the chinese respond in a very ugly way . and before we know it they send in the tanks and they send in the troops <unk> and lots of people are dying. <unk> a very very difficult situation <unk> can you imagine what you would feel. if you were in my shoes <unk> . can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there <unk> or a truck full of soldiers. just imagine what you would feel because you know. <unk> you know what they 're doing here and you just feel the anger and you feel the fear <unk>. <unk> if you can that 's empathy <unk> that 's empathy <unk> you 've left your shoes and you 've stood in mine and. you 've got to feel that <unk> ok so that 's the warm up that 's the warm up now we 're going to have. the real radical experiment <unk> so for the remainder of my talk what i want you to do. is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary arab muslim. living in the middle east in particular in iraq. <unk> and so to help you . perhaps you 're a member of this middle class family in baghdad <unk>. what you want is the best for your kids you want your kids to have a better life <unk> and you watch the news you pay attention <unk> you read the newspaper you go down to the coffee shop with your friends you read the newspapers from around the world sometimes. <unk> you even watch satellite cnn from the united states <unk> you have a sense of what the americans are thinking <unk> but really you just want a better life for yourself that 's what you want . you 're arab muslim. living in iraq <unk> you want a better life for yourself <unk> so here <unk> let me help you let me help you with some things that you might be thinking <unk> number one . this incursion into your land. these past twenty years and. <unk> before the reason anyone is interested in your land and particularly the united states is oil. it 's all about oil <unk> you know that everybody knows that people back in the united states know it 's about oil. <unk> it 's because somebody else has a design for your resource it 's your resource it 's not somebody else 's it 's your land. <unk> it 's your resource somebody else has a design for it <unk> . and you know why they have a design you know why they have their their eyes set on it <unk> because they have an entire economic system that 's dependent on that oil. foreign oil oil from other parts of the world that they don 't own <unk> . and what else do you think about these people. <unk> the americans they 're rich come on they live in big houses they have big cars they all have blond hair blue eyes <unk> . they 're happy you think that it 's not true of course but that 's the media impression and that 's what you get. and they have big cities and the cities are all dependent on oil <unk> . and back home <unk> what do you see <unk> poverty despair <unk> struggle . look you don 't live in a wealthy country <unk> i mean this is iraq. <unk> this is what you see <unk> you see people. <unk> not easy you see a lot of poverty and you feel something about this these people have designs for your resource and this is what you see . something else you see that you talk about americans don 't talk about this but you do there 's this thing this militarization of the world and it 's centered right in the united states and the united states. is responsible for almost one half of the world 's military spending. <unk> four percent of the world 's population and you feel it you see it every day it 's part of your life <unk> and you talk about it. with your friends you read about it <unk> and back when saddam hussein was in power . the americans didn 't care about his crimes

hub of democracy around the world. they don 't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world . there are a lot of countries oil producing countries that aren 't very democratic but supported by the united states that 's. odd oh. <unk> these two wars the ten years of sanctions the eight years. of occupation the insurgency that 's been unleashed on your people <unk>
