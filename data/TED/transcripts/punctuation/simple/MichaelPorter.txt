 <unk> all aware that the world today is full of problems we 've been hearing them. today and yesterday and and every day for decades <unk> serious problems <unk>. <unk> pressing problems poor nutrition <unk> access to water <unk> climate change deforestation . lack of skills insecurity <unk> not enough food not enough healthcare pollution there. 's problem after problem and i think what really separates this time from any time i can remember in in my brief time. on earth is the awareness of these problems we 're all very aware why are we having so much. <unk> trouble dealing with these problems that 's the question i 've been struggling with coming from my very different. perspective <unk> i 'm not a social problem guy <unk> . i 'm a guy that works with business <unk> helps business make money <unk> god forbid <unk> . so why are we having so. <unk> with these social problems <unk> and really is there any role for business and if so what is that role . i think that in order to address that question we have to step back and think about. how we 've understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face. <unk> now i think many have seen business. as the problem or at least one of the problems in many of the social challenges we face you know. think of the fast food industry the drug industry the banking industry you know this is a low point. in the respect for business . business is not seen as the solution it 's seen as the problem now for most people <unk> and rightly so in many cases there 's a. <unk> lot of bad actors out there. that have done the wrong thing that actually have made the problem worse so this perspective is perhaps justified . how have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems <unk> . these many issues that we face in society <unk> . well we 've tended to see the solutions in terms of ngos in terms of government in terms of philanthropy. indeed the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise. of ngos and. social organizations this is a unique new organizational form that we 've seen grown up enormous innovation <unk> enormous energy <unk> . enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure. to try to deal with all of these. challenges <unk> and many of us here are deeply involved in that. <unk> i 'm a business school professor but i 've actually founded. i think now four nonprofits <unk> whenever i got interested and became aware of a societal problem <unk> that was what i did <unk> . form a nonprofit <unk>. <unk> that was the way we 've thought about how to deal with these issues even a business school professor. has thought about it that way . but i think at this moment we 've been at this for quite a while we 've been aware of these problems for decades <unk> we have decades of experience. <unk> with our ngos and with our government entities and there 's an awkward reality the awkward reality is we 're not making fast enough progress <unk> we 're not winning. problems still seem very daunting and very intractable and any solutions we 're achieving are small solutions . we 're making incremental progress . what 's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems <unk> if we cut all the. complexity away we have the problem. <unk> scale <unk> we can 't scale <unk> . we can make progress we can show benefits we can show results we can make things better. <unk> we 're helping <unk> we 're doing better <unk> we 're doing good <unk> we can 't scale <unk> . we can 't make a large scale impact. <unk> why is that because we don 't have the resources . and that 's really clear now <unk> and that 's clearer now than it 's been for decades <unk> there 's simply not enough money. to deal with any of these problems at scale. using the current model <unk> there 's not enough tax revenue <unk> there 's not. <unk> enough philanthropic donations . to deal with these problems the way we 're dealing with them now we 've got to. confront that reality <unk> and the scarcity of resources. for dealing with these problems is is only growing <unk> certainly in the advanced world. today with all the fiscal problems we face. <unk> if it 's fundamentally a resource problem. <unk> where are the resources in society <unk> . how are those resources really created the resources we 're going to need to deal with all these societal challenges <unk> . well there i think the answer is very clear they 're in business. all wealth is actually created by business. <unk> business creates wealth. when it meets needs. at a profit that 's how all wealth is created <unk> it 's meeting needs at a profit. that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations <unk> that 's where all the resources come. <unk> only business can actually create resources other institutions can utilize them to do important work <unk> but only business can create them . and business creates them when it 's able to meet a need. at a profit . the resources are overwhelmingly generated by business. <unk> the question then is how do we. tap into this how do we tap into this . business generates those resources when it makes a profit . that profit is that small difference between. the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they 're trying to solve <unk> but that. <unk> profit. is the magic <unk> why because that profit. allows whatever solution we 've created. to be infinitely scalable . because if we can make a profit <unk> we can do it for ten <unk> one hundred a million <unk> one hundred million. a billion <unk> the solution becomes <unk> self sustaining . that 's what business does when it makes a profit . now what does this all have to do with social problems <unk> well one line of thinking is. <unk> let 's take this profit and redeploy it. into social problems <unk> . business should give more business should be more responsible <unk> and that 's been the path that we 've been on in business <unk> . but again this path that we 've been on is not getting us where we need to go . now <unk> i started out as a strategy professor and i 'm still a strategy. <unk> i 'm proud of that but i 've also <unk> over the years worked more and more on social issues i 've worked on healthcare <unk> the environment <unk> . economic development reducing poverty <unk> and as i worked more and more in the social field <unk> . i started seeing something that had a profound impact on me. and my whole life. <unk> and the view in business has historically been that actually there 's a tradeoff between. social performance and economic performance the conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit. by causing a social problem the classic example is pollution. <unk> it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution <unk> reducing pollution is expensive therefore. businesses don 't want to do it . it 's profitable to have an unsafe working environment it 's too expensive to have a safe working environment <unk> therefore business makes more money if they don 't have a safe working environment that 's been the conventional wisdom . a lot of companies have fallen into. <unk> that conventional wisdom they resisted environmental improvement they resisted workplace improvement. <unk> that thinking. has led to i think much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business that i come to criticize in business <unk> . but the more deeply i got into all these social issues <unk> one after another. <unk> and actually the more i tried to address them myself personally in a few cases through nonprofits that i was involved with . the more i found actually that the reality is the opposite . business does not profit from causing social problems actually not in any fundamental sense . that 's a very simplistic view <unk> the deeper we get into these issues. <unk> the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems that 's where the real profit comes let. 's take pollution <unk> . we 've learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit it saves. <unk> business more productive and efficient it doesn 't waste resources . having a safer working environment actually and avoiding accidents . it makes the business more profitable because it it 's a sign of good processes <unk> accidents are expensive. and costly issue by issue by issue we start to learn that actually there 's no trade off between. social progress and economic efficiency. in any. <unk> sense another issue is health i mean <unk> what we 've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure because. that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent <unk> the deeper work the new work the new thinking. on the interface between. <unk> social problems is actually showing that there 's a fundamental deep. synergy <unk> particularly if you 're not thinking in the very short run in the very short run you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking. that there 's fundamentally opposing goals but in the long run ultimately we 're learning. in field after field that this is simply not true so how could we tap into the power of business. <unk> to address the fundamental problems that we face <unk> . imagine if we could do that because if we could do it we could scale <unk> . we could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity. <unk> and guess what that 's happening now finally <unk> . partly because of. people like you. who have. <unk> raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade . we see organizations like dow chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products . this is an example of jain irrigation this is a company that 's brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers <unk> reducing substantially the use of water <unk> . we see companies like the brazilian forestry company. <unk> fibria that 's figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare. of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees <unk> you see companies like cisco that are training so far four million people in i t skills. <unk> be responsible but help expand the opportunity to disseminate i t technology and grow the whole business <unk> there 's a fundamental opportunity. for business today. to impact and address these social problems <unk> and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity. we see in business . and the question is how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value. this is what i call shared value addressing a social issue with a business model <unk> . that 's shared value . shared value is capitalism <unk> but it 's a higher kind of capitalism it 's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be meeting important needs . not incrementally competing for. trivial differences in. <unk> and market share shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously <unk> it 's finding those opportunities. that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale <unk> . we can address shared value at multiple levels <unk> . it 's real it 's happening . but in order to get this solution. <unk> working we have to now change how business sees itself . and this is thankfully underway . businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom that they shouldn 't worry about social problems that this was sort of something on the side that somebody else was doing it <unk> . we 're now seeing companies embrace this. <unk> but we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have ngos and government working in partnership with. business <unk> the new ngos that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships that have found these ways to collaborate the governments that are making the most progress. are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business. rather than see government as the only player that has to. <unk> call the shots and government has many ways in which it could impact. the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way <unk> . i think if we can get business seeing itself differently <unk> and if we can get others seeing business differently <unk> we can change the world . i know it <unk> i 'm seeing it i 'm. <unk> i 'm feeling it . young people i think my harvard business school students are getting it if we can break down this sort of. divide this unease this tension this sense that we 're not. fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems we can break this down and we finally i think can have. solutions thank you.
