 <unk> is the air jordan three black cement . this might be the most important sneaker in history <unk> . first released in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight this is the shoe that started nike marketing as we know it this is the shoe that. <unk> propelled the entire air jordan lineage <unk> and perhaps saved nike . the air jordan three black cement did for sneakers what the iphone did for phones <unk> it 's been re released four times . every celebrity 's been seen wearing it there 's a site about what to wear with the black cement <unk> it 's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down . and right about now most of. <unk> you are probably thinking sneakers . yes <unk> yes sneakers <unk> some extraordinary things about sneakers. and data and nike and how they 're all related possibly to the future of all online commerce <unk>. <unk> in two thousand and eleven the last time the jordan three black cement was released at a retail of one hundred and sixty dollars <unk> it sold out globally in minutes <unk> . and that 's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale . and just minutes after that thousands of those pairs were on ebay for two and three times retail . in fact there 's over one thousand pairs on ebay right now four years later <unk> . but here 's the thing this happens every single saturday. every week there 's another release or two or three and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the jordan three black cement . this is nike building the marketplace for. <unk> very important demographic <unk> these are the tastemakers <unk> these are the apple fanboys <unk> . because who else is going to buy a pair of $ eight thousand back to the future sneakers . yeah <unk> eight thousand dollars <unk> and while that 's obviously the anomaly the resell sneaker market is definitely. <unk> years in the making what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much . now we have sneaker addictions . in a market where in the past twelve months there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the united states alone at a value of one point two billion dollars <unk> . and that 's a conservative estimate. <unk> i should know <unk> i am a sneakerhead this is my collection in the pantheon of great collections mine doesn 't even register <unk> . i have about two hundred and fifty pairs but trust me <unk> i am small time people have thousands i 'm a very typical <unk> 37 year old sneakerhead . i grew up playing basketball when michael jordan played i always wanted air jordans my mother would never buy me air jordans as soon as i got some. <unk> money i bought air jordans literally we all have the exact same story <unk> but here 's where mine diverged <unk> . after starting three companies i took a job as a strategy consultant when i very quickly realized. that i didn 't know the first thing about data <unk> . but i learned <unk> because i had to . and i liked it so i thought i wonder if i could get ahold of some sneaker data just to play with for my own amusement . the goal was to develop a price guide a real data driven view of the market. and four years later we 're analyzing over twenty five million transactions providing real time analytics on thousands of sneakers <unk> . now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases <unk> . others have used the data to validate insurance claims . and the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry <unk> and here 's the best part. have sneaker portfolios laughter. sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time compare it to others and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account <unk> . so sneakerhead dan builds his collection and identifies which three hundred and fifty two are his . he can see it 's worth one hundred and three thousand dollars frankly a modest collection . at the asset level. he can see gain loss by shoe here he 's made over six hundred dollars on one pair i have one of those . so an unregulated one point two billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online and has spawned fundamental financial services for. <unk> at some point i asked myself what 's really going on in the market <unk> and two comparisons started to emerge are sneakers more like stocks. or drugs in fact one guy emailed to say he thought his 15 year old son. was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers . and now they use the data to do it together <unk> and that 's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists and. <unk> don 't just mean the kid selling sneakers <unk> instead of drugs how about all kids you have to be eighteen to play the stock market <unk> . i sold chewing gum in sixth grade <unk> blow pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school . the cards are long dead and the candy market 's usually quite local . for a lot of people. <unk> and accessible investment opportunity. a democratized stock market <unk> . but also unregulated which is why the story you 're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers . and while that definitely happens and is tragic <unk> it 's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe in fact it 's a very. small piece of a much bigger and better story . so sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor . someone is making the rules . in the case of sneakers <unk> that someone. is nike <unk> . let me walk you through some numbers the resell market we know is $ one point two billion nike <unk> including jordan brand accounts for. ninety six percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market <unk> just complete domination sneakerheads love jordans <unk> . and profit on the secondary market is about a third . that means that sneakerheads made three hundred and eighty million dollars selling nikes last year <unk> . let 's jump to retail for a second <unk> skechers earlier this year became the number two footwear brand in the country. <unk> adidas this was a big deal <unk> and in the twelve months ending in june <unk> skechers 's net income was two hundred and nine million dollars . that means that nike 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor . that . how is that even possible. the sneaker market is just supply and demand <unk> but nike 's gotten very good at using supply. limited sneakers and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit . so it 's really just supply. <unk> sneakerheads joke that as long as it 's limited and nike they 'll buy it . shoes that sell for eight thousand dollars do so because they 're very rare <unk> it 's no different than any other collectible market. <unk> only. this isn 't a market at all . it 's a false construct created by nike ingeniously created by nike in the most positive sense to sell more shoes <unk> . and in the process it provided tens of thousands of people with life long passions <unk> myself included . if nike wanted to kill the resell market they could do so. <unk> all they have to do is release more shoes but we certainly don 't want them to nor is it in their best interest . that 's because unlike apple who will sell an iphone to anyone who wants one . nike doesn 't make their money by just selling $ two hundred sneakers <unk> . they sell millions of shoes to millions of people for sixty dollars <unk> . and sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the pr and the brand cachet <unk> and enable nike to sell millions of $ sixty sneakers. it 's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before this isn 't in any textbook . for fifteen years nike has propped up an artificial commodities market <unk> with a facebook level hyped ipo every single weekend . drive by any footlocker at 8am on a saturday morning and there will be a line down the street and around the block <unk> and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week . you know those crazy iphone lines you see on the news every other year. <unk> year . nike lines happen one hundred and four times more often . so nike sets the rules <unk> and they do so by controlling supply and distribution <unk> . but once a pair leaves the retail channel it 's the wild west <unk> there are very few if any legal unregulated markets. <unk> nike is definitely not the stock exchange in fact <unk> there is no central exchange . by last count there were forty eight different online markets that i know of . some are ebay clones some are mobile markets . and then you have consignment shops and brick and mortar stores and sneaker conventions and reseller sites and facebook and instagram and twitter. literally <unk> . <unk> come into contact with each other shoes will be bought and sold but that means. no efficiencies no transparency sometimes not even authenticity can you imagine if that 's how stocks were bought . what if the way to buy a share of apple stock was to search over one hundred places online and off <unk> including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some apple stock . never knowing who had the best price or even if the stock. <unk> were looking at was real that would surely make you say [ wtf ]. of course that 's not how we buy stock <unk> but what if that 's not how we need to buy sneakers either . what if the inverse is true and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock <unk> and what if it wasn 't just sneakers but any similar product. <unk> like watches and handbags and women 's shoes and any collectible any seasonal item and any markdown item what if there was a stock market for commerce . a stock market. of things <unk> . and not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner <unk> . but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market <unk> shorts and options and futures. <unk> maybe you see where this is going <unk> maybe you want to invest in a stock market. of things <unk> because if you had invested in a pair of air jordan three black cement in two thousand and eleven . you could either be wearing them onstage . or have earned one hundred and sixty two percent on your money double the s & p and twenty percent more than apple . and that 's why we 're talking about sneakers <unk> thank you.
