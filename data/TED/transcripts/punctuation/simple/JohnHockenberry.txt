 <unk> my dad was which is kind of an interesting way to grow up i had to figure out what it is my dad. did and why it was important <unk> dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing. <unk> up you know bad design is is just people not thinking john he would say. whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or say a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen <unk> you know. bad design there 's just no excuse for it it 's letting stuff happen. without thinking about it every object should be about something john <unk> it should imagine a user it should cast that user in a story starring the user <unk>. and the object good design my dad said is about supplying intent . <unk> for steelcase <unk> that was important <unk> i knew design was important in my house because for heaven 's sake <unk> it put food on our table right <unk> and design was in everything my dad did . he had a dixieland jazz band when we were growing up <unk> . and he would always cover louis armstrong tunes <unk> and i would ask him every once in a while dad do you want it to sound like the record we had lots of old jazz records lying around the house and he said. <unk> the song is just a given that 's how you have to think about it you gotta make it your own <unk> you gotta design it <unk> show everyone what you intend is what he said doing that <unk> acting by design is what we all should be doing <unk> . it 's where we all belong all of us. <unk> given. it 's how you cover it that matters well <unk> let 's hold on to that thought for just a minute <unk> it 's kind of like this wheelchair i 'm in right . the original tune it 's a little scary ooh <unk> what happened to that dude <unk> he can 't walk <unk> anybody know the story <unk> . anybody . i don 't like to talk about this very much but i 'll tell you guys the story today. <unk> this week that 's right i was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail. on a poorly designed road in pennsylvania <unk> and plummeted. down a 200 foot embankment and killed two people. in the car <unk> but ever since then the wheelchair has been a given in my life <unk> my life at the mercy of good design. and bad design <unk> . think about it now in design terms a wheelchair is a very difficult object <unk> . it mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune and it projects that message that story so strongly that it almost blots out anything else <unk> i roll swiftly through an airport right and moms grab their kids out of the way. has this terrified look on his face god knows what they think and for for decades i 'm going why does this happen what can i do about it how can i change this i mean there must be something so <unk>. <unk> i i would roll i 'd make no eye contact just kinda frown right <unk> or i 'd. <unk> i wouldn 't shower for a week nothing worked . nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that i had and they said oh dad dad look you gotta get these these flashy wheels you gotta get. <unk> all and. of course they immediately concluded oh . what a bummer dad journalists aren 't allowed to have flashy wheels i mean <unk> how important could you be then . they said <unk>. <unk> all right right i 'll get the wheels purely out of protest i got the flashy wheels and. <unk> so what you are looking at here has completely changed my life <unk> i mean totally changed my life instead of blank stares and <unk>. <unk> awkwardness now it is pointing and smiling people going. <unk> wheels dude those are awesome <unk> i mean i want some of those wheels little kids say can i have a ride . and of course there 's the occasional person usually a middle aged male who will say oh those wheels are great <unk> i guess they 're for safety right. <unk> what 's the difference here the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights the difference. is intent <unk> that 's right <unk> that 's right i 'm no longer a victim <unk> i chose to change the situation i 'm the commander of the starship wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the. <unk> i choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element <unk> . acting with intent it conveys authorship it suggests that someone is driving it. 's reassuring people are drawn to it <unk> someone making the experience their own <unk> covering the tragic tune. <unk> with something different something radically different . people respond to that <unk> . now it seems simple but actually i think in our society and culture in general we have a huge problem with intent now go with me here look. at this guy <unk> you know who this is it 's anders breivik now if he. <unk> norway last year <unk> dozens and dozens of young people. if he intended to do that he 's a vicious criminal <unk> we punish him life in prison death penalty in the united states not so much in norway . but if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy <unk> if he was motivated by some random. mental illness <unk> he 's in a completely different category we may put him away for life but. we watch him clinically. it 's a completely different domain as an intentional murderer <unk> anders breivik is. is merely evil <unk> but as a dysfunctional as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic <unk> he 's something much more complicated he 's the breath. of some primitive ancient chaos <unk> he 's the random state of nature we emerged from he 's something very. <unk> very different <unk> it 's as though intent is an essential component for humanity <unk> it 's what we 're supposed to do somehow <unk> we 're supposed to act with intent <unk> we 're supposed to do things by design <unk> . intent. is a marker for civilization . now here 's an example a little closer to home my family is all about intent <unk> you can probably tell there are two sets of twins. the result of ivf technology in vitro fertilization technology due to some physical limitations i won 't go into anyway in vitro. technology ivf is about as intentional as agriculture <unk> let me tell you some of you may have the experience . in fact the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal <unk> cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian <unk> . i met the dude <unk> he 's a great guy. <unk> this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he 'd worked with all the different animals probes he designed <unk>. and in fact he was really really proud of these probes he would say you 're right between horse and squirrel john. <unk> wife and i decided to upgrade our early middle age we had four kids after all with a little different technology that i won 't explain in too much detail here my urologist. <unk> assured me i had nothing whatsoever to worry about no need for birth control doc are you sure about that . of birth control well . laughter what a liberating thought. yes and after a couple very liberating weekends my wife and i utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won 't get into it now. <unk> we. noticed some familiar if unexpected symptoms <unk> i wasn 't exactly a form of birth control. <unk> look at that font there my wife was so pissed i mean did a designer come up with that no i don 't think a designer did come up with that . in fact maybe that 's the problem and so little ajax was. <unk> he 's like our other children but the experience is completely different <unk>. it 's something like my accident <unk> right <unk> he came out of nowhere <unk> . but we all had to change <unk> but not just react to the given <unk> we bend to this new experience with intent <unk> . we 're five now. five facing the given with intent. <unk> doing things by design <unk> hey <unk> the name ajax you can 't get much more intentional than that right we 're really hoping he thanks us for that. later on . but i never became a designer no no no no never attempted never even close. i did love some great designs as i was growing up the hp 35s calculator god i loved that thing oh god i wish i had one. <unk> i love that thing i could afford that <unk> other designs i really couldn 't afford like the one thousand nine hundred and seventy four nine hundred and eleven targa . in school i studied nothing close to design or engineering i studied useless things like the classics <unk> but there were some lessons even there. this guy <unk> plato it turns out he 's a designer . he designed a state in the republic a design never implemented listen to one of the design features of plato 's government four point. the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager <unk> the worst . well got that wrong didn 't we . but look at that statement it 's all about intent that 's what i love about it <unk> but consider what plato is doing here what is he doing <unk> it 's a grand idea of design a huge idea. <unk> of design <unk> common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the classical period what was going on then <unk> . they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive as the human race emerged from a prehistoric <unk>. chaos a confrontation with random brutal nature . <unk> moment to think and there was a lot to think about all of a sudden <unk> human existence needed an intent <unk> . human life needed a reason <unk> reality itself needed a designer the given was replaced by various aspects of intent <unk> . by various designs by various gods . gods we 're still fighting about. oh yeah <unk> . today we don 't confront the chaos of nature <unk> today it is the chaos of humanity 's impact on the earth itself that we confront . this young discipline called design i think . is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question what shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created. <unk> what shall we do . how shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create on all the circumstances we create . on all the places we change the consequences of a planet with seven billion people and counting <unk> . that 's the tune we 're all covering today all of us and we can 't just imitate the past no <unk> . that won 't do. that won 't do at all . here 's my favorite design moment . in the city of kinshasa in zaire in the 1990s i was working for abc news and i was reporting on the fall of mobutu sese seko the dictator the brutal dictator in zaire who raped and pillaged that country there was rioting in the middle of kinshasa <unk> the. <unk> a horrible horrible place and i needed to go and. and explore the center of kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting people were carrying off vehicles carrying off pieces of buildings soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests . in the middle of this chaos <unk> i 'm rolling around in a wheelchair <unk> and i was completely invisible . completely <unk> i was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like a looter i. was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like. <unk> a journalist <unk> particularly at least from their perspective <unk> and i didn 't look like a soldier that 's for sure . i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire completely invisible . and all of a sudden <unk> from around a corner comes this young man paralyzed just like me in this metal and wood. <unk> and i looked at him <unk> he didn 't know any other english than that but we didn 't need english no no no no no . we sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes <unk> and i looked at his whacky pedal mechanism. <unk> he was full of pride over his design i wish i could show you that contraption . his smile our glow as we talked a universal language. of design <unk> . invisible to the chaos around us . his machine homemade bolted <unk> rusty <unk> comical my machine <unk> american made confident sleek <unk> . he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat really comfortable seat he had made in his. chariot. and its. beautiful fabric fringe around the edge oh i wish i 'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him man <unk> he would have loved those oh yeah <unk> . he would have understood those a chariot of pure intent think about it. in a city out of control design blew it all away for a moment <unk> we spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos. <unk> he went back to the streets of kinshasa <unk> i went to my hotel <unk> and i think of him now <unk> now <unk> . and i pose this question an object imbued with intent. it has power <unk> it 's treasure we 're drawn to it <unk> an object devoid of intent it 's random. <unk> it repels us it 's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away this. is what we must demand. of our lives of our objects of our things of our circumstances <unk> living. with intent <unk> and i have to say. that on that score i have a very unfair advantage over all of you. <unk> want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day thirty six years ago. at nearly this moment <unk> a 19 year old boy awoke from a coma. to ask a nurse a question <unk> but the nurse was already there with an answer you 've had a terrible accident young man you 've broken your. <unk> i know all that what day is it . you see <unk> i knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of february <unk> and i knew. <unk> got some catching up to do and from that moment <unk> i knew. the given was that accident <unk> i had no option. but to make up this new life without walking intent. a life with intent lived by design <unk> covering the original with something better. <unk> it 's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times . to get back to this to get back to design . and as my daddy suggested a long time ago make the song your own <unk> john <unk> show everybody what you intend. <unk> to get back to. <unk> a lot.
