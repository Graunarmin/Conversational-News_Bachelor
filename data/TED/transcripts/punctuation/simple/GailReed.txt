 <unk> i want to tell you how twenty thousand remarkable young people from over one hundred countries ended up in cuba. and are transforming health in their communities. <unk> ninety percent of them would never have left home at all if it weren 't for a scholarship to study medicine in cuba. and a commitment to go back to places like the ones they 'd come from. remote farmlands mountains <unk> ghettos. to become doctors for people like themselves to walk the walk . havana 's latin american medical school it 's the largest medical school in the world graduating. <unk> thousand young doctors since its first class of two thousand and five with nearly ten thousand more in the pipeline . its mission to train physicians for the people who need them the most the over one billion. who have never seen a doctor the people who live. and die. under every poverty line ever invented. <unk> its students defy all norms they 're the school 's biggest risk and and also its best bet <unk> . they 're recruited from the poorest most broken places on our planet. by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need . that they will practice where most doctors don 't in places. <unk> not only poor but oftentimes dangerous carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods. riddled by drugs gangs and bullets their home ground . the hope is that they will help transform access to care the health picture in impoverished areas <unk> and even the way medicine itself is learned. <unk> and practiced and. that they will become pioneers in our global reach for universal health coverage surely a tall order . two big storms and this notion of walk the walk prompted creation of elam back in <unk>. the hurricanes georges and mitch had ripped through the caribbean and central. <unk> america <unk> leaving thirty thousand dead and two and a half million homeless . hundreds of cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response but. when they got there they found a bigger disaster whole communities with no healthcare . doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff and just. too many babies dying before their. <unk> birthday . what would happen when these cuban doctors left . new doctors were needed to make care sustainable but where would they come from where would they train . in havana <unk> the campus of a former naval academy was turned over to the cuban health ministry. to become the latin american medical school elam. <unk> tuition room and board and a small stipend were offered to hundreds of students. from the countries hardest hit by the storms . as a journalist in havana i watched the first ninety seven nicaraguans arrive in march one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine . settling into dorms barely refurbished and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes. over the next few years governments throughout the americas requested scholarships for their own students . and the congressional black caucus asked for and received. hundreds of scholarships for young people from the usa <unk> today <unk> among the twenty three thousand. are graduates from eighty three countries in the americas. <unk> africa and asia and enrollment has grown to one hundred and twenty three nations . more than half the students are young women they come from one hundred ethnic groups speak fifty different languages who director margaret chan said . for once . if you are poor female or from an indigenous population you have a distinct advantage. <unk> ethic that makes this medical school unique . luther castillo comes from san pedro de tocamacho on the atlantic coast of honduras there. 's no running water no electricity there and to reach the village you have to walk for hours. or take your chances in a pickup truck like i did skirting the waves of the atlantic. <unk> luther. was one of forty tocamacho children who started grammar school the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the garfuna . twenty percent of the honduran population <unk> . the nearest healthcare was fatal miles away <unk> . luther had to walk three hours every day to middle school only. <unk> seventeen made that trip only five went on to high school <unk> and only one to university . luther to elam <unk> among the first crop of garfuna graduates . <unk> doctors had preceded them in all of honduran history <unk> now there. need big solutions <unk> sparked by big ideas imagination and audacity but also solutions that work . elam 's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them . so they learned the hard way by doing and correcting course as they went . even the brightest students from these poor communities. weren 't academically. <unk> prepared for six years of medical training so a bridging course was set up in sciences then came language <unk> these were mapuche <unk>. indigenous peoples who learned spanish as a second language or haitians who spoke creole so spanish became part. <unk> even so in cuba . the music the food <unk> the smells just about everything was different . so faculty became family elam home <unk> . religions ranged from indigenous beliefs to yoruba muslim and christian evangelical <unk> . embracing diversity became a way of life . <unk> so many countries asked for these scholarships . first they just don 't have enough doctors and where they do their distribution is skewed against the poor <unk> . because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources . we are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs . and the problem is everywhere. <unk> doctors are concentrated in the cities <unk> where only half the world 's people live . and within cities not in the shantytowns or south l a . here in the united states where we have healthcare reform <unk> we don 't have the professionals we need by two thousand and twenty we will be short. <unk> part of the problem the united states is the number one importer of doctors from developing countries <unk> . the second reasons students flock to cuba is the island 's own health report card <unk> relying on strong primary care . a commission from the lancet rates cuba among the best. <unk> countries in health save the children ranks cuba the best country in latin america to become a mother . cuba has similar life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the united states with fewer disparities <unk> . while spending per person one. <unk> what we do on health here in the usa <unk>. <unk> elam is tough but eighty percent of its students graduate the subjects are familiar basic and clinical sciences. but there are major differences first . training has moved out of the ivory tower and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods <unk> the kinds of places most of these grads will practice <unk> . sure they have lectures. <unk> on day one . second students treat the whole patient . mind and body in the context of their families their communities and their culture. <unk> third <unk> they learn public health to assess their patients ' drinking water housing <unk> social and economic. <unk> that a good patient interview. and a thorough clinical exam provide most of the clues for diagnosis <unk> saving costly technology for confirmation <unk> . and finally they 're taught over and over again the importance of prevention <unk> especially as chronic diseases cripple health. <unk> also comes with a team approach as much how to work in teams. as how to lead them with a dose of humility <unk> . upon graduation these doctors share their knowledge with nurse 's aids midwives <unk> community health workers . to help them become better at what they do not to replace them . to work with shamans and traditional. <unk> healers . elam 's graduates are they proving this audacious experiment right <unk> . dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they 're capable of doing take the garfuna grads . they not only went to work back home but they organized their communities to build honduras ' first indigenous hospital. <unk> with an architect 's help residents literally raised it from the ground up . the first patients walked through the doors in december two thousand and seven <unk> and since then the hospital has received nearly one million patient visits <unk> . and government is paying attention <unk> upholding the hospital as a model. of rural public health for honduras. elam 's graduates are smart strong. and also dedicated . haiti <unk> january two thousand and ten . the pain people buried under thirty million tons of rubble overwhelming . three hundred forty cuban doctors were already on the ground long term. more were on their way many more were needed at elam students worked round the clock. to contact two thousand graduates as a result hundreds arrived in haiti. <unk> countries ' worth from mali in the sahara to st lucia bolivia chile and the usa. <unk> they spoke easily to each other in spanish and listened to their patients in creole. thanks to haitian medical students flown in from elam in cuba many stayed for months <unk> even through the cholera epidemic . hundreds of haitian graduates. had to pick up the pieces <unk> . overcome their own heartbreak <unk> and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for haiti <unk> today with aid of. <unk> organizations and governments from norway to cuba to brazil <unk> dozens of new health centers have been built staffed . and in thirty five cases headed by elam graduates <unk> . yet the haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries take a. <unk> haitian graduates by two thousand and twelve when cholera struck nearly half working in the public health sector. but one quarter unemployed and one hundred and ten had left haiti altogether . so in the best case scenarios . these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems . where often they 're the only doctors around. <unk> in the worst cases there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector where most poor people are treated . not enough political will not enough resources not enough anything. just too many patients with no care <unk> the grads face pressure from their families too <unk> desperate to make ends meet. <unk> so when there are no public sector jobs these new mds decamp into private practice or go abroad to send money home . worst of all in some countries medical societies influence accreditation bodies not to honor the elam degree <unk> . fearful these grads will take their jobs or reduce their patient loads and income . it 's not a question of competencies here in the usa the california. <unk> medical board accredited the school after rigorous inspection . and the new physicians are making good on cuba 's big bet <unk> . passing their boards and accepted into highly respected residencies from new york to chicago to new mexico . two hundred strong they 're coming back to the. <unk> and also dissatisfied . as one grad put it in cuba . we are trained to provide quality care with minimal resources <unk> . so when i see all the resources we have here <unk> and you tell me that 's not possible i know it 's not true . not only have i seen it work i 've done the work . elam 's graduates. <unk> from right here in d c and baltimore have come from the poorest of the poor. to offer health education. and a voice to their communities they 've done the heavy lifting <unk> now we need to do our part. to support the twenty three thousand and counting all of us. foundations <unk> residency directors . <unk> to step up we need to do much more globally to give these new doctors the opportunity to prove their mettle <unk> . they need to be able to take their countries <unk> ' licensing exams <unk> they need jobs in the public health sector. or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work. <unk> they need the chance to be the doctors their patients need . to move forward <unk> we may have to find our way back. to that pediatrician who would knock on my family 's door on the south side of chicago when i was a kid who made house calls . who was a public servant . these aren 't such new ideas of what medicine should be what 's new. <unk> new is the scaling up. and the faces of the doctors themselves an elam graduate is more likely to be a she than a he . in the amazon <unk> peru or guatemala an indigenous doctor in the usa a doctor of color. who speaks fluent spanish she is well trained can be counted on. and shares the face and culture of her patients . and she deserves our support surely <unk> . because whether by subway <unk> mule or canoe <unk> she is teaching us to walk the walk.
