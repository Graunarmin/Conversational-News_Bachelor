 <unk> i have one more reason for optimism climate change maybe you don 't believe it <unk> but here is the fact . on december twelve <unk> two thousand and fifteen . <unk> if you 've worked with governments you know how difficult that is. unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable. and improve the life of all of us. <unk> but it is even. more remarkable. if you consider where we had been just a few years ago <unk> two thousand and nine copenhagen who remembers copenhagen <unk> . well <unk> after years of working toward a climate agreement . the same governments convened in copenhagen. <unk> why did it fail miserably . for many different reasons <unk> but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global north and the global south <unk> . so now six months after this failure <unk> . i was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations. <unk> you can imagine the perfect moment to start this new job . the global mood on climate change was in the trash can no one believed. that a global agreement could ever be possible in fact <unk> neither did i if. you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful ted audience i 'm going to divulge a secret that has been. <unk> do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible and without engaging brain i heard me. utter not in my lifetime well <unk> you can imagine the faces of my press team. who were horrified at this crazy costa rican woman who was their. <unk> new boss <unk> and i was horrified too now i wasn 't horrified at me because i 'm kind of used to myself i was actually horrified. at the consequences of what i had just said at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have. to live. <unk> it was frankly a horrible moment for me <unk> and i thought well no <unk> hang on hang on impossible. is not a fact <unk> it 's an attitude it 's only an attitude and i decided right then and there. that i was going to change my attitude and i was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change so. i don 't know no. just this thanks <unk> i don 't know. what you would do if you were told your job is to. save the planet put that on the job description . and you have full responsibility <unk> but you have absolutely no authority <unk> because governments are sovereign in every decision that they. well <unk> . i would really love to know what you would do on the first monday morning <unk> but here 's what i did i panicked . and then i panicked again <unk> because i realized i have no idea how we 're going to solve this problem <unk> . and then i realized i have no idea how we 're going to solve this problem <unk> but i do know. one thing we have got to change the tone of this conversation <unk> . because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism <unk> . and here i. use optimism as a very simple word but let 's understand it in its broader sense let 's understand it as courage hope. <unk> trust solidarity the fundamental belief that we humans can come together. and can help each other to better the fate of mankind . well you can imagine that i thought that without that there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of copenhagen and for six years i. i have stubbornly <unk> relentlessly injected optimism into the system <unk> no matter. what the questions from the press and i have gotten better at those. and no matter what the evidence to the contrary and believe you me <unk> there has been a lot. of contrary evidence but relentless optimism into. <unk> and pretty soon <unk> we began to see changes happening. in many areas <unk> . precipitated by thousands of people <unk> including many of you here today <unk> and i thank you . and this ted community will not be surprised if i tell you the first area. <unk> we began to see that clean technologies in particular renewable energy technologies began to drop price and increase in capacity to the point where today we are already <unk>. <unk> building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent. <unk> buildings <unk> and with this shift in technologies <unk> we were able to begin to understand. that there was a shift in the economic equation <unk> . because we were able to recognize that yes there are huge costs to climate change and yes there are compounded risks <unk> but there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits. <unk> dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air . better health . better transportation more livable cities more energy security <unk> more energy access to the developing world . in sum a better world than what we have now <unk> . and with that. <unk> should have witnessed in fact part of you were the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through <unk> first through <unk>. <unk> governments the private sector <unk> captains of industry insurance companies <unk> investors <unk> city leaders <unk> faith communities <unk> because they all <unk>. <unk> began to understand this actually can be in their interest this can actually improve their. <unk> bottom line <unk> . and it wasn 't. just. the usual suspects . i have to tell you i had the ceo of a major . major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say. privately. <unk> of course. he did not know how he was going to change his company but he is going to change it because he 's interested in long term viability <unk> . well <unk> now we have a shift. in the economic equation <unk> . and with that with broader support from everyone it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is. <unk> in their national interest <unk> and when we asked countries to begin to identify. how they could contribute. to global efforts but based on their national interest <unk> . one hundred and eighty nine countries out of one hundred and ninety five one hundred and eighty nine countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans <unk> . based on their national interest. <unk> concurrent with their priorities <unk> consistent with their national sustainable development plans <unk> . well <unk> once you protect the core interests. of nations then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a. common path . onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy . into a <unk> decarbonized highly resilient economy <unk> . and the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments. are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate <unk> but they are only the first step <unk> and they will improve over time <unk> and the. <unk> measurement <unk> reporting and verification of all of those efforts is legally binding <unk> . and the checkpoints that we 're going to have every five years to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding <unk> and the path itself <unk>. toward a <unk> decarbonized and more resilient economy is legally binding <unk> . <unk> handful of countries who had undertaken very reduced. emission reduction commitments that were completely insufficient. and furthermore <unk> largely perceived as a burden now what do we have now we have all countries of the world contributing. with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors. <unk> but all of them contributing to a common goal. and along a path. with environmental integrity <unk> . well <unk> . once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding then you see that governments were able to. <unk> i look back. over the past six years . first i remember the day the paris agreement was adopted. i cannot tell you the euphoria in the room five thousand people jumping out of their seats <unk> . crying <unk> clapping <unk> screaming yelling torn between euphoria. and still disbelief at what they had just seen <unk> because so many people. had worked for years. <unk> and this was finally their reality <unk> . and it wasn 't just those who had participated directly a. few weeks ago i was with a colleague who was trying to decide on a tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife natasha <unk> . and once he had finally decided. what he was going to buy. <unk> the jeweler said to him you know you 're very lucky that you 're buying this now <unk> because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change . but the jeweler said have you heard the governments have just come to a decision . and tahiti. could have a chance well <unk> what a fantastic confirmation. that perhaps perhaps here is hope here is a possible. chance <unk> . i 'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do we 've only just started our work on climate change . and in fact <unk> we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts over the next five years that are the urgent five years <unk> . but. i do believe that we have come over the past six years. <unk> years from the impossible. to the now unstoppable <unk> and how did we do that by injecting transformational. optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global <unk>. <unk> needs <unk> and that if we understand that we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously. <unk> as i look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century. food security <unk> water security <unk> home security <unk> forced migration. i see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet <unk> . but we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change. <unk> we can understand that we have got. to reinterpret the zero sum mentality <unk> . because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers and that your loss is my gain <unk> . well <unk> now that we 're in a world in which we have reached. planetary boundaries and that. <unk> not just so interconnected but increasingly interdependent on each other your loss is no longer my gain we 're either. all losers. or we all can be winners <unk> but we are going to have to decide between. zero and sum we 're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all. or living life as the sum of all of us we 've done it once we can do it again.
