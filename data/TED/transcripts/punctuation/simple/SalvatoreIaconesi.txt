 <unk> the key phrase is. <unk> brain cancer was really as you can imagine shocking news for me <unk> i knew nothing about cancer <unk> in. western cultures <unk> when you have cancer it 's as if you disappear in a way your life as a complex. <unk> lab values a list of medicines. and everyone changes as well you suddenly become a disease on legs doctors start speaking. a language which you don 't understand they start. <unk> people start. changing as well because they. start dealing with the disease <unk> instead of. with the human being <unk> they say what did the doctor say before even saying hello . and in the meanwhile you 're left with questions to which. <unk> nobody gives an answer these are the can i questions can i work while i have cancer <unk> . can i study <unk> can i make love can i be creative <unk> . and. you wonder what have i done to deserve this you wonder can i change something. <unk> doctors are the good guys in. all these scenarios <unk> because they are very professional and dedicated to to curing you <unk> but they also. are very used to having to deal with patients so i. <unk> things are changing but classically they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition . <unk> your friends and family engaged <unk> or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you 're going through <unk> . but instead you 're forced there. to wait. in the hands of a series of. very professional strangers while i was in the hospital i asked for a printed out. <unk> it was really hard to obtain because it 's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer. <unk> i talked to it and i said okay cancer <unk> you 're not all there is to me <unk> there 's more to me. <unk> a cure <unk> whichever it is will have to deal. with the whole of me and so <unk> the next day i left the. <unk> the hospital against medical advice <unk> i was determined to change. my relationship with the cancer and i was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing. anything as drastic as a surgery . i 'm an artist i use several forms. <unk> and open information in my practice so my best bet. was to get it all out there get the information out there and use it. so that it could be accessed by anyone so i. created a website which is called la <unk> cura on which i put my medical data online. <unk> actually had to hack it and that 's a thing which we can talk about in another speech i chose this <unk>. <unk> in italian means the cure because. in many different cultures <unk> the word cure can mean many different things <unk> in our western cultures it means. eradicating or reversing. <unk> from the mediterranean <unk> from latin countries from africa it can mean many more things . of course i was interested in the opinions of. doctors. and healthcare providers <unk> but i was also interested in the cure of the artist . <unk> i was interested in. the social cure <unk> i was interested in the psychological cure <unk> i was interested in the spiritual cure <unk> i was interested in the emotional cure i was interested in any form of cure . and . <unk> i received lots of media attention from. italy and from abroad and i quickly received. more than five hundred thousand contacts emails social networking. most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer <unk> but more of them were about how to cure myself as. <unk> for example here we see francesca fini in her performance . or <unk> as artist patrick lichty has done <unk> he produced a 3d. <unk> can share our cancer and this was going on. scientists the traditional medicine experts <unk> several researchers doctors all connected with me to. <unk> with all this information and support i was able to form a team of several. neurosurgeons <unk> traditional doctors <unk> oncologists <unk> and several hundred. volunteers with whom i was able to discuss. the information i was receiving <unk> which. which is very important and together we were able to form a strategy for my own cure. in many languages <unk> according to many cultures <unk> and the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history . which is quite remarkable for me [. surgery ] the follow up mris showed <unk> luckily <unk> little to no growth of the cancer so i was able to take my time and choose. <unk> i chose. the doctor i wanted to work with i chose the hospital i wanted to stay in and in the meanwhile <unk> i was supported by thousands of people <unk> . none of whom felt pity for me <unk> . everyone. felt like they could. take an active role in helping me to get well <unk> and this was the most important part of la. what are the outcomes <unk> i 'm fine <unk> as you can see pretty fine . i had excellent news after the. surgery i have i had. a very low grade glioma. <unk> kind of cancer which doesn 't grow a lot <unk> i have completely changed my life. and my lifestyle <unk> everything i did was. thoughtfully designed to get me engaged <unk> up until the very last few minutes of the surgery <unk> . which was very intense a matrix of electrodes. <unk> map of what the brain controls and right before the operation we were able to discuss <unk>. <unk> the functional map of of my brain with the doctor to understand which risks i was running into and if there were any. <unk> and this openness was really the fundamental part of la cura thousands of people shared their. stories their experiences. doctors got to talk with people they don 't usually consult when. <unk> different languages in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research. <unk> really. depends. on the wellness of all of its components . this global performance is my open source cure for cancer . and from what i feel it 's a cure for me <unk> but for us all thank you.
