 <unk> i have a story a story that i would like to share with you and it 's an african story <unk> . it is a story of hope resilience and glamour . there was hollywood. <unk> film industry in the world in two thousand and six alone <unk> almost two thousand films. were made in nigeria now try to imagine. forty <unk> fifty films wrapped distributed every week in the streets of lagos nigeria and. <unk> west africa some estimates put. the value of this industry at two hundred and fifty million dollars <unk> it has created. thousands if not tens of thousands of jobs <unk> and it 's expanding <unk> but. keep in mind that this. was a grassroots movement this is something. that happened without foreign investment . without government aid <unk> and actually it happened against all odds . in one of the <unk>. most difficult moments in nigerian economy the industry is fifteen years old <unk>. <unk> you 're thinking now why how an italian filmmaker based in boston. is so interested in this story <unk> and so i think i have to tell you just a few words a few things about my personal. life <unk> because i think there is a connection . my grandfather lived most of his life and. is buried in zambia my father. also lived most of his adult life in east africa <unk> and i was born in zambia <unk> . even though i left when i was only three years old <unk> i really felt that africa was this big part of my life . and it really was a place a place where i learned to. <unk> uttered the first words and my family bought their first home <unk> so. when we came back to italy <unk> and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories . it seemed that for our neighbors and friends africa was either this exotic place this. <unk> and so we were always caught in this stereotype <unk> and. i remember really this desire to talk about africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives and have dreams like we all have . so when i. read in a newspaper in the business page the. <unk> story of nollywood <unk> i really felt. this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions here i can. tell a story of africans making movies like i do and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me. <unk> have the good fortune of being a filmmaker in residence at the center of digital imaging arts at boston university <unk> and we really look. how digital technology is changing and how young <unk> independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost so when i. proposed the story i really had all the support to make this film . <unk> i found two wonderful partners in crime. in this adventure aimee corrigan a very talented and young photographer <unk> and robert caputo a friend and a mentor who. is a veteran of national geographic and told me you know <unk> franco in twenty five years of covering africa i don 't know if i have come across a story. that is so full of hope. <unk> we went to lagos in october two thousand and five <unk> . and we went to lagos to meet bond emeruwa <unk> a wonderful talented film director who is with us tonight <unk> . the plan was to give you a portrait of nollywood of this incredible film industry . following bond in his quest to make an action movie. that deals with the issue of. <unk> corruption called checkpoint police corruption <unk> and he had nine days to make it we thought this was a good. story <unk> in the meantime <unk> we had to cover nollywood and we talked to a lot of. filmmakers <unk> but i don 't want to create too many expectations i would like to show you six minutes. <unk> and these are six minutes they really prepared for the ted audience <unk> . there are several themes from the documentary <unk> but they are re edited and made for you ok <unk> so i guess it 's a world premier. <unk> for those who work in it is a kind of subsistence filmmaking what they do to make a living. <unk> fancy filmmaking where you say oh you want to put all the razzmatazz of hollywood and where you have big budgets here is that you make these films <unk> it sells <unk> you jump onto the. location again to make another film <unk> because if you don 't make the next film you 're not going to feed. <unk> we should be able to educate. i believe in the power of. audiovisuals <unk> . i mean ninety percent of the population will watch nollywood <unk> i think it 's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable. <unk> so if you 're making a movie no matter what your topic is put in. a message in. <unk> keep trying to explain to people it 's not about. the quality at the moment the quality is coming i mean there are those films that people are making for quality. but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day . and these are the people that really watch. <unk> that has just been born in this part of the world . because nobody believed that nollywood can come out of africa. <unk> our people for our people. <unk> we have been so deep into the foreign movies it 's all about the foreign movies but we can do something. <unk> you can now walk the street and see a role model <unk> its not just what you see in picture <unk> you see the person live you see how he talks you see how he lives . he influences you really good <unk> you know <unk> its not just what you see in the picture <unk> it is not what you. <unk> i was so fascinated you know <unk> with those cowboy movies but then. when i discovered the situation in my country at that time there was so much corruption. <unk> for a young man to really make it out here you got to think of some negative things. <unk> and all that or some kind of vices and i didn 't want that you know and i discovered that i could. be successful in life as an actor without doing crime without cheating nobody without telling no lies. just me and. <unk> they have all these things in place but here we. <unk> just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won 't affect my face the explosion you know <unk> but she 's a professional she knows what shes doing i 'm trying to protect my. <unk> face too this ain 't going to be my last movie you know this. is nollywood where the magic lives <unk>. so now you 're about to see how we do our own movies here <unk> with or without any assistance from anybody. <unk> so many things to say so little time <unk> so many themes in this story <unk> i just can 't tell you. theres one thing i want to tell you i spent <unk> you know several weeks with all these actors producers <unk> and the problems they have. <unk> a filmmaker who works in america or in europe <unk> but always with a smile always with an enthusiasm that is incredible. <unk> werner herzog the german filmmaker said i need. to make movies like you need oxygen and i think theyre breathing the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like. <unk> a very very important thing for them and for their audiences a woman told me when i see a nollywood film i can relax <unk> i really i can breathe better. there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience its technology im very interested in it and. i really think that the digital non linear editing has slashed. <unk> the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be . incredible cameras cost under five thousand dollars and this has unleashed tremendous energy and guess what we didnt have to tell to the nigerian filmmakers they understood it they embraced the technology. and they run with it and theyre successful i hope that <unk>. the nollywood phenomenon will go both ways <unk> i hope it will inspire other african nations to embrace the technology look at the nigerian. <unk> model make their films create jobs create a narrative for the population something to identify something positive <unk> something that really is psychological relief and it 's part of the culture <unk> . but i really think this is a. a phenomenon that can inspire us i really think it goes both ways filmmakers friends of mine. <unk> they look at nollywood and they say wow they are doing what we really want to do and make a buck and live with this. job so i really think its a lesson that we 're actually learning from them <unk> and there 's one thing one small challenge that i have for you and. should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling <unk> and i think this is really the theme of this session try. to imagine a world where the only. <unk> and a shelter but no stories no stories around the campfire <unk> no legends no fairytales <unk> . nothing no novels . difficult eh . it 's meaningless <unk> so this is what i really think i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and i think. <unk> that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this. i would like you to hear their voices just a few moments its not. an added sequence just some voices from. nollywood toyin alousa nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them if you have an industry that puts a smile on people 's face <unk> thats nollywood. <unk> i believe very soon were not only going to have better movies. <unk> i don 't see us exhausting the stories we have fs my job ends here <unk> and the nollywood filmmakers really have now to. work and i really hope that there will be many many collaborations where we teach each other things and i really hope. <unk> you described this as the world 's third largest film industry what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films really fs oh yes <unk> i think i mentioned briefly it 's. close to two thousand films there is scientific data on. <unk> two thousand and five or six the. censor board has censored one thousand . six hundred films alone and we know that there are more so its safe to say that there are two thousand films so imagine forty five films per week. <unk> there are challenges there are challenges there is a glut of film the quality has to be raised <unk> they need to go to the next level but im optimistic . ca and these arent films that are primarily seen in cinemas. <unk> of course this is very important <unk> maybe <unk> you know <unk> for you to try to imagine this this these are films that are distributed. directly in markets <unk> they are bought in video shops they can be rented for pennies ca . on what format fs oh the format thank you for the question yes <unk> it 's. vcds it 's a cd it 's a little bit. <unk> can be in a lagos traffic jam. <unk> and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water.
