 <unk> when i was growing up in montana . i had two dreams <unk> i wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist <unk> and i wanted to have a pet. <unk> and so. that 's what i 've been striving for all of my life <unk> . i was very fortunate early in my career <unk> . i was fortunate in finding things <unk> i wasn 't very good at reading things in fact i don 't read much of anything . i am extremely dyslexic <unk> and so reading is the hardest thing i do . but instead i go out and i find things then i just pick things up. <unk> i basically. practice. for finding money on the street and i wander about the hills and i have found a few things and. i have been fortunate enough to find things like. the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests the first dinosaur embryos and. <unk> massive accumulations of bones <unk> and. it happened to be at a time when. people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren 't the big <unk> . stupid green reptiles that people had thought for so many years people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special <unk> . and so at that time i was able to make some. <unk> interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had that dinosaurs. built nests and lived in colonies. and cared for their young <unk> brought food to their babies and traveled in. <unk> it was pretty interesting stuff <unk> i have gone on to find more things and. and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found. a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different. which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles. <unk> the juveniles can recognize the adults <unk> and so. we 're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like and they didn 't just all chase jeeps around . but. it is that social thing that that i guess attracted. michael crichton and in his book he talked about the social animals and then steven spielberg. <unk> of course <unk> depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures <unk> the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so. we come to that part of jurassic park michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life . you all know the story right. <unk> i assume everyone here has seen jurassic park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap. otherwise known as amber. that has some blood sucking insects in it. <unk> good ones . and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna <unk> because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days. sucked dinosaur dna out and you take your. <unk> dna back to the laboratory and you clone it and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then. you wait and lo and behold out pops. a little baby dinosaur <unk> and everybody 's happy about that . and they 're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and. <unk> and then then then and. then then. the dinosaurs being social . act out their socialness <unk> and they get together <unk> and they conspire . and of course that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie. conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber. and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you. got something out of that insect and you cloned it <unk> and you did it over and over and over again . you 'd have a room full of mosquitos . applause and probably a whole bunch of trees as. <unk> if you want dinosaur dna i say. go to the dinosaur <unk> . so that 's what we 've done back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the national science foundation. to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur <unk> . and we chose the dinosaur on the left a tyrannosaurus rex <unk> which was a very nice specimen <unk> and one of my former doctoral students. <unk> mary schweitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so. she looked into the bone of this <unk> t rex one of the thigh bones <unk> and she actually found some very interesting structures in there . they found these red <unk>. <unk> objects <unk> and they looked for all the world like red blood cells <unk> and they 're in what appear to be the. blood channels that go through the bone <unk> and so. she thought well what the heck so she. sampled some material out of it <unk> now it wasn 't dna she didn 't find dna <unk> but she did find. heme <unk> which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin. <unk> we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell creek project and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get. as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully. find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern montana. there 's a lot of space a lot of badlands and not very many people and so. you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of. tyrannosaurs <unk> but we found one special tyrannosaur <unk> and we called it b rex and b rex was found. under a thousand cubic yards of rock it wasn 't a very complete t rex <unk> and it wasn 't a very big t rex <unk> . but it was a very special b rex and i and my colleagues cut into it and. <unk> we were able to determine by looking at lines of arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of sixteen <unk> . we don 't really know how long dinosaurs lived because we haven 't found the oldest one yet. <unk> but this one died at the age of sixteen <unk> . we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female. based on medullary tissue found on the. <unk> inside of the bone <unk> medullary tissue is the calcium build up . the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant <unk> when a bird is pregnant <unk> . so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs <unk> but mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid <unk> now. we all know that bones are fossilized <unk> and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn 't be anything left <unk> . but there was something left <unk> there were blood vessels left <unk> there were flexible clear blood vessels <unk> . and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur it was extraordinary <unk> . but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find dna. <unk> but she did find evidence of proteins <unk> but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that. the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast <unk> . and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field. where we could get better samples and we did we got. <unk> better material . the cells looked better the vessels looked better . found the protein collagen i mean it was wonderful stuff <unk> but it 's not dinosaur dna <unk> . so. we have discovered that dinosaur dna and all dna just breaks down too. <unk> going to be able to do what they did in jurassic park we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on. a dinosaur <unk> but. birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs <unk> we actually classify them. as dinosaurs we now call them. <unk> dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs so the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct <unk> . avian dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them. <unk> you can call it a dinosaur <unk> but look at the velociraptor the velociraptor is cool the chicken is not . so this is our problem as you can imagine <unk> the chicken is a dinosaur i mean it really. <unk> you can 't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way . but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken . laughter so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken. <unk> so we have a number of of ways that we actually can. <unk> fix the chicken <unk> because evolution works <unk> we actually have some evolutionary tools we. 'll call them biological modification tools <unk> we have selection . and we know selection works <unk> we started out with a <unk> wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese. <unk> definitely genetic modification . or any of the other funny looking little dogs. <unk> we also have transgenesis transgenesis is really cool too that 's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one <unk> that 's how people make glofish . you take a glow gene out of. <unk> and you stick it in a zebrafish and puff they glow and that 's pretty cool <unk> and they obviously make a lot of money off of them . and now they 're making <unk> glow rabbits and glow all sorts of things i guess we could make a glow chicken . but i don 't think that 'll satisfy the sixth graders either. <unk> but there 's another thing there 's what we call atavism activation and atavism activation is basically. an atavism is an ancestral characteristic <unk>. you heard that occasionally children are born with tails <unk> . and it 's because it 's an ancestral characteristic <unk> . and so there are a number of. <unk> can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs <unk> and here 's an example this is a chicken. with teeth a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison. actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene. for teeth <unk> and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on. and produce teeth in. <unk> 's a good characteristic <unk> we can save that one we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth. that 's getting closer <unk> that 's better than a glowing chicken . a friend of mine <unk> a colleague of mine dr hans larsson at mcgill university is actually looking at atavisms <unk> and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo. <unk> genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he 's interested in how birds actually lost their tail <unk> he 's also interested in the transformation <unk>. of the arm the hand to the wing <unk> he 's looking for those genes as well <unk> and i said . and so he agreed and so. that 's what we 're looking into . if you look at dinosaur hands a. velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it <unk> archaeopteryx which is a bird <unk> a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand . but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else another bird has kind of a weird looking. <unk> the hand is a wing <unk> but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing. the hand actually. looks. pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand it has the three fingers the three digits <unk> but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together <unk> . and so what we 're looking for is that gene we want to stop that gene from turning on fusing those hands together <unk> so we can get a chicken that hatches out. with a three fingered hand <unk> like the archaeopteryx and the same goes for the tails <unk> birds have basically. rudimentary tails <unk> and so. we know that. in embryo <unk> as the animal is developing it actually has. a relatively long tail <unk> but a gene turns on and resorbs the. <unk> tail <unk> gets rid of it <unk> so that 's the other gene we 're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so. what we 're trying to do really is. take our chicken <unk> modify it. and make the chickenosaurus. <unk> just the very basics <unk> so that really is what we 're doing <unk> and people always say why do that why make this thing what good is it . well that 's a good question . actually i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and. quite frankly i think if. <unk> sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece . anyway. when our dino chicken hatches . it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call a poster chick for technology <unk> entertainment and design <unk> thank you.
