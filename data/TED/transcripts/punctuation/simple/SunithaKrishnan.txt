 <unk> worst form of human rights violation. <unk> like to tell you the story. of these three children <unk> pranitha <unk> shaheen and anjali pranitha 's mother. was a woman in prostitution <unk> a prostituted person she got infected with hiv <unk> and towards the end of her life <unk>. <unk> when she was in the final stages of aids she could not prostitute . so she sold four year old pranitha to a broker <unk> . by the time we got the information <unk> we reached there pranitha was already raped by three men <unk> . shaheen 's background i don 't even know we found her in a railway track raped by. <unk> many many men <unk> i don 't know many <unk> but the indications of that on her body was. that her intestine was outside her body <unk> . and when we took her to the hospital she needed thirty two stitches to put back her intestine into her body <unk> . we still don 't know who her parents are . who she is all that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally. <unk> anjali 's father a drunkard sold his child. for pornography you 're seeing here images of three years. and five year old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation <unk>. <unk> in this country <unk> and across the globe hundreds and thousands of children as young as three as young as four . are sold into sexual slavery <unk> . but that 's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for <unk> they are sold in the name of adoption <unk> they are sold in the name of organ trade <unk> they are sold in the name of forced labor <unk> camel jockeying <unk> anything everything. <unk> i work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation and i tell you stories from there my own journey to work with these children. started as a teenager <unk> i was fifteen when i was gang raped by eight men <unk> . i don 't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part. <unk> there were eight men who defiled me raped me <unk> but that didn 't go into my consciousness i never felt like a victim then or now . but what lingered from then till now i am forty today. is this huge outrageous anger two years <unk> i was ostracized <unk> i was stigmatized <unk> i. <unk> because i was a victim <unk> . and that 's what we do to all traffic survivors . we as a society <unk> we have phds in victimizing a victim <unk> . right from the age of fifteen when i started looking around me <unk> i started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children. who are left in. <unk> because we don 't allow them to come in where does their journey begin <unk> . most of them come from very optionless families not just poor you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked <unk> . i had this i s officer 's daughter who is. <unk> raped chatting with one individual <unk> . and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine <unk> who was trafficked <unk> i have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very. <unk> into prostitution <unk> some pay the price for it <unk> they 're killed <unk> we don 't even hear about them <unk> . they are voiceless <unk>. nameless people <unk> . but the rest who succumb into it <unk> go through everyday torture <unk> . because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends. <unk> or who want to have a family with you these are men who buy you for an hour for a day and use you throw you. each of the girls that i have rescued i have rescued more than three thousand two hundred girls each of them tell me one story. <unk> one man taking a cigarette and burning her one man whipping her we are living among those men they 're our brothers <unk> fathers <unk> uncles cousins all around us <unk> and we are silent about them <unk> . we think it is easy money <unk> we think it is shortcut <unk> we think the person likes to do what she. <unk> but the extra bonuses that she gets. is various infections <unk> sexually transmitted infections hiv aids syphilis gonorrhea you name it <unk> substance abuse drugs <unk> everything under the sun <unk> . and one day she gives up on you and me <unk> because we have no options for her <unk> . and therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation <unk> she believes yes this is it this is what my destiny is about . and this is normal to get raped by. <unk> hundred men a day <unk> and it 's abnormal to live in live in a shelter it 's abnormal. to get rehabilitated it 's in that context that i work it 's in that context that i rescue children . i 've rescued children as young as three years <unk> and i 've rescued women as old as forty years <unk> . <unk> when i rescued them one of the biggest challenges i had was where do i begin <unk> because. i had lots of them. who were already hiv infected one third of the people i rescue are hiv positive <unk> . and therefore my challenge was to. understand how can i get out the power from this pain. <unk> and for me <unk> i was my greatest experience. <unk> my own self <unk> understanding my own pain my own. isolation was my greatest teacher <unk> . because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential . you see a girl here who is trained as a welder . she works. for a very big company a workshop in hyderabad <unk> making furnitures she earns around twelve thousand rupees . she is an illiterate girl . trained <unk> skilled as a welder <unk> why welding and why not. computers <unk> we felt <unk> one of the things that these girls had. is. immense amount of courage they did not have any. pardas inside their body <unk> hijabs inside themselves they 've crossed the barrier of it <unk> . and therefore they could fight in a <unk> male dominated world very easily <unk> and not feel very shy about it <unk> . we have trained girls as carpenters as masons. <unk> as security guards as cab drivers <unk> and each one of them are excelling. in their chosen field <unk> . gaining confidence <unk> restoring dignity <unk> and building hopes in their own lives these girls. are also working in big construction companies. <unk> what has been my challenge my challenge. has not been the traffickers who beat me up i 've been beaten up more than fourteen times in my life. i can 't hear from my right ear <unk> . i 've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue my biggest challenge. <unk> is society <unk> it 's you and me . my biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own . a very. supportive friend of mine a well wisher of mine . used to give me every month two thousand rupees for vegetables when her mother fell sick. she said. <unk> so much of contacts can you get somebody in my house to work so that she can look after my mother . and there is a long pause <unk> and then she says not one of our girls it. 's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking in this fantastic a c hall it 's very nice. <unk> making films and everything <unk> but it is not nice. to bring them to our homes it 's not nice to give them employment. in our factories our companies it 's not nice for our children to study with their children . there it ends that 's my biggest challenge if i 'm here today i 'm here not only as sunitha. <unk> as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking <unk> . they need your compassion <unk> . they need your empathy <unk> they need much more than anything else your acceptance . many times when i talk to people . i keep telling them one thing don 't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem . can you ply your mind for that one way. <unk> that you can respond to the problem <unk> . and that 's what i 'm here for asking for your support <unk> demanding for your support <unk> requesting for your support <unk> . can you break your culture of silence can you speak to at least two persons about this story tell them this story <unk> convince. <unk> to tell the story to another two persons.
