 <unk> needs no introduction it needs no introduction in part because the apollo seventeen astronauts when they were hurtling around the moon. <unk> beings to realize that we 're on spaceship earth <unk> . fragile and finite as it is and that we need to take care of it <unk> but while this picture is beautiful <unk> it 's static <unk> and the earth is constantly changing it. 's changing on days ' time scales with human activity <unk> . and the satellite imagery we have of it today is old <unk> . <unk> and that 's important because you can 't fix what you can 't see what we 'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day <unk> . so what 's standing in our way what 's the problem <unk> . this is the problem satellites are big expensive and they 're slow <unk> this one weighs three tons <unk> it 's six. <unk> four meters wide <unk> it took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it one satellite one rocket <unk> it cost eight hundred and fifty five million dollars . satellites like these have done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet <unk> . but if we want to understand it much more regularly . we need lots of satellites and this model isn 't scalable so me and my friends we started planet labs to make satellites. <unk> i 'm going to show you what our satellite looks like . this is our satellite <unk> . this is not a scale model <unk> this is the real size it 's ten by ten by thirty centimeters it weighs four kilograms <unk> . and we 've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package. so that even though this is really small. this can take pictures ten times the resolution of the big satellite here <unk> even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass <unk> . and we call this satellite dove thank you . we call this satellite dove and we call it dove because satellites are. <unk> these sort of things <unk> but ours have a humanitarian mission so we wanted to call them doves <unk> . and we haven 't just built them though we 've launched them and not just one <unk> but many <unk> . it all started in our garage <unk> yes we built our first satellite prototype in our garage now this is pretty normal for a silicon valley company that we are but we believe. <unk> first time for a space company <unk> and. that 's not the only trick we learned from silicon valley <unk> we. rapidly prototype our satellites we use release early release often on our software <unk> and we take a different risk approach we take them. outside and test them <unk> we even put satellites in space just to test the satellites <unk> and we 've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale <unk> . we 've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them. i think for the first time we call it agile aerospace. and that 's what 's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box . now <unk> what has bonded our team over the years. is the idea of democratizing access to. <unk> in fact the founders of our company chris robbie and i we met over fifteen years ago at the united nations when they were hosting a conference. about exactly that question how do you use satellites to help humanity <unk> how do you use satellites to help people in developing countries or with climate change <unk> . and this is what has bonded us our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity . you could say we 're space geeks but not only do we care about what 's up there we care about what 's down here too i 'm going to show you a video. <unk> just four weeks ago of two of our satellites being launched from the international space station <unk> . this is not an animation <unk> this is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window it. gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites it 's like some of the smallest satellites ever are being launched from the biggest satellite ever . and right at the end the solar array glints in the. <unk> we didn 't just launch two of them like this we launched twenty eight of them it. 's the largest constellation of earth imaging satellites in human history <unk> and it 's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet <unk> . but that 's just the beginning . you see we 're going to launch more than one hundred of these satellites like these over the course of the next year. 's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history <unk> and this is what it 's going to do acting in a single orbit plane that stays fixed with respect to the sun the earth rotates <unk>. <unk> underneath they 're all cameras pointed down and they slowly scan across as the earth rotates underneath . <unk> a line scanner for the planet <unk> . we don 't take a picture of anywhere on the planet every day <unk> we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day <unk> even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago <unk> . we 've already got some initial imagery from the satellites. and i 'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now <unk> . this is the very first picture taken by our satellite <unk> it happened to be over uc davis ' campus in california when we turned the camera on . but what 's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area. which was taken many months ago <unk> and the image on the left is from our satellite <unk> and we see buildings are being built . the general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities every day <unk> . water as well <unk> thank you we. 'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water. <unk> security . from water security to food security . we 'll see crops as they grow in all the fields in every farmer 's field around the planet every day and help them to improve crop yield <unk> . this is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago. when the satellite was flying over argentina the general point is there are probably hundreds and thousands of applications of this data i 've mentioned a few but there 's others deforestation. <unk> the ice caps melting we can track all of these things every tree on the planet every day <unk> . if you took the difference between today 's image and yesterday 's image you 'd see much of the world news you 'd see floods and fires and earthquakes <unk> . and we have decided therefore that the best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it . we want to ensure everyone can. ngos and companies and scientists and journalists to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet <unk> we want to enable the developer community to. run their apps on our data in short we want to democratize access to information about our planet <unk> . which brings me back to this you see this will be an entirely new global data set <unk> and we believe that together. <unk> can help to take care of our spaceship earth <unk> . and what i would like to leave you with is the following question <unk> . if you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day <unk> what would you do with that data what problems would you solve what exploration would you do well. i invite you to come and explore with us <unk> thank you very much.
