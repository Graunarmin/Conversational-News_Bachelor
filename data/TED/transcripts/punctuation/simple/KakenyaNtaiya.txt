 <unk> in kenya people cross oceans. to go see them these people are tall they jump high <unk> they wear red <unk> and they kill lions. <unk> might be wondering who are these people these are the. maasais and you know what 's cool <unk> i 'm actually one of them . the maasais <unk> the boys are brought up to be warriors the girls are brought up to be mothers when i was. five years old <unk> i found out that i was engaged. to be married as soon as i reached puberty . my mother my grandmother . my aunties they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by . cool yeah and. everything i had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman. at age twelve my day started at five. <unk> in the morning <unk> milking the cows sweeping the house cooking for my siblings collecting water <unk> firewood <unk> . i did everything that i needed to do. to become a perfect wife i went to school not because the maasais <unk> ' women or girls were going to. <unk> 's because my mother was denied an education . and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living . why did she say that my father worked as a policeman. in the city he came home once a year <unk> we didn 't see him for sometimes even two years . and whenever he came home <unk> it was a different case my mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat. <unk> she reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us <unk> . but when my father came he would sell the cows he would sell the the products we had and he went and drank with his friends in. in the bars <unk> because my mother was a woman she was not allowed to own any property <unk> and by default everything in my family. <unk> belongs to my father so he had the right <unk> and if my mother ever questioned him he beat her abused her and really. it was difficult . when i went to school <unk> i had a dream <unk> i wanted to become a teacher <unk> . teachers looked nice <unk> they wear nice dresses high heeled shoes i found out later that they are uncomfortable but i admired it. <unk> most of all the teacher was just writing on the board. not hard work that 's what i thought. <unk> compared to what i was doing in the farm <unk> so i wanted to become a teacher <unk> i worked hard in school <unk> but when i was in eighth grade <unk> . it was a determining factor in our tradition there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become. <unk> and it 's a rite of passage to womanhood <unk> . and then i was just finishing my eighth grade <unk> and that was a transition for me to go to high school <unk> this was the crossroad . once i go through this tradition <unk> i was going to become a wife . well <unk> my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass <unk> so i talked. i had to come up with a plan to figure these things out i talked to my father i did something that most girls have never done. <unk> i told my father i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school . the reason why if i ran away <unk> my father will have a stigma . people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn 't go through the ceremony it was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life <unk> so he figured out. <unk> i did the ceremony happened <unk> it 's a whole week long of excitement. <unk> it 's a ceremony people are enjoying it . and the day before the actual ceremony happens we were dancing having excitement <unk> and through all the night we we did not sleep <unk> . the actual day came <unk> . and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in yes we danced and danced we walked out to the courtyard. and there were a bunch of people waiting <unk> they were all in a circle <unk> . and as we danced and danced and we approached this circle of women men women children everybody was there . there was a woman sitting in the middle of it <unk> . and this woman was waiting to hold us . <unk> were my sisters and a couple of other girls <unk> and as i approached her <unk> . she looked at me and i sat down <unk> . and i sat down <unk> and i opened my legs <unk> . as i opened my leg <unk> another woman came <unk> and this woman was carrying a knife <unk> . and as she carried the knife <unk> she walked toward me and she held the clitoris <unk> and. <unk> it off . as you can imagine <unk> i bled <unk> i bled after bleeding for a while i fainted thereafter <unk> . it 's something that so many girls i 'm lucky i never died but many die <unk> . it 's practiced <unk> it 's no anesthesia it 's a rusty old knife <unk> . and it was difficult <unk> i was lucky because one also. <unk> mom did something that most women don 't do . three days later after everybody has left the home my mom went and brought a nurse we were taken care of three weeks later <unk> i was healed and i was back in high school <unk> . i was so determined. to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference. <unk> while i was in high school <unk> something happened <unk> . i met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the university of oregon this man was wearing a white t shirt jeans. <unk> camera. <unk> white sneakers and i 'm talking about white sneakers there is something about clothes i think and shoes. they were sneakers. <unk> that doesn 't even have paved roads it was quite attractive <unk> . i told him . well i want to go to where you are because this man looked very happy <unk> . and i admired that <unk> . and he told me well what do you. mean you want to go don 't you have a husband waiting for you and i told him don 't worry about that part just tell me how to get there. <unk> while i was in high school also my dad was sick he got a stroke <unk> and he was really really sick so he really couldn 't tell me what to do next <unk> . but the problem is my father is not the only father i have . everybody who is my dad 's age male in the community is my father by default my uncles all of them and they dictate what my future is . so the news came <unk> i applied. <unk> to school and i was accepted to randolph macon woman 's college in lynchburg virginia <unk> and i couldn 't come. without the support of the village because i needed to raise money to buy the air ticket i got a scholarship but i needed to get myself here <unk> . but i needed the support of the village <unk> . and here again when the men heard and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school. <unk> they said what a lost opportunity this should have been given to a boy <unk> we can 't do this . so i went back and i had to go back to the tradition <unk> . there 's a belief among our people that. morning brings good news so i had to come up with something to do with the morning <unk> because there 's good news in. <unk> if he says yes everybody will follow him <unk> so i went to him very early in the morning as the sun rose the first thing he sees when he. opens his door is <unk> it 's me . my child what are you doing here well dad i need help can you support me to go to america . i promised him that i would be the best girl <unk> i will come back . anything they wanted after that i will do it for. he said well but i can 't do it alone he gave me a list of another. fifteen men that i went sixteen more men every single morning i went and visited them they all came together . the village the women the men everybody came together to support me. to come to get an education <unk> i arrived in america as you can imagine what did i find <unk> i found snow. i found wal marts vacuum cleaners <unk> . and lots of food in the cafeteria i was in a land of plenty <unk> . i enjoyed myself . but during that moment while i was here <unk> i discovered a lot of things <unk> i learned that. that ceremony that i went through when i was thirteen years old <unk> it was called. <unk> female genital mutilation <unk> i learned that it was against the law in kenya <unk> i learned that. i did not have to trade part of my body. to get an education <unk> i had a right <unk> and as we speak right now <unk> three million girls in africa are at risk of going through. <unk> i learned that my mom had a right to own property <unk> i learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman . those things made me angry <unk> . i wanted to do something <unk> . as i went back every time i went <unk> i found that my neighbors ' girls were getting married <unk> they were getting mutilated <unk> . and here <unk> after i graduated from here i worked at the u n i went back to school to get my graduate work. <unk> the constant cry of these girls was in my face i had to do something . as i went back <unk> i started talking to the men to the village and mothers and i said i want to give back the way i had promised you that i would come back and help you . what do you need as i spoke to the women they told me you know what we need we really need a school for. <unk> because there had not been any school for girls and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she 's walking to school <unk> the mother is blamed for that . if she got pregnant. before she got married <unk> the mother is blamed for that and she 's punished she 's beaten they said we wanted to put our girls in a safe place . as we moved <unk> and i went to talk to the fathers the fathers of course you can imagine what they said we want a school for boys and i said. <unk> well <unk> there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education <unk> . why can 't they build a school for boys and i 'll build a school for girls that made sense <unk> and they agreed <unk> . and i told them <unk> i wanted them to show me a sign of commitment and they did <unk> they donated land. <unk> to meet one of the girls in that school <unk> . angeline came to apply for the school . and she did not meet any criteria that we had . she 's an orphan yes <unk> we could have taken her for that but she was older <unk> she was twelve years old and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade <unk> . angeline had been moving from one place because she 's an orphan she has no mother she has no father moving from one grandmother 's house to another one from aunties to aunties she had no. <unk> stability in her life <unk> and i looked at her i remember that day and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline . and yes she was older to be in fourth grade <unk> we gave her the opportunity to come to the class . five months later that is angeline a transformation had begun in her life angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world. <unk> she was not the top student when we took her <unk> now she 's the best student not just in our school <unk> but in the entire division that we are in . that 's sharon that 's five years later . that 's evelyn five months later that is the difference that we are making . as a new. dawn is happening in my school a new beginning is happening as we speak right now one hundred and twenty five girls will never be mutilated . one hundred twenty five girls. will not be married when they 're twelve years old one hundred twenty five girls are creating and achieving their dreams . this is the thing that we are doing giving them opportunities where they can. <unk> as we speak right now women are not being beaten. because of the revolutions we 've started in our community i want to challenge. you today <unk> . you are
