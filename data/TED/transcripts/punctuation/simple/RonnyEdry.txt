 <unk> on march fourteen this year i posted this poster on facebook <unk> this is an image of me and my daughter. holding the israeli flag <unk> i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted a few days. <unk> ago <unk> i was sitting waiting. on the line at the grocery store <unk> and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other <unk> and the owner was explaining to the client that we 're going to get ten thousand missiles on israel <unk> . and the client was saying no it 's ten thousand a day. this is where we are now in israel we have this war with iran coming for ten years now <unk> and we have people <unk> you know <unk> afraid <unk> . it 's like every year it 's. the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran <unk> it 's like <unk> if we don 't act now it 's too late forever for ten. <unk> so at some point it became you know to me <unk> i 'm a graphic designer so i made posters about it and i posted the one i just showed you before <unk> . most of the time i make posters i post them on facebook my friends like it don 't like it most of the time don 't like it don 't share it don 't nothing <unk> . and it 's another day. <unk> so i went to sleep <unk> and that was it for me and later on in the night <unk> i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night. <unk> and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots you know on facebook <unk> which i 've never seen before . and i was like what 's going on . so i come to the computer and i start looking on and suddenly i see many people talking to me <unk> most of them i don 't know . and a few of them. <unk> you have to understand in israel we don 't talk with people from iran <unk> we don 't know people from iran <unk> it 's like <unk> on facebook you have friends only from it 's like your neighbors are your friends on facebook <unk> . and now people from iran are talking to me <unk> so i start answering this. <unk> and she 's telling me she saw the poster and. she asked her family to come because they don 't have a computer she asked her family to come to see the poster and they 're all sitting in the living room crying <unk> . so i 'm like whoa . i ask my wife to come <unk> and i tell her you have to see that people are crying <unk> and she came she read the text <unk> and she started to cry <unk> . and everybody 's crying now . so i don 't know what to do so my first reflex as a graphic designer. is <unk> you know to show everybody what i 'd just seen and people started to see them and to share them and that 's how it started . the day after when really it became a lot of talking i said to myself and my wife said to me <unk> i also want a poster <unk> so. this is her . laughter because. <unk> put me in a poster now. <unk> but more seriously <unk> i was like <unk> okay <unk> these ones work but it 's not just about me <unk> it 's about people from israel who want to say something so i 'm going to shoot all the <unk>. <unk> people i know <unk> if they want and i 'm going to put them in a poster and i 'm going to share them <unk> so i went to my neighbors and friends and students and i just asked them . from facebook friends and others just understand that they can be part of it it 's not just one dude making one poster it <unk> 's. we can be part of it so they start sending me pictures and ask me make me a poster post it <unk> tell the iranians we from israel love you too . it became you know at some point it was really really intense. <unk> friends. to come . graphic designers most of them to make posters with me because i didn 't have the time it was a huge amount of pictures <unk> so for a few days that 's how my living room. was and we received. israeli posters israeli images <unk> but also lots of comments lots of. <unk> this one is really moving for me because it 's the story of a girl who has been raised. in iran to walk on on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning. and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending she starts she she said that she changed her mind <unk> and now. she she loves that blue she loves that star and she loves that flag talking about the israeli flag <unk> and she wished that we 'd meet. and come to visit one another and just a few days after i posted the first poster . <unk> the day after iranians started to respond with their own posters <unk> they have graphic designers what crazy crazy . so you can see they are still shy they don 't want to show their faces but they want to spread the message they want to respond they want to say the same thing so . and now it 's. communication <unk> it 's a two way story <unk>. <unk> this never happened before <unk> and this is. two people supposed to be enemies we 're on the verge of a war <unk> and suddenly people on facebook are starting to say . i like this guy <unk> i love those guys . and it became really big at some point <unk> . and then. it became news <unk> because when you 're seeing the middle east <unk> you see only the bad. <unk> news <unk> and suddenly there is something that was happening that was good news <unk> so the guys on the news they say okay let 's talk about this . and they just came <unk> and it was so much i remember one day. michal she was talking with the journalist and she was asking him who 's gonna see the show and he said. <unk> forty million people are going to see you today it 's everybody the chinese <unk> and we were just at the beginning. of the story something crazy also happened every time a country started talking about it like germany. <unk> america wherever a page on facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories so at the beginning we had <unk>. which is an iranian sitting in tehran. this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message to people sending their love one to each other . the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me . google the word ' israel '. and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google. <unk> when you were. typing israel or iran . we really changed how people. see the middle east <unk> because you 're not in the middle east you 're somewhere over there and then you want to see the middle east so you go on google and you say israel and they give you the bad stuff <unk> and for a few days you got those images. <unk> one of the photos <unk> so for five months now that 's what we are doing me michal a few of my friends are just. making images we 're showing a new reality. by just making images because that 's how the world perceives us <unk> they see. <unk> images of us <unk> and they see bad images <unk> so we 're working on making good images <unk> end of story . look at this one <unk> this is the. <unk> page this is not <unk>. <unk> this is not my page <unk> this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli. <unk> and it 's going both ways <unk> it 's like we are showing respect one to each other <unk> and we 're understanding . and you show compassion and you become friends . and at some point you become. <unk> friends on facebook <unk> and you become friends in life <unk> you can go and travel and meet people <unk> and. i was in munich a few weeks ago <unk> . i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people from the page that told me okay you 're going to be in europe i 'm coming i 'm coming from france from holland. <unk> of course and from israel people came <unk> and we just met there for the first time in real life i met with people that. are supposed to be my enemies. for the first time <unk> and we just shake hands <unk> and have a coffee and a nice discussion <unk> and we talk about food and basketball and that was the end of it <unk> . remember that image from the beginning at some point we met in real life <unk> and we. and it goes the other way around some girl that we met on facebook. never been in israel <unk> born and raised in iran <unk> lives in germany <unk> afraid. of israelis because of what she knows about us <unk> decides after a few months of talking on the internet. <unk> and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says okay <unk> not that big a deal . so a few weeks ago the stress is is getting higher <unk> so we start this new campaign called . not ready to die in your war i mean <unk> it 's plus minus the same message but we wanted really to to add some aggressivity to it. again something amazing happened something that we didn 't have on the first wave of the campaign now people from iran <unk> the same ones who were shy. at the first campaign and just sent you know their foot and half their faces now they 're sending their faces and they 're saying okay <unk> . no problem we 're into it <unk> we are with you. <unk> just read. where those guys are from and for every guy from israel . you 've got someone from iran <unk> . just people sending their pictures. <unk> may ask yourself who is this dude . my name is ronny edry and i 'm forty one i 'm an israeli i 'm a. father of two i 'm a husband <unk> and i 'm a graphic designer <unk> i 'm teaching graphic. <unk> and i 'm not that naive <unk> because a lot of the time i 've been asked <unk> many times i 've been asked yeah but . this is really naive sending flowers over <unk> i mean. i was in the army <unk> i was in the paratroopers for three years and i know how it looks from the ground i know how. it can look really bad so to me <unk> this is the courageous thing to do to try to reach the other. <unk> side before it 's too late <unk> because when it 's going to be too late it 's going to be too late and sometimes. war is inevitable . sometimes but maybe [. with ] effort we can avoid it <unk> maybe as people because especially in israel we 're in a democracy <unk> . we have the freedom of speech <unk> and maybe that little thing can change something . and really we can be our. own ambassadors we can just. send a message and hope for the best. <unk> so i want to ask michal my wife to come with me on the stage just. to make with you one image because it 's all about images <unk> and maybe that image.
