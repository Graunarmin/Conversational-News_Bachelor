 <unk> this story starts with these two. my kids we were hiking in the oakland woods when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek she looked at me and said . <unk> that doesn 't go there when she said that it reminded me of summer camp . on the morning of visiting day right before they 'd let our anxious parents come barreling through the gates our camp director would say quick <unk> everyone pick up five pieces of litter . you get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces and pretty soon you 've got a much cleaner camp <unk> . so i thought <unk> why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model. to the entire planet <unk> and that was the inspiration for. <unk> the vision is to create a litter free world let me show you how it started i took a picture of a cigarette using instagram . then i took another photo <unk> . and another photo <unk> and another photo and i noticed two things one litter became artistic and approachable <unk> . and two at the end of a few days i had fifty photos on my phone and i had picked up each piece and i realized. <unk> that i was keeping a record of the positive impact. i was having on the planet that 's fifty less things that you might see or you might step on or some bird might eat so i started telling people what i was doing <unk> . and they started. participating one day <unk> this photo showed up. <unk> was more than just pretty pictures we were becoming a community that was collecting data . each photo tells a story it tells us who picked up what a geotag tells us where. and a time stamp tells us when so. i built a google map and started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up and through that process the community grew. <unk> and the data grew my two kids go to school right in that bullseye . litter it 's blending into the background of our lives but what if we brought it to the forefront . what if we understood exactly what was on our streets our sidewalks. and our school yards how might we use that data. to make a difference <unk> well let me show you the first is with. <unk> cities . san francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes <unk> why to create a tax <unk> . so they put a couple of people in the streets with pencils and clipboards who walked around collecting information which led to a 20 cent tax on all cigarette sales <unk> . and then they got sued. by big tobacco who claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards. <unk> is neither precise. nor provable . the city called me and asked if our technology could help i 'm. not sure they realized that our technology was my instagram account but i said yes we can . and we can tell you if that 's a parliament or a pall mall plus <unk> every photograph is. <unk> five thousand pieces later our data was used in court to not only defend. but double the tax <unk> generating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars. for san francisco to clean itself up . now during that process i learned two things one instagram is not the right tool . so we built an app <unk> and two if you think about it <unk> every city in the world. has a unique. litter fingerprint and that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem and the path to the solution . if you could generate a revenue stream just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes well what about coffee cups. or soda cans or plastic bottles . <unk> you could fingerprint san francisco well how about oakland. or amsterdam. or somewhere much closer to home . and what about brands how might they use this data to align their environmental and economic interests . there 's a block in downtown oakland that 's covered in blight the litterati community got together and picked up one thousand five hundred pieces. <unk> and here 's what we learned most of that litter came from a very well known taco brand . most of that brand 's litter were their own hot sauce packets and most of those hot sauce packets. hadn 't even been opened . the problem. and the path to the solution well maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request. or installs bulk dispensers or comes up with more sustainable packaging how does a brand take an. <unk> environmental hazard turn it into an economic engine and become an industry hero . if you really want to create change there 's no better place to start than with our kids a. group of fifth graders picked up one thousand two hundred and forty seven pieces of litter just on their school yard <unk> . and they learned that the most common type of litter were the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria . so these kids went to their principal and asked. why are we still buying straws . and they stopped <unk> . and they learned that individually they could each make a difference <unk> but together they created an impact . it doesn 't matter if you 're a student or a scientist <unk> whether you live in honolulu or hanoi <unk> this is a community. <unk> started because of two little kids in the northern california woods and today it 's spread across the world and you know how we 're getting there <unk> . one piece at a time.
