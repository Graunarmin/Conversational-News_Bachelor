 <unk> i work for the red cross and. i 'm a physical therapist my job is to make. arms and legs well it 's not completely true <unk> we do more than that we provide the. patients the afghan disabled first with the physical rehabilitation. then with the social reintegration <unk> it 's a very logical plan <unk> . but it was not always like this for many years we were just providing them with. artificial limbs <unk> it took. quite. <unk> for the program to become what it is now <unk> today i would like to. to tell you a story the story of a big change <unk> and the story of the people who made this change possible . i arrived in afghanistan in one thousand nine hundred and ninety. to work in a hospital for. <unk> not only for war victims but it was for any kind of patient <unk> i was also working in. the orthopedic center we call it this is the place where we make the legs at that time. i found myself. in a strange situation <unk> i felt not quite ready for that job <unk> there was so much to learn . there were so many things new to me but it was a terrific job. but as soon as the fighting intensified the physical rehabilitation was suspended there were many other things to do . so the orthopedic center was closed. because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority. every time i i make this speech it 's not the first time but it 's an emotion it 's something that comes comes out from the past. displaced people <unk> but one day something happened <unk> i was. coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque. where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions <unk> i wanted to go home i was driving. <unk> forget you don 't want to see things so you just want to to go to your room to lock yourself inside and say that 's enough . a bomb fell not far from my car well far enough but big noise and. everybody disappeared from the street the cars disappeared as well i ducked and. <unk> only one figure remained in the middle of the road it was a man in a wheelchair. desperately trying to. to move away well i 'm not a particularly brave person i have to confess it but. i could not just ignore him <unk> so i stopped the car. <unk> i went to help <unk> the man was. without legs. and only with one arm <unk> behind him there was a child his son red in the face in an effort to. to push the father <unk> so i took him into a safe place and. i ask what are you doing out in the. <unk> and then i ask an. even more stupid question why don 't you have the prostheses <unk> why don 't you have the artificial legs and he said the red cross has closed . well without thinking <unk> i told him come tomorrow <unk> we will provide you with a. <unk> my god what did i say <unk> the center is closed no staff around <unk> maybe the machinery. is broken who is going to make the legs for him so i hoped that. <unk> he would not come this is the streets of kabul. in those days <unk> so i. said well i will give him some money and so the following day <unk> i went to the orthopedic center <unk> and i spoke with a. gatekeeper <unk> i was ready to tell him listen if someone such and such comes. <unk> tell him that it was a mistake nothing can be done . give him some money but mahmoud and his son were already there <unk> and they were not alone . there were fifteen <unk> maybe twenty people like him. waiting and there was some staff too among them there was my right hand man najmuddin. <unk> we have to go away we cannot stay here they were bombing not very close but you could hear the noise of the bombs so we cannot stay here it 's dangerous <unk> it 's not a priority . but najmuddin told me listen now we 're here at least we can start repairing the prostheses the broken prostheses of the people and maybe. try to do something for people like. <unk> mahmoud i <unk>. we cannot do that <unk> it 's really dangerous <unk> we have other things to do but they insisted <unk> when you have. twenty people. in front of you looking at you and you are the the one who has to decide <unk> . so we started doing some repairs also one of the physical therapists reported that. mahmoud. could. be provided with a leg but not immediately the legs were swollen and the knees were stiff so he needed a long preparation . believe me i was worried because i was breaking the rules i was doing something that. i was not supposed to do in the evening i went to to speak with the bosses at the headquarters and i told them i lied. <unk> i told them listen <unk> we are going to start a couple of hours per day <unk> just a few repairs maybe some of them. <unk> on the patients he was telling me patients are coming we knew that. many more patients could not come prevented by the fighting but people were coming <unk> and mahmoud was coming every day <unk> . and slowly slowly week after week. his legs were improving <unk> . <unk> he was starting the real physical rehabilitation <unk> he was coming every day crossing the front line . a couple of times i crossed the front line in the very place where mahmoud and his son were crossing <unk> . i tell you it was something so sinister that. i was astonished he could do it every day. mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs <unk> . it was april i remember a very beautiful day <unk> april in kabul is beautiful full of roses <unk> full of flowers <unk> . we could not possibly stay indoors with all these sandbags at the windows very. <unk> so we. chose a small spot in the garden <unk> and. mahmoud put on his prostheses <unk> the other patients did the same <unk> and they started. practicing for the last time before being discharged suddenly they started fighting <unk> . two groups of mujahideen started fighting we could hear in the air the. <unk> the shelter . mahmoud grabbed his son i grabbed someone else everybody was grabbing something and. we ran you know fifty meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed <unk> but. we managed to reach the shelter <unk> inside all of us panting i sat a. <unk> of course i can i can run and now you can go to school <unk> . no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair . later on we took them home <unk> and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair. <unk> and then i understood physical rehabilitation is a priority <unk> . dignity cannot wait for better times. from that day on we never closed a single day . well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours but we never <unk> we never. closed it again <unk> i met mahmoud one year later. <unk> later he was in good shape. a bit thinner he needed. to change his prostheses a new pair of prostheses i asked about his son he told me he 's at school he 'd doing quite well but. i understood he wanted to tell me. <unk> and he was standing in front of me <unk> his head down <unk> . he said . you have taught me to walk <unk> thank you very much now help me. not to be a beggar anymore that was the job. my children are growing <unk> i feel ashamed <unk> i don 't want them to be teased at school. by the other students . i said okay i thought <unk> how much money do i have in my pocket just to give him some money it was the easiest way . <unk> i ask for a job . and then he added something. i will never forget for the rest of my life he said . i am a scrap of a man <unk> . but if you help me i 'm ready to do anything even if i have to crawl on the ground. <unk> and then he sat down <unk> i sat down too with goosebumps everywhere <unk> . legless with only one arm. <unk> we need to increase the production of feet <unk> we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the. <unk> we can modify the. the workbench maybe to put a special stool a special anvil special vice and maybe an electric screwdriver i said listen. <unk> it 's insane <unk> and it 's even cruel to think of anything like this that 's a production line and a very fast one <unk> it 's cruel to. offer him a job knowing that he 's going to fail . but with najmuddin <unk> we cannot discuss so. the only things i could manage to to obtain was a kind of. <unk> compromise only one week. one week try and not a single day more one week later mahmoud was the fastest in the production line . i told najmuddin that 's a trick <unk> . i can 't believe it the production was up twenty percent it 's a trick it 's a trick i said <unk> and then i asked for verification. it was true <unk> the comment of najmuddin was mahmoud has something to prove <unk> i understood that. <unk> i was wrong again <unk> mahmoud had looked taller i remember him sitting behind the workbench. smiling he was a new. <unk> i understood that what made him stand tall. yeah they were the legs thank you very much but as a first step <unk> . it was the dignity <unk> he has regained his full dignity thanks to that job <unk> . so of course i understood and then. we started a new policy a new policy completely different. we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job <unk> it became. a policy of positive discrimination we call it now <unk> and. you know what it 's good for everybody everybody benefits from that. those employed of course <unk> because. they get a job. and dignity. but also for the newcomers <unk> they are seven thousand every year people coming for the first time . and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them sometimes you see them they look. <unk> and it 's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability <unk> poof they learn much faster the motivation . the empathy they can establish with the patient is completely different completely . scraps of men do not exist people like. <unk> you cannot stop so. employing people yes but also we started programming projects of microfinance <unk> education <unk> and when you start you cannot stop so you do vocational training <unk>. <unk> home education for those who cannot go to school <unk> physical therapies can be done not only in the orthopedic center but also in the houses of the people . <unk> 's najmuddin the one with the white coat <unk> terrible najmuddin is that one . i have learned a lot from people like najmuddin mahmoud rafi they are my teachers <unk> . i have a wish a big wish <unk> that this way of working this way of thinking is going to be implemented in other countries. <unk> are plenty of countries at war like afghanistan . it is possible and it is not difficult <unk> . all we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist . to make them part of the the decision making process. and then of course to adapt . <unk> my big wish <unk> well don 't think that the changes in afghanistan are over not at all we are going on <unk> recently we have just. started a program a sport program. basketball for wheelchair users <unk> we transport the wheelchairs everywhere we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan. at the beginning when anajulina. <unk> and then i asked the usual question is it a priority <unk> is it. really necessary . well now you should see me <unk> i never miss a single training session <unk> the night before a match i 'm very nervous <unk> and. you should see me. during the match i shout. <unk> a true italian . what 's next what is going to be the next change well. i don 't know yet but i 'm sure najmuddin and his friends they have it already in mind . that was my story <unk> thank you very much.
