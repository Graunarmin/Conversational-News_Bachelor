 <unk> what i do is i organize information i 'm a graphic designer <unk> professionally i try to make sense. often of things that don 't make much sense themselves <unk> so my father might not understand what it is that i do for a. <unk> his part of my ancestry has been farmers he 's part of this ethnic minority called the pontic greeks <unk> . they lived in asia minor and fled to greece after a genocide about a hundred years ago <unk> . and ever since that <unk> migration has somewhat been a theme in my family my father moved to germany <unk> studied there and married <unk> . and as a result <unk> i now have this. <unk> with all the analytical thinking and that slightly dorky demeanor that come with that <unk> . and of course it meant that i was a foreigner in both countries <unk> and that of course made it pretty easy for me. to migrate as well <unk> in good family tradition if you like . but of course most journeys that we undertake from day to day are within a city . and especially if you know the city <unk> getting from a to b may seem pretty obvious. <unk> but the question is why is it obvious how do we know where we 're going <unk> . so i washed up on a dublin ferry port about twelve years ago a professional foreigner if you like <unk> and. i 'm sure you 've all had this experience before yeah <unk> you arrive in a new city <unk> and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place once you find your base your home. <unk> you start to build this cognitive map of your environment . it 's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain . all animal species do it even though we all use slightly different tools <unk> us humans of course we don 't. move around marking our territory by scent like dogs <unk> we don 't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks like bats. <unk> just don 't do that although a night in the temple bar district can get pretty wild . laughter no. <unk> we do two important things to make a place our own first we move along linear routes <unk> typically we find a main street <unk> . and this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds <unk> but our mind keeps. <unk> every street is generally perceived as a straight line <unk> and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make . when we do however make a turn into a side street <unk> our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 degree angle . this of course makes for some funny moments when you 're in some old city layout that follows some sort of. circular. <unk> maybe you 've had that experience as well <unk> <unk> let 's say you 're on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square <unk> and you want to get to another point. on a side street just like that . the cognitive map in your mind may tell you . aris go back to the main cathedral square <unk> take a 90 degree turn and walk down that other side street . but somehow you feel adventurous that day <unk> and you suddenly discover. <unk> that the two spots were actually only a single building apart <unk> now i don 't know about you <unk> but i always feel like i find this wormhole or this inter dimensional portal . so we move along linear routes. and our mind straightens streets and perceives. <unk> the second thing that we do to make a place our own is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those along those lines <unk> . if you go to the irish countryside. and you ask an old lady for directions <unk> . brace yourself for some elaborate irish storytelling about all the landmarks <unk> yeah <unk> she 'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work and go past that church where i got married that kind of thing. <unk> so we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning . what 's more <unk> we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them we recognize them by the experiences. and we abstract them into symbols <unk> and of course <unk> we 're all capable of understanding. <unk> what 's more <unk> we 're all capable of understanding the cognitive maps <unk> and. you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves <unk> so next time when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place <unk> . you grab a beermat grab a napkin <unk> . and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design it 's got straight lines it 's got. <unk> little symbols along the way <unk> and. when you look at what you 've just drawn <unk> . you realize it does not resemble a street map <unk> . if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you 've just drawn <unk> you 'd realize your streets and the distances they 'd be way off . no what you 've just drawn is more like a diagram or a. <unk> schematic it 's a visual construct. of lines <unk> dots <unk> letters designed in the language of our brains so it 's no big surprise. that the big. icon of the last century the pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from a to b the london underground map. was not designed by a cartographer or. <unk> a city planner it was designed by an engineering draftsman in the <unk>. harry beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design. and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever now the very key to the success of this map. is in the omission of less important. <unk> information. and in the extreme simplification <unk> . so <unk> straightened streets <unk> . corners of ninety and forty five degrees <unk> but also the extreme geographic distortion in that map <unk> if you were to look at the actual locations of these stations <unk> you 'd see they 're very different <unk>. <unk> but this is all for the clarity of the public tube map. <unk> if you say wanted to get from regent 's park station to great portland street <unk> the tube map would tell you <unk> take the tube <unk> go to baker street <unk> change over take another tube of course what you don 't know is. that the two stations are only about a hundred meters apart <unk> now we 've reached the subject of public. <unk> public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject . for everybody who does not know the public transport here in dublin essentially we have this system of local buses that grew with the city <unk> . for every outskirt that was added <unk> there was another bus route added <unk> running from the outskirt all the way to the city center <unk> . and as these local buses approach the city center <unk> they all run side by. <unk> side and converge in pretty much. one main street so when i stepped stepped off the boat twelve years ago <unk> i tried to make sense of that <unk> . because. exploring a city on foot only gets you so far <unk> but when you explore a foreign and new public. <unk> you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way <unk> . typically <unk> you choose yourself a rapid transport route . and in your mind this route is perceived as a straight line <unk> . and like a pearl necklace all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line <unk> . and only then you start to discover. some local bus routes. that would fill in the gaps and that allow for those wormhole inter dimensional portal shortcuts <unk> . so i tried to make sense <unk> . and when i arrived <unk> i was looking for some information leaflets that would help me crack this system and understand it <unk> and i found those brochures. <unk> a lot of omission of information <unk> but unfortunately the wrong information <unk> say in the city center. there were never actually any lines that showed the routes there are actually not even any stations with names. <unk> have gotten better <unk> and. after i finished the project. <unk> they got a good a good bit better <unk> but still no station names <unk> still no routes so being naive <unk> . and being half german . i decided aris why don 't you build your own map so that 's what i did <unk> i researched how each and every bus route moved through the city. nice and logical every bus route a separate line <unk> i plotted it into my own map of dublin . and in the city center <unk> i got a nice spaghetti plate . now this is a bit of a mess <unk> so i decided of course. <unk> you 're going to apply the rules of schematic design cleaning up the corridors widening the streets where there were loads of buses and making the streets at straight 90 degree corners 45 degree corners or fractions of that . and filled it in with the bus routes . and i built this city center bus map of the system how it was five years ago i. 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of. the quays and westmoreland street. <unk> now i can proudly say . i can proudly say . as a public transport map <unk> this diagram. is an utter failure . except probably in. <unk> i now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was now call me <unk>. but i think a public transport route map should have lines <unk> . because that 's what they are <unk> yeah <unk> they 're little pieces of string that wrap their way through the city center or through the city <unk> . if you will <unk> the greek guy inside of me. feels if i don 't get a line <unk> it 's like entering the labyrinth. <unk> of the minotaur without having ariadne giving you the string to find your way <unk> so the outcome of. my academic research <unk> loads of questionnaires case studies. and looking at a lot of maps . was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the public transport system here in dublin was the lack of a coherent public transport map a simplified coherent public transport map. because i think this is the crucial step to understanding a public transport network on a physical level <unk> but it 's also the crucial step. to make a public transport network mappable on a visual level <unk> . so i teamed up with a gentleman called james leahy a civil engineer and a recent master 's. <unk> and together we drafted the simplified model network <unk> which i could then go ahead and visualize <unk> so here 's what we did <unk> . we distributed these. <unk> corridors throughout the city center <unk> and extended them into the outskirts rapid <unk> because we wanted them to be. <unk> james wanted to use bus rapid transport for that rather than light rail for me it was important. that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the. <unk> we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again so in other words <unk>. <unk> if there was a street in an outskirt where there had been a bus <unk> we put a bus back in . <unk> one of these thick lines over there so the rest was merely a couple of months of work. and a couple of fights with my girlfriend of our place constantly being. clogged up with maps and the outcome one of the outcomes was this map of the greater dublin area i 'll zoom in a little bit . this map only shows the rapid transport connections no local bus very. <unk> was so successful in london and that since has been. exported to so many other major cities and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps . what 's also important is with a simplified network like this it now would become possible for me. to tackle the ultimate challenge and make a public transport map for the city center. <unk> where i wouldn 't just show rapid transport connections <unk> but also all the local bus routes streets and the likes <unk> and this is what a map like this could look like i 'll zoom in a little bit . in this map <unk> i 'm including each transport mode <unk> so rapid transport . <unk> individual route is represented represented by a separate line <unk> . the map shows each and every station each and every station name <unk> . and. i 'm also displaying displaying side streets in fact <unk> most of the side streets even with their. <unk> for good measure also a couple of landmarks some of them signified by little symbols <unk> others by these isometric three dimensional bird 's eye view drawings <unk> . the map is relatively small in overall size so something that you could still hold as a fold out map or display in a reasonably sized display box on a bus shelter i think. it tries to be the the best balance between actual representation. and simplification the language of way finding in our brain . so straightened lines <unk>. cleaned up corners <unk> and of course that very very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible . if you for example have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city the yellow and orange one over here this is how they look in. <unk> accurate street map <unk> and this is how they would look in my. distorted simplified public transport map <unk> . so for a successful public transport map <unk> we should not stick to accurate representation <unk> but design them in the way our brains work <unk> the reactions i got were tremendous <unk>. it was really good to see <unk> and of course for my own self <unk> i was very happy to see that my folks in germany and greece finally have an idea.
