 <unk> making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube and this exhibition is the first one i did using paper. <unk> and environmental issues <unk> . i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure it 's very complicated to test the. new material for the building but this is much stronger than i expected and also it 's very easy to waterproof and also because it 's industrial. <unk> this is the first temporary building made out of paper there are three hundred and thirty tubes. <unk> there was a big expo in germany i was asked to design the building because the theme of the expo was environmental issues <unk> so i was chosen to build. the pavilion out of paper tubes recyclable paper. my goal of the design is not when it 's completed my goal was when the building was demolished <unk> because. <unk> each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year <unk> we create a lot of industrial waste so my building has to be reused or <unk>. after the building was recycled <unk> so that was the goal of my design then. i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz <unk> . because i was so poor <unk> i wanted to rent an office in paris but i couldn 't afford it so i decided to bring my students to paris. <unk> to build our office on top of the pompidou center in paris by ourselves <unk> so we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the. <unk> see me they had to buy a ticket to see me that was the problem . then i completed the pompidou center in metz it 's a very popular museum now <unk> and i created a big monument for the government . but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect because we are not helping we are not working for. <unk> they have money and power those are invisible <unk> so they hire us to visualize their power and money. by making monumental architecture that is our profession <unk> even historically it 's the same <unk> even now we are. doing the same <unk> so i was very disappointed that we are not working for society. <unk> who lost their houses by natural disasters <unk> . but i must say they are no longer natural disasters . for example earthquakes never kill people <unk> but collapse of the buildings kill people <unk> that 's the responsibility of architects <unk> . then people need some temporary housing but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people <unk> . <unk> we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing <unk> we can make it better <unk> so that is why i started working in disaster <unk>. there was a big disaster in rwanda africa two tribes hutu and tutsi fought each other over two million people became refugees <unk> but i was so surprised to. <unk> just providing a plastic sheet and the refugees had to cut the trees and just like this . but over two million people cut trees it just became big heavy deforestation. and an environmental problem <unk> that. <unk> very expensive they throw them out for money <unk> then cutting trees again <unk> so i proposed my idea. to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong <unk> but my budget is only fifty u s dollars per unit <unk>. <unk> we built fifty units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and. <unk> we had a big earthquake <unk> . nearly seven thousand people were killed <unk> and the city like this nagata district all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake . and also i found out there 's many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church all the building was totally destroyed <unk> . so i went there. and also i proposed to the priests. <unk> why don 't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes and he said oh god are you crazy <unk> . after a fire what are you proposing so he never trusted me <unk> . but i didn 't give up i started commuting to kobe <unk> . and i met the society of vietnamese people they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park <unk> . so i proposed to rebuild i raised did. fundraising i made a paper tube shelter. <unk> for them and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish <unk> i used beer crates. as a foundation i asked the kirin beer company to propose because at that time the. asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red which doesn 't go with the color of the paper tubes the color coordination is very important. <unk> i still remember we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate but it came empty so i remember it was so disappointing <unk> . so during the summer with my students we built over fifty units of the shelters <unk> finally the priest finally he trusted me to rebuild he said as long as you collect money by yourself bring your students to build you can do it so we spent five weeks rebuilding the. <unk> it was meant to stay there for three years but actually it stayed there ten years because people loved it then. in taiwan they had a big earthquake . and we proposed to donate this church <unk> so we dismantled them we sent them over to be built by volunteer people it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now <unk> . so this building became a permanent building . then i wonder what is a permanent and what is a temporary building. <unk> even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it <unk> even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money . in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine in turkey the big earthquake i went there to use the local material to build a. shelter two thousand and one in west india <unk> i built also a shelter <unk> in two thousand and four in sri lanka after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami. <unk> rebuilt islamic fishermen 's villages and in two thousand and eight in. chengdu sichuan area in china. <unk> nearly seventy thousand people were killed <unk> and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor i was asked to rebuild the temporary church . i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese. month <unk> we completed nine classrooms over five hundred square meters it 's still used even after the current earthquake in china <unk> . in two thousand and nine in italy l 'aquila . also they had a big earthquake and this is a very interesting photo <unk> former prime minister berlusconi. <unk> have to change the prime minister ever year <unk> and they are very kind affording my model i proposed a big rebuilding <unk>. temporary music hall because l 'aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed so musicians were moving out <unk> so i proposed to the mayor i 'd like to. <unk> as long as you bring your money <unk> you can do it and i was very lucky mr berlusconi brought g8 summit and our former prime minister came <unk> so they helped us to. collect money and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary. auditorium <unk> year two thousand and ten in haiti there was a big earthquake but it 's impossible to fly. <unk> six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build fifty units of shelter out of local paper tubes this is what happened in japan two years ago <unk> in northern japan . after the earthquake and tsunami people had to be evacuated in a big room like a. gymnasium <unk> but look at this there 's no privacy people suffer mentally and physically <unk> so we went there to build partitions. with all the student volunteers with paper tubes just a very simple shelter. out of the tube frame and the curtain . however some of the facility authority doesn 't want us to do it because they said simply it 's become more difficult to control them . but it 's really necessary to do it they don 't have enough flat area to. <unk> housing like this one look at this even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing <unk> so dense. and so messy because there is no storage nothing <unk> water is leaking <unk> so i thought we have to make <unk> multi story building because there 's no land. and also it 's not very comfortable <unk> so i proposed to the. <unk> while i was making partitions finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi . he asked me to build three story housing <unk>. i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building. furniture to make them comfortable <unk> within the budget of the government but also the. area of the house is exactly the same <unk> but much more comfortable many of the. people want to stay here forever i was very happy to hear that . now i am working in in new zealand <unk> christchurch <unk> . about twenty days before the japanese earthquake happened also they had a big earthquake and many japanese students were also killed <unk> . and the most important cathedral of the city the symbol of. <unk> was totally destroyed <unk> and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral <unk> so this is under construction <unk> . and i 'd like to keep building monuments. that are beloved by people.
