 <unk> grew up interacting with the physical objects around us there are an enormous number of them that we. unlike most of our computing devices these objects are much more fun to use when you talk about objects. <unk> one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing . and that is gestures how we manipulate these objects how we use these objects in everyday life . we use gestures not only to interact with these objects but we also use them to interact with each other . a gesture of namaste maybe to respect someone or maybe in india i don 't need to teach a. <unk> in cricket it comes as a part of our everyday learning <unk> so i am very interested from the beginning how our knowledge. about everyday objects and gestures and how we use these objects can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world <unk> . rather than using a keyboard and mouse why can i not use my computer in the same way that i interact in the physical world <unk> . so i started this exploration. <unk> around eight years back <unk> and it literally started with a mouse on my desk. rather than using it for my computer <unk> i actually opened it. most of you might be aware that in those days the mouse used to come with a ball inside and there were two rollers. that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving and accordingly where the mouse is moving. <unk> i was interested in these two rollers <unk> and i actually wanted more so i borrowed another. mouse from a friend never returned to him and i now had four rollers . interestingly what i did with these rollers is basically <unk> i took them off of these mouses. and then put them in one line it had some strings and pulleys and some springs what i got is basically a <unk>. <unk> whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made around eight years back in two thousand <unk> . because i was interested in integrating these two worlds <unk> i thought of sticky notes . i thought why can i not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world a message written on a sticky note to my mom. <unk> on paper can come to an sms <unk> or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar. a to do list that automatically syncs with you . but you can also search in the digital world <unk> or maybe you can write a query saying what is dr smith 's address and this small system actually prints it out so it actually acts like a paper. <unk> just made out of paper . in another exploration i thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions <unk> . so i implemented this pen that can help designers and architects. not only think in three dimensions but they can actually draw so that it 's more intuitive to use that way then i thought why not make a google map . <unk> rather than. typing a keyword to find something i put my objects on top of it if i put a boarding pass it will show me where the flight gate is a coffee cup. will show where you can find more coffee <unk> or where you can trash the cup . so these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly <unk> . among all these experiments there was one thing in common i was trying to bring a part of the physical world. to the digital world. <unk> i was taking some part of the objects or any of the intuitiveness of real life and bringing them to the digital world <unk> . because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive <unk> . but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing . what we are interested in is information <unk> we want to know about things we want to know about dynamic things going around . so i thought. <unk> last year. in the beginning of the last year i started thinking why can i not take this approach in the reverse way maybe how about i take my digital world. and paint. the physical world with that digital information because pixels are actually right now confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets <unk> . <unk> why can i not remove this confine. and take that to my everyday objects everyday life so that i don 't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels <unk> . so <unk> in order to realize this dream i actually thought of putting a <unk> big size projector on my head i think that 's why this is called a head mounted projector isn 't it <unk> . i took it very literally and took my bike helmet put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely so now what i can do i can. <unk> the world around me with this digital information . but later i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels also so i put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye <unk> . later we moved to a much better. consumer oriented pendant version of that that many of you now know as the sixthsense device <unk> . but the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your. <unk> digital world with you wherever you go you can start using any surface any wall around you as an interface the camera is actually tracking. all your gestures <unk> whatever you 're doing with your hands it 's understanding that gesture . and actually if you see there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it you can start painting on any wall you stop by a wall and start painting on that wall <unk> . <unk> tracking one finger here . we are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. the camera is actually doing. just getting all the images is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms. <unk> little bit complex but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use in some sense <unk> . but i 'm more excited that you can actually take it outside <unk> . rather than getting your camera out of your pocket you can just do the gesture of taking a photo <unk> and it takes a photo for you thank. and later i can find <unk>. <unk> and start browsing those photos or maybe ok i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend so we are looking for an. an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world . and of course if you don 't have any surface you can start using your palm for simple operations here i 'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements but interestingly is also able to understand what. <unk> objects you are holding in your hand. for example in this case the book. cover is matched with so many thousands or maybe millions of books online <unk> and checking out which book it is once it has that information it finds out more reviews about that or maybe. new york times has a sound overview on that so you can actually. <unk> famous talk at harvard university this was obama 's. visit last week to mit and particularly i want to thank two outstanding. mit pranav mistry so i was seeing the live [ video ] of his talk outside <unk> on just a newspaper your newspaper will show you live. weather information rather than having it updated you have to check your computer in order to. <unk> 'm going back <unk> i can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed because at that particular time i 'm not feeling like opening my iphone and checking out a particular icon <unk> . and i think this technology will not only change the way yes <unk> it will change the way we interact with people also not only the physical. <unk> the fun part is i 'm going to the boston metro <unk> and playing a pong game inside the train. on on the ground right . laughter and i think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life <unk> but many of you argue actually that. all of our work is not only about physical objects <unk> we actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things <unk> what about that . and many of you are excited about the. <unk> to come out in the market <unk> so rather than waiting for that i actually made my own just using a piece of paper so what i did here is. remove the camera all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera i removed the microphone from that . and then just pinched that like i just made a clip out of the microphone and clipped that to a piece of paper any paper that you found. <unk> around so now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly i 'm touching the paper <unk> but the camera is actually tracking where. my fingers are moving you can of course watch movies. <unk> the camera is actually understanding how you 're holding the paper and playing a car racing game . many of you already must have thought ok you can browse yeah of course you can browse to any any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it . so more interestingly. <unk> i 'm interested in how we can take that. in a more dynamic way <unk> when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full size. computer . and why only computers <unk> we can just play with papers paper world is interesting to play with here i 'm taking a part of a document . and putting over here a second part from. <unk> and i 'm actually modifying the information that i have over there <unk> . yeah <unk> and i say <unk> ok this looks nice let me print it out that thing so i now have a print out of that thing so the the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe. twenty years back rather than now switching between these two worlds <unk> so as a last thought <unk> i think that integrating. information to everyday objects will not. <unk> only help us to get rid of the digital divide the gap between these two worlds <unk> . but will also help us in some way to stay human. to be more connected to our physical world . and it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines. <unk> this is there a company being planned <unk> or is this research forever or what pranav mistry so there are lots of companies sponsor companies of media lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the ngos in india . thinking why can we only have ' sixth sense ' we should have a ' fifth sense ' for missing sense people who cannot speak this technology can be used for them to speak out. in a different way maybe a speaker system. <unk> plans are you staying at mit or are you going to do something with this pm i 'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own sixthsense device because the hardware is actually not <unk>. <unk> that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own <unk> we will provide all the open source software for them maybe starting next month. <unk> you going to split your your time going forward pm there is a lot of energy here lots of learning all of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in india and now if you see it 's more about the cost effectiveness . <unk> this system costs you $ three hundred compared to the $ twenty thousand. surface tables or anything like that <unk> or maybe even the $ two mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ five thousand <unk>. i showed that at a conference <unk> to president abdul kalam at that time and then he said ok we should use this in bhabha atomic research centre for some use of that so i 'm excited about how i can bring the technology to the masses rather. <unk> based on the people we 've seen at ted i would say you 're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now it 's an honor to have you at.
