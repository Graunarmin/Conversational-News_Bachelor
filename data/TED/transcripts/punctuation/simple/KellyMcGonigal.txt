 <unk> i have a confession to make . but first <unk> i want you to make a little confession to me . in the past year i want you to just raise your hand. if you 've experienced relatively little stress. <unk> anyone how. about a moderate amount of stress <unk> . who has experienced a lot of stress <unk> yeah <unk> . me too <unk> but that is not my confession . my confession is this i am a health psychologist and my mission is to help people be happier and. <unk> but i fear. that something i 've been teaching for the last ten years. is doing more harm than good <unk> and it has to do with stress . for years i 've been telling people stress makes you sick it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease <unk> . basically i 've turned stress into the enemy <unk> . but i have changed my mind about stress and today <unk> i want to change yours. let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress . this study tracked thirty thousand adults in the united states for eight years and they started by asking people . how much stress have you experienced in the last year . they also asked do you believe that stress is harmful for your health. they used public death records to find out who died . okay. <unk> some bad news first <unk> . people who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a forty three percent increased risk of dying <unk> . but. that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. <unk> people who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die in fact they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study including people who had relatively little stress <unk> . now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths one hundred and eighty two thousand americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief. that stress is bad for you . that is over twenty thousand deaths a year <unk> . now if that estimate is correct . that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the united states last year <unk> . killing more people than skin cancer hiv aids and homicide. <unk> see why this study freaked me out here i 've been spending so much energy telling people. stress is bad for your health . so this study got me wondering can changing how you think about stress make you healthier <unk> and here the science says yes when you change your mind about stress you can change your body. <unk> now to explain how this works <unk> i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out <unk> it 's called the social stress test <unk> . you come into the laboratory <unk> and you 're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech. on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face. <unk> like this and. the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging non verbal feedback . like this . now that you 're sufficiently demoralized time for part two a math test and. <unk> unbeknownst to you the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it now we 're going to all do this together <unk> it 's going to be fun . for me okay . i want you all to count backwards from nine hundred and <unk> ninety six in increments of seven you 're going to do this out loud as. <unk> that guy made a mistake we are going to have to start all over again you. 're not very good at this are you okay . so you get the idea <unk> if you were actually in this study you 'd probably be a little stressed out your heart might be pounding you might be breathing faster maybe breaking out into a sweat. and normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren 't coping very well with the pressure <unk> . but what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized was preparing you to meet this challenge <unk> . now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at. <unk> before they went through the social stress test <unk> they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful that pounding heart is preparing you for action . if you 're breathing faster <unk> it 's no problem <unk> it 's getting more oxygen to your brain <unk> . and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance <unk> well they were less stressed out less anxious more confident. <unk> but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed <unk> . now in a typical stress response <unk> your heart rate goes up <unk> and your blood vessels constrict like this. <unk> and this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease <unk> it 's not really healthy to be in this state all the time . but in the study when participants viewed their stress response as helpful their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. <unk> this . their heart was still pounding but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile <unk> it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy. and courage . over a lifetime of stressful experiences this one biological change could be the difference. <unk> heart attack at age fifty and living well into your <unk>. and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters . so my goal as a health psychologist has changed i no longer want to get rid of your stress <unk> i want to make you better at stress <unk> . and we just did a little intervention <unk> if you raised your hand and said you 'd had a lot of stress in the last year <unk> we could have saved your life <unk> . <unk> the next time your heart is pounding from stress you 're going to remember this talk and you 're going to think to yourself this is my body helping me rise to this challenge <unk> . and when you view stress in that way your body believes you and your stress response becomes healthier <unk> . now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem. <unk> myself from so we are going to do one more intervention <unk> . i want to tell you about one of the most under appreciated aspects of the stress response <unk> and the idea is this stress makes you social . to understand this side of stress we need to talk about a hormone oxytocin . and i know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get it even has its own. <unk> cute nickname the cuddle hormone <unk> because it 's released when you hug someone but this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in . oxytocin is <unk>. a neuro hormone it fine tunes your brain 's social instincts <unk> it primes you to do things that strengthen close. <unk> oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family . it enhances your empathy <unk> it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about . some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin . to become more compassionate and caring <unk> but here 's what most people don 't. <unk> it 's a stress hormone <unk> . your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response it 's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound <unk> . and when oxytocin is released in the stress response <unk> it is motivating you to seek support <unk> . your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it. <unk> up <unk> your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling. so that you can support each other . when life is difficult your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you okay. so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier <unk> well oxytocin doesn 't only act on your brain. it also acts on your body <unk> . and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress <unk> it 's a natural. it also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress but my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart . your heart has receptors for this hormone <unk> . and oxytocin helps. <unk> heart cells regenerate. and heal from any stress induced damage this stress hormone strengthens your heart <unk> . and the cool thing is. is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support . so when you reach out to others under stress <unk> either to seek support or to help someone else. you release more of this hormone <unk> your stress response becomes healthier <unk> and you actually recover faster from stress <unk> . i find this amazing that your stress response has a built in mechanism for stress resilience <unk> . and that mechanism is human connection <unk> . i want to finish by telling you about one more study <unk> and listen up. <unk> up <unk> because this study could also save a life . this study tracked about one thousand adults in the united states and they ranged in age from thirty four to ninety three . and they started the study by asking how much stress have you experienced in the last year . they also asked how much time have you spent helping out friends <unk> neighbors people in your. <unk> community . and then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died <unk> . okay so the bad news first <unk> . for every major stressful life experience like financial difficulties or family crisis . that increased the risk of dying by thirty percent . but. and i hope you are expecting a. <unk> wasn 't true for everyone . people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying zero. <unk> caring created resilience <unk> . and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not. <unk> how you think. and how you act can transform your experience of stress <unk> when you choose to view your stress response as helpful <unk> . you create the biology of courage <unk> . and when you choose to connect with others under stress you can create resilience <unk> now. i wouldn 't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life. but. this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress stress gives us access to our hearts . the compassionate heart. that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others . and yes <unk> your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy. <unk> and when you choose to view stress in this way you 're not just getting better at stress you 're actually making a pretty profound statement. <unk> you 're saying that you can trust yourself. to handle life 's challenges <unk> and. you 're remembering that you don 't have to face them. <unk> kind of amazing what you 're telling us <unk> it seems amazing to me that a belief. about stress can make so much difference to. someone 's life expectancy how would that extend to advice like if someone is making a lifestyle choice between say a stressful job. <unk> and a non stressful job does it matter. which way they go it 's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense km yeah and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is <unk>. <unk> better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort <unk> and so i would say that 's really the best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.
