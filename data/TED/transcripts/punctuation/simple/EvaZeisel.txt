 <unk> from was to still <unk> and i am illustrating still. <unk> still doing this or that i don 't answer because i 'm not doing things still i 'm doing it like i always did . i still have. or did i use the word. <unk> which is. called. to do i have my plans <unk> i have my clients i am doing my work like i always did. so this takes care. <unk> i want to show you my work so you know what i am doing and why i am here <unk> this was <unk>. all of these things were made during the last. <unk> doing more or less what you see here this is castleton china this was an exhibition. at the museum of modern art . this is now for sale at the metropolitan museum this is still at the metropolitan museum now for sale. <unk> this is a portrait of my daughter and myself these. were just some of the things. i call myself a maker of things i don 't call myself an industrial designer. because i 'm other things industrial designers. want to make novel things <unk> novelty is a concept. <unk> industrial design magazine i believe is called . innovation innovation is not part of the aim of my work . well <unk> . <unk> make things more beautiful more elegant more comfortable. than just the craftsmen do i have so much to say i have to think what i am going to say <unk> . well to describe our profession otherwise we are actually. concerned with the playful search for beauty that means the playful search for. <unk> beauty was called the first activity of man sarah. smith <unk> who was a mathematics professor at mit wrote the playful search for beauty. was man 's first. activity. that all useful qualities and all material. <unk> qualities were developed from the. playful search. for beauty these are tiles the word playful is a necessary aspect of our work. because actually one of our problems is that. <unk> lovely things. throughout all of life <unk> . and this for me is now seventy five years <unk> so how can you without drying up . make things with the same pleasure as a gift to others. <unk> for so long the playful is therefore an important part of our. quality as designer . let me tell you some. about my life as i said <unk> i started to do these things. <unk> exhibition in the united states was at the sesquicentennial exhibition in. <unk> took me. through many countries and showed me a great part of the world <unk> . this is not that they took me the work didn 't take me. i. made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world. <unk> i was incredibly curious to see the world <unk> and i made all these things <unk> . which then finally did take me to see many countries. and many cultures <unk> i started. as an apprentice. <unk> and this taught me what the. guild system was. in middle ages the guild system that means when i was an apprentice i had to. apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master. <unk> there was a. traditional. hierarchy of master journeyman and learned worker. <unk> as an apprentice was very primitive that means i had to actually learn. every aspect of making. pottery pottery by hand we mashed the clay with our feet. when it came from the. <unk> hillside <unk> after that it had to be kneaded it had to then go in kind of a mangle <unk> and then finally. it was prepared for the. for the. throwing <unk> and there i really worked as an apprentice . <unk> the time and finally i had received a document that i had. accomplished my apprenticeship successfully that i had behaved morally. <unk> i also got at the time a workbook which explained my. <unk> and i still have that workbook first i set up a shop in my own garden <unk> and made pottery which i sold. on the marketplace in budapest <unk> and there i was sitting <unk> and. my <unk>. i didn 't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today but my boyfriend and. <unk> i sat at the market and sold the pots my mother thought that this was not very proper <unk> so she sat with us. to. add propriety to this activity . however after a while there was a new factory being built in budapest a pottery. <unk> factory a large one <unk> and i visited it with several ladies and asked all sorts of questions of the director then. the director asked me why do you ask all these questions i said i also have a pottery . so he asked me <unk> could he please visit me and then. finally he did and explained to me that what i did. <unk> now in my shop was an anachronism that the industrial revolution had broken out and that i rather should join. the factory there he made an art department for me. where i worked for several months <unk> however <unk> everybody in the factory spent his time. <unk> at the art department the director there said there were several women. casting and producing my designs now in molds <unk> and this was sold also to. everybody concerned himself much more with the art department that means with my work than making toilets <unk> so finally <unk>. they got a letter from the center from the bank who owned the factory saying make. <unk> and that was my end <unk> so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman and journeymen also take their satchel. and go. to see the world <unk> so as a journeyman i put an ad into the paper. that i had studied that i was a down to earth potter 's journeyman and i was looking for a job as. <unk> got several answers and. i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically i thought halfway to america <unk> . and that was in hamburg . then i first took this job in hamburg <unk> at an. art pottery where everything was done. <unk> and so i worked in a shop. where there were several. potters <unk> and the first day i was coming to take. my place at the. turntable there were three or four turntables and one of. <unk> who smelled very bad so i doused him in. cologne every day <unk> which he thought was very nice <unk> and therefore. he brought bread and butter. every day which i had to eat out of courtesy the first day i came to work in this shop there was on my. <unk> my wheel a surprise for me my colleagues had thoughtfully put. on the. wheel where i was supposed to work a very nicely modeled. <unk> they were very i finally. was now accepted <unk> and worked there for some six months. this was my first job . <unk> go on like this you will be here till midnight. <unk> i have to tell you that within five minutes i will talk very fast and. actually my work took me to many countries because i. used my work to fill my curiosity <unk> and. <unk> i was finally there although i had nothing to do i was a foreign expert <unk> i became art director of the china and glass industry <unk> . and eventually. <unk> purges at the beginning of stalin 's purges i didn 't know that. hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested so i was arrested. quite early in stalin 's purges <unk> and spent sixteen months. in. a russian prison. that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin 's life <unk> this was a very dangerous. accusation <unk> and if. this is the end of my five minutes i want to tell you that i actually. <unk> i survived and i 'm here <unk> and since this is the end of the five minutes i will moderator tell me when your last trip to russia was. invited me they found out that i had worked in ' thirty three at this factory <unk> and they came to my. studio in rockland county and brought the fifteen of their. artists to visit me here <unk> and they invited myself to come to the russian factory last summer. <unk> july to make some dishes <unk> . design some dishes <unk> and since i don 't like to travel alone <unk> they also invited. my. daughter son in law and granddaughter <unk> so we had a lovely trip to see. russia today which is not a very pleasant and happy view. <unk> i am now <unk> if this is the end.
