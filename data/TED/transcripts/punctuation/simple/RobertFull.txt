 <unk> do is to create a biologically inspired design <unk> and so here 's the challenge i want you to help me create a fully 3d dynamic parameterized contact model. <unk> translation of that is could you help me build a foot <unk> and it is a true challenge and i do want you to help me of course in the challenge there is a prize it. 's not quite the ted prize <unk> but it is an exclusive t shirt from our lab <unk> so please send me your ideas. about how to design a foot <unk> now if we want to design a foot <unk> what do we have to do. we have to first know what a foot is if we go to the dictionary it says . it 's the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking that 's the traditional definition but if you wanted to really do research what do you have to do you have to go to the literature and look up what 's known about feet <unk> . so you go to the literature laughter. maybe you 're familiar with this literature. the problem. <unk> there are many many feet how do you do this you need to survey all feet. and extract the principles of how they work and i want you to help me do that in this next clip as you see this clip look for principles and also think about experiments. that you might design in order to understand. how a foot works. <unk> all. <unk> animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot <unk> . it 's a design inspired by nature but it 's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at <unk> but it 's a synthesis of the secrets of. many many feet now it. turns out that animals can go anywhere they can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw in the probability of contact <unk> . the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present . if you want to study how a foot works we 're going to have to simulate those surfaces <unk> or simulate that. <unk> when we did that here 's a new experiment that we did <unk> . we put an animal and had it run this grass spider on a surface with ninety nine percent of the contact area removed <unk> but it didn 't even slow down the animal it 's still running at the human equivalent of three hundred miles per hour now. how could it do that well look more carefully when we slow it down fifty times we see. how the leg is hitting that simulated debris the leg is acting. <unk> and in fact <unk> the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot the foot is distributed. along the whole leg <unk> you can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach. with a foot <unk> and you can remove its foot <unk> i 'm passing some cockroaches around take a look at their feet <unk> without a foot here 's what it does it doesn 't even slow. <unk> can run the same speed without even that segment no problem for the cockroach they can grow them back if you care . how do they do it look carefully this is slowed down one hundred times . and watch what it 's doing with the rest of its leg it 's acting again as a distributed foot. very effective now the question we had is how general is a distributed foot and the. <unk> next behavior i 'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it <unk> . journalists this is off the record <unk> it 's embargoed <unk> take a look at what that is . that 's a bipedal octopus. that 's disguised as a rolling coconut. <unk> it was discovered by christina huffard and filmed by sea studios right here from monterey. we 've also described. another species. of bipedal octopus this one disguises itself as floating algae <unk> it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air. so that it can 't be seen and look. what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain. <unk> it uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there. truly extraordinary in one. thousand nine hundred and fifty one escher made this drawing he thought he created an animal fantasy <unk> . but we know that art imitates life and it turns out nature <unk> three million years ago evolved the next animal. <unk> stomatopod and here 's how it moves on the beaches of panama <unk> . it actually rolls and it can even roll uphill it 's the ultimate distributed foot its whole body in this case is acting. like its foot <unk> . so if we want to then to. <unk> the first important feature we want to add distributed foot contact not just with the traditional foot <unk> but also the leg and even of the body . can this help us inspire the design of novel robots <unk> we biologically inspired this robot named rhex built by these extraordinary. engineers over the last few years rhex 's foot started off to be quite simple then it got tuned over time and ultimately resulted in this half circle . why is that the video will show you. watch where the robot now contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain <unk> . what you 'll see in fact is that it 's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot <unk> . watch it go over this you can see it here well on this debris . extraordinary no sensing. <unk> the control is built right into the tuned legs . really simple but beautiful now you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain <unk> and my assistant 's going to help me here . when you touched the cockroach leg can. you get the microphone for him when. you touched the cockroach leg what did it. feel like did you notice something boy spiny robert full it 's spiny right it 's. <unk> sort of hurts maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he 'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach chris anderson did you touch it. rf so if you look carefully at this what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago no one knew. what they did they assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures we found that they 're for something else. here 's a segment of that spine they 're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris <unk> but they 're stiff in the other direction so. <unk> they capture. disparities in the surface <unk> now crabs don 't miss footholds because they normally move on sand until they come to our lab <unk> . and where they have a problem with this kind of mesh <unk> because they don 't have spines <unk> . the crabs are missing spines so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain <unk> but of course we can deal with that. because we can produce artificial spines. <unk> we can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out we did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs as you see here <unk>. <unk> and then we tested them do we really understand that principle of tuning <unk> the answer is yes <unk> this is slowed down 20 fold and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris. <unk> so to our blueprint we need to add tuned spines <unk> . now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots well here 's rhex rhex has trouble on rails on smooth rails as you see here <unk> so why not add a spine . my colleagues did this at u penn dan koditschek put some steel nails very simple. <unk> and here 's rhex now going over those steel those rails <unk> . no problem how does it do it let 's slow it down and you can see the spines in action watch the leg come around <unk> and you 'll see it grab on right there it. couldn 't do that before it would just slip and get stuck and tip over and watch again right there. successful <unk> now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn 't mean you can climb vertical. <unk> this is really really difficult but look at this animal do it one of the ones i 'm passing around. is climbing up this vertical surface that 's a smooth metal plate it. 's extraordinary how fast it can do it but if you slow it down you see something that 's quite extraordinary <unk> it 's a secret <unk> . the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look and doing actually terribly with respect to grabbing on the surface it looks in fact like it 's swimming up the surface . we can actually model that behavior. better as a fluid if you look at it the distributed foot <unk> actually is working more like a paddle . the same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand . watch its feet <unk> it 's actually functioning as a paddle even though it 's interacting with a. surface that we normally think of as a solid. <unk> this is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself . can you use this to make a better robot <unk> martin buehler did who 's now at boston dynamics. he took this idea and made rhex to be aqua rhex so here 's rhex with paddles <unk> . now converted into an incredibly maneuverable. swimming robot. for rough surfaces though animals add claws and you probably feel them if you grabbed it did you touch it ca i did rf . and they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws <unk> mark cutkosky at stanford university one of my collaborators is an extraordinary engineer. who developed this technique called shape deposition manufacturing where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot <unk> and here 's the simple version of a foot for a new robot. <unk> that i 'll show you in a bit <unk> so to our blueprint <unk> let 's attach claws <unk> . now if we look at animals though to be really maneuverable in all surfaces the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws and spines and hairs and pads and glue and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things . these are all from different insects there 's an ant crawling up a vertical surface let 's look at that ant . <unk> this is the foot of an ant you see the hairs and the claws and this thing here <unk> this is when its foot 's in the air . watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich . you see what happens that pad comes out <unk> and that 's where the glue is . here from underneath is an ant foot <unk> and when the claws don 't dig in that pad automatically comes. comes out without the ant doing anything it just extrudes and this was a hard shot to get i think this is <unk>. this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings so it 's pretty pretty tough to to do . this is what it looks like close up here 's the ant foot and there 's the glue and we discovered this glue may be an interesting two phase mixture it. certainly helps it to hold on . so. to our blueprint we stick on some sticky pads now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here <unk> now we have something better. the gecko 's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature . these are its feet they 're almost look alien and the secret <unk> which they stick on with involves their hairy toes . they can run up a surface at a meter per second take thirty steps in that one second you can hardly see them if we slow it. <unk> they attach their feet at eight milliseconds <unk> and detach them in sixteen milliseconds <unk> . and when you watch how they detach it it is bizarre . they peel away from the surface like you 'd peel away a piece of tape . very strange. how do they stick if you look at their feet they have leaf like structures called linalae with millions of hairs and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible . it has a hundred to a thousand split. <unk> ends and that 's the secret <unk> because it allows intimate contact the gecko has a billion of these <unk>. <unk> split ends <unk> and they don 't stick by glue or they don 't work like velcro or they don 't work with suction <unk> we discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone <unk> . so to our blueprint <unk> we split some hairs <unk> . <unk> this has inspired the design of the first self cleaning dry adhesive the patent issued we 're happy to say and here 's the. simplest version in nature <unk> and here 's my collaborator ron fearing 's attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane <unk> . and here 's the first attempt to. have it work on some load there 's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields you could think of a thousand possible uses. <unk> lots of people have and we 're excited about realizing this as a product we have imagined products for example this one we imagined a. <unk> where we took the glue off the band aid we took some hairs from a molting gecko put three rolls of them on here <unk> and then made this band aid . this is an undergraduate volunteer we have thirty thousand undergraduates so we can choose among them. <unk> that 's actually just a red red pen mark but it makes an incredible. it 's aerated it can be peeled off easily it doesn. 't cause any irritation it works underwater. <unk> i think this is an extraordinary example of how <unk> curiosity based research we just wondered how they climbed up something can lead to things that you could never imagine it 's just an example of why we need to support. <unk> now what a foot is . the question is can we use these secrets then to inspire the design of a better foot better than one that we see in nature <unk> here 's the new project we. 're trying to create the first climbing <unk> search and rescue robot no suction or magnets that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces <unk> i call the new robot rise for. <unk> robot in scansorial environment that 's a climbing environment. and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot <unk> and here is rise. it 's six legged and has a tail here it is on a fence and a tree <unk> and here are rise 's first steps on. <unk> so this is very new but we think we got the dynamics right. of the robot <unk> mark cutkosky though is taking it a step further <unk> he 's the one able to build this shape deposition manufactured. feet and toes the next step is to make compliant toes and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives <unk> so the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right . attempt to make that climb and ultimately put. <unk> on the robot and that 's exactly what he 's done he 's built in fact a climbing foot bot. inspired by nature <unk> and here 's cutkosky 's and his amazing students ' design. <unk> so these are tuned toes there are six of them. <unk> and they use the principles that i just talked about collectively for the blueprint. <unk> so this is not using any suction any glue and it will ultimately when it 's attached to the robot it 's as biologically inspired as the as the animal hopefully be able to climb. any kind of a surface here you see it next going up the side of a building at stanford. <unk> it 's a foot climbing it 's not the whole robot yet we 're working on it now you can see how it 's attaching these tuned structures. allow the spines friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging difficult. surfaces <unk> and so they were able to get this thing this is now sped up twenty times can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor . ok you can visualize this now it 's not impossible it 's a very. <unk> but more to come later to finish <unk> . we 've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built <unk> . we 've learned we should distribute control to smart parts don 't put it all in the brain <unk> but put some of the control in tuned feet <unk> legs and even body . that nature uses hybrid solutions not a single solution to these problems and they 're integrated and beautifully robust . and third <unk> we believe strongly that we do not. want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make potentially something. better than nature.
