 <unk> we humans have an. extraordinary potential for goodness <unk> but also an immense power to do harm <unk> any tool. can be used to build or to destroy. <unk> that all depends on our motivation <unk> therefore it is all the more important. to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one . so now we indeed are facing many challenges in our times those could be. <unk> our own mind. can be our best friend. or our worst enemy <unk> . there 's also societal challenges poverty in the midst of plenty <unk> inequalities conflict injustice <unk> . and then there are the new challenges which we don 't expect . ten thousand years ago there were about five million human beings on earth <unk> . whatever they could do the earth 's resilience would soon heal. <unk> human activities <unk> . after the industrial and technological revolutions that 's not the same anymore <unk> . we are now the major agent of impact on our earth we enter the anthropocene <unk> the era of human beings . so in a way <unk> if we were to say. <unk> if this man was saying and i heard. a former head of state <unk> i won 't mention who . saying five years ago <unk> we were at the edge of the precipice today we made a big step forward . so this edge. is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary. <unk> boundaries <unk> and within those boundaries they can carry a number of factors <unk> . we can still prosper <unk> humanity can still prosper for one hundred and fifty thousand years. if we keep the same stability of climate as in the holocene for the last ten thousand years <unk> but this depends. on choosing. a voluntary simplicity <unk> growing qualitatively not. <unk> quantitatively so in one thousand nine hundred as you can see we were well within the limits of safety <unk> . now <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and fifty came the great acceleration <unk> . now hold your breath not too long to imagine what comes next now. we have. <unk> vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries just to take biodiversity . at the current rate <unk> by two thousand and fifty thirty percent of all species on earth will have disappeared . even if we keep their dna in some fridge that 's not going to be reversible <unk> . so here i am sitting in front of a. <unk> glaciers are melting fast faster than the arctic <unk> . so what can we do in that situation <unk> well <unk> . however complex politically <unk> economically scientifically the question of the environment is it simply boils. <unk> i heard the billionaire steve forbes on fox news saying exactly the same thing but seriously. <unk> he was told about the rise of the ocean and he said i find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen in a hundred years . so if you don 't care for future generations just go for it <unk> . so one of the main challenges of our times is to reconcile three time scales <unk> . the short term of the economy <unk> the ups and downs of the stock. <unk> the midterm of the quality of life what is the quality every moment of our life over ten years and twenty years and. the long term of the environment when the environmentalists speak with economists it 's like a schizophrenic dialogue <unk> completely incoherent they don 't speak the same language . now for the last ten years i went. <unk> thinkers in the himalayas all over the place it seems to me <unk> there 's only one concept. that can reconcile those three time scales <unk> it is simply having more consideration for others <unk> . if you have more consideration for others <unk> you will have a caring economics where. finance is at the service of society and not society. <unk> at the service of finance <unk> . you will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with . if you have more consideration for others <unk> you will make sure that you remedy inequality <unk> that you bring some kind of well being within society in education at the workplace otherwise . a nation that is the most powerful and the richest but everyone is miserable. and if you have more consideration for others <unk> you are not going to ransack that planet that we have. and at the current rate we don 't have three planets to continue that way <unk> . so the question is <unk> . okay altruism <unk> is the answer it 's not just a novel ideal <unk> but can it be a real <unk> pragmatic solution <unk> . and first of all does it exist <unk> true altruism or are we. <unk> so selfish <unk> so some philosophers thought we were. irredeemably selfish but are we really all just like rascals <unk> that 's good news isn 't it . many philosophers like hobbes have said so but not everyone. <unk> man a wolf for man but this guy doesn 't seem too bad he. 's one of my friends in tibet he 's very kind <unk> . so now . we love cooperation there 's no better joy than working together is there . and then not only humans . then of course. <unk> there 's the struggle for life the survival of the fittest social darwinism. but in evolution . cooperation though competition exists of course cooperation has to be much more creative. to go to increased levels of complexity we are <unk>. <unk> super cooperators and we should even go further <unk> so now <unk> on top of. <unk> a survey among ten factors including income everything the first one that people said that 's the main thing for my happiness is. quality of social relationships. <unk> not only in humans <unk> and look at those great grandmothers so now <unk> . this idea that if we go deep within we are irredeemably selfish <unk> this is armchair. <unk> science <unk> there is not a single sociological study psychological study that 's ever shown that rather the opposite . my friend daniel batson spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations and of course we are sometimes selfish and some people more than others <unk> . <unk> there 's a significant number of people who do behave altruistically no matter what. if you see someone deeply wounded great suffering <unk> . you might just help out of empathic distress you can 't stand it so it 's better to help than to keep on looking at that person so we tested all that and in the end he said <unk> . clearly people can be altruistic so that 's. <unk> and even further we should look at the banality of goodness <unk> . now look at here when we come out we aren 't going to say that 's so nice there was no fistfight while this mob was thinking about altruism <unk>. <unk> that 's expected isn 't it if there was a fistfight we would speak of that for months <unk> so the banality of goodness is something that doesn 't attract your attention but it. <unk> some psychologists said <unk> . when i tell them i run one hundred and forty humanitarian projects in the himalayas that give me so much joy they said oh i see you work for the warm glow that is not altruistic you just feel good . you think this guy when he jumped in front of the train. <unk> feel so good when this is over . but that 's not the end of it <unk> they say well but when you interviewed him he said . i had no choice <unk> i had to jump of course he has no choice <unk> automatic behavior it 's neither selfish nor altruistic . no choice <unk> well of course this guy 's not going to think for half an hour should i give my. <unk> people who had choice like pastor andr trocm and his wife and the whole village of le chambon sur lignon in france for the whole second world war . they saved three thousand five hundred jews <unk> gave them shelter brought them to switzerland against all odds at the. <unk> of their family <unk> so altruism does exist so what is altruism it is the wish may others be happy and find the cause of happiness <unk> now <unk> empathy. is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you this person is joyful this person suffers <unk> but empathy alone. is not sufficient <unk> . if you keep on being confronted with suffering <unk> you might have empathic distress <unk> burnout so you need the greater sphere of. with tania singer at the max planck institute of leipzig we showed that the. brain networks for empathy and loving kindness are different now that 's all well done so we got that from. evolution from maternal care parental love <unk> but we need to extend that it can be extended even to other. <unk> if we want a more altruistic society we need two things individual change and societal change . so is individual change possible <unk> two thousand years of contemplative study said yes <unk> it is now fifteen years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics said yes our brains change when you train in altruism <unk> . so. i spent one hundred and twenty hours in an mri machine this is the first time i went after two and a half hours. and then the result has been published in many scientific papers it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love . just to give you an idea <unk> this is the meditator at rest on the left. <unk> in compassion meditation you see all the activity <unk> and then the control group at rest nothing happened in meditation nothing happened <unk> they have not been trained. <unk> trained <unk> . so do you need fifty thousand hours of meditation no you don 't <unk> . four weeks twenty minutes a day of caring mindfulness meditation already brings. a structural change in the brain compared to a control group that 's only twenty minutes a day for four weeks . even with preschoolers richard davidson did that in madison. <unk> gratitude loving kindness cooperation . mindful breathing you would say oh they 're just preschoolers look after eight weeks the pro social behavior that 's the blue line <unk> . and then comes the ultimate. scientific test the stickers test <unk> before you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class. <unk> their least favorite child <unk> an unknown child <unk> and the sick child and they have to give stickers away <unk> . so before the intervention they give most of it to their best friend . four five years old twenty minutes three times a week after the intervention <unk> no more discrimination . the same amount of stickers to their best friend and the least favorite child <unk>. <unk> that 's something we should do in all the schools in the world <unk>. <unk> so now where do we go from there individual change is possible <unk> . now do we have to wait for an altruistic gene to be in the human race that will take fifty thousand years too much for the environment . fortunately. as. specialists have shown . change faster than genes that 's the good news look attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years <unk> . so now individual change and cultural change mutually fashion each other and yes we can achieve a more altruistic society so where do we go from there . <unk> go back to the east now we treat one hundred thousand patients a year in our projects we have twenty five thousand kids in school <unk> four percent overhead some people say well your stuff works in practice but does it work in theory . there 's always positive deviance . so i will also go back to my hermitage to find the inner resources to better serve others <unk> . but on the more global level <unk> what can we do we need three things <unk> enhancing cooperation. <unk> cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning . unconditional cooperation within corporations there can be some competition between corporations but not within <unk> . we need sustainable harmony i love this term . not sustainable growth anymore sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality in the future we do more with. <unk> less <unk> and we continue to grow qualitatively not quantitatively <unk> . we need caring economics <unk> the homo <unk> economicus cannot deal with. poverty in the midst of plenty <unk> cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere of the oceans . we need a caring economics if you say economics should be compassionate. <unk> bad <unk> we need local commitment global responsibility <unk> we need to extend altruism to the other one point six.
