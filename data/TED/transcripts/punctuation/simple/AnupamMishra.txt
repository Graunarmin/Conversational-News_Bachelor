 <unk> should not move quickly to the desert <unk> so <unk> first a small housekeeping announcement <unk> please switch off. <unk> welcome to the golden desert <unk> indian desert <unk> it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest rainfall <unk> . if you are. <unk> feet deep one. hundred meters <unk> and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking . so you can 't install hand pumps or dig wells <unk> . though there is no electricity in most of the villages <unk> but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps. they are of no use. <unk> welcome to the golden desert clouds seldom visit this area <unk> but we find. forty different names of clouds in this dialect. used here there are a number of techniques to. harvest rain this is a new work <unk> it 's a new program <unk> but for the desert society this is no. <unk> this is their life and they. harvest rain in many ways <unk> so this is the first device they use in harvesting rain <unk> it 's called kunds somewhere it is called [ unclear ] and you can notice. they have created a kind of false catchment the desert is there sand dunes some small field <unk> and this is all big. raised platform you can. <unk> notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment <unk> and there is a slope sometimes our. engineers and architects. do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly <unk> . and the water will go where it should go and then it is forty feet. <unk> waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city. contractors <unk> because not a single drop should go waste in this they collect one. hundred thousand liters in one season <unk> and this is pure drinking water <unk> below the surface. <unk> but now you can have this for year round it 's. two houses . we often use a term called bylaws <unk> . because we are used to get written things <unk> but here it is unwritten by law <unk> and people made their house <unk> . and the water storage. tanks. <unk> these raised up platforms just like this. stage . in fact they go fifteen feet deep <unk> and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe <unk> and from their courtyard <unk> it can also harvest something like twenty five thousand in a. good monsoon <unk> another big one this is of course out of the. hardcore desert area <unk> this is near jaipur this is. <unk> called the jaigarh fort <unk> . and it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season <unk> the age is four hundred years <unk> . so <unk> since four hundred years it has been giving you. almost six million gallons of water per season you can calculate the price of that water <unk> it draws water from. <unk> fifteen kilometers of. canals <unk> you can see a modern road <unk> hardly fifty years old . it can break sometimes <unk> but this four hundred year old canal which draws water <unk> it is maintained for so many generations . of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked but they can be opened for ted people. <unk> we request them <unk> you can see. person coming up with two canisters of water and the water level these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this . it can envy many municipalities. the color <unk> the taste the purity of this water and this is what they call zero b type of water. <unk> because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water . we stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems <unk> the government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring. dollar project to bring water from the himalayas that 's why i said that this is a commercial break. <unk> but we will come back once again to the traditional thing <unk> . so water from three hundred four hundred kilometers away . soon it become like this in many portions water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything of course there are some areas where water is. <unk> i 'm not saying that it is not reaching at all but the tail end the jaisalmer. area <unk> you will notice in bikaner things like this where the water hyacinth couldn 't grow <unk> the. sand is flowing in these canals <unk> the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. <unk> canal came . they said that throw away your traditional systems <unk> these new cement tanks will supply you piped water <unk> it 's a dream <unk> . and it became a dream also because. soon the water was not able to reach these areas <unk> and people started renovating their own structures. these are all traditional water structures which we won 't be able to explain in such a short time <unk> but you can see that no woman is standing on those. i 'm not sure by that time bombay was there or delhi was there or chennai was there or bangalore was there <unk> so <unk> this was the terminal point for silk route . well connected eight hundred years ago. <unk> through. europe <unk> none of us were able to go to europe but jaisalmer. was well connected to it and this is the. <unk> sixteen centimeter area <unk> such a limited rainfall <unk> and highest. colorful life flourished in these areas you won 't find water in this slide but it is invisible <unk> . somewhere. a stream or a rivulet is running through here or if you want to paint. <unk> can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and. deposit. in the rooms <unk> but apart from this system they designed. beautiful water bodies around this town and what we call private. <unk> public partnership you can add estate also so estate public and. private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful. water body <unk> and. it 's a kind of water body for all seasons <unk> you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout. <unk> the year whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout another water body <unk> . dried up of course during the summer period <unk> but you can see how. the traditional society combines. engineering with aesthetics with the heart these statues <unk> marvelous statues gives you an idea of water table . when this. rain comes and the water starts. <unk> filling this tank it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in english today mass communication this was for mass communication <unk> everybody <unk>. <unk> in the town will know that this elephant has drowned <unk> so water will be there for seven months or nine months or twelve months <unk> and then they will come and worship. <unk> another small water body called the [ unclear ] it is difficult to translate in english especially in my english but the nearest would be glory a reputation <unk>. the reputation in desert of this small water water body is that it never dries up . they. they knew the. future also it was designed some one hundred and fifty years ago <unk> but perhaps they knew that on sixth november two thousand and nine there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this. <unk> children are standing on a very difficult device to explain <unk> this is called kund we have in english . surface water and ground water <unk> but this is not ground water <unk> you can draw ground water from any well <unk> but this is no ordinary well <unk> it squeeze the moisture hidden in the. dubbed this water as the third one called [ unclear ] and. there is a gypsum belt running below it <unk> and it was deposited by the great mother earth some. three million years ago <unk> and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water <unk> this is the same dry water body now you don 't find any. <unk> are all submerged <unk> but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year this year they have received <unk>. <unk> only six centimeters <unk> six centimeter of rainfall <unk> and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your. <unk> please come to our area of six centimeters <unk> we can give you water . how they maintain them there are three things <unk> concept <unk> planning <unk> making the actual thing <unk> and also maintaining them <unk>. <unk> for maintain for centuries by generations <unk> without any department <unk> without any funding so the secret. <unk> not personal property . my property every time so these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area <unk> don 't spit don 't do anything <unk>. <unk> wrong so that the clean water can be collected another pillar stone pillar on your right side. <unk> if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice <unk> this was. done in 11th century <unk> and you have to go further down they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a. thousand words right now an another thousand words <unk> if the water table goes down <unk> you will find new stairs if it comes up some of them will be submerged. <unk> this beautiful system will give you some pleasure three sides such steps on the fourth side there is. the best civil engineers we had <unk> . the best planners <unk> the best architects . we can say that because of them <unk> because of their forefathers india could get the first engineering college in <unk>. there were no english medium schools at that time. <unk> but such people compelled to the east india company <unk> which came here for business a very dirty kind of business . but not to create the engineering colleges <unk> but because of them <unk> first engineering college was created in a small village . not in the town . the last point we all know in our. primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. <unk> so <unk> you can find through your jeep a camel and a cart <unk> . this tire comes from the airplane <unk> . so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something. through a tire from. <unk> they were using it on their body <unk> tattoo was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or. con thing but now it is in thing . applause you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this. of life is water <unk> these are the beautiful waves <unk> these are the beautiful stairs which we just. saw in one of the slides <unk> these are the trees <unk> and these are the flowers. which add fragrance. <unk> do you believe that they. can be used elsewhere that the world can learn from this or is this just right for this place <unk>. <unk> the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area <unk> so the ponds <unk> the open bodies are everywhere . right from sri lanka to. kashmir <unk> and in other parts also <unk> and these [ unclear ] which stored water <unk> there are two. <unk> which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million. years ago if it is there it can be done right now <unk> otherwise it can 't be done.
