 <unk> i 'd like to ask you what do these three people have in common well. you probably recognize the first person i 'm sure you 're all avid american idol watchers . but you might not recognize aydah al jahani <unk> who is a contestant indeed a finalist. <unk> in the poet of the millions competition which is broadcast out of abu dhabi and seen throughout the arab world in this contest. people have to write and recite original poetry <unk> in the nabati form of poetry which is the traditional bedouin form. <unk> and lima sahar was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition. <unk> now <unk> before i go any further yes i know it all began with britain 's got talent . but my point in discussing this is to show you i hope i 'll be able to show you how these <unk> merit based competitions . with equal access to everyone with the winner selected. <unk> are changing tribal societies and i 'm going to focus on afghanistan. and the arab world with the uae how they 're changing tribal societies not by introducing western ideas . but by being integrated into the language in those places it all begins with enjoyment. <unk> these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society in afghanistan people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program and you <unk>. <unk> don 't necessarily have to have your own tv set people watch it all over the country also in public. <unk> places <unk> . but it goes beyond watching <unk> . because also part of this is campaigning people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway <unk> who fan out over the countryside . campaigning for their. <unk> contestants also put themselves forward now of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance but not entirely because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group . this has opened up the door particularly for women and in the last season there were two women in the finalists one of them lima sahar is a pashtun from kandahar a very conservative. <unk> and here she relates in the documentary film afghan star how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy <unk> but <unk>. <unk> she also confides that she knows that members of the taliban are actually <unk> sms ing. <unk> her husband backed her from the start but her tribe and family urged her not to compete. and were very much against it but once she started to win then they got behind her again it turns out that. competition and winning is a universal human value . and she 's out there her poetry is about women and the life of. <unk> women in society so just by presenting herself and being in competition with men this shows the voting on the program it sets a very important <unk>. <unk> example for young women these are young women in the audience of the program in abu dhabi but also people in the viewing audience . would introduce a measure of americanization . but actually just the opposite is happening by using this engaging popular format for traditional local culture it actually <unk>. in the gulf is precipitating a revival of interest in nabati poetry also in traditional dress and dance and music <unk> and for afghanistan <unk>. where the taliban banned music for many years it is reintroducing their traditional music they don 't sing. <unk> pop songs they sing afghan music and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner. <unk> she 's out there.
