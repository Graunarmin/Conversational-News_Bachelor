 <unk> i was asked by wilsonart international a plastic laminate company which is the largest plastic. laminate company in the world they asked me to. design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international. <unk> contemporary furniture fair in new york in two thousand . so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically. transportation design <unk> interiors and furniture . we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it and trying to portray laminate. <unk> and a trailer in kind of a fresh new contemporary look when this trailer. showed up at my shop in berkeley i 'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it. in its most idealistic fashion i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong. <unk> somewhere along the history of airstream <unk> what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell. and the interior architecture of the pieces in that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight . modern <unk> futuristic high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway <unk> and the interiors were completely out of sync. <unk> with that in fact it appeared like they. referenced a mountain cabin that seemed really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape <unk>. <unk> and about travel and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what 's authentic in. <unk> an airstream trailer and what feels like it has true purpose and utility <unk> we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic <unk>. <unk> aluminum shell we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing i literally drew on the walls of the trailer mocked it up in cardboard we 'd come in and cut. <unk> decide things were wrong pull it out put it back in the main goal was to smooth out the interior <unk> and begin to speak about motion <unk>. and mobility <unk> and independence the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you 're designing there 's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form. <unk> of the trailer there 's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change. materials and shapes so that became a challenge <unk> compounding that the material of choice laminate that i was trying to highlight only bends in two dimensions <unk>. it 's a compound curve interior what i had to devise was a way. <unk> into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float. over the aluminum shell . and what i was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the casework wouldn. 't break up the space. <unk> they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function as an electrical chase <unk> that 's the trailer pretty much finished . that trailer led to another commission to participate in whats called tokyo designers block its a week of furniture design events in tokyo in october <unk> teruo kurosaki <unk> who owns a furniture company called. to ship him two trailers to tokyo <unk> he said one. he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one trailer number two you have a blank slate you can to anything you want <unk> we came up with a fantasy scenario <unk>. <unk> of a dj traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tours this trailer. <unk> integrated sound system it 's got a huge couch fits quite a few people and basically we 'd had a great time with this and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about <unk>. travel <unk> and escape in an idiosyncratic sense <unk> a lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for airstream.
