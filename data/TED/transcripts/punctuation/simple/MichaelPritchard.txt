 <unk> like to talk about a couple of things today. the first thing is water <unk> . now i see you 've all been enjoying the water that 's been provided for you here at the conference over the past couple of days and i 'm sure you 'll feel that it 's from a safe source . but what if it wasn. <unk> what if it was from a source like this . then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea <unk> . i talked a lot in the past about statistics <unk> and the provision of safe drinking water for all . but they just don 't seem to get through <unk> and i think i 've worked out why. <unk> 's because using current thinking <unk> the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving <unk> . so we just switch off <unk> us <unk> governments. and aid agencies well today i 'd like to show you that through thinking differently. <unk> the problem has been solved . by the way <unk> since i 've been speaking another thirteen thousand people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea . and four children. have just died . i invented lifesaver bottle because i got angry . i like most of you was sitting down the day after christmas in two thousand and four when i was watching the devastating news of the asian tsunami. as it rolled in playing out on tv <unk> the days and weeks that followed people fleeing to the hills <unk> being forced to drink contaminated water. or face death . that really stuck with me <unk> then a few months later <unk> hurricane katrina slammed into. <unk> here 's a first world country let 's see what they can do day one nothing . day two nothing do you know it took five days to get water to the superdome . people were shooting each other on the streets. for tv sets and water . that 's when i decided i had to do something now i spent a lot of time in my garage over the next weeks and months. and also in my kitchen much to the dismay of my wife . laughter however after a few failed prototypes <unk> i finally came up with this <unk> the lifesaver bottle . okay now for the science bit <unk> before lifesaver the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about two hundred nanometers. <unk> the smallest bacteria is about two hundred nanometers <unk> so a 200 nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200 nanometer hole <unk> . the smallest virus on the other hand is about <unk>. <unk> nanometers <unk> so that 's definitely going to get through those two hundred nanometer holes lifesaver pores. are fifteen nanometers <unk> so nothing is getting through okay. i 'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration would you like to see that i spent all the time setting this up so i guess i should we 're in the fine city of oxford <unk> so. someone 's done that up fine city of oxford so what i 've done is i 've gone and got some water from the river cherwell <unk> and the river thames that flow through here and this is the water <unk> . but i got to thinking you know if we were in the middle of a flood zone. in bangladesh the water wouldn 't look like this. <unk> this <unk> so i 've gone and got some stuff to add into it and this is from my pond have a smell of that mister cameraman okay . right we 're just going to pour that in there audience ugh michael. pritchard okay <unk> we 've got some. <unk> runoff from a sewage plant farm <unk> so i 'm just going to put that in there put that in there there we go . and some other bits and pieces <unk> chuck that in there <unk> and. i 've got a gift here from a friend of mine 's rabbit <unk> so we 're just going to. put that in there as well. <unk> simply you just scoop the water up today i 'm going to. use a jug just to show you all let 's get a bit of that poo in there <unk> that 's not dirty enough let 's just stir that up a little bit. <unk> okay <unk> so i 'm going to take this. <unk> the top give it. a few pumps <unk> okay <unk> that 's all that 's necessary <unk> now as soon as i. pop the teat sterile drinking water is going to come out. there we go mind the electrics that is safe sterile drinking water. <unk> let 's see chris 's program throughout the rest of the show okay . okay <unk> . lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world . it 'll last for six thousand liters <unk> and when it 's expired using failsafe technology the system will shut off <unk> protecting the user. <unk> the cartridge out pop a new one in it 's good for another six thousand liters <unk> . so let 's look at the applications <unk> traditionally in a crisis what do we do we ship water <unk> . then after a few weeks we set up camps and people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water <unk> . what happens when twenty thousand people congregate in a camp. diseases spread more resources are required <unk> the problem just becomes. but by thinking differently <unk> and shipping these people can stay put . they can make their own sterile drinking water and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives. <unk> it doesn 't require a natural disaster. for this to work <unk> using. the old thinking of national infrastructure and pipe work is too expensive when you run the numbers on a calculator you run out of noughts <unk> . so here is the thinking different bit <unk> instead of shipping water <unk> and. <unk> processes to do it let 's use mother nature <unk> she 's got a fantastic system she picks the water up from there <unk> desalinates it for free <unk> . transports it over there and dumps it onto the mountains rivers and streams and where do people live <unk> near water . all we 've go to do is make it sterile . how do we do that well <unk> we could use the lifesaver bottle or we could use one of these <unk> the same technology in a jerry can this will. <unk> process twenty five thousand liters of water . that 's good enough for a family of four for three years <unk> . and how much does it cost . about half a cent a day to run thank you . so by thinking differently and processing water at the point of use. <unk> mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water <unk> they can get it from a source nearby <unk> . so with just eight billion dollars <unk> . we can hit the millennium goal 's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water. <unk> to put that into context the u k government spends about twelve billion pounds a year on foreign aid . but why stop there . with twenty billion dollars <unk> everyone can have access to safe drinking water <unk> . so the three and a half billion people that suffer every year as a result <unk> . and the two million kids that die every year . will live <unk> .
