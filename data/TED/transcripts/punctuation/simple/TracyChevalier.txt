 <unk> i 'm going to tell you about an affliction i suffer from and i have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well . when i 'm walking around an art gallery <unk> rooms and rooms full of paintings after about fifteen or twenty minutes . <unk> i 'm not thinking about the paintings i 'm not connecting to them <unk> instead i 'm thinking about that cup of coffee i desperately need to wake me up . i 'm suffering from gallery fatigue how many of you out there suffer from yes ha ha ha ha now . sometimes you might last longer than twenty minutes or. <unk> but i think we all suffer from it and do you have the. accompanying guilt for me i look at the paintings on the wall and i think somebody has decided to put them there thinks they 're good enough. to be on that wall but i don 't always see it in fact most of the time i don 't see it <unk> and. i leave feeling actually unhappy <unk> i feel guilty and and unhappy with myself rather than thinking there 's something wrong with the painting i think there 's something wrong with me <unk> and that 's not a good experience. <unk> leave a gallery like that . the thing is i think we should give ourselves a break if you think about going into a restaurant . when you look at the menu are you expected to order every single thing on the menu no you select <unk> . if you go into a department store to buy a shirt . are you going to. try on every single shirt and want every single shirt of course not you can be selective. it 's expected . how come then it 's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery <unk> why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting. well i 'm trying to take a different approach and there 's two things i do when i go into a gallery first of all i go quite fast and i. <unk> look at everything <unk> and i. pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other i don 't even know why they make me slow down but something pulls me like a magnet. and then i ignore all the others <unk> and i just go to that painting so it 's the first thing i do is i do my own curation i choose a painting <unk> it might just be one painting in fifty . and then the second thing i do is i stand in front of that painting <unk> and i tell myself a story about it <unk> why a story <unk> well i think that we are. <unk> wired <unk> our dna tells us to tell stories we tell stories all the time about everything and i think we do it. because the world is kind of a crazy <unk> chaotic place and sometimes stories we 're trying to make sense of the world a little bit trying to bring some order to it <unk> . why not apply that. to our looking at paintings <unk> so i now have this sort of restaurant. <unk> menu. visiting of art galleries . there are three paintings i 'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them . the first one needs little introduction girl with a pearl earring by johannes vermeer. <unk> dutch painter . this is the most glorious painting . i first saw it when i was nineteen and i immediately went out and got a poster of it and in fact i still have that poster thirty years later it 's hanging in my house <unk> . it 's accompanied me everywhere i 've gone i never tire of looking at her . what made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face <unk> . but i think what 's kept me still coming back year after year. is another thing and that is. the look on her face the conflicted look on her face <unk> i can 't tell if she 's happy or sad <unk> and i change my mind all the time . so that keeps me coming back . one day sixteen years after i had this poster on my wall <unk> i lay in bed and looked at her <unk> . and i suddenly thought <unk> i wonder what. <unk> did to her. to make her look like that . and it was the first time i 'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him <unk> . always before i 'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl . now i began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship <unk> . and i thought well what is that relationship <unk> so i went to find out i did some research and discovered. we have no idea who she is in fact we don 't know who any of the models in any of vermeer 's paintings are and we know very little about vermeer himself <unk> . which made me go yippee . i can do whatever i want i can come up with whatever story i want to . so here 's how i came up with the story . <unk> got to get her into the house <unk> how does vermeer know her well there 've been suggestions that she is his 12 year old daughter. <unk> the daughter at the time was twelve when he painted the painting <unk> . and i thought no it 's a very intimate look but it 's not a look a daughter gives her father for one thing in dutch painting of the time if a woman 's mouth was open it was indicating sexual availability <unk>. <unk> it would have been inappropriate for vermeer to paint his daughter like that so it 's not his daughter but it 's somebody. <unk> close to him physically close to him <unk> well who else would be in the house . a servant a lovely servant <unk> so she 's in the house how do we get her into the studio . we don 't know very much about vermeer but the little bits that we do know one thing we know is that he married a catholic woman they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he his studio <unk> . he also had eleven. <unk> children <unk> it would have been a chaotic noisy household and if you 've seen vermeer 's paintings before you know that they 're incredibly calm. and quiet how does a painter paint such calm quiet paintings with eleven kids around well he compartmentalizes his life he gets to his studio and he says nobody <unk>. <unk> comes in here not the wife not the kids <unk> okay the maid can come in and clean. she 's in the studio <unk> he 's got her in the studio <unk> they 're together and he decides to paint her . he has her wear very plain clothes now all of the women or most of the women in vermeer 's other paintings wore velvet <unk> silk . fur very sumptuous materials this is very plain the only thing that isn 't plain. is her pearl earring. if she 's a servant there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings <unk> so those are not her pearl earrings <unk> whose are they . we happen to know there 's a list of catharina the wife 's clothes amongst them a yellow. coat with white fur a yellow and black bodice <unk> and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings different women in the. <unk> paintings vermeer 's paintings <unk> . so clearly her clothes were lent to various different women it 's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife <unk> . so we 've got all the elements for our story <unk> she 's in the studio with him for a long time these paintings took a long time to make they would have. <unk> time alone all that time she 's wearing his wife 's pearl earring she 's gorgeous she obviously loves him she 's conflicted . and does the wife know maybe not and if she doesn 't . well. that 's the story . laughter the next painting i 'm going to talk about is called boy building a house of cards by chardin he 's an. <unk> french painter best known for his still lifes but he did occasionally paint people <unk> . and in fact he painted four versions of this painting <unk> different boys building houses of cards all concentrated <unk> . i like this version the best because some of the boys are older and some are younger and to me this one like goldilocks 's porridge is just right. <unk> he 's not quite a child. <unk> and he 's not quite a man <unk> he 's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience <unk> and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting <unk> . and i looked at his face <unk> it 's like a vermeer painting a bit the light comes in from the left his face is bathed in this glowing light it 's right in the center of the painting and you look at it <unk> and i found that when i was looking at it i was standing there going . <unk> please look at me and he didn 't look at me <unk> he was still looking at his cards and that 's one of the seductive elements of this painting is he 's so focused on what he 's doing that he doesn 't look at us <unk> . and that is to me <unk> the sign of a masterpiece of a painting when there 's a lack of resolution <unk> he 's never going to look at me <unk> so i was thinking of a story where if i 'm in this position who could. <unk> there looking at him not the painter i don 't want to think about the painter i 'm. <unk> looking for the answer looking for the story to fill in that gap and we may make a story <unk> . and it satisfies us momentarily <unk> but not not really and we come back again and again . the last painting i 'm going to talk about. is called anonymous by anonymous. <unk> this is a tudor portrait bought by the national portrait gallery <unk> they thought it was a man named sir thomas overbury <unk> . and then they discovered that it wasn 't him and they have no idea who it is . now in the national portrait gallery if you don 't know the biography of the painting <unk> it 's kind of useless to you they can 't hang it on the wall because they don 't know who he is so unfortunately <unk> this orphan <unk>. spends most of his time in storage along with quite a number of other orphans some of them some beautiful paintings . made me stop in my tracks. for three reasons one is the disconnection between his mouth that 's smiling and his eyes that are wistful <unk> . he 's not happy and why isn 't he happy . the second thing that really attracted me. were his bright red cheeks <unk> he is blushing he 's. blushing for his portrait being made this must be a guy who blushes all the time what is he thinking about that 's making him blush <unk> the third thing. that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet <unk> . silk gray those beautiful buttons <unk> and you know what it makes me think of is it 's sort of snug and puffy it 's like a duvet spread over a bed . i kept thinking of beds and red cheeks and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him <unk> . <unk> what he 's thinking about <unk> and i thought <unk> if i 'm going to make a story what 's the last thing i 'm going to put in there well what would a tudor gentleman be preoccupied with and i thought well henry viii okay . he 'd be preoccupied with his inheritance with his heir who is going to inherit. his name and his fortune you put all those. <unk> and you 've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back now here 's the story <unk> . it 's short . rosy . i am still wearing the white brocade doublet caroline gave me <unk> . it has a plain high collar detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread set close together so that the fit. <unk> is snug the doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed perhaps that was the intention . i first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor . i knew even before i stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed . i have always flushed easily from physical exertion from wine from high emotion as a boy. i was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys <unk> . but not by george only george could call me rosy <unk> . i would not allow anyone else he managed to make the word tender . when i made the announcement george did not turn rosy but went pale as my. <unk> he should not have been surprised <unk> it has been a common assumption that i would one day marry his cousin <unk> . but it is difficult to hear the words aloud i know i could barely utter them . afterwards <unk> i found george on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden . despite drinking steadily all afternoon <unk> he was still pale . we stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces . what do you think of my doublet. he glanced at me that collar looks to be strangling you . we will still see each other i insisted we can still hunt and play cards and attend court nothing need change . george did not speak . i am twenty three years old it is time for me to marry and produce an heir <unk> it is expected of me. <unk> another glass of claret and turned to me congratulations on your upcoming nuptials james <unk> i 'm sure you 'll be. content together he never used my nickname again <unk> . thank you.
