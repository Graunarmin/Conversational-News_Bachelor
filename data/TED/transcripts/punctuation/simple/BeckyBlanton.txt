 <unk> i 'm a writer and a journalist <unk> and i 'm also an insanely curious person <unk> so in twenty two years as a journalist i 've learned how to do a lot of new things . and three years ago . one of the things i learned how to do was to become invisible <unk> . i became one of the working homeless. i quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in february of that same year and decided to travel . his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that . i 've camped my whole life and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so i packed my cat my rottweiler. and my camping gear into a one thousand nine hundred and seventy five chevy van and drove off into the sunset having fully failed to realize. three critical things one that society equates living in a permanent structure even a shack with having value as a person . two i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality. <unk> let it three <unk> i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle . at first living in the van was great i showered in campgrounds i ate out regularly <unk> and i had time to relax and to grieve <unk> . but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in . my freelance job ended and i had to get a full time job to pay the bills. what had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer <unk> and it became impossible to park anywhere. <unk> that i had a cat and a dog with me and it was really hot . the cat came and went through an open window in the van the doggy went into doggy day care <unk> and i sweated. <unk> whenever i could <unk> i used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops or i washed up in. in public rest rooms . nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below eighty degrees fahrenheit making it difficult or impossible to sleep <unk> food rotted in the heat . ice in my ice chest melted within hours <unk> and. it was was pretty miserable. <unk> couldn 't afford to find an apartment or couldn 't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat and i refused to give them up . so i stayed in the van . and when the heat made me too sick to walk the fifty feet to the public restroom outside my. <unk> van at night i used a bucket. and a trash bag as a toilet . when winter weather set in the temperatures dropped below freezing and they stayed there <unk> . and i faced a whole new set of challenges <unk> . i parked. a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police i didn 't always succeed . but. i felt out of control of my life <unk> and i don 't know. when or how it happened but the speed. at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist. to being a homeless woman living in a van took my breath away . i hadn 't changed my i q hadn 't dropped my talent . <unk> everything about me. remained the same but i had changed somehow <unk> . i spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic <unk> . and i went i hadn 't bathed in three days i was as smelly. and as depressed as anyone in line <unk> i just wasn 't drunk or high <unk> and when several of the homeless men realized that. <unk> including a former university professor they said you aren 't homeless <unk> why are you really here other homeless people didn 't see me as homeless but i did . then the professor listened to my story and he said . you have a job you have hope the real homeless don 't have hope a. reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal <unk> and i remember thinking if i killed myself. no one would notice. a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national t v . an essay i 'd written about my father the year before he died. <unk> in tim 's new book <unk> and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing <unk> . and when i realized that tim russert <unk> former moderator of meet the press was talking about my writing while i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot . i started laughing you should too . i started laughing. because it got to. <unk> the point where was i a writer. or was i a homeless woman <unk> so i went in the bookstore <unk> and i found tim 's book <unk> . and i stood there <unk> and i reread my essay <unk> and i cried because i. was a writer <unk> i was a writer <unk> . shortly after that i moved back to tennessee <unk> i alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends <unk> and i started writing again . by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist <unk> i was winning awards. <unk> awards <unk> i was living in my own apartment i was no longer homeless <unk> and i was no longer invisible. <unk> i was living in a van in a.
