 <unk> it 's pretty simple there are nine sort of rules that i discovered after thirty five years of rock climbing . most of them are pretty basic <unk> number one don 't let go. very sure success method <unk> but really truly often you think. <unk> about letting go way before your body does <unk> so hang in there <unk> and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions <unk> . number two <unk> hesitation is bad this is a friction climb up in tuolumne meadows in the yosemite high country. friction climbing doesn 't have any sort of hard positive edges. <unk> climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock the most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your. foot on the rock <unk> and then from that point on you 're basically falling. falling so momentum is good <unk> don 't stop . rule number three have a plan this is a climb called the naked edge in el dorado canyon outside of boulder <unk> this climber is on the last pitch of it he 's actually right about where i fell. <unk> one thousand feet of air below him <unk> and all the hard pitches are actually below him. often what happens is you 're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part how do i get through the hardest part and then what happens you get to the last pitch it <unk>. <unk> 's easy <unk> and you 're completely flamed out <unk> don 't do it you have to plan. <unk> ahead to get to the top but you also can 't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete this is a climb called the dike route on pywjack. <unk> dome <unk> up in the yosemite high country the interesting thing about this climb is it 's not that hard but if you 're the leader on it at the hardest move you 're looking at about one hundred foot fall onto some low angle slabs <unk> so you 've got to. <unk> you don 't want to stop in the middle like coleridge 's kubla kahn you 've got to keep going <unk> . rule number five know how to rest . it 's amazing the best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest . regroup <unk> calm themselves focus <unk> and keep going this. <unk> is a climb in the needles again in california <unk> fear really sucks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing you 're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you 're doing. because any given move should require all your. concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively one of the things in climbing is . most people sort of take it straight on and they follow the most obvious solution this is. <unk> the devils tower in wyoming which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from close encounters with this typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing . the cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips. <unk> opposing pressure and forcing yourself up . rule number eight strength doesn 't always equal success in the thirty five years i 've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls and stuff like that the most important thing i 've learned was <unk>. guys will always try to do pull ups beginning guys it 's like they thrash they thrash they get fifteen feet up and they can do about fifteen pull ups. <unk> they just flame out <unk> women. are much more in balance because they don 't have that idea that they 're going to be able to do one hundred pull ups they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it <unk>. <unk> 's sort of natural they carry you all day long <unk> so balance is really critical and keeping your weight on your feet <unk> which is your strongest muscle.
