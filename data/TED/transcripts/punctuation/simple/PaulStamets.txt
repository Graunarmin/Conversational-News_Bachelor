 <unk> love a challenge and saving the earth is probably a good one . we all know the earth is in trouble <unk> we have now entered in the 6x the sixth major extinction on this planet <unk> . i often wondered if there was a united organization of organisms otherwise known as. <unk> every organism had had a right to vote would we be voted on the planet or off the planet <unk> i think that vote is occurring right now <unk> . i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions using fungi and these solutions are based. on mycelium. <unk> the mycelium infuses. <unk> all landscapes it holds soils together it 's extremely tenacious this holds up to thirty thousand times its mass they 're. the grand molecular disassemblers of nature the soil magicians <unk> they generate the humus soils across the landmasses of earth. we have now discovered that there is a <unk> multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants mitigated by the mcyelium so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks cedars and douglas firs . dusty and i we. <unk> like to say on sunday this is where we go to church i 'm in love with the old growth forest and i 'm a patriotic american because. we have those . most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms <unk> and frankly i face a big obstacle when i mention mushrooms to somebody they immediately think portobellos or magic mushrooms their eyes glaze over and they think i 'm a little crazy . so i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group. <unk> we call it mycophobia <unk> the irrational fear. of the unknown <unk> when it comes to fungi mushrooms are very fast in their growth day twenty one day twenty three day twenty five . mushrooms produce strong antibiotics in fact we 're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom a group of twenty eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta. <unk> that joins animalia and fungi together <unk> . we share in common the same pathogens fungi don 't like to rot from bacteria <unk> and so our best antibiotics come. come from fungi <unk> but here is a mushroom that 's past its prime after they sporulate they do rot but i propose to you that the sequence of microbes. that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest they give rise to the trees they create the debris fields that. <unk> feed the mycelium <unk> . and so we see a mushroom here sporulating <unk> . and the spores are germinating <unk> and the mycelium forms and goes underground . in a single cubic inch of soil there can be more than eight miles of these cells my foot is covering approximately three hundred miles of mycelium <unk> . this is. <unk> from nick read and patrick hickey and notice that as the mycelium grows it conquers territory and then it begins the net <unk> . i 've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years i have thousands of electron micrographs <unk> and when i 'm staring. at the mycelium i realize that they are microfiltration membranes <unk> we exhale carbon dioxide so does mycelium it inhales oxygen just like we do . but these are essentially externalized stomachs. and lungs <unk> and i. <unk> to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes <unk> and in these cavities these micro cavities form and as they fuse soils they absorb water these are little wells and inside these wells then microbial communities begin to form <unk> . and so the spongy soil not only resists erosion but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality. of other organisms. i first proposed in the early <unk> 1990s that mycelium is earth 's natural internet when you look at the mycelium. they 're highly branched and if there 's one branch that that is broken then very quickly because of the nodes of crossing internet engineers maybe call them hot points. <unk> alternative pathways for channeling nutrients. and information the mycelium is sentient <unk> . it knows that you are there when you walk across landscapes <unk> it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab. debris . so i believe the invention of the computer internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously. <unk> biologically successful model the earth invented the computer internet for its own benefit <unk> and we now being the top. organism on this planet are trying to allocate resources in order to to protect the biosphere . going way out <unk> dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype <unk> . i believe matter begets life life becomes single cells. <unk> single cells become strings strings become chains chains network and this is the paradigm that we see throughout. the universe . most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land they came to land one point three billion years ago . and plants followed several hundred million years later <unk> how is that possible it. 's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids and many other acids and enzymes <unk> pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other. <unk> minerals and forming calcium oxalates <unk> makes the rocks crumble <unk> and the first step in the generation of soil <unk> . oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together . so fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates and all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering. carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix. <unk> this was first discovered in one thousand eight hundred and fifty nine this is a photograph by franz hueber <unk> . this photograph 's taken <unk> 1950s in saudi arabia <unk> four hundred and twenty million years ago . this organism existed <unk> it was called prototaxites . prototaxites laying down was about three feet tall <unk> the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet. <unk> boyce at the university of chicago <unk> published an article in the journal of geology this past year. determining. that prototaxites was a giant fungus a giant mushroom . across the landscapes of earth were dotted these giant mushrooms . all across most land masses <unk> . and these existed for tens of millions of years. <unk> several extinction events <unk> and as we march forward sixty five million years ago most of you know about it. we had an asteroid impact the earth was struck by an asteroid a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere . sunlight was cut off and fungi inherited the earth . those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded <unk> because fungi do not need light. <unk> more recently at einstein university they just just determined. that fungi use radiation as a as a source of energy much like plants use light . so the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere i think is a forgone conclusion at least in my own mind <unk> . the largest organism in the world. is in eastern oregon. <unk> two hundred acres in size two. thousand two hundred acres in size two thousand years old the largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat one cell wall thick <unk> . how is it that this organism. can be so large and yet be one cell wall thick <unk> whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us . the mycelium in the right conditions produces a mushroom it bursts through with such ferocity. <unk> show you six if i can solutions for helping to save the world <unk> battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham washington there were four piles saturated. with diesel and other petroleum waste one was a control pile one pile was treated with enzymes one pile. was treated with bacteria <unk> and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium <unk> the mycelium absorbs the oil the mycelium is producing. <unk> enzymes peroxidases that break carbon hydrogen bonds these are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together so the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil <unk> . and then when we returned six weeks later <unk> . all the tarps were removed all the other piles were dead dark and stinky <unk> we came back to our pile it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms <unk> and the color changed to a light form <unk> . the enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons. into carbohydrates fungal sugars <unk> . some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms they 're very large they 're showing how much nutrition that they could 've obtained but something else happened which was an epiphany in my life <unk> . they sporulated the spores attract insects the insects laid eggs eggs. became larvae <unk> birds then came bringing in seeds and our pile became an oasis of life <unk> whereas the other three piles were dead. <unk> dark and stinky <unk> and the pah 's the aromatic hydrocarbons went from ten thousand parts per million to less than two hundred in eight weeks . the last image we don 't have the entire pile was a green berm of life these are gateway species vanguard species that open the door. for other biological communities . so i invented. burlap sacks bunker spawn. and putting the mycelium. using storm blown debris . you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that 's producing <unk> e coli or other wastes or a factory with chemical toxins and it leads to habitat restoration . so we set up a site in mason county washington <unk> and we 've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms <unk> and i 'll show you. <unk> a graph here <unk> this is a logarithmic scale ten to the eighth power there 's more than a one hundred million colonies per gram <unk> . and ten to the third power is around one thousand in forty eight hours to seventy two hours <unk>. these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria ten thousand times . think of the implications this is a space conservative method that uses storm debris and we can guarantee that we will have storms every. <unk> this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time <unk> this is my wife dusty with a mushroom called fomitopsis officinalis <unk> agarikon it. 's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that dioscorides first described in sixty five a d as a treatment against consumption . this mushroom grows in washington state oregon northern california british columbia now thought to be extinct in europe may not seem that large. <unk> is extremely rare fungus . our team and we have a team of experts that go out we went out twenty times in the old growth forest last year <unk> we found one sample to be able to get into culture <unk> . preserving the genome of these fungi in the <unk> old growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health i. 've been involved with the u s defense department bioshield program <unk> we submitted over three hundred samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites. <unk> and a few years ago <unk> we received these results <unk> we have. three different strains of agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses . dr earl kern who 's a smallpox expert of the u s defense department states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active ten or greater are considered to be very active. <unk> our mushroom strains. <unk> were in the highly active range there 's a vetted press release that you can read it 's vetted by dod if you. google stamets and smallpox or you can go to npr org and listen to a live interview <unk> . so <unk> encouraged by this naturally we went to flu viruses <unk> . and so for the first time i am showing this we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses here 's the selectivity index. <unk> numbers against pox you saw 10s and <unk> 20s now against flu viruses compared to the ribavirin controls . we have an extraordinarily high activity and we 're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical . we tried it against flu a viruses. as well as flu b viruses so then we tried. <unk> i then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense . i became interested in entomopathogenic fungi fungi that kill insects. our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants so i went to the epa homepage <unk> and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants as well as termites <unk> . i did something that nobody else had done <unk> i actually chased the mycelium <unk> when it stopped stopped producing spores these are spores this is in their spores <unk> i was able to morph the culture. <unk> industry has spent over one hundred million dollars specifically on on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house . but the insects aren 't stupid and they would avoid the spores when they came close <unk> and so i morphed the cultures into a non sporulating form <unk> . and i got my daughter 's barbie doll dish i put it right right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields every day <unk> in my house <unk> and the ants were. <unk> to the mycelium because there 's no spores <unk> they gave it to the queen one week later <unk> i had no sawdust piles whatsoever <unk> and then. a delicate dance between. dinner and death the mycelium is consumed by the ants <unk> they become mummified and boing a mushroom pops out of their head . now after sporulation the spores repel. <unk> of termites . and so my house came down <unk> i received my first patent against carpenter ants termites and fire ants . then we tried extracts and lo and behold we can steer insects to different directions this has huge implications <unk> . i then received my second patent and this is a big one it 's been called an alexander graham bell patent it covers over. <unk> hundred thousand species . this is the most disruptive technology i 've been told by executives of the pesticide industry that they have ever witnessed this could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world . <unk> you could fly one hundred ph d students under the umbrella of this concept because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi prior to sporulation attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores <unk> . <unk> i needed a delivery system <unk> the life box you 're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference. you add soil <unk> you add water <unk> . you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores like of the agarikon mushroom the seeds then are mothered. by this mycelium <unk> . and then you put tree seeds in here <unk> and then you end up growing potentially an old growth forest from a cardboard box i want to reinvent the delivery system <unk> and the use of. <unk> cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprints if there 's a youtube like. site that you could put up you could make it interactive zip code specific where people could join together <unk> and through satellite imaging systems through virtual earth or google earth you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through life boxes . you could take a cardboard box delivering shoes <unk> you could add water i developed this for. <unk> refugee community corns beans and squash and onions i took several containers my wife said if i could do this anybody could. and i ended up growing a seed garden then you harvest the seeds. and thank you eric rasmussen <unk> for your help on this. and then you 're harvesting the seed garden then you can harvest the kernels <unk> and then you just need a few kernels i add mycelium to it <unk> and then i inoculate the corncobs. <unk> now three corncobs <unk> no other grain lots of mushrooms begin to form <unk> too many withdrawals from the carbon bank <unk> . and so this population will be shut down but watch what happens here . the mushrooms then are harvested <unk> but. very importantly the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars <unk> and so i thought. how could we address the energy crisis in this country <unk> and we came up with econol.
