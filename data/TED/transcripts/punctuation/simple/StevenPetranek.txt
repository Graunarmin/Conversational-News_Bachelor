 <unk> the advances that have taken place in astronomy <unk> cosmology. and biology in the last ten years <unk> are really extraordinary. to the point where we know more about our universe. <unk> and how it works than. many of you might imagine <unk> but there was something else that i 've noticed. as those changes were taking place as people were starting to find out that hmm yeah there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy the. science writers and editors i shouldn 't say science writers i should say people who write about science. <unk> and editors would sit down over a couple of beers <unk> . after a hard day of work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works <unk> and. they would inevitably end up in what i thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly <unk> . <unk> at first it all seemed a little fantastical to me but. after challenging a lot of these ideas <unk> i began to take a lot of them seriously and then september eleven happened. <unk> and i thought ah god i can 't go to the ted conference and talk about how the world is going to end . nobody wants to hear that not after this <unk> and that got me into a discussion with some other people other scientists about. maybe some other subjects and one of the guys i talked to who was a neuroscientist said you know i think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up. <unk> michael 's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can 't have a solution if you don 't have a. problem so we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow <unk> and lo and behold <unk> we found them . which leads me to a. videotape of a president bush. press. <unk> to defend our security <unk> . and whatever it costs to defend our freedom <unk> . we must pay it sp i agree with the president he wants two trillion dollars to. protect us from terrorists next year a two trillion dollar federal budget which will land us back into deficit spending real fast. <unk> the only threat we face there are. really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we 're in the same kind of denial about that we were about. terrorism and what could 've happened on september eleven. <unk> i would propose therefore <unk> that if we took ten billion dollars from that two point one three. <unk> of that budget. and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems i 'm going to talk to you about the vast majority could be solved. <unk> and the rest we could deal with <unk> so <unk> i hope you find this. both fascinating. i 'm fascinated by this kind of stuff i gotta admit. to me these are richard 's cockroaches. <unk> but i also hope <unk> because i think the people in this room can literally change the world <unk> . i hope you take some of this stuff away with you and when you have an opportunity to be influential. <unk> that you try to get some heavy duty money spent on some of these ideas <unk> so let 's start. <unk> number ten we lose the will. we live in an incredible age of modern medicine we are all much healthier than we were twenty years ago <unk> . people around the world are getting better medicine. but mentally <unk> we 're falling apart the world health organization now estimates. that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed. <unk> and the world health organization also says that depression is the. biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced <unk> . soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to. allow us to think of one hundred as a normal lifespan. <unk> a female child born tomorrow on average median will live to age eighty three our life. longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes . now the problem with all of this getting older is that people over sixty five are the most likely people to commit suicide <unk> . so what are the solutions <unk> we don 't really have mental health insurance in this. <unk> often a combination of talk therapy and pills pills alone don 't do it <unk> especially in clinically depressed people . you ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist. or a psychologist and put down your <unk> 10 dollar copay <unk> and get treated just like you do when you got a cut on your arm it 's ridiculous <unk> secondly <unk> . drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs <unk> we know that most. mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with and we know just an amazing amount more about the. <unk> now than we did ten years ago <unk> we need a pump push from the federal government <unk> through nih and national science nsf. and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs <unk> moving on number nine. don 't laugh. <unk> aliens invade earth <unk> ten years ago you couldn 't have found an astronomer well very few astronomers. in the world who would 've told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we found three . the count now is up to eighty we 're finding about two or three a month . all of the ones we 've found by the way are in this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the milky way <unk> . there must be millions of planets in the milky way <unk> and as carl sagan insisted. <unk> for many years and was laughed at for it <unk> there must be billions and billions in the universe . in a few years nasa is going to launch four or five telescopes out to jupiter where there 's less dust and start looking for earth like planets . which we cannot see with present technology nor detect <unk> . it 's becoming obvious that the chance that. life does not exist elsewhere in. <unk> the universe and probably fairly close to us is a fairly remote idea <unk> . and the chance that some of it isn 't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea. <unk> remember we 've only been an advanced civilization an industrial civilization if you would for two hundred years although every time i go to pompeii i 'm amazed that. they had the. <unk> a mcdonald 's on every street corner too so i don 't know how much civilization really has progressed since ad seventy nine but. there 's a great likelihood i really believe this <unk> and i don 't believe in aliens <unk> and i don 't believe there are any aliens on the earth or anything like that but. there 's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own now what will happen <unk> . what if they come to you know <unk> suck up our oceans for the hydrogen and swat us away like flies. <unk> we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it we can look at our own history the late physicist gerard o 'neill said . advanced western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with . even in those cases where every attempt was made. to protect and guard the primitive civilization if the aliens come visiting. 're the primitive civilization <unk> so what are the solutions to this . thank god. you can all read it may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them how much energy and money. <unk> does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species <unk> . secondly <unk> and you 're going to hear more from me about this we have to become an <unk>. <unk> nation we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn 't last forever our sun doesn 't last forever <unk> if we want humanity to last forever <unk> . we have to colonize the milky way. and that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point it 'll. also help us a lot if we meet an advanced civilization along the way <unk> if we 're trying to be an advanced civilization. <unk> number eight the ecosystem collapses last july in science <unk> the journal science. <unk> nineteen oceanographers published a very very unusual article it wasn 't really a research report it was a screed <unk> they said <unk> we 've been looking at the oceans for a long time now <unk> and we want to tell you they 're not in trouble they 're near collapse . many other ecosystems. on earth are in real real. <unk> danger <unk> we 're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of ten thousand <unk> . we have lost twenty five percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last twenty years <unk> california is expected to lose twenty five percent of its species in the next forty years <unk> . somewhere in the amazon forest is the marginal tree <unk> you cut down that tree <unk> the rain forest collapses. <unk> as an ecosystem <unk> there 's really a tree like that out there that 's really what it comes to <unk> . and when that ecosystem collapses it could take a major ecosystem with it <unk> like our atmosphere <unk> . so what do we do about this what are the solutions <unk> . there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now <unk> the problem with. with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly that we don 't know they 're really in trouble until it 's almost too late. <unk> we need to know earlier. that they 're getting in trouble <unk> and we need to. be able to pump possible solutions into models <unk> and with the kind of computing power we have now there is as i say some of this going on but it needs money national science foundation needs to say. <unk> all the money that 's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government one way or another <unk> . and they get to prioritize <unk> you know there are people at the national science foundation who get to say this is the most important thing <unk> this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about <unk> secondly we need to create huge <unk>. <unk> biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around there 's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank . <unk> and an amazing thing has happened almost all the fish have come back <unk> and they 're reproducing like crazy <unk> . we 're going to have to start doing this around the globe we 're going to have to have no take zones we 're going to have to say no more logging in the amazon for twenty years <unk> let it recover . <unk> you all remember ted kaczynski the unabomber one of the things he raved about. was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire. and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world . a lot of very sober minded physicists believe it or not have had exactly the same thought this spring there 's a collider at brookhaven on long island. <unk> it 's going to. have an experiment in which it creates black holes they are expecting. to create little tiny black holes <unk> they expect them to evaporate . i hope they 're right . other collider experiments there 's one that 's going to take place next summer at cern. have the possibility of creating something called strangelets which are kind of like antimatter whenever they hit other matter they destroy it. <unk> and obliterate it <unk> . most physicists say that the accelerators we have now are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets that we need to worry about <unk> and they 're probably right but all around the world <unk> in japan in canada. <unk> there 's talk about this of reviving this in the united states we shut one down that was going to be big <unk> but there 's talk of building very. <unk> what can we do about this <unk> what are the solutions <unk> we 've got the fox watching the henhouse here <unk> we need to. we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics but. we need some. outside thinking and watchdogging of what 's going on with these experiments <unk> secondly we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth we have. an electromagnetic field around the earth <unk> and it 's constantly bombarded. <unk> by high energy particles like protons <unk> and in my opinion we don 't spend enough time. looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what 's safe to do on earth <unk> . number six biotech disaster it 's one of my favorite ones because we 've done several stories on bt corn bt corn is a corn. that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer. you may of heard of it heard it called starlink <unk> especially when all those taco shells were taken <unk>. <unk> out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago <unk> this stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the united states and it got into the human food supply <unk> and. somebody should 've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily but the thing that 's alarming is a couple of months ago in mexico. <unk> where bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal <unk> . they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants now <unk> corn originated we think <unk> in mexico. this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn <unk> this brings back a skepticism that has gone. <unk> superweeds and superpests could spread around the world from biotechnology <unk> that literally could destroy the world 's food supply in very short order so what. do we do about that . we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants <unk> . it 's that simple <unk> this is an amazingly unregulated field when the starlink disaster happened there was a battle between. <unk> who really had authority and over what parts of this <unk> and they didn 't get it straightened out for months that 's kind of crazy <unk> . number five one of my favorites reversal of the earth 's magnetic field <unk> believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years <unk> and has happened many times in our history <unk> north pole goes to the south south pole goes to the north and vice. <unk> as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth. over the period of about one hundred years <unk> and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this. field protects us from are well basically <unk> we 're gonna fry. <unk> can we do about this <unk> oh by the way we 're overdue it 's. been seven hundred and eighty thousand years since this happened so it should have happened about four hundred and eighty thousand. years ago oh and here 's one other thing scientists think now our magnetic field may be. diminished by about five. <unk> maybe we 're in the throes of it one of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the earth is is that we. have you know we don 't have good weather data from sixty years ago much less data on things like the ozone layer <unk> so <unk> . there 's a fairly simple solution to this <unk> there 's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that 's going to come online in about six or seven years. that gets us into the low atmosphere very. <unk> cheaply <unk> you know <unk> we can make ozone from car tailpipes <unk> it 's not hard it 's just three oxygen atoms <unk> . if you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the earth it would be the thickness of two pennies at fourteen pounds per square inch you don 't need that much up there <unk> . we need to learn how to repair and replenish. the earth 's ozone. <unk> giant solar flares . solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the sun that bombard the earth with high speed subatomic particles . so far our atmosphere has done and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this <unk> occasionally <unk> we get a flare from the sun that. causes havoc with. communications and so forth <unk> and electricity <unk> . but the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our sun and they 've found that a number of them . when they 're about the age of our sun brighten by a factor of as much as twenty . doesn 't last for very long <unk> and they think these are super flares millions of times more powerful than any flares we 've had from our sun so far. <unk> side to it in studying stars like our sun we 've found that they go through periods of diminishment when their. total amount of energy that 's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent one percent doesn 't sound like a lot but it would cause one hell of an ice age here so. what can we do about this . start terraforming mars. <unk> this is one of my favorite subjects i wrote a story about this in life magazine in. <unk> rocket science but it 's not hard rocket science. <unk> everything that we need to make an atmosphere on mars and to make a livable planet on mars <unk> is probably there and. you just literally have to. send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of mars. and spit out the oxygen the problem is it takes three hundred years to terraform mars. really more like five hundred years to do it right <unk> there 's no reason why we shouldn 't start now number three. isn 't this stuff cool . a new global epidemic people have been at war with germs ever since there have been people and from time to time the. <unk> we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed twenty million people that was back when the population. was around one hundred million people <unk> the bubonic plague in europe in the middle ages killed one out of. four europeans <unk> aids is coming back. ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency. <unk> and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics <unk> we 've all. <unk> learned what the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head like anthrax <unk> . the worst possibility. is that. a very simple germ like staph for which we have one antibiotic that still works mutates and we know staph can do. <unk> a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come and change and mutate <unk> . the danger is that some germ like staph will be will mutate into something that 's really virulent very contagious <unk> and will sweep. through. populations before we can do anything about it that 's happened before <unk> about twelve thousand years ago <unk> there was a massive. <unk> massive wave of mammal extinctions in the americas <unk> and that is thought to have been a virulent disease <unk> so what can we do about. it it is nuts we give antibiotics . every cow every lamb every chicken they get antibiotics every day all you know you go to a restaurant you eat fish i got news for you it 's all farmed you know . you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it 's a wild fish cause they 're not going to tell. <unk> we 're giving away the code this is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code <unk> we 're telling. the germs out there. how to fight us. <unk> we gotta fix that we gotta outlaw that right away <unk> secondly our public health system as we saw with anthrax <unk> is a real disaster we have a real major. outbreak of disease in the united states <unk> we are not prepared to cope with it now <unk> there is money. <unk> in the federal budget next year to build up the public health service but i don 't think to any extent that it really needs to be done <unk> number two my favorite. we meet a rogue black hole <unk> you know <unk> ten years ago or fifteen years ago really you walk into an astronomy convention . and you say you know there 's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy and they 're going to hoot you off the stage <unk> . and now if you went into one of those conventions and you said well i don 't think. <unk> our comprehension of the way the universe works is really has just gained. unbelievably in recent years <unk> . we think that there are about ten million dead stars in the milky way alone our galaxy <unk> . and these stars have compressed down to maybe something like twelve fifteen miles wide <unk> and they are black holes and they are gobbling up everything around them. <unk> which is why we can 't see them <unk> most of them should be in orbit around something but. galaxies are very violent places and things can be spun out of orbit <unk> and also space is incredibly vast so even if you. flung a million of these things out of orbit the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote <unk> but. it only it only has to get close about a billion miles away one of these things. about a billion miles away here 's what happens to earth 's orbit <unk> it becomes elliptical instead of circular <unk> . and for three months out of the year the surface temperatures go up to one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty for three months out of the year they go to fifty below zero . that won 't work too well <unk> what can we do about this and this is my scariest. <unk> gotta think about being a colonizing race <unk> and finally number one . biggest danger to life as we know it i think a really big asteroid heads for earth <unk> . the important thing to remember here this is. <unk> piece of a comet. exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe one hundred miles it had the effect of about one thousand hiroshima bombs . astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years in. <unk> miles away from earth <unk> nothing to worry about right <unk> . it passed directly through earth 's orbit <unk> we were in that that spot six hours earlier . a small asteroid say a half mile wide would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up carl sagan 's nuclear winter. thing an asteroid five miles wide. <unk> causes major extinctions we think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide <unk> where are they . there 's something called the kuiper belt <unk> which some people think pluto 's not a planet <unk> that 's where pluto is it 's in the kuiper belt. there 's also something a little farther out called the oort cloud <unk> there are about one hundred thousand. balls of ice and rock comets really out there. <unk> there that are fifty miles in diameter or more <unk> and they regularly take a little spin in towards the sun and. pass reasonably close to us . of more concern i think is. the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter. <unk> the folks at the sloan digital sky survey told us last fall they 're making the first map of the universe. three dimensional map of the universe that there are probably seven hundred thousand asteroids between mars and jupiter. that are a half a mile big or bigger so you say yeah well. <unk> what are really the chances of this happening <unk> andrew can you put that chart up. <unk> this is a chart that dr clark chapman at the southwest research institute presented to congress a few years ago <unk> you 'll notice that the chance of an <unk>. <unk> impact killing you is about one in twenty thousand <unk> according to the work they 've done <unk> now look at the one right below that passenger aircraft. crash one in twenty thousand <unk> we spend an awful lot of money. trying to be sure that we don 't die in airplane accidents <unk> and we 're not spending hardly anything. on this <unk> and yet <unk> this is completely preventable we finally have just in the last year <unk> the technology to stop this cold could we have the solutions <unk> . nasa 's spending three million dollars a year three million bucks that is like pocket change. to search for asteroids because we can actually figure out every asteroid that 's out there <unk> and if it might hit earth <unk> and when. <unk> hit earth <unk> and they 're trying to do that but it 's going to take them ten years <unk> at spending three million dollars a year and even then they claim they 'll only have about eighty percent of them catalogued . comets are a tougher act we don 't really have the technology to predict. comet trajectories or when one with our name on it might arrive <unk> but we would have lots of time. <unk> if we see it coming we really need a dedicated observatory <unk> you 'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of amateur. astronomers that 's because nobody 's looking for them except amateurs <unk> we need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets <unk> . part two of the solutions. <unk> we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid or alter its trajectory now <unk> a year ago we did an amazing thing we sent a probe out to this. <unk> they pulled one of those sneaky nasa things where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything and then at the last minute they landed when the mission was over they actually landed on the thing <unk> . we have landed. a rocket ship on an asteroid it 's not a big deal now the trouble with just sending a bomb out. <unk> for this thing is that you don 't have anything to push against in space because there 's no air <unk> a nuclear explosion is just as hot <unk> but. we don 't really have anything big enough. to melt a 22 mile long asteroid or vaporize it would be more like it <unk> but we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them. and put something like a small ion propulsion. motor on it. <unk> slowly after a period of time push it into a different trajectory which if we 've done our math right . would keep it from hitting earth <unk> this is just a matter of finding ' em going there and doing something about it . i know your head is spinning from all this stuff.
