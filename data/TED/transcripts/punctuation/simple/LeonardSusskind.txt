 <unk> i decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman . i was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence and i 'm going to tell. <unk> the richard feynman that i knew <unk> . i 'm sure there are people here who could tell you about the richard feynman they knew and it would probably be a different richard feynman richard feynman was a very complex man. <unk> he was a man of many many parts he was of course <unk> foremost a very very very great scientist <unk> . he was an actor <unk> you saw him act i also had the good fortune to be in those lectures up in the. <unk> they were fantastic <unk> he was a philosopher <unk> he was a drum player <unk> he was a teacher par excellence . richard feynman was also a showman an enormous showman <unk> he was brash <unk> irreverent <unk> . he was full of macho a kind of macho. <unk> a lot of room at the bottom <unk> and what i mean by that is a lot of room in my case i can 't speak for anybody else . but in my case a lot of room for another big ego <unk> well not as big as his but. fairly big i always felt good with dick feynman. <unk> it was always fun to be with him <unk> . he always made me feel smart <unk> how can somebody like that make you feel smart somehow he did he made me feel smart he made me feel he was smart <unk> he made me feel we were both smart <unk> and the two of us could solve any problem whatever. and in fact we did sometimes do physics together we never published a paper together <unk> but we did have a lot of fun. <unk> he loved to win . win these little macho games we would sometimes play and he didn 't only play them with me but with all sorts of people he would almost always win <unk> . but when he didn 't win when he lost . he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won . i remember once he told me a story about a joke the students played on him. <unk> they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pasadena it may still exist i don 't know . celebrity sandwiches was their thing <unk> you could get a marilyn monroe sandwich you could get a humphrey bogart sandwich . the students went there in advance <unk> and arranged that they. <unk> all order feynman sandwiches one after another they came in and ordered feynman sandwiches feynman loved this story he told me this story and he was really happy and. laughing when he finished the story <unk> . i said to him dick i wonder what would be the difference between a feynman sandwich and a susskind sandwich . and without skipping a beat at all he said <unk>. <unk> be about the same the only difference is a susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham. well <unk> i happened to have been very quick that day and i said yeah but a lot less baloney <unk>. the truth of the matter is that a feynman sandwich had a load of ham <unk> but absolutely no. <unk> a couple of times up in san francisco at some very rich guy 's house up in san francisco for dinner. <unk> and the last time the rich guy invited us he also invited a couple of philosophers these guys were philosophers of mind . their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness <unk> and they were full of all kinds of jargon i 'm trying to remember the words. monism dualism categories all over the place i didn 't know what those meant neither did dick or sydney for that matter <unk> and what did we talk. <unk> what do you talk about when you talk about minds there 's one obvious thing to talk about can a machine become a mind . can you build a machine that thinks like a human being that is conscious . we sat around and talked about this we of course never resolved it <unk> but the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been. <unk> a scientific question after all and this was a very very dangerous thing to do around dick feynman. feynman let them have it both barrels right between the eyes it was brutal it was funny ooh it was funny <unk> but. it was really brutal he really popped their balloon <unk> . but the amazing thing was feynman had to leave a little early he wasn 't feeling too well <unk> so he left a little bit early <unk> and sidney and i were left there with the two philosophers <unk> . and the amazing thing is these guys were. <unk> flying they were so happy <unk> . they had met the great man <unk> they had been instructed by the great man <unk> they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud <unk> . and. it was something special i realized there was something just extraordinary about feynman. even when he did what he did. <unk> dick he was my friend i did call him dick. dick and i had a little bit of a rapport i think it may have been a special rapport that he and i had we liked each other we liked the same kind of things <unk> i also like the intellectual macho games . sometimes i would win mostly he would win but we both enjoyed them <unk> . and dick became convinced at some point that he and i had some kind of similarity of. <unk> personality <unk> . i don 't think he was right i think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves <unk> . but he was convinced of this <unk> and the man was incredibly curious <unk> and he wanted to understand what it was and why it was. that that there was this funny connection . <unk> the reason he called me leonardo is because we were in europe and he was practicing his french . and he said leonardo were you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid. <unk> he was a working man had a fifth grade education <unk> he was a master mechanic and he taught me how to use tools he taught me. all sorts of things about mechanical things he even taught me the pythagorean theorem he didn 't call it the hypotenuse <unk> he called it the shortcut distance . and. feynman 's eyes just. <unk> he went off like a lightbulb <unk> . and he said that he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father . in fact he had been convinced at one time that to be a good. physicist <unk> it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father <unk> i apologize for the sexist. conversation here but this is the way it really happened. <unk> said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary a necessary part of. the growing up of a young physicist <unk> . being dick he of course wanted to check this he wanted to go out and do an experiment well . he did <unk> he went out and did an experiment he asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists was it your mom or your pop that influenced you. <unk> there went that theory down the trash can of history but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience. with his <unk> father as he had with his father <unk> and for some time he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well <unk> i don 't know. <unk> who knows but let me tell you a little bit about feynman the physicist <unk> . feynman 's style. no style is not the right word style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing it 's something much deeper than that. but i can 't think of another word for it feynman 's scientific style was always to look for the simplest . most elementary solution to a problem that was possible <unk> if it wasn 't. <unk> possible you had to use something fancier. <unk> no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could . but he also deeply believed he truly believed that if you couldn 't explain something simply you didn 't understand it . <unk> people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked . there was a theory <unk> it was due to a russian mathematical physicist it was a complicated theory i 'll tell you what it was soon enough . it was a terribly complicated theory full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth. and it sort of worked but it didn 't work very well the only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very very far apart. <unk> unfortunately the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other feynman decided as a sort of amateur helium physicist that he would try to figure it out. he had an idea a very clear idea <unk> he would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like he would try to visualize. <unk> guided by a small number of simple principles . the small number of simple principles were very very simple the first one was that when helium atoms touch each other <unk> they repel <unk> the implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other <unk> . the other fact is that in the ground state the lowest energy state of a quantum system the wave function is always very. <unk> has the minimum number of wiggles so he sat down and i imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil. and he tried to write down and did write down the simplest function that he could think of . which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between . he wrote down a simple thing so simple in fact <unk> that i suspect a. <unk> student who didn 't even have calculus could understand what he wrote down . the thing was that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some <unk> . i 've always wondered. whether the professionals the real professional helium physicists were just a little bit embarrassed by this <unk> they had their <unk>. technique and they. <unk> in my own university i wasn 't there at the time <unk>. they were exploring the structure of the proton the proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles this was more or less known <unk> . and the way to analyze it was of course feynman. <unk> diagrams that 's what feynman diagrams were constructed for to understand particles . the experiments that were going on were very simple <unk> you simply take the proton and you hit it really sharply with an electron this was the thing the feynman diagrams were for . the only problem was that feynman diagrams are complicated they 're difficult. <unk> if you could do all of them you would have a very precise theory but you couldn 't they were just too complicated . people were trying to do them you could do a one loop diagram don 't worry about one loop one loop two loops maybe you could do a three loop diagram but beyond that you couldn 't do anything feynman said forget all of that . just think of the proton as an assemblage. <unk> moving real fast because they 're moving real fast <unk> . relativity says the internal motions go very slow <unk> . the electron hits it suddenly it 's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton <unk> . what do you see you see a frozen bunch of partons <unk> they don 't move and because they don 't move during the course of the experiment. <unk> you don 't have to worry about how they 're moving <unk> you don 't have to worry about the forces between them <unk> . you just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons . this was the key to analyzing these experiments extremely effective. somebody said the word revolution is a bad. <unk> but it certainly evolved. very very deeply our understanding of the of the proton <unk> and of particles beyond that . well i had some more that i was going to tell you about my connection with feynman what he was like but i see i have exactly half a minute . so i think i 'll just finish up by saying <unk> i actually don 't think feynman would have liked this event <unk> i think he would have said. <unk> but how should we honor feynman how should we really honor feynman <unk> i think the answer is we should honor feynman. by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can thank you.
