 <unk> me just start with my story <unk> so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college . then i went on to tear my acl the ligament in my knee <unk> and then developed an arthritic knee and i 'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and. by the way i married a. <unk> who has exactly the same story <unk> so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon. and to see if i couldn 't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me . so with that let me just show you a quick video. to get you in the mood of what we 're trying to explain narrator we are all aware of the risk of cancer but there 's another disease that 's destined to affect even more of us. <unk> arthritis <unk> cancer may kill you but when you look at the numbers arthritis ruins more lives <unk> . assuming you live a long life there 's a fifty percent chance you 'll develop arthritis and it 's not just aging that causes arthritis <unk> common injuries can lead to decades of pain <unk> until our joints quite literally grind to a halt <unk> . desperate for a solution we 've turned to. <unk> to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts <unk> . but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body <unk> shouldn 't we stop and ask if there 's a better more natural way . let 's consider an alternative path . what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature <unk> or within our own stem cells <unk> this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace. <unk> and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically and let 's talk about both what i did for my wife and what i 've done for hundreds of other patients. first thing for my wife and the most common thing i hear from my patients particularly in the 40 to 80 year old age group 70 year old age group is they come in and say hey doc isn 't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee i 'm not ready for joint replacement . and so for her i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that. <unk> unstable ligament we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee <unk> . and then for the damaged arthritis on the surface we did a stem cell paste graft which we designed in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there <unk> . so here 's my wife 's bad knee on the left and her just hiking now four months later in aspen and doing well. <unk> and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients the girl on the video jen hudak just won the superpipe in aspen. just nine months after having destroyed her knee as you see in the other image and having a paste graft to that knee <unk> and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically <unk> . so with all this success. <unk> why isn 't that good enough you might ask . well the reason is because there 's not enough donor cycles there 's not enough young healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us <unk> . and the tissue 's very expensive <unk> and so that 's not going to be a solution that 's going to get us global with biologic tissue <unk> . but the solution is animal tissue because it 's plentiful it 's. <unk> you can get it from young healthy tissues . but the barrier is immunology and the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl or gal epitope so if we 're going to transplant animal tissues to people we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope <unk> . so my story in working with animal tissues starts in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and i started first with cow achilles tendon <unk> where we would take the cow achilles tendon <unk> which is type i collagen strip it of its antigens. <unk> by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template . we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient 's knee <unk> . we 've now done that procedure and it 's been done worldwide in over four thousand cases. <unk> the tissue <unk> but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament i can 't grind it up in a blender <unk> . so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away or strip those galactosyl <unk>. epitopes with a specific enzyme and we call that a gal stripping technique what we do is humanize the tissue. 's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient 's knee . and we 've done that now we 've taken pig ligament young healthy big tissue put it into ten patients in an fda approved trial and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill. <unk> he calls it so we know it can work and there 's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending <unk> . so what about the next step what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement not just the parts how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement <unk> well here 's how we 're going to do it <unk> . so what we 're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young healthy pig . strip it of its antigens load it with your stem cells. then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee <unk> tack it on there have you heal that surface. and then create a new biologic surface for your knee <unk> . so that 's our biologic approach right now we 're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. we 're going to resurface it with a completely new surface . but we have other advantages from the animal kingdom there 's a benefit of four hundred million years of ambulation <unk> we can harness those benefits <unk> we can use thicker <unk>. younger better tissues than you might have injured in your knee or that you might have when you 're forty fifty or sixty . <unk> super biologics it 's not hardware . it 's not software it 's bioware it 's version two point zero of you . and so with that coming to a . coming to an operating theater near you soon i believe <unk> thank you very much.
