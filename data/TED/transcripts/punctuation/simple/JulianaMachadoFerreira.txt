 <unk> illegal wildlife trade in brazil. is one of the major threats against our fauna especially birds <unk> and mainly to supply the pet market. with thousands of animals taken from nature every month <unk> and transported far from their. <unk> origins to be sold mainly in rio de janeiro and so paulo <unk> . it is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in brazil withdraw from nature. almost <unk> <unk> thirty eight million animals every year a business worth almost two billion dollars . the police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals. <unk> intended to supply the pet market <unk> or they seize the animals directly from the people 's houses <unk> . and this is how we end up every month with thousands of seized animals <unk> . and for us to understand what happens with them <unk> we 're going to follow brad . in the eyes of many people after the animals are seized they say. <unk> yay <unk> justice has been served the good guys arrived <unk> took the cute mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers <unk> and everyone lived happily ever after . but did they . actually no <unk> and this is where many of our problems begin because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals . in brazil they are usually. <unk> first sent to governmental triage facilities in which most of the cases the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers . in two thousand and two these centers received <unk>. <unk> thousand animals of which thirty seven thousand were birds and the police estimates that we seize. seize only five percent of what 's being trafficked <unk> some lucky ones and among them brad. go to serious rehabilitation centers after that and in these places they are cared for . they train their flying <unk> they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature . and they are able to socialize with others from the same species . but then what the brazil ornithological society so now. <unk> we 're talking only birds. claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature . therefore it would be too risky to release these animals <unk> both for the released and for the natural populations <unk> . they also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. <unk> only in the state of so paulo <unk> only in two thousand and six <unk> but some researchers <unk> myself included. some ngos and some people from the brazilian government. <unk> believe there is an alternative . we think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health <unk> behavior <unk> inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations . then technically responsible releases are possible both. <unk> of the individual <unk> and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems <unk> because we will be returning genes for these populations which could be important for them. in facing environmental challenges. and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers <unk> predators <unk> preys <unk> etc. <unk> all of these were released by us on the top the turtles are just enjoying freedom. <unk> middle. <unk> this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release and on the bottom my personal favorite the little male over there four hours after his release he was together with a wild female . so this is not new people have been doing this around the world <unk> but it 's still a big issue in brazil we believe we have performed responsible releases. <unk> we 've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks . so these genes are indeed going back to the populations.
