 <unk> i 'm here today to talk about social change <unk> not. a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that but a new business model for social change a new way of tackling the problem . in britain. <unk> percent. of all men who come out of short sentences. from prison re offend again within a year <unk> . now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit. and how many previous times do you think they 've been in prison. <unk> we went to talk to the ministry of justice <unk> and we said to the ministry of justice what 's it worth to you. if fewer of these guys re offend it 's got to be worth something right i mean there 's prison costs <unk> there 's. police costs there 's court costs all these things that you 're spending money on to deal with these guys <unk> what 's it worth now of. we care about the social value social finance the organization i helped set up <unk> cares about social stuff <unk> but. we wanted to make the economic case <unk> because if we could make the economic case <unk> then the value of doing this would be completely compelling <unk> and if we can agree on both a value. and a way of measuring whether we 've been successful at reducing that re offending then we can do something. <unk> social impact bond is simply saying if we can get the government to agree that we can create a contract. where they only pay. if it worked <unk> so that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn 't work <unk> which for still quite a lot of bits of government. <unk> that 's a serious issue <unk> now many of you may have noticed there 's a problem at this point and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened <unk> . so. we have to raise some money <unk> we use the contract. to raise money from socially motivated investors . socially motivated investors there 's an interesting idea <unk> right <unk> . but actually <unk> there 's a lot of people who if they 're given the chance would love to invest in something that does social good. <unk> and here 's the opportunity do you want to also help government find whether there 's a better economic model . not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re offend and putting them back in again <unk> . but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes. and fewer victims <unk> so we find some investors <unk> and they pay for a set of services. <unk> and if those services are successful then they improve outcomes <unk> . and with those measured reductions in re offending government saves money and with those savings they can pay outcomes <unk> . and the investors do not just get their money back <unk> but they make a return <unk> so in march two thousand and ten we signed the first social impact bond. with the ministry of justice around peterborough prison. <unk> was to work with three thousand offenders. split into three cohorts of one thousand each <unk> . now each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison they 've got to have a year to commit their crimes six months to get through the court system <unk> . and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer as similar as possible and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of. 10 percent reduction for every conviction event that didn 't happen <unk> so we get paid for crimes saved <unk> now if. we achieved that 10 percent reduction across all three cohorts then the investors get a seven and a half percent. annualized return on their investment <unk> and if we do better than that they can get up to thirteen percent annualized return on their investment. <unk> is okay <unk> so. everyone wins here right the ministry of justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works . investors get two opportunities for the first time they can invest in social change . also they make a reasonable return and they also know that. first investors in these kinds of things they 're going to have to believers they 're going to have to care in the. <unk> program <unk> but if this builds a track record over five or ten years <unk> then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product . the service providers well for the first time they 've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they 're doing. in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they 're doing over five or six years not just one or two as often happens at. fewer crimes fewer victims <unk> . now the offenders they also benefit instead of just coming out of the prison with forty six pounds in their pocket half of them not knowing where they 're spending their first night out of jail . actually <unk> . someone meets them in prison <unk> learns about their issues <unk> meets them at the gate <unk> takes them through to somewhere to stay <unk> . connects them to benefits connects them to employment drug. <unk> rehabilitation mental health <unk> whatever 's needed <unk> . so. let 's think of another example . working with children in care social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people . so children in the state care tend to do very badly. <unk> only thirteen percent achieve a reasonable level of five gcses at sixteen <unk> . against fifty eight percent of the wider population more troublingly twenty seven percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care <unk> . and even more worryingly <unk> and this is a home office statistic <unk> seventy percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care the state is not a great. <unk> there are great programs for. adolescents who are on the edge of care and thirty percent of kids going into care are adolescents. so we set up a program with essex county council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those. for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system <unk> essex only pays in the event that it 's saving. <unk> investors have put in three point one million pounds that program started last month <unk> others around homelessness in london around. youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country there are now thirteen social impact bonds in britain <unk> . and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world so david cameron 's put twenty million pounds. into a social outcomes fund to support this idea <unk> obama has suggested three. <unk> hundred million dollars in the u s budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward . and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest so what 's caused this excitement why is this so different for people . well the first piece which we 've talked about is innovation it enables testing of new ideas in a way that 's less difficult. <unk> the second piece it brings is rigor <unk> by working to outcomes people really have to test and bring data. into the situation that one 's dealing with so taking peterborough as an example <unk> we. add case management across all of the different organizations that we 're working with so they know what actually has been done with different. <unk> and at the same time they learn from the ministry of justice and we learn because we pushed for the data what actually happens whether they get re arrested or not and we learn and adapt the program accordingly <unk> . and this leads to the third element which is new <unk> and that 's flexibility <unk> because. normal contracting for things when you 're spending government money you 're spending our money <unk> tax money <unk> and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control. <unk> exactly how you spend it . now any entrepreneur in the in the room knows that version one point zero the business plan is not the one that generally works <unk> . so when you 're trying to do something like this you need the flexibility to adapt the program . and again in peterborough <unk> we started off with a program but we also. <unk> over the period of time <unk> . we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term <unk> . greater engagement. from the prisoners longer term engagement as well <unk> . the last element is partnership <unk> there is at the moment a stale debate going on very often state 's better <unk> public sector 's better private sector 's better. <unk> social sector 's better for a lot of these programs actually for creating social change we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work <unk> . and this creates a structure through which they can combine . so where does this leave us this leaves us with a way. that people can invest in social change <unk> we 've met thousands <unk> possibly millions of people who want the. opportunity to invest in social change <unk> we 've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences . with this kind of model we can help bring them together <unk> thank you.
