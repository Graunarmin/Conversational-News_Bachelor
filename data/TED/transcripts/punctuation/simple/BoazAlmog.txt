 <unk> the phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum. <unk> locking and the object. that was levitating here is called a superconductor . superconductivity is a quantum state of matter <unk> and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature . now <unk> it 's quite an old phenomenon it was discovered one hundred years ago <unk> however only recently due to several. <unk> technological advancements we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation. and quantum locking <unk> . so a superconductor is defined by two properties the first is zero electrical resistance <unk> . and the second. is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor. <unk> that sounds complicated right <unk> but what is electrical resistance <unk> so <unk> electricity is the flow of electrons. inside a material <unk> . and these electrons while flowing they collide with the atoms <unk> and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy <unk> . and they dissipate this energy in the form of heat <unk> and you know that effect. however inside a superconductor there are no collisions . so there is no energy dissipation <unk> . it 's quite remarkable think about it . in classical physics there is always some friction some energy loss but not here <unk> because it is a quantum effect <unk> . but that 's not all. <unk> because superconductors. don 't like magnetic fields . so a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside <unk> and it has the means to do that. by circulating currents now the combination of both effects. the expulsion of magnetic. <unk> resistance. is exactly a superconductor . but the picture isn 't always perfect as we all know and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor . now <unk> under proper conditions which we have here these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor. and. these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor . they come in discrete quantities <unk> why because it is a quantum phenomenon it 's quantum physics <unk> . and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles . in this movie here you can see how they flow one by one discretely this is. strands of magnetic field. <unk> not particles but they behave like particles <unk> . so this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking <unk> but what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field <unk> . well first there are strands of magnetic field left inside. <unk> but now the superconductor doesn 't like them moving around <unk> because their movements. dissipate energy which breaks the superconductivity state . so what it actually does it locks these strands which are called fluxons <unk> . and it locks these fluxons in place <unk> . and by doing that what it actually does. is locking itself in place why. <unk> movement. of the superconductor will change their place will change their configuration <unk> so we get quantum locking and let me show you. how this works i have here a superconductor which i. wrapped up so it 'd stay cold long enough <unk> and when i place it on top of a regular magnet <unk> it just stays. locked in midair now . this is not just. levitation it 's not just repulsion i can rearrange the fluxons <unk> and it will be locked in this new configuration . like this or move it slightly to the right or to the left . <unk> of course i can turn it upside down <unk> and it will remain locked now now that we understand that this. <unk> levitation is actually locking yeah. we understand that . you won 't be surprised to hear that if i take this circular magnet. in which the magnetic field is the same all around . the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet <unk> why because as long as it rotates . the locking. is maintained you see i can adjust and i can rotate the superconductor we have frictionless motion it is still. <unk> levitating <unk> but can move freely all around <unk> . so we have quantum locking and. we can levitate it on top of this magnet <unk> but how many fluxons how many magnetic strands. are there in a single disk like this well we can calculate it and it turns out quite a lot one hundred billion strands. <unk> of magnetic field inside this. disk but that 's not the amazing part yet because there is something i haven 't told you yet . and yeah <unk> the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here. is only half a micron thick <unk> it 's extremely thin <unk> and this extremely thin layer. <unk> able to levitate. more than seventy thousand times its own weight <unk> . it 's a remarkable effect it 's very strong . now i can extend this circular magnet <unk> and make whatever track i want . for example <unk> i can make. a large circular rail here. and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail . it moves freely . and again that 's not all i can adjust its position like this and rotate. and it freely moves in this new position and. i can even try a new thing <unk> let 's try it for the first time i can take this disk. and put it here <unk> and while it stays here don 't move. <unk> it 's quantum locking not levitation <unk>. <unk> while i 'll let it circulate for a little more let me tell you a little bit about superconductors now . laughter so. we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors so we can use them to produce. <unk> such as needed in mri machines particle accelerators and so on but we can also store energy. using superconductors <unk> because we have no dissipation <unk> . and we could also produce power cables to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations imagine you could back up. a single power station with a. <unk> but what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking <unk> . well <unk> let me answer this simple question by giving you an example <unk> . imagine. you would have. a disk similar to the one i have here in my hand three inch diameter with a single difference the superconducting layer. <unk> instead of being half a micron thin <unk> being two millimeters thin quite thin this <unk>. superconducting layer could hold one thousand kilograms a small car in my hand.
