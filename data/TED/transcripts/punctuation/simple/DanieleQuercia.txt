 <unk> a scientist and engineer <unk> i 've focused on efficiency. for many years but efficiency can be a cult and today. i 'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back. to a far richer reality . a few years ago <unk> after finishing my ph d in london <unk> i moved to boston i lived in boston. and worked in cambridge <unk> i bought a racing bicycle that summer <unk> and i bicycled every day to work. to find my way <unk> i used my phone it sent me over mass ave massachusetts avenue <unk> the shortest route. from boston. to cambridge <unk> but. after a month that i was cycling every day on the car packed mass ave i took a different route one day. <unk> not entirely sure why i took a different route that day a detour <unk> i just remember a feeling of. surprise surprise at finding. a street with no cars <unk> as opposed to the nearby mass ave full of cars <unk> . surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees <unk> . but after the feeling of. <unk> i felt shame <unk> how could i have been so blind for an entire month i was so trapped in my mobile app. that a journey to work became one thing only . the shortest path <unk> in this single journey there was no thought of enjoying the road <unk> . no pleasure in connecting with nature <unk> no possibility of looking people in the eyes and why. because i was saving a minute. out of my commute . now let me ask you am i alone here <unk> . how many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions . most of you if not all have and don 't get me wrong. <unk> for encouraging people to explore the city you take your phone out and you know immediately where to go <unk> . however <unk> the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination <unk> . it has the power. to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination. <unk> to understanding how people experience the city <unk> . i used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale <unk> at web scale <unk> . i became. captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by jane jacobs. <unk> milgram <unk> kevin lynch <unk> the result of that research has been the creation of. new maps maps. where you don 't only find the shortest path <unk> the blue one but also the most enjoyable path <unk> the red one <unk> . how was that possible <unk> . <unk> will get you from a to b imagination will take you everywhere so with a bit of imagination we needed to understand. which parts of the city people find beautiful . at the university of cambridge with colleagues we thought about this simple experiment if i were to show you these two urban. <unk> ask you which one is more beautiful which one would you say . don 't be shy <unk> . who says a <unk> who says b brilliant <unk> . based on that idea <unk> we built a crowdsourcing platform a web game <unk> players are shown pairs of urban scenes and they 're asked to choose which one is more beautiful quiet. and happy. <unk> based on thousands of user votes then we are able to see where consensus emerges we are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy <unk> . after that work <unk> i joined yahoo labs <unk> and i teamed up with luca and rossano . and together we aggregated those winning locations in london to build a new map of the city . a cartography. weighted for human emotions on this cartography you 're not only able to see and connect from point a to point b. the shortest segments <unk> but you 're also able to see the happy. segment <unk> the beautiful path <unk> the quiet path in tests <unk> participants found. the happy the beautiful the quiet path far more enjoyable than. <unk> the shortest one <unk> and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time <unk> participants also love to attach. memories to places <unk> shared memories that 's where the old bbc building was and personal memories. that 's where i gave my first. <unk> they also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded <unk> . so what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell <unk> . sound <unk> and memories that 's where our research is going right now . more generally my research <unk> what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path to avoid robbing people. of fully experiencing the city in which they live <unk> walk the path through the park not through the car park <unk> and you have an entirely different path <unk> . walk the path full of people you love and not full of cars <unk> and you have an entirely different path <unk> it 's that simple . i would like to end with this thought do you remember the truman show it 's a media satire. <unk> in which a real person doesn 't know he 's living in a fabricated world <unk> perhaps. we live in a world fabricated for efficiency . look at some of your daily habits <unk> and as truman did in the movie <unk> escape. the fabricated world why well if you think that. adventure is dangerous try routine it 's deadly <unk> thank you.
