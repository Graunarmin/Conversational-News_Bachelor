 <unk> years ago our ancestors were insignificant animals <unk> . the most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant <unk> their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or. <unk> fireflies or woodpeckers . today in contrast <unk> we control this planet . and the question is <unk> how did we come from there to here <unk> . how did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes minding their own business in a corner of africa into the rulers of. <unk> we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level <unk> . we want to believe i want to believe that there is something special about me . about my body about my brain that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig or a chimpanzee <unk> . but the truth is that on the individual level <unk> i 'm embarrassingly similar. <unk> similar to a chimpanzee . and if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better <unk> i would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee . not on myself <unk> and this is not something wrong with me personally. <unk> i guess if they took almost any one of you and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island <unk> the chimpanzee would do much better . the real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level it 's on the collective level . humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. <unk> now there are other animals like the social insects <unk> the bees the ants that can cooperate in large numbers <unk> . but they don 't do so flexibly their cooperation is very rigid . there is basically just one way in which a beehive can function and if there 's a new opportunity or a new. <unk> the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight . they cannot for example <unk> execute the queen and establish a republic of bees or a communist dictatorship of worker bees . other animals like the social mammals the wolves the elephants the dolphins the chimpanzees. they can cooperate much more flexibly <unk> but they do so only in small numbers <unk> because cooperation among chimpanzees is. <unk> based on intimate knowledge one of the other i 'm a chimpanzee and you 're a chimpanzee and i want to cooperate with you i need to know you personally <unk>. <unk> what kind of chimpanzee are you are you a nice chimpanzee are you an evil chimpanzee are you trustworthy if i don 't know you <unk> how can i cooperate. <unk> that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us homo sapiens <unk> . one versus one . or even ten versus ten chimpanzees might be better than us . but if you pit one thousand humans against one thousand chimpanzees. <unk> the humans will win easily for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all . and if you now try to cram one hundred thousand chimpanzees into oxford street or into wembley stadium or tienanmen square or the vatican <unk>. you will get chaos <unk> complete chaos just imagine wembley stadium with one hundred thousand chimpanzees. <unk> complete madness . in contrast humans normally gather there in tens of thousands <unk> and what we get is not chaos usually <unk> what we get <unk>. is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation . <unk> ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers <unk> . think even about this very talk that i 'm giving now <unk> i 'm standing here in front of an audience of about three hundred or four hundred people . most of you are complete strangers to me . similarly <unk> i don 't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event <unk> i don 't know. the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here <unk> yesterday to london <unk> . i don 't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras which are recording what i 'm saying <unk> . i don 't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that i read in preparation for this talk . and i certainly don 't know all the people who might be. <unk> watching this talk over the internet somewhere in buenos aires or in new delhi <unk> . nevertheless even though we don 't know each other <unk> we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas . this is something chimpanzees cannot do they communicate. <unk> but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants or anything else that might interest chimpanzees . now cooperation is of course not always nice . all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history and we have been doing some very horrible. <unk> are a system of cooperation slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation concentration camps are a system of cooperation . chimpanzees don 't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps . now suppose i 've managed to convince you perhaps that yes <unk> we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. the next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener. is how exactly do we do it <unk> what enables us alone of all the animals to cooperate in such a way <unk> . the answer. is our imagination <unk> we can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers. because we alone of all the animals on the planet can create and believe fictions fictional stories <unk> . and as long as everybody believes in the same fiction . everybody obeys and follows the same rules the same norms the same values . all other animals use their communication system only. to describe reality . a chimpanzee may say look there 's a lion <unk> let 's run away or look <unk> there 's a banana tree over there <unk> let 's go and get bananas . humans in contrast use their language not merely to describe reality <unk> but also to create new realities fictional realities . a human can say. <unk> above the clouds <unk> and if you don 't do what i tell you to do when you die god will punish you and send you to hell . and if you all believe this story that i 've invented <unk> then you will follow the same norms and laws and values <unk> and you can cooperate . this is something only humans can do . you can never. <unk> and you 'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds so now give me this banana no chimpanzee will ever believe such a story . only humans believe such stories <unk> which is why we control the world whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories . now you may find it acceptable that yes. <unk> the religious field <unk> humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions <unk> millions of people come together to build a cathedral or <unk>. <unk> a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad because they all believe in the same stories about god and heaven and hell <unk> . underlies all other forms of <unk> mass scale human cooperation not only in the religious field take. for example <unk> the legal field . most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights <unk> but what are human rights. <unk> human rights just like god and heaven are just a story that we 've invented they are not an objective reality <unk> they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens <unk> . take a human being <unk> cut him open look inside you will find the heart <unk> the kidneys neurons hormones dna <unk> but you won 't find any rights <unk> . the only place you find. <unk> the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries <unk> . they may be very positive stories very good stories <unk> but they 're still just fictional stories that we 've invented <unk> . the same is true of the political field <unk> the most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. <unk> but what are states and nations <unk> they are not an objective reality <unk> a mountain is an objective reality <unk> you can see it <unk> you can touch it <unk> you can even smell it <unk> . but a nation or a state like israel or iran or france or germany this is just a story that we 've invented and became extremely attached to . the same is true of the economic field <unk> . the most important actors today in the global economy are companies and. <unk> corporations many of you today perhaps work for <unk>. like google or toyota or mcdonald 's what exactly are these things . they are what lawyers call legal fictions <unk> . they are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. <unk> corporations do all day <unk> mostly they try to make money <unk> . yet what is money <unk> again money is not an objective reality <unk> it has no objective value <unk> . take this green piece of paper the dollar bill <unk> look at it it has no value <unk> you cannot eat it <unk> you cannot drink it <unk> you cannot wear it <unk> . but then came along these master storytellers. the big bankers <unk> the finance ministers <unk> the prime ministers and they tell us a very convincing story . look you see this green piece of paper it is actually worth ten bananas . and if i believe it and you believe it and everybody believes it it actually works i can take this worthless piece of paper . go to the supermarket give it to a complete stranger. <unk> whom i 've never met before and get in exchange real bananas which i can actually eat . this is something amazing you could never do it with chimpanzees . chimpanzees trade of course yes <unk> you give me a coconut i 'll give you a banana that can work <unk> . but you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana no way what do you think i am a human. money in fact is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans because it is the only story everybody believes . not everybody believes in god . not everybody believes in human rights <unk> not everybody believes in nationalism <unk> but everybody believes in money. <unk> the dollar bill take. even osama bin laden <unk> . he hated american politics and american religion and american culture <unk> but he had no objection to american dollars he was quite fond of them actually . to conclude then we humans control the world because we live in a dual reality. other animals live in an objective reality <unk> . their reality consists of objective entities <unk> like rivers and trees and lions and elephants <unk> . we humans we also live in an objective reality <unk> in our world too there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants <unk> . but over the centuries we have. <unk> constructed on top of this objective reality. a second layer of fictional reality . a reality made of fictional entities <unk> like nations <unk> like gods <unk> like money <unk> like corporations <unk> . and what is amazing is that as history. <unk> fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today <unk> the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities . today <unk> the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional. <unk> after sapiens you wrote another one and it. <unk> in the book if i understand it correctly you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that. we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better but. they will create and i quote you new classes and new class struggles just as the industrial revolution did can you elaborate for us ynh yes. in the industrial revolution we saw the creation of a new class of the. urban proletariat and much of the political and social history of the last two hundred years involved what to do with this class and the new problems and opportunities . now we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people . as. computers become better and better in more. <unk> a distinct possibility that computers will out perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant and then the big political and economic question <unk>. of the 21st century will be what do we need humans for or at least what do we need so many humans for bg do you have an answer in the book ynh . <unk> this doesn 't sound like a very appealing future bg ok so. you 're basically saying in the book and now that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality . we are just kind of at the beginning of the process ynh again it 's. not a prophecy it 's. seeing all kinds of possibilities before us one possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people. <unk> possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods <unk> . <unk> and the poor being degraded to this level of useless useless people bg i feel there is another ted talk coming up in a year or two thank you.
