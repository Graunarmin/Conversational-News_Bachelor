 <unk> i 'm gonna talk a little bit about. security <unk> because we 've got to get better at security in this 21st century let me start by saying <unk> let 's look back to the. <unk> and kind of get a sense of. how that style of security worked for us <unk> . this is verdun a battlefield in france just north of the nato headquarters in belgium . at verdun in one thousand nine hundred and sixteen over a <unk>. period <unk> seven hundred thousand people were killed so about two thousand a day <unk> . <unk> the second world war you see the battle of stalingrad three hundred days two million people killed . we go into the cold war and we continue to try and build walls <unk> we go from the trench warfare. of the first world war. to the maginot line of the second world war and then we go into the cold war <unk> the iron curtain. <unk> berlin wall walls don 't work <unk> my thesis for us today. is instead of building walls to create security we need to build bridges <unk> this is a famous bridge in europe <unk> it 's in <unk>. 's the bridge over the drina river the subject of a novel by. <unk> and it talks about how in that very troubled part of europe and the balkans over time there 's been enormous building of walls <unk> . more recently in the last decade we begin to see these communities start hesitatingly to come together <unk> . i would argue <unk> again open source security is about connecting. <unk> and lashing it together with strategic communication largely in social networks <unk> . so let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways <unk> . and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls <unk> . now i 'm a sailor. <unk> this is a ship a liner clipping through the indian ocean <unk> what 's wrong with this picture <unk> . it 's got concertina wire along the sides of it that. 's to prevent pirates from attacking it . piracy is a very active threat today around the world <unk> this is in the indian ocean <unk> piracy is also very active. in the strait of malacca. <unk> in the gulf of guinea <unk> we see it in the caribbean it 's a <unk>. <unk> discontinuity in the global. transport system <unk> last year at this time there were twenty vessels <unk> five hundred mariners held hostage <unk> this is. an attack on the global commons we need to think about how to address it let 's shift to a different kind of. <unk> cyber sea <unk> . here are photographs of two young men at the moment they 're incarcerated they conducted a credit card. fraud. that netted them over ten billion dollars <unk> this is part of cybercrime which is a. just under the gdp of great britain <unk> . so this cyber sea which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness is very much under threat as well . another thing i worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking by the movement of narcotics. here coming out of afghanistan through europe over to the united states we worry about cocaine coming from the andean ridge north <unk> . we worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking <unk> above all perhaps we worry about human trafficking and the awful cost of it . trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons. <unk> this is a photograph and i wish i could tell you. that this is a very high tech piece of us navy gear that we 're using to stop the trafficking <unk> . the bad news is <unk> this is a. run by drug cartels it was built in the jungles of south america we caught it with that. low tech raft . laughter and it was carrying six tons of cocaine crew of four sophisticated communications sweep <unk> . this kind of trafficking <unk> in narcotics in humans in weapons god forbid in weapons of mass destruction is part of the threat to the global commons <unk> . and let 's pull it together in. <unk> afghanistan today <unk> this is a field of poppies in afghanistan . eighty to ninety percent of the world 's poppy <unk> opium and heroin comes out of afghanistan <unk> we also see there of course <unk> terrorism . this is where al qaeda is staged from . we also see a very. strong insurgency embedded. <unk> so this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons <unk> and what we must address . so here we are 21st century <unk> we know our <unk>. <unk> tools are not going to work what should we do . i would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. <unk> we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun <unk> . we will need the application of military force when we do it we must do it well and competently . but my thesis is open source security is about international interagency private public connection. pulled together. by this idea of strategic communication. <unk> on the internet <unk> . let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way <unk> . this is afghanistan these are afghan soldiers they are all holding books . you should say that 's odd <unk> i thought i read that. this demographic young men and women in their. when they enter the security forces of afghanistan <unk> why <unk> because the taliban withheld education. during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read so the question is so <unk> why are they all standing there holding books <unk> . the answer is . we are teaching them to read. in literacy courses. by nato in partnership with. <unk> private sector entities in partnership with development agencies . we 've taught well over two hundred thousand afghan security forces to read and write at a basic level. <unk> when you can read and write in afghanistan you will typically put a pen in your pocket <unk> . at the ceremonies when these young men and women graduate they take that pen with great pride and put it in their. <unk> pocket <unk> this is bringing together international. interagency these development agencies and private public to take on this kind of security now. we are also teaching them combat skills of course but i would argue open source. security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect <unk> . here 's another example <unk> this is a us navy warship it. 's called the comfort <unk> . there 's a sister ship called the mercy <unk> . they are hospital ships this one the comfort <unk> operates throughout the caribbean and the coast of south america. conducting patient treatments on a typical cruise they 'll do four hundred thousand patient. <unk> treatments <unk> it is crewed not strictly by military. but by a combination of humanitarian organizations operation hope <unk> project smile other organizations send volunteers . interagency physicians come out they 're all part of this to give you one example of the impact this can have . this little boy. <unk> years old walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the comfort <unk> . when he was fitted over his extremely myopic eyes he suddenly looked up and said. <unk> treatments this. <unk> collaboration with security forces and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way <unk> . here you see. baseball players can you pick out the two us army soldiers in this photograph they. are the two young men on either side of these young boys. this is part of a series of baseball clinics where we have explored collaboration between major league baseball . the department of state who sets up the diplomatic piece of this . military baseball players <unk> who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission <unk> . and they put on clinics throughout latin america and the caribbean in honduras. <unk> in nicaragua . in all of the central american and caribbean nations where baseball is so popular <unk> and it creates security <unk> it shows role models to young men and women. about fitness and about life that i would argue help create security for us . another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief. a us air force helicopter participating after the tsunami in two thousand and four which killed two hundred and fifty thousand people . in each of these major disasters. the tsunami in two thousand and four two hundred and fifty thousand dead <unk> the kashmiri earthquake in pakistan. <unk> the haitian earthquake about three hundred thousand dead <unk> more recently the awful. <unk> combination which struck japan and its nuclear industry in all of these instances we see partnerships. between international actors interagency. <unk> working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster so these are examples of this idea of open source security <unk> . we tie it together increasingly by doing things like this now <unk> you 're looking at this thinking ah . admiral these must be sea lanes of communication <unk> or these might be fiber optic cables no <unk> . <unk> to be involved we talked earlier about the arab spring and the power of all this i 'll give you another example and it 's how you move this message <unk> i gave a talk like this in london a while <unk>. <unk> back about this point i said as i say to all of you i 'm on facebook friend me. <unk> on the wire got picked up in two places in the world finland and indonesia <unk> . the headline was nato admiral needs friends thank you . which i do . laughter and the story was a catalyst and the next morning i had hundreds of facebook friend requests from indonesians and finns. <unk> need a friend and oh by the way what is nato so yeah . we laugh but this is how we move the message and moving that message is how we connect international interagency private public . and these social nets to help create security <unk> . now let me hit a somber note <unk> this is a photograph. <unk> of a brave british soldier he 's in the scots guards he 's standing the watch in helmand in southern afghanistan <unk> . i put him here to remind us <unk> i would not want anyone to leave the room thinking. that we do not need capable competent militaries. who can create real. <unk> military effect that is the core of who we are and what we do and we do it to protect. freedom freedom of speech all the things we treasure in our societies . but you know life is not an on and off switch you don 't have to have a military that is either in hard combat. or is in the barracks <unk> i would argue life is a rheostat you have to dial it in. <unk> as i think about how we create security in this 21st century <unk> there will be times. when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis but there will be many instances as we 've talked about today where our militaries can be part of creating. <unk> i would close by saying that. we heard earlier today about wikipedia i use wikipedia all the time. to look up facts and as all of you appreciate . wikipedia is not created by twelve brilliant people locked in a room writing articles wikipedia every day is tens of thousands. <unk> of people inputting information and every day millions of people withdrawing that information <unk> it 's a perfect image. for the fundamental point that no one of us. is as smart as all of us thinking together no one person no one alliance no one nation no one of us. is as smart as all of us thinking together the vision. <unk> statement of wikipedia. is very simple a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge <unk> my thesis for you. is that by combining. international interagency private public strategic communication together . in this 21st century <unk> we can create the sum of all security <unk> .
