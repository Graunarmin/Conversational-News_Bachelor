 <unk> world is changing in some really profound ways <unk> . and i worry that investors aren 't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change especially when it comes to sustainability. <unk> and by sustainability <unk> i mean the really juicy things like environmental and social issues. and corporate governance <unk> . i think it 's reckless to ignore these things <unk> because doing so can jeopardize future long term returns <unk> . and here 's something that may surprise you the balance of power to really influence sustainability. rests with institutional investors the large investors like pension funds. i believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think better performing than you believe and more important than we can imagine <unk> . let me remind you what we already know <unk> . we have a population that 's both growing and aging we have seven billion souls today heading to ten billion at the end. <unk> we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change. just keep increasing <unk> . now clearly these are environmental and social issues <unk> but that 's not all . they 're economic issues and that makes them relevant to risk and. <unk> and they are really complex and they can seem really far off that the temptation may be to do this bury our heads in the sand and not think about it . resist this if you can don 't do this at home . laughter but it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today. are fit for purpose tomorrow <unk> we know. <unk> when they look at a company and decide whether to invest <unk> they look at financial data metrics like sales growth cash flow market share valuation. you know the really sexy stuff . and these things are fundamental of course <unk> but they 're not enough investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call. water availability <unk> waste. and pollution <unk> just making efficient uses of resources . social includes human capital things like employee engagement and innovation capacity . as well as supply chain management. and labor rights and human rights and governance relates to the. <unk> of companies by their boards and investors see i told you this is the really juicy stuff but esg is the measure. of sustainability and sustainable investing incorporates esg factors. with financial factors into the investment process it means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet. and it means providing capital to users. who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes <unk> . so if sustainability matters financially today and all signs indicate more tomorrow is the private sector paying attention . well the really cool thing. is that most ceos are they started to see sustainability. not just as important but crucial to business success about eighty percent of global ceos see sustainability as the root to growth. in innovation. and leading to competitive advantage in their industries <unk> but ninety three percent see esg as the future or as important to the future of their. <unk> so the views of ceos are clear there 's tremendous opportunity in sustainability <unk> so how are companies actually leveraging. esg to drive hard business results . one example is near and dear to our hearts in two thousand. and twelve state street migrated fifty four applications to the cloud environment and we retired another eighty five . we virtualized our operating system environments <unk> and we completed numerous automation projects. <unk> now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace <unk> and they reduce our real estate footprint <unk> . and they yield savings of twenty three million dollars in operating costs annually <unk> . and avoid the emissions of a one hundred thousand metric tons of carbon that 's the equivalent of taking twenty one thousand. <unk> industrial conglomerate and about a decade ago they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds. in a water business that 's a really big bet why did they do that well with apologies to the home improvement fans. <unk> there 's more growth in water than in power tools . and this company has their sights set on what they call the new new world that 's four billion middle class people demanding food <unk> . energy and water . now . you may be asking yourself are these just isolated cases <unk> i mean come on really do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially. <unk> the answer that may surprise you. is yes <unk> the data shows that stocks with better esg performance. perform just as well as others . in blue we see the msci world it. 's an index of large companies from developed markets across the world and in gold <unk> we see a subset of companies rated as having the best esg performance . over three plus years <unk> . no performance. <unk> so that 's okay right <unk> we want more i want more in some cases there may be outperformance from esg . in blue <unk> . we see the performance of the five hundred largest global companies and in gold <unk> we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management . now over almost eight years they 've outperformed by about two thirds <unk> . so yes this is correlation. <unk> 's not causation <unk> but it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns <unk> so. if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits <unk> wouldn 't this be the norm . are investors particularly institutional investors engaged well some are and a few are really at the vanguard. hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in australia with assets of twenty two billion [ dollars ] . they believe that esg has the potential to impact risks and returns <unk> so incorporating it into the investment process. is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members core to their duty you gotta love the aussies right. <unk> calpers is another example <unk> calpers is the pension fund for public employees in california . and with assets of two hundred and forty four billion [ dollars ] they are the second largest in the u s and the sixth largest in the world <unk> . now they 're moving toward one hundred percent sustainable investment. by systematically integrated esg across the. <unk> entire fund . why . they believe it 's critical to superior long term returns <unk> full stop . in their own words long term value creation requires the effective management. of three forms of capital financial . human <unk> and physical this is why we are concerned with esg . <unk> i do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job and not all of them see it this way <unk> . often i hear we are required to maximize returns so we don 't do that here . or we don 't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements . the one that just really gets under my skin is if you want to do something about that just make money <unk> give the profits to charities. <unk> me clarify something right here . companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet they don 't have indefinite social obligations <unk> and prudent investing and finance theory aren 't subordinate to sustainability <unk> . they 're compatible . so i 'm not talking about tradeoffs here <unk>. <unk> they hold the key the answer quite simply is they have the money . a lot of it <unk> . i mean a really lot of it the global stock market is worth fifty five trillion dollars <unk> the global bond market seventy eight. <unk> a half times the gdp of the u s that 's the world 's largest economy that 's some serious freaking firepower <unk> . so we can reconsider. some of these pressing challenges like fresh water clean air feeding ten billion mouths . if institutional investors integrated esg into investment . what if they used that firepower to. <unk> more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges. or at least not exacerbating them what if we. work and save and invest <unk> only to find that the world we retire into. is more stressed and less secure than it is now what if there isn 't enough clean air and fresh water. a fair question might be what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated <unk> overstated it 's not urgent . something for virtuous consumers. or lifestyle choice well president john f kennedy said something about this that is just. spot on there are risks and costs to a program of action <unk> but they are far less than the. <unk> costs of comfortable. inaction . i can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus . the odds that it 's not completely wrong. are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we 'll get in a car accident well maybe not if you live in boston . laughter but my point is. is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially. in case those things happen right <unk> . so by investing sustainably we 're doing two things we. 're creating insurance reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy <unk> . and at the same time. <unk> you like it i like it too . i like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue <unk> i bet you can 't guess which side i 'm on <unk> . but what i really like about it is that it reminds me of something mark twain said which is plan for the future <unk> because that 's where you 're going to spend the rest of your life.
