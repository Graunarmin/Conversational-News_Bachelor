 <unk> i do two things i design mobile computers and i study brains today 's talk is about brains and yay i have a brain fan out there. if i could have my first slide. <unk> see the title of my talk and my two affiliations <unk> . so what i 'm going to talk about is why we don 't have a good brain theory <unk> why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it i. 'll try to do all that in twenty minutes i have two affiliations <unk> most of you know me from my palm and handspring days <unk> . but i also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the redwood neuroscience institute in menlo park <unk> we study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex works i 'm going. <unk> talk all about that <unk> . i have one slide on my my other life the computer life and that 's this slide here these are some of the products i 've worked on over the last twenty years <unk> starting from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet <unk>. <unk> computers and so on ending up most recently with the treo <unk> and we 're continuing to do this i 've done this because i believe mobile computing is the future of personal computing and i 'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things. <unk> i really didn 't want to do any of these products <unk> very early in my career i decided i was not going to be in the computer industry before that i just have to tell you about this picture of graffiti i picked off the <unk>. <unk> web the other day <unk> i was looking for a picture for graffiti that 'll text input language i found a website dedicated to teachers who want to. <unk> things across the top of their blackboard <unk> and they had added graffiti to it and i 'm sorry about that . <unk> when i was young and got out of engineering school at cornell in <unk>. i went to work for intel and was in the computer industry and three months into that . i fell in love with something else <unk> i said i made the wrong career choice here and i fell in love with brains. <unk> this is not a real brain this is a picture of one a line drawing <unk> and i don 't remember. <unk> i have one recollection which was pretty strong in my mind . in september of one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine scientific american came out with a single topic issue about the brain <unk> it was one of their best issues ever <unk> they talked about the neuron development disease vision and all the things you might want to know about brains it was really quite impressive . one might 've had the impression we knew a lot about brains but the last article in that issue was written by. francis crick of. <unk> and he wrote a story basically saying <unk> this is all well and good. <unk> but you know we don 't know diddly squat about brains and no one has a clue how they work so don 't believe what anyone tells you <unk> . this is a quote from that that article he says what is conspicuously lacking he. 's a very proper british gentleman what is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches i thought the word. <unk> say we didn 't have a theory he says we don 't even know how to begin to think about it we don 't even have a framework <unk> we are in the pre paradigm days if you want to use thomas. kuhn so i fell in love with this i said look we have all this knowledge about brains. how hard can it be it 's something we can work on in my lifetime i could make a difference so i tried to get out of the computer business into the brain business <unk> . first i went to mit the ai lab was there i said i want to build intelligent machines too but i want to study how brains work first. <unk> and they said oh you don 't need to do that you 're just going to program computers that 's all i said you really ought to study brains they said no you 're wrong . i said no you 're wrong and i didn 't get in . laughter i was a little disappointed pretty young but i went back again a few years later this time in california and i went to berkeley and i said i 'll go in from the biological. <unk> you can 't get funded for that and as a graduate student <unk> you can 't do that so i said oh my gosh i was depressed i said but i can make a difference in this field <unk>. <unk> i went back in the computer industry and said i 'll have to work here for a while that 's when i designed all those computer products . <unk> i want to do this for four years make some money <unk> i was having a family <unk> and i would mature a bit and maybe. the business of neuroscience would mature a bit <unk> well it took longer than four years it 's been about sixteen years but i 'm doing it now and i 'm going to tell you about it <unk> . so why should we have a good brain theory. <unk> well there 's lots of reasons people do science the most basic one is people like to know things we 're. <unk> interesting and fascinating . but sometimes a science has other attributes which makes it really really interesting sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves it 'll tell us who we are evolution did this and copernicus did this where we <unk> we have a new understanding of who we are . and after all we are our brains <unk> my brain is talking to your brain our bodies are hanging along for the ride but my brain is talking to your brain <unk> and if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive. <unk> understand brains <unk> . another thing is sometimes science leads to big societal benefits <unk> technologies or businesses or whatever this is one too because when we understand how brains work we 'll be able to build intelligent <unk>. <unk> machines that 's a good thing on the whole with tremendous benefits to society just like a fundamental technology so why don 't we have a good theory of brains people have been working on it for one hundred years <unk>. <unk> like this is normal science . normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists the theorist guy says i think this is what 's going on the experimentalist says you 're wrong it goes back and forth this works <unk>. <unk> in physics this in geology <unk> but if this is normal science what does neuroscience look like this is what neuroscience looks like we have this mountain of data <unk> . <unk> and behavior you can 't imagine how much detail we know about brains <unk> there were twenty eight thousand people who went to the neuroscience conference this year and every one of them is doing research in brains <unk> . a lot of data but no theory there 's a little wimpy box on top there and theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences <unk> and it 's a real shame now why has this come about if you ask neuroscientists why is. <unk> 'll admit it <unk> but if you ask them they say <unk> there 's various reasons we don 't have a good brain theory <unk> some say we still don 't have enough data we need more information there 's all these things we don 't know <unk> . well <unk> i just told you there 's data coming out of your ears we have so much information we don 't even know how to organize it <unk> what good is more going to do maybe we 'll be lucky and discover some magic thing <unk>. but i don 't think so this is a symptom of the fact that we we just don 't have a theory we don 't need more data <unk> we need a good theory . <unk> so complex it 'll take another fifty years i even think chris said something like this yesterday something like it 's one of the most complicated things in the universe that. 's not true you 're more complicated than your brain you 've got a brain <unk> and although the brain looks very complicated things look complicated until you understand them <unk> . that 's always been the case so we can say my neocortex the part of the brain i 'm interested in has thirty billion cells but you know what it 's very. <unk> very regular in fact it looks like it 's the same thing repeated over and over again it 's not as complex as it looks <unk> that 's not the issue . some people say <unk> brains can 't understand brains <unk> very zen like woo . you know it sounds good but why i mean what 's the point it 's just a bunch of cells you understand your liver it 's got a lot of cells in it too . <unk> i don 't think there 's anything to that and finally some people say i don 't feel like a bunch of cells. i. 'm conscious i 've got this experience i 'm in the world <unk> i can 't be just a bunch of cells well people used to believe there was a life force to be to be living and we now know that 's really not. not true at all and there 's really no evidence other than that people just disbelieve that cells can do what they do so some people have fallen into the pit of. <unk> another reason why we don 't have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive <unk> strongly held but incorrect assumption. that has prevented us from seeing the answer <unk> . there 's something we believe that just it 's obvious but it 's wrong now there 's a history of this in science and before i tell you what it is i 'll tell you about the history of it in science. <unk> look at other scientific revolutions the solar system that 's copernicus darwin 's evolution and tectonic plates that 's wegener <unk>. they all have a lot in common with brain science first they had a lot of unexplained data a lot of it but it got more manageable once they had a theory <unk> . the best minds were stumped really really smart people we 're not smarter now than they were then it just turns out it 's really hard to think of things but once you 've thought of them it 's easy to understand. <unk> daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework in kindergarten <unk>. it 's not that hard here 's the apple here 's the orange the earth goes around that kind of stuff. <unk> another thing is the answer was there all along but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing it was an intuitive strongly held belief that was wrong in the case of the. <unk> the idea that the earth is spinning the surface is going a thousand miles an hour and it 's going through the solar system at a million miles an hour this is lunacy <unk> we all know the earth isn 't moving do you feel like you 're moving a thousand miles an hour. if you said earth was spinning around in space and was huge they would lock you up that 's what they did back then <unk> . so it was intuitive and obvious now what about evolution . evolution same thing we taught our kids the bible says god created all these species cats are cats dogs are dogs people are people plants are plants they don 't change. noah put them on the ark in that order blah <unk>. blah the fact is if you believe in evolution <unk> we all have a common ancestor <unk> we all have a common ancestor with the plant in the lobby <unk> . this is what evolution tells us <unk> and it 's true <unk> it 's kind of unbelievable and the same thing about tectonic plates <unk> . all the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top. <unk> what is the intuitive but incorrect assumption . that 's kept us from understanding brains i 'll tell you it 'll seem obvious that it 's correct that 's the point then i 'll make an argument why you 're incorrect on the other assumption <unk> . the intuitive but obvious thing is somehow intelligence is defined by behavior. we 're intelligent because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently and i 'm going to tell you that 's wrong. <unk> work you through this in a few slides and give you an example of what this means <unk> here 's a system <unk> engineers and scientists like to look at systems like this <unk>. <unk> we have a thing in a box we have its inputs and outputs <unk> the ai people said the thing in the box is a programmable computer because it 's equivalent to a brain we 'll feed it some inputs and get it to do something . have some behavior alan turing defined the turing test which essentially says we 'll. <unk> something 's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human. a behavioral metric of what intelligence is that has stuck in our minds for a long time . reality though i call it real intelligence real intelligence is built on something else <unk> we experience the world through a sequence of patterns . and we store them <unk> and we recall them when we recall them we match them up against reality <unk> and we 're making predictions all the time it 's an internal metric there 's an internal metric about us saying do we understand the world am i making predictions and so on. <unk> being intelligent now <unk> but you 're not doing anything maybe you 're scratching yourself <unk> but. you 're not doing anything but you 're being intelligent you 're understanding what i 'm saying because you 're intelligent and you speak english you know the word at the end of this. sentence. the word came to you you make these predictions all the time what i 'm saying is the internal prediction is the. <unk> prediction leads to intelligent behavior here 's how that happens let 's start with a non intelligent brain i 'll argue a non intelligent brain we 'll call it an old brain . and we 'll say it 's a non mammal like a reptile say an alligator we have an alligator <unk> and the alligator has. some very sophisticated senses it 's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on a mouth and a nose <unk> it has very. <unk> it can run and hide it has fears and emotions it can eat you you <unk> it can attack it can. do all kinds of stuff <unk> but we don 't consider. the alligator very intelligent not in a human sort of way <unk> but it has all this complex behavior already now in evolution what happened <unk> . first thing that happened in evolution with mammals is we started to develop a thing called the neocortex <unk> i 'm going to represent the neocortex by this box. <unk> it 's a new layer on top of your brain it 's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn 't fit . laughter literally it 's about the size of a table napkin and doesn 't fit so it 's wrinkly . now <unk> look at how i 've drawn this the old brain is still there you still have that alligator brain <unk> you do it 's your emotional brain it 's all. those gut reactions you have on top of it we have this memory system called the neocortex and the memory system is sitting. <unk> over the sensory part of of the brain <unk> so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain it also goes up into the neocortex <unk> . and the neocortex is just memorizing <unk> it 's sitting there saying. <unk> i 'm going to memorize all the things going on where i 've been people i 've seen things i 've heard and so on . and in the future when it sees something similar to that again . <unk> i 've been here before and when you were here before this happened next <unk> it allows you to predict the future <unk> . it literally feeds back the signals into your brain they 'll let you see what 's going to happen next will let you hear the word sentence before i said it <unk> . and it 's this feeding back into the old brain that will allow you to make more intelligent decisions this is the most. <unk> i recognize this maze <unk> i know which way to go i 've been here before i can envision the future that 's what it 's doing. <unk> this is true for all mammals in humans it got a lot worse humans actually developed the front of the neocortex called the the anterior part of the neocortex. and nature did a little trick it copied the posterior the back part which is sensory and put it in the front humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front but we use it for motor control <unk> . so we 're now able to do very sophisticated motor planning things like that <unk> i don 't have time to explain but to understand how a brain works you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works how it is we. <unk> the next note pops into your head already you anticipate it. moving your doorknob over two inches <unk> when you go home tonight you 'll put your hand out reach for the doorknob notice it 's in the wrong spot. and go whoa something happened it. may take a second <unk> but something happened i can change your doorknob in other ways make it larger smaller <unk> change its brass to silver <unk> make it a lever <unk> i can change the door put colors on put windows in <unk> i can change a thousand things about your door and in the two seconds you take to open. <unk> engineering approach the ai approach to this is to build a door database with all the door attributes <unk> and as you go up to the door we. check them off one at time door door color <unk> we don 't do that <unk> . your brain doesn 't do that your brain is making constant predictions all the time about what will happen in your environment as i put my hand on this table i expect to feel it stop when i walk every. <unk> if i missed it by an eighth of an inch i 'll know something has changed you 're constantly making predictions about your environment i 'll. talk about vision briefly <unk> this is a picture of a woman when we look at people our eyes saccade over two to three times a second we 're not aware of it but our eyes are always moving. when we look at a face we typically go from eye to eye to nose to mouth when your eye moves from eye to eye if there was something else there like a nose <unk> you 'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and go. <unk> you have an expectation of what you 're going to see . every single moment <unk> . and finally let 's think about how we test intelligence we test it by prediction <unk> . what is the next word in this this is to this as this is to this <unk> what is the next number in this sentence here 's three visions of an object what 's the fourth one. that 's how we test it it 's all about prediction. <unk> is the recipe for brain theory first of all we have to have the right framework <unk> . and the framework is a memory framework not a computational or behavior framework it 's a memory framework how do you store and recall these sequences of patterns it. 's spatiotemporal patterns <unk> then <unk> if in that framework you take a bunch of theoreticians biologists generally are not good theoreticians not always but generally there 's not a good history of theory in biology <unk> i 've found the best people to work with are physicists. and mathematicians who tend to think algorithmically <unk> then they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology you have to make these theories very realistic in. anatomical terms anyone who tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn 't tell you exactly how it 's working and how the wiring works. <unk> and i expect to be back on this stage sometime in the <unk> not too distant future to tell you about it i 'm really really excited this is not going to take fifty years <unk>. what will brain theory look like first of all it 's going to be about memory not like computer memory not at all like computer memory it 's very very different. it 's a memory of very high dimensional patterns like the things that come from your eyes <unk> it 's also memory of sequences you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence a song must be heard. in sequence over time <unk> and you must play it back in sequence over time <unk> and these sequences are auto associatively recalled so if i see something i hear something it reminds me of it and it plays back automatically it 's an automatic playback . and prediction of future inputs is the desired output and as i said the theory must be biologically accurate <unk> it must be testable and you must be able to build it if you don 't build it you don. <unk> really build intelligent machines absolutely <unk> and it 's going to be different than people think . no doubt that it 's going to happen in my mind first of all we 're going to build this stuff out of silicon the same techniques we use to build. silicon computer memories we can use here but they 're very different types of memories <unk> and we 'll attach these memories to sensors. <unk> learn about their environment now it 's very unlikely the first things you 'll see are like robots not that robots aren 't useful people can build robots <unk> but the robotics part is the hardest part that 's old brain. that 's really hard the new brain is easier than the old brain so first we 'll do things that don 't require a lot of robotics so you 're not going to see. <unk> see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is what driving is and have learned that. <unk> with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren 't going to turn.
