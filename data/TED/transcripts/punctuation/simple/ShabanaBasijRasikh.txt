 <unk> i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house . my father was listening to bbc news on his small gray radio <unk> . there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly. <unk> depressed him . the taliban are gone my father shouted <unk> . i didn 't know what it meant <unk> but i could see that my father was very very happy . you can go to a real school now he said . a morning that i. <unk> will never forget . a real school . you see i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school . so for the next five years i dressed as a boy. to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school. it was the only way we both could be educated. <unk> each day we took a different route. so that no one would suspect where we were going we. would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping . the school was in a house <unk> more than one. <unk> hundred of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer . we all knew we were risking our lives the teacher <unk> the students and our parents . from time to time the school would suddenly be canceled. for a week because taliban were suspicious . we always wondered what they knew about us were we being followed . do they know where we live . we were scared <unk> but still school was where we wanted to be . i was very lucky to. <unk> grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured . my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time . a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan <unk> he insisted that his daughter my mom . go to school and for that he was disowned by his father <unk> . but my educated mother became a teacher. <unk> there she is . she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood <unk> . and my father. that 's him. he was the first ever in his family to receive an education <unk> . there was no question that his children would. receive an education <unk> including his daughters <unk> . despite the taliban <unk> despite the risks to him <unk> there was greater risk in not. educating his children . during taliban years i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life. and always being scared and not seeing a future i would want to quit <unk> . but my father . he would say . listen my daughter . you can lose everything you own in your life . your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war <unk> but the one thing that will always remain with you. <unk> you is what is here . and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will . so do you still not want to continue . today i am twenty two i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school . and had my family not been so committed to my education i would be one of them <unk> . instead <unk> i stand here a proud graduate of middlebury college. <unk> when i returned to afghanistan <unk> . my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me <unk> . he not only brags about my college degree but also that i was the first woman and that i am the first woman to drive him through. <unk> my family believes in me <unk> i dream big <unk> but my family dreams even bigger for me that 's why. i am a global ambassador for 10x10 a global campaign to educate women . that 's why i cofounded sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan. <unk> a country where it 's still risky for girls to go to school the exciting thing is that i see students at my school. with ambition grabbing at opportunity <unk> . and i see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them. in the face of daunting opposition . like ahmed that 's not his real name <unk> and i cannot show you his face . but ahmed is the father of one of my students . less than a month ago <unk> he. and his daughter. were on on their way from sola to their village and. they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb. by minutes as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him. that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again . kill me now if you wish. <unk> will not ruin my daughter 's future because of your old and backward ideas . what i 've come to realize about afghanistan . and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most most of us who succeed. is a father. <unk> recognizes the value in his daughter. and who sees that her success is his success . it 's not to say that our mothers aren 't key. in our success in fact they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters. <unk> but in the context of a society like in afghanistan we must have the support of men . under the taliban. <unk> girls who went to school. numbered in the hundreds remember it was illegal <unk> . but today <unk> . more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan . <unk> looks so different from here in america <unk> i find that americans see the fragility. in changes <unk> i fear that these changes will not last. much beyond the u s troops ' withdrawal <unk> . but when i am back in afghanistan <unk> when i see. the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them. <unk> i see a promising future. and lasting change . to me afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities <unk> . and every single day the girls of sola remind me of that. <unk> they are dreaming big.
