 <unk> i flew over a crowd of thousands of people in brazil playing music by george <unk> frideric handel. <unk> i also drove along the streets of amsterdam again playing music by this same composer let 's take a look. <unk> all this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons. now you may ask why have i done these things <unk> they 're not really typical for a musician <unk>. well i did it because i fell in love with the music and i wanted to share it with as many people as possible . it started a couple of years ago <unk> i was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the internet a little when i. <unk> found out that handel had written works for the keyboard <unk> . well i was surprised i did not know this so i downloaded the sheet music and started playing . and what happened next was that i entered this state of. pure <unk> unprejudiced amazement it was an experience of being totally in awe of the music. <unk> and i had not felt that in a long time . it might be easier to relate to this when you hear it <unk> the first piece that i played through. started like this. <unk> sounds very melancholic doesn 't it <unk> and i turned the. <unk> and what came next was this. <unk> this sounds very energetic doesn 't it . so within a couple of minutes <unk> and the piece isn 't even finished yet i experienced two very contrasting characters . beautiful melancholy and sheer energy <unk> . and i consider these two elements to be vital. <unk> and the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively <unk> . i 've given a lot of children 's concerts for children of seven. and eight years old <unk> and whatever i play whether it 's bach <unk> beethoven even stockhausen or some jazzy music <unk> . they are open to hear it really willing to listen and they are comfortable. doing so. and when classes come in with children who are just. a few years older eleven twelve <unk> . i felt that i sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that . the complexity of the music does become an issue <unk> and. actually the opinions of others. <unk> they start to count . but the young ones they don 't question their own opinion . they are in this constant state of wonder <unk> and i do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven year old children . even when growing up <unk> . and that is why i have played not only in the concert hall but also on the street online in the. air to feel that state of wonder to truly listen . and to listen without prejudice <unk> and i would like to invite you. to do so now. the. the. the.
