 <unk> does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented . any guesses one thousand eight hundred and sixteen <unk> and what i can say is in two thousand and sixteen <unk> doctors aren 't going to be walking around with. <unk> a whole lot better technology coming <unk> and that 's part of the change in medicine what has changed our society. has been wireless devices <unk> but the future are digital medical. wireless devices <unk> ok <unk> so let me give you some examples of this to kind of make this much more concrete <unk> this is the first one <unk> . this is an electrocardiogram and as a cardiologist to think that you could see in real time a patient an individual anywhere in the world on your. <unk> smartphone <unk> watching your rhythm that 's incredible and it 's with us today <unk> but that 's just the beginning <unk> . you check your email while you 're sitting here . in the future you 're going to be checking all your vital signs <unk> all your vital signs <unk> your heart rhythm your blood pressure your oxygen your. <unk> this is already available today this is airstrip technologies it 's now. wired or i should say wireless by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital in the intensive care unit and putting it on a smartphone for physicians . if you 're an expectant parent <unk> what about the ability to monitor continuously <unk> fetal heart rate or intrauterine contractions <unk> and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy. over into the time of delivery <unk> and then as we go further today we have continuous glucose sensors right now they are under the skin . but in the future . they won 't have to be implanted <unk> . and of course the desired range trying to keep glucose between seventy five and less than two hundred . checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor you 'll see how that can impact diabetes . <unk> and what about sleep we 're going to zoom in on that a little bit we 're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep <unk> what if on your phone <unk> which will be available in the next few weeks you had every minute of your sleep displayed <unk> . and this is of course as you can see the awake is the orange <unk> . the rem sleep rapid eye movement dream state is in light green <unk> and light is gray <unk> light sleep and deep sleep the best restorative sleep <unk> is that dark green. <unk> how about counting every calorie <unk> and this is ability in real time to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure through a band aid . now <unk> what i 've talked about are physiologic metrics but what i want to. get to the next frontier very quickly <unk> and why the stethoscope is on its way out is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds <unk> and the breath sounds. <unk> because now <unk> introduced by g e is a handheld ultra sound . why is this important because this is so much more sensitive . here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound <unk> and also a cardiac echo . which can be sent wireless and then there 's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone <unk> so we 're not just talking about physiologic metrics. the key measurements of vital signs and all those things in physiology. <unk> but also all the imaging. that one could look at in your smartphone now <unk> this is an example of another obsolete technology soon to be buried <unk> the holter monitor. twenty four hour recording <unk> lots of wires <unk> this is now a little tiny patch . you can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail <unk> . now how does this. <unk> or these sensors that one would put on on a shoe or on the wrist <unk> and this sends a signal. and it creates a body area network to a gateway gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway <unk> as today many of these things are dedicated gateways because they are not so well integrated . that signal goes to the web <unk> the cloud and then it can be processed and sent anywhere to a caregiver to a physician <unk> back to the patient. <unk> basically very simplistic technology of how this works now i have this device on i didn 't want to take my. shirt off to show you but i can tell you it 's on this is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm <unk> . as you saw already <unk> but it also goes well beyond that <unk> . this is me now <unk> and. <unk> below that 's the actual heart rate and the trend to the right of that is a bioconductant that 's the fluid status <unk> . fluid status that 's really important if you 're monitoring somebody with heart failure <unk> . and below that 's temperature <unk> . and respiration and oxygen and then the position activity <unk> so this is really striking <unk> because this device. measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure. <unk> and why is this important well this is the most expensive bed . what if we could reduce the need for hospital beds <unk> well <unk> we can first of all heart failure is the number one. reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country <unk> the cost of heart failure is thirty seven billion dollars a. <unk> which is eighty percent related to hospitalization and in the course of thirty days after a hospital stay for a medicare greater than sixty five years or older is twenty seven percent are readmitted in thirty days and by. six months over fifty six percent are readmitted so can we improve that well the idea is we take this device that i 'm wearing <unk> and we put it on six hundred patients with heart failure <unk> . <unk> versus six hundred patients who don 't have active monitoring and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions and that 's exciting and we 'll start that trial <unk> and you 'll hear more about how we 're going to do that <unk> but that 's a. type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead <unk> . why now <unk> why has this all of a sudden become a reality an exciting direction in the future of medicine what we have is in a way a perfect. positive storm this sets up. <unk> that 's where this is all starting <unk> let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you 're not aware of it one point two million americans have gotten a nike shoe <unk>. <unk> which is a body area network that connects the shoe <unk> the sole of the shoe to the iphone or an ipod <unk> and this wired magazine cover article really captured a lot of this it talked a lot about the nike shoe and how quickly that 's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and. <unk> energy expenditure here are some things the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind <unk>. a data driven health revolution promises to make us all better faster and stronger living by numbers and this one which is really telling <unk> this was from july this cover article . the personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise <unk> it 's about tracking every facet of life from sleep to mood to pain. well <unk> i tried this device <unk>. a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life i didn 't have one of those <unk> but i got the fitbit that looks like this it 's like a wireless. accelerometer pedometer and i want to just give you the results of that testing because i wanted to understand about the consumer movement i hope the by the way the phillips direct. <unk> life works better i hope so <unk> . but this monitors food it monitors activity and tracks weight however you have to put in most of this stuff the only thing it really tracks by itself is activity and even then it 's not complete <unk> . so <unk> you exercise and it picks up the exercise you put in your height and weight it calculates bmi and. <unk> course it tells you how many calories you 're expending. from the exercise and how many you took in if you go in and enter all the foods <unk> but it really wants you to enter all your activity and so. i went to this. <unk> and of course i was gratified that it picked up the forty two minutes of exercise elliptical exercise i did but then it wants more information so it says . you want to log sexual activity <unk> how long did you do it. <unk> this doesn 't appear this just doesn 't work i mean this just doesn 't work <unk> . so <unk> now i want to move to sleep <unk> who would ever have thought you could have your own eeg at your home <unk> tagged to a very nice alarm clock by the. way this is the headband that goes with this alarm clock <unk> . it monitors your brainwaves continuously when you 're sleeping so i did this thing for seven. <unk> days getting ready for tedmed <unk> this is an important part of our life one third you 're supposed to be sleeping of course how many here. have any problems with sleeping it 's. usually ninety percent <unk> so you tell me you sleep better than expected. okay well this was a week of my life in sleeping <unk> and you get a z q . <unk> is adjusted to age and you want to get as high as you possibly can so this is the. <unk> sleep and you see that z q there was 80 odd and. the wake time is in orange <unk> and this can be a problem as i learned <unk> because it not only helps you. <unk> your sleep but also tells others you 're awake so when my wife came in and she could <unk> tell. you 're awake eric i want to talk i want to talk and i 'm trying to play possum this thing is very very impressive ok . so that 's the first night and this one is now sixty seven and that 's not a good score <unk> and. <unk> tells you of course how much you had in rem sleep in deep sleep <unk> . and all this sort of thing this was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep so it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group it 's. like a managed competition of sleep <unk> . and. really interesting stuff <unk> look at this thing and say well <unk> i didn 't think i was a very good sleeper. but actually i did better than average in. fifty to sixty year olds ok <unk> and the key thing was what i didn 't know. was that i was a really good dreamer <unk> ok <unk> now let 's move from sleep to diseases eighty percent of. americans have chronic disease or eighty percent of age greater than sixty five have. two or more chronic disease one hundred and forty million americans have one or more chronic disease <unk> and eighty percent of our one point. five whatever trillion expenditures are. <unk> to chronic disease <unk> now diabetes is one of the big ones almost <unk> twenty four million people have diabetes and here is the latest map it was published just a little more than a week ago in the new york times . and it isn 't looking good . that is for men twenty nine percent in the country over sixty have type ii diabetes and women although it 's less it 's terribly high . but of course we have a way to measure that now on. <unk> continuous basis with a sensor that detects blood glucose and it 's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn 't be known <unk> and also hypoglycemia and you can see the red <unk>. <unk> dots in this particular patient 's case were finger sticks which would have missed both ends <unk> . <unk> is being able to move this to a band aid type phenomenon and that 's not so far away <unk> . so let me just give you very quickly ten top targets for wireless medicine . all these things are possible some of them are very close or already <unk> as you heard are available today in some way or form alzheimer 's disease <unk> . there 's five million people affected and you can check vital signs activity balance asthma. <unk> we could detect things like pollen count air quality respiratory rate breast cancer i 'll show you an example of that real quickly <unk> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <unk> depression there 's a <unk>. <unk> great approach to that in mood disorders <unk> diabetes i 've just mentioned heart failure we already talked about hypertension seventy four million people could have continuous blood pressure monitoring to to come up with much better management and prevention. <unk> and obesity we already talked about the ways to get to that and sleep disorders <unk> this is effective around the world the access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary <unk> and this <unk>. article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people more quickly than any previous technology and that 's before we got going. <unk> the problem is enormous <unk> three hundred thousand broken hips per year <unk> but the solutions are extraordinary and they include so many different things one of the ones i just wanted to mention <unk> . the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling . <unk> seniors the pharmaceutical arena changes <unk> . the full spectrum of disease i hope i 've given you a sense of that across the globe there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process . one of them we 're very fortunate is to develop a dedicated institute and that 's work that started with the work that scripps. with qualcomm <unk> and then the great fortune of meeting up with gary and mary west to get behind this wireless health. <unk> institute <unk> san diego is an extraordinary place for this there 's over six hundred and fifty wireless companies <unk> one hundred of which or more are working in wireless health. <unk> it 's the number one source of commerce <unk> and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over five hundred life science companies <unk> the wireless. institute the west wireless health institute is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening. gary and mary west and i 'd like to give it up for them for getting behind. this their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible <unk> and. this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open it looks like this this whole building dedicated <unk> and what it 's trying to do is accelerate this era to take unmet medical needs to work and innovate. <unk> we just appointed the chief engineer mehran mehregany it was announced on monday then to move up with development . clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice the most challenging thing of all <unk> requiring attention to reimbursement <unk> healthcare policy healthcare economics the other big <unk>. <unk> thing besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance. <unk> guidance <unk> and that 's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital if we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping <unk>. that 's big because what it does is allow a convergence like we 've never had before over eighty major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level <unk> but this is quite extraordinary. <unk> more has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man <unk> . and when you put that together with for example now an app for the iphone with your genotype to guide drug therapy <unk> but the future. we can now tell who 's going to get type ii diabetes from all the common variants and that 's going to get filled in more with low frequency variants in the future we can tell who 's going to get breast cancer. from the various genes we can also know who 's likely to get atrial fibrillation. <unk> and finally <unk> another example sudden cardiac death <unk> each of these has a sensor we can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it . we can prevent or have the earliest detection possible for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient. <unk> thousand people a year in the u s from sudden cardiac death <unk> so <unk> i hope i 've convinced you of this of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive. across all these different diseases and more it 's really taking individualized individualized medicine to a new height and it <unk>. and i think it represents the black swan of medicine thanks for your attention.
