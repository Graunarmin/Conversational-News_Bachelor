 <unk> know if you 've heard about it newspapers it 's a sort of. you know what they say they say the print media is dying who says that well the media but. this is no news right <unk> you 've read about it. already . ladies and gentlemen the world has gotten smaller. <unk> i know it 's a cliche but look look how small . how tiny it has gotten and you know the reason why of course this is because of technology. yeah . any computer designers in the room . yeah well. <unk> are making my life miserable because. track pads used to be round <unk> a nice round shape that makes a good cartoon <unk> but what are you going to do with a flat track pad <unk> those square things <unk> . there 's nothing i can do as a cartoonist . well i know the world is flat now . that 's true and the internet has reached every corner of the world <unk> the poorest the remotest places . every village in africa now has a cyber cafe. don 't go asking for a frappuccino there . so we are bridging the digital divide the third world is connected <unk> we are connected <unk> . and what happens next <unk> well <unk> you 've got mail. <unk> yeah well the internet has empowered us it has empowered you it has empowered me. and it has empowered some other guys as well . laughter you know these last two cartoons i did them live during a conference in hanoi. <unk> were not used to that in in. communist two point zero. vietnam so i was cartooning live on a on a wide screen it was quite a sensation and then this guy came to me he was. taking pictures of me and of my sketches and i thought this is great a vietnamese fan and as he came the second day. on the third day i finally understood the guy was actually on duty <unk> . so by now there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files. of the vietnamese police no but it. 's true the internet has changed the world it has rocked the music industry. <unk> it has changed the way we consume music for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store to steal it . and it has changed the way your future employer. will look at your application so be careful with that. facebook account your momma told you be careful <unk>. <unk> it has liberated us from the office desk <unk> this is your life <unk> . enjoy it . laughter in short technology the internet they have changed our. <unk> like this man that a german magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century they are shaping the way we do things they are shaping the way. we consume they are shaping our very desires. <unk> has even changed our relationship to god . now i shouldn 't get into this religion and political cartoons as you may have heard <unk> . make a difficult couple ever since that day. of two thousand and five when a bunch of cartoonists in denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world. demonstrations fatwa <unk> they provoked violence <unk> people died in the violence <unk> this was so sickening <unk> people died. because of cartoons <unk> i mean. i had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used. by both sides actually <unk> they were used first by a danish newspaper which wanted to make a point on islam. <unk> cartoonist told me he was one of the twenty four who received the assignment to draw the prophet twelve of them refused did you know that . he told me nobody has to tell me what i should draw <unk> this is not how it works . and then of course they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side they wanted to stir up controversy you know the story. <unk> we know that cartoons can be used as weapons history tells us they 've been used. by the nazis to attack the jews and here we are now . in the united nations half of the world is pushing to penalize the offense to religion. they call it the defamation of religion while the other half of the world is fighting back in defense of freedom of speech <unk> so. the clash of civilizations is here. <unk> cartoons are at the middle of it this got me thinking now you see me thinking. at my kitchen table and. since you 're in my kitchen please meet my wife . in two thousand and six a few months after <unk> i went ivory coast. western africa now <unk> talk of a divided place the country was cut in two you had a rebellion in the north <unk> the government in the south the capital abidjan. and in the middle <unk> the french army <unk> this looks like a giant hamburger you don 't want to be. the ham in the middle <unk> . i was there to report on that story. in cartoons i 've been doing this for the last. fifteen years it 's my side job if you want so you see the style is different this is. more serious than maybe editorial cartooning <unk> i went to places like. gaza during the war in two thousand and nine <unk> so this is really. journalism in cartoons you 'll hear more and more about it this is the future of journalism i think <unk> . and of course i went to see the rebels in the north. <unk> those were poor guys fighting for their rights there was. an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in africa <unk> and i went to see the dozo the dozo <unk> they are the traditional hunters. of west africa <unk> people fear them they help the rebellion a lot <unk> they are believed to have magical powers they can disappear. <unk> i went to see a dozo chief he told me about his magical powers <unk> he said i can chop your head off. right away and bring you back to life i said well maybe we don 't have time for this. right now another time so back in abidjan i was given a chance. to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and i thought yes. <unk> context like this cartoons can really be used as weapons. against the other side <unk> i mean <unk> the press in ivory coast was bitterly divided it was compared. to the media in rwanda before the genocide. so imagine <unk> and what can a cartoonist do sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see and the guy has to feed his family right. <unk> so. the idea was pretty simple we brought together cartoonists from all sides. in ivory coast we took them away from their newspaper for three days <unk> and i asked them to. do a project together <unk> tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons yes in cartoons <unk> show. <unk> it 's a great tool of communication for bad or for good . and cartoons can cross boundaries as you have seen and humor is a good way i think to address serious issues <unk> . and. i 'm very proud of what they did i mean they didn 't agree with each other that was not the point <unk> . and i didn 't ask them to do nice cartoons <unk> the first day they were even shouting at each other but they came up with a book <unk> looking back. at thirteen years. <unk> of political crisis in ivory coast <unk> . so the idea was there and i 've been doing projects like this . in two thousand and nine in lebanon <unk> this year in kenya back in january in lebanon it was not a book the idea was to. have the same principal a divided country take cartoonists from all sides and let them do something. <unk> we enrolled the newspaper editors <unk> and we got them to publish. eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page addressing the issue affecting lebanon like religion in. politics and everyday life and it worked for three days <unk> almost all the newspapers of beirut published all those cartoonists together. <unk> you name it <unk> so this was a great project and then in kenya what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity which is a poison. in a lot of places in africa <unk> and we did video clips. you can see them if you go to youtube. <unk> for freedom of speech is easy here <unk> but. as you have seen in contexts of repression or division <unk> again what can a cartoonist do he has to. to keep his job. <unk> well i believe that in any context anywhere . he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred and that 's the message. i try to convey to them <unk> i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing <unk> . but we need to support these. <unk> tech companies are the world 's largest editors they decide what is too offensive or too provocative for you to see . so really it 's not about the freedom of cartoonists <unk> it 's about your freedoms . and. for dictators all over the world <unk> . the good news is when. <unk> cartoonists journalists and activists shut up.
