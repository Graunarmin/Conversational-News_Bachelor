 <unk> i grew up with my identical twin who. was an incredibly loving brother . now one thing about being a twin is it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism if his cookie. <unk> was even slightly bigger than my cookie i had questions <unk> and clearly i wasn 't starving . when i became a psychologist <unk> . i began to notice favoritism of a different kind <unk> and that is how much more we value the body. than we do the mind i spent nine years at university. earning my doctorate in psychology <unk> and i can 't tell you how many people look at my business card and say oh a psychologist <unk> . so not a real doctor . as if it should say that on my card. everywhere <unk> i recently was at a friend 's house and <unk>. was getting ready for bed <unk> he was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell <unk> . he cried for a minute but then he got back up got back on the stool and reached out for a box of. <unk> to put one on his cut . now . this kid could barely tie his shoelaces <unk> but he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn 't become infected and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day . we all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene <unk> right we 've known it. since we were five years old but what do we know about maintaining our psychological health. <unk> well <unk> nothing what do we teach our children about emotional hygiene <unk> . nothing how is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth. than we do our minds why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health. <unk> psychological injuries. even more often than we do physical ones injuries like failure. or rejection or loneliness and they can also get worse if we ignore them <unk> . and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways. <unk> and yet even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries . we don 't <unk> . it doesn 't. <unk> even occur to us that we should oh you 're feeling depressed just shake it off it 's all in your head . can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg oh just walk it off it 's all in your leg . it is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological. <unk> time we made them more equal . more like twins <unk> . speaking of which my brother is also a psychologist <unk> so he 's not a real doctor either . we didn 't study together though in fact <unk> the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life. is move across the atlantic to new york city to get my doctorate in psychology <unk> we were apart then for the first time. <unk> in our lives and the separation was brutal for both of us <unk> but while he remained among family and friends i was alone in a new country <unk> . we missed each other terribly but international phone calls were really expensive then and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week. when our birthday rolled around it was the first we wouldn 't be spending together we. <unk> to splurge and that week <unk> we would talk for ten minutes i spent the morning pacing around my room waiting for him to call. and waiting . and waiting <unk> but the phone didn 't ring <unk> given the time difference i assumed ok he 's out with friends he 'll call later there were no cell. <unk> i began to realize that after being away for over ten months <unk> he no longer missed me. the way i missed him i knew he would call in the morning but. that night. was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life . i woke up the next morning <unk> i glanced down at the phone and i realized i had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. i stumbled out of bed <unk> i put the phone back on the receiver <unk> and it rang a second later <unk> . and it was my brother <unk> and boy was he pissed . laughter it was the saddest and longest night of his life as well now . i tried to explain what happened but he said i don 't understand if you saw i wasn 't calling you why didn 't you just pick up the phone and call me. <unk> he was right <unk> . why didn 't i call him i didn 't have an answer then <unk> but i do today <unk> and it 's a simple one . loneliness . loneliness creates a deep psychological wound . one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking <unk> it makes us believe that those around us. <unk> care much less than they actually do . it make us really afraid to reach out because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand . i was in the grips of real loneliness back then but. i was surrounded by people all day so it never occurred to me <unk> but loneliness is defined purely subjectively. it depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you and i did <unk> . there is a lot of research on loneliness and all of it. is horrifying loneliness won 't just make you miserable it will kill you i 'm not. <unk> chronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death by fourteen percent <unk> fourteen percent . loneliness causes high blood pressure <unk> . high cholesterol it even suppress the functioning of your immune system <unk> making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases . in fact scientists have concluded that taken together <unk> chronic loneliness poses as significant a risk for your. as cigarette smoking now <unk> cigarette packs come with warnings saying this could kill you . but loneliness doesn 't . and that 's why it 's so important that we prioritize our psychological health that we practice emotional hygiene <unk> . because you can 't treat a psychological wound if you don 't even know you 're injured . loneliness. <unk> isn 't the only psychological wound that distorts our perceptions and misleads us failure. does that as well <unk> . i once visited a day care center <unk> where i saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys <unk> . you had to slide the red button <unk> and a cute doggie would pop out . one little girl tried pulling the purple button <unk> then pushing it. <unk> and then she just sat back and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling . the little boy next to her watched this happen then turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it . meanwhile another little girl tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button the cute doggie popped out . and she squealed with delight . so three toddlers with identical. <unk> plastic toys <unk> but with very different reactions to failure <unk> the first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button <unk> . the only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind. tricked them into believing they could not now <unk> adults get tricked this way as well all. <unk> we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure <unk> . you need to be because if your mind tries to convince you you 're incapable of something <unk> and you believe it . then like those two toddlers you 'll begin to feel helpless. and you 'll stop trying too soon or you won 't even try at all and then you 'll be even more convinced you can 't succeed. <unk> succeed <unk> . you see that 's why so many people function below their actual potential <unk> . because somewhere along the way sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn 't succeed <unk> and they believed it . once we become convinced of something it 's very difficult to change our mind . i learned that lesson the hard way when i was a teenager with my brother we were driving with friends down a. <unk> road at night when a police car stopped us there had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects <unk> the officer approached the car <unk> and shined his flashlight on the driver . then on my brother in the front seat <unk> and then on me <unk> and his eyes opened wide and he said where have i seen your face before. <unk> but that made no sense to him whatsoever so now he thought i was on drugs . laughter so he drags me out of the car he searches me <unk> he marches me over to the police car <unk> and only when he verified i didn 't have a police record could i show him i had a twin in the front. <unk> even as we were driving away you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that i was getting away with something . our mind is hard to change once we become convinced so it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail <unk> but you cannot. allow yourself to become convinced you can 't succeed <unk> you have to fight feelings of. <unk> you have to gain control over the situation and you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins [ stop emotional bleeding ]. our minds and our feelings. they 're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were . they 're more like a really moody friend who can be totally supportive one minute . and really unpleasant the next <unk> i once worked with this woman who after twenty years marriage. and an extremely ugly divorce. was finally ready for her first date she had met this guy online and he seemed nice and he seemed successful and most importantly he seemed really into her . so she was very excited she bought a new dress and they met at an upscale new york city bar for a drink . ten minutes into the date the man stands up and says i 'm not interested and walks out. rejection. is extremely painful . the woman was so hurt she couldn 't move all she could do was call a friend. here 's what the friend said . well <unk> what do you expect . you have big hips you have nothing interesting to say <unk> why would a handsome successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you. <unk> friend could be so cruel <unk> but it would be much less shocking if i told you it wasn 't the friend who said that it. 's what the woman said to herself <unk> . and that 's something we all do <unk> . especially after a rejection we all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings what we wish we were what we wish we weren 't we call ourselves names maybe not as harshly <unk> but we all do it. 's interesting that we do because. our self esteem is already hurting <unk> . why would we want to go and damage it even further <unk>. <unk> we wouldn 't make a physical injury worse on purpose you wouldn 't get a cut on your arm and decide oh i know i 'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper i can make it . but we do that with psychological injuries. <unk> all the time why because of poor emotional hygiene <unk> because we don 't prioritize our psychological health <unk> . we know from dozens of studies that when your self esteem is lower <unk> you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety that failures and rejections hurt more <unk> and it takes longer to recover from them . so when you get rejected the first thing you should be doing is to revive your. <unk> join fight club and beat it into a pulp when you 're in emotional pain treat yourself with the same compassion. you would expect from a truly good friend [ protect your self esteem ]. we have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them <unk> and one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination . to ruminate means to chew over it 's when your boss yells at you or your professor makes you. <unk> feel stupid in class or you have big fight with a friend. and you just can 't stop replaying the scene in your head for days <unk> sometimes for weeks on end . now <unk> ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit <unk> and it 's a very costly one . because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts <unk> you are actually putting yourself at significant risk. <unk> for developing clinical depression <unk> alcoholism <unk> eating disorders and even cardiovascular disease <unk> . the problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important so it 's a difficult habit to stop. <unk> i know this for a fact <unk> because a little over a year ago <unk> i developed the habit. <unk> you see my twin brother. was diagnosed with stage three non hodgkin 's lymphoma . his cancer was extremely aggressive he had visible tumors all over his body . and he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy <unk> . and i couldn 't stop thinking about what he was going through <unk> i couldn 't stop thinking about how much he was suffering . even though. he never complained. <unk> once he had this incredibly positive attitude his psychological health was amazing <unk> . i was physically healthy <unk> but psychologically i was a mess <unk> . but i knew what to do studies tell us that even a <unk> two minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in. <unk> and so each time i had a worrying upsetting negative thought i forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed . and within one week <unk> my whole outlook changed and became more positive. and more hopeful [ battle negative thinking ]. nine weeks after he started chemotherapy my brother had a cat scan <unk> and i was by his side when he got the results. <unk> all the tumors were gone he still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go but we knew he would recover this picture. was taken two weeks ago. <unk> by taking action when you 're lonely by changing your responses to failure by protecting <unk>. by battling negative thinking <unk> you won 't just heal your psychological wounds. you will build emotional resilience <unk> you will thrive . a hundred years ago <unk> people began practicing personal hygiene <unk> . and life expectancy rates rose by over fifty percent in just a matter of decades <unk> . i believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically. <unk> if we all began practicing emotional hygiene <unk> can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier . if there were less loneliness and less depression if people knew how to overcome failure . if they felt better about themselves and more empowered if they were happier and more fulfilled . i can because that 's the world i want to live in <unk> . and that 's the world my brother. wants to live in as well. and if you just become informed and change a few simple habits well. that 's the world we can all live in thank you very much.
