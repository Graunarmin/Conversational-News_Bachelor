 <unk> we look around the media as we see on the news from iraq afghanistan sierra leone <unk> and the conflict seems. incomprehensible to us <unk> and that 's certainly how it seemed to me when i started this project <unk> but as a physicist i thought <unk> well if you give me some. <unk> data i could maybe understand this you know give us a go <unk> so as a naive new zealander i thought well i 'll go to the pentagon . can you get me some information . so i had to think a little harder <unk> . and i was watching the news one night in oxford <unk> and i looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice <unk> and i saw that there was information there . <unk> data within the streams of news that we consume all this noise around us actually has information. so what i started thinking was perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here if we can get enough of these streams of information together <unk> . we can perhaps start to understand the war. so this is exactly what i did we started bringing a team together an interdisciplinary team of scientists of economists. we brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this <unk>. we did it in three steps the first step we did was to collect <unk> we did one hundred and thirty different sources of information from ngo reports to newspapers and cable news. we brought this raw data in and we filtered it <unk> we extracted the key bits on information to build the database <unk>. that database contained the timing of attacks the location the size and the weapons used it 's all. <unk> in the streams of information we consume daily <unk> we just have to know how to pull it out and once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff what if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks <unk> what would that tell us. so we started doing this and you can see here on the horizontal axis you 've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack <unk> and on the vertical. <unk> axis you 've got the number of attacks . so we plot data for sample on this you see some sort of random distribution perhaps sixty seven attacks one person was killed or forty seven attacks where seven people were killed <unk>. we did this exact same thing for iraq and we didn 't know for iraq what we were going to find it turns out what we found was pretty surprising . you take all of the conflict all of the chaos all of the noise <unk> and out of that. comes this precise mathematical distribution of the. <unk> way attacks are ordered in this conflict this blew our mind why should a conflict like iraq have this. as its fundamental signature <unk> why should there be order in war <unk> we didn 't really understand that we thought. maybe there is something special about iraq so we looked at a few more conflicts <unk> we looked at colombia we looked at afghanistan <unk> and we looked at senegal and the same pattern. emerged in each conflict this wasn 't supposed to happen these are different wars with different religious factions different political factions <unk> . and different socioeconomic problems and yet the fundamental patterns underlying them. are. the same. so we went a little wider. <unk> we looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on from peru to indonesia we. <unk> studied this same pattern again <unk> and we found. that not only were the distributions these straight lines <unk> but the slope of these lines they clustered around this value of alpha equals two point five <unk> . and we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack what we 're saying here. is the probability of an attack killing x number of people in a country like iraq is equal to a constant. <unk> times the size of that attack <unk> raised to the power of negative alpha <unk> and negative alpha is the slope of that line i showed you before. so what . this is data statistics what does it tell us about these conflicts that was a challenge we had to face as physicists how do we explain. <unk> and what we really found was that alpha if we think about it is the organizational structure of the insurgency . alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks <unk> which is really the distribution. of the group strength carrying out the attacks so we look at a process of group dynamics coalescence and fragmentation . groups coming together <unk> groups breaking apart <unk> and we start running the numbers on this can we simulate it can we create the kind of patterns that we 're seeing. in places like iraq. <unk> iraq turns out we kind of do a reasonable job <unk> we can run these simulations we can recreate this using a process of group dynamics. to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world <unk> . so what 's going on <unk> why should these different seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns now what i believe is going on is. <unk> that. the insurgent forces they evolve over time they adapt <unk> . and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy <unk> and if you don 't find that solution as an insurgent force . you don 't exist <unk> so every insurgent force that is ongoing <unk> every conflict that is ongoing it 's going to look something like this <unk> . <unk> we think is happening <unk> . taking it forward <unk> how do we change it <unk> how do we end a war like iraq what does it look like . alpha is the structure it 's got a stable state at two point five this is what wars look like. when they continue we 've got to change that . we can push it up the forces become more fragmented there is more of them <unk> but they are weaker or. we push it down they 're more robust there is less groups. but perhaps you can sit and talk to them. <unk> structure of the insurgency.
