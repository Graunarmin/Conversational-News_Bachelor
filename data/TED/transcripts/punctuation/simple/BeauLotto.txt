 <unk> this game is very simple all you have to do is read what you see <unk> right <unk> so i 'm going to count to you so we don 't all do it. <unk> are you reading there are no words there <unk> i said read what you 're seeing <unk> right <unk> it literally says. 's because perception is grounded in our experience <unk> right <unk> . the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it which means we never see what 's there we never see information we only ever see what was useful to see in the past all. right which means when it comes to perception we 're all like this frog. <unk> when things don 't go our way we get a little bit annoyed right <unk> but we 're talking about perception here right <unk> . and perception underpins everything we think we know we believe our hopes our dreams the clothes we wear falling in love everything begins with perception . now if perception is grounded in our history it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before but actually it 's a tremendous problem. <unk> because how can we ever see differently <unk> . now <unk> . i want to tell you a story about seeing differently <unk> and all new perceptions begin in the same way they begin with a question . the problem with questions is they create uncertainty now uncertainty is a very bad thing it 's evolutionarily a bad thing if you 're not sure that 's a predator it 's too late . <unk> even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty right. if you go down below on a boat <unk> your inner ears are you telling you you 're moving your eyes because it 's moving in register with the boat say i 'm standing still your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information and it gets ill . the question why is one of the most dangerous things you can do because it takes you. <unk> and yet the irony is the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space <unk> so how can we ever do anything new well fortunately <unk> . evolution has given us an answer <unk> right <unk> and it enables us to address even the most difficult. of questions the best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty they 're the ones that question the things we. <unk> easy to ask questions about how did life begin or what extends beyond the universe <unk> but to question what you think to be true already. is really stepping into that space <unk> so what is evolution 's answer. to the problem of uncertainty <unk> it 's play <unk> . now play is not simply a process experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being . play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . uncertainty is what makes. <unk> play fun <unk> right <unk> it 's adaptable to change <unk> right it opens possibility <unk> . and it 's cooperative it 's actually how we do our social bonding and it 's intrinsically motivated what that means is that we play to play play is its own reward . now if you look at these five ways of being these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist. <unk> is not defined by the method section of a paper it 's actually a way of being which is here and this is true for anything that is creative so. if you add rules to play you have a game that 's actually what an experiment is . so armed with these two ideas that science is a way of being. <unk> because they 're experts in play <unk> . so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon <unk> and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently <unk> . but through the process of science to see themselves differently. <unk> right <unk> . the first step was to ask a question <unk> now <unk> i should say that we didn 't get. <unk> funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn 't make a useful contribution to science and the teachers said kids couldn 't do it . so we did it anyway right . of course <unk> so here are some of the questions i put them in small print so you wouldn 't bother reading it point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with. were actually the basis of science publication the last five to fifteen years <unk> right <unk> so they were asking. <unk> questions that were significant to expert scientists . now here <unk> i want to share the stage with someone quite special <unk> right <unk> she was one of the young people who was involved in this study and she 's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world <unk> . right <unk> she will now once she comes onto stage will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted . <unk> and asking questions is about courage <unk> now she is the personification of courage because she 's going to stand up here and talk to you all so amy would you please come up . so amy 's going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project <unk> and first she 's going to. <unk> easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think <unk> because we look alike <unk> but we wondered if there 's a possible link. with other animals it 'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar <unk> since they seem so different from us <unk> . so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way really we wanted to know if bees. can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions <unk> so. what if bees can think like us well it. 'd be amazing since we 're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells <unk> . but it actually makes a lot of sense they should because bees like us can recognize a good flower. <unk> was to design an experiment <unk> which is a game <unk> so the kids went off and they designed this experiment and so well game and so amy can you tell us what the game was and the puzzle that you set the bees ao the. puzzle we came up with was. <unk> to a certain color flower only when it 's in a certain pattern . they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow <unk> . now there 's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle <unk> the interesting question is which what. was really exciting about this project was we and beau had no idea whether it would work. <unk> completely new and no one had done it before including adults bl . including the teachers <unk> . and that was really hard for the teachers it 's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he 's doing because that 's what we do in the lab but for a teacher not to know what 's going to happen at the end of the day so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick who was the collaborator on. <unk> i 'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read read about it but the next step is observation <unk> so here are some of the students. doing the observations they 're recording the data of where the bees fly. <unk> so we 've got our observations we 've got our data they do the simple. mathematics averaging etc etc <unk> and now we want to share that 's the next step so we 're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication <unk> . right <unk> so we have to write it up so we go of course to the pub. <unk> the one on the left is mine <unk> okay . now i tell them a paper has four different sections an introduction a methods a results a discussion the introduction says <unk> what 's the question and why methods what did you do results what was the <unk>. <unk> observation <unk> and the discussion is who cares <unk> right <unk> that 's a science paper basically . <unk> i put it into a narrative <unk> which means that this paper is written in kidspeak it 's not written by me it 's written by amy. and the other students in the class . as a consequence this science paper begins once upon a time . the results section it says training phase the puzzle duh duh duuuuuhhh right and the methods it says then we put the bees. <unk> this is a science paper we 're going to try to get it published <unk> . so here 's the title page <unk> we have a number of authors there all the ones in bold are eight to ten years old . the first author is blackawton primary school because if it were ever referenced it would be blackawton et al . and not one individual so we submit it to a public access journal <unk> and it says this it said many things but it said this i 'm afraid the. <unk> get it reviewed <unk> . so i sent it to dale purves who is at the national academy of science one of the leading neuroscientists in the world <unk> and he says this is the most original science paper i have ever read . and it certainly deserves wide exposure larry maloney expert in vision says the paper is magnificent the work would be publishable if done by adults . <unk> do we send it back to the editor they say no <unk> . so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists right <unk> putting in the references . and we submit it to biology letters <unk> . and there <unk> it was reviewed by five independent referees <unk> and it was published. <unk> it took four months to do the science <unk> two years to get it published . typical science actually <unk> right <unk> . so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world what was the feedback like . well <unk> it was published two days before. <unk> thirty thousand times in the first day <unk> right. <unk> it was the editors ' choice in science which is a top science magazine <unk> . it 's forever freely accessible by biology letters it 's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal . last year it was the second most downloaded paper by biology letters <unk> . and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well <unk> and i 'll just read. <unk> i have read ' blackawton bees ' recently i don 't have words to explain exactly how i am feeling right now what you guys have done is real true and amazing <unk> curiosity interest innocence and zeal are the most basic and most <unk>. <unk> important things to do science who else can have these qualities more than children please congratulate your children 's team from my side . <unk> about taking risks so this is an incredible risk right for me not for him <unk> right because we 've only done this once before. <unk> we 're going to do a little demonstration <unk> right <unk> you have to close your eyes <unk> and you have to point where you hear me clapping. <unk> one more time everyone over there shout where 's the sound coming from. <unk> science does for us right <unk> we normally walk through life responding but if we ever want to do anything different we have to step into uncertainty <unk> . when he opened his eyes <unk> he was able to see the world in a new way that 's what science offers us <unk> it offers the possibility to step on uncertainty. through the process of play right now <unk> true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice so i 've asked amy. to be the last voice in this short story so amy ao . this project was really exciting for me because it brought the process of discovery to life and it. showed me that anyone and i mean anyone has the potential to discover something new and that. a small question can lead into a big. <unk> changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy. or hard it all depends on the way the person feels about change <unk> but changing the way i thought about science was. surprisingly easy once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle <unk> i then realized that science isn 't just a boring subject <unk> . and that anyone can discover something new . you just need an opportunity.
