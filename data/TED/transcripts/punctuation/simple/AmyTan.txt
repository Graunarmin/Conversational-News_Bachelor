 <unk> the value of nothing . out of nothing comes something . that was an essay i wrote when i was eleven years old and i got a b + what. i 'm going to talk about nothing out of something <unk> and how we create <unk> and i 'm gonna try and do that within the. <unk> time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually . something that creates a near death experience but near death is good for creativity ok . so i also want to explain because dave eggers said he was. <unk> if i said anything that was a lie or not true to universal creativity and i 've done it this way for half the audience who is scientific <unk> when i say we i don <unk>. <unk> 't mean you necessarily i mean me and my right brain my left brain and the one that 's in between that is the censor and tells me what i 'm saying is wrong <unk> . <unk> started even earlier than the moment in which i 'm creating something new <unk> and that includes. nature and nurture <unk> and what i refer to as nightmares <unk> now in the nature area we. look at whether or not we are innately equipped with. <unk> perhaps in our brains some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect <unk> and. some people would say that we 're born with it in some other means and. others like my mother would say that i get my material from past lives . some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk van gogh. <unk> syndrome that you have a little bit of you know . psychosis or depression i do have to say somebody i read read recently that van gogh wasn 't really necessarily psychotic that he might have had temporal lobe seizures <unk> . and that might have caused his spurt of creativity and i don 't. i suppose it does something in some part of your brain and i will. <unk> mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures. a number of years ago but it was during the time i was writing my last book and some people say that book is. is quite different . i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis you know <unk> who am i why am i this particular person why am i not black like everybody else . <unk> you 're equipped with skills but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity <unk> i used to draw i thought i would be an artist and i had a miniature poodle <unk> and it <unk>. <unk> wasn 't bad but it wasn 't really creative because all i could really do was represent in a very one on one way and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book. you know you look at those scores and it wasn 't bad but it. was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words also one of the principles of. creativity is to have a little childhood trauma <unk> and. i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had and that is that. <unk> on me that figure right there by the way <unk> . figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age . i have some ones that were long lasting from the age of five to fifteen this was supposed to be my side. <unk> and it led to a sense of failure <unk> but actually there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about fourteen <unk> and it was discovered that my brother <unk>. <unk> and then my father <unk> six months later had brain tumors <unk> . and my mother believed that something had gone wrong and she was gonna find out what it was <unk> and she was gonna fix it . my father was a baptist minister <unk> and he believed in miracles and that god 's will. <unk> would take care of that but of course they ended up dying <unk> six months apart <unk> and after that my mother believed that it was fate or curses <unk>. why this would have happened everything except randomness she did not believe in randomness <unk> there was a reason for everything and one of the reasons she thought was that her mother who had died when she was very young. <unk> was angry at her <unk> and so i had this notion of death all around me because my mother also believed that i would be next and she would be next and when you <unk>. <unk> are faced with the prospect of death very soon you begin to think very much about everything you become very creative in a. <unk> to my big questions and they 're the same ones that i have today <unk> and they are why do things happen <unk> . and how do things happen <unk> and. the one my mother asked how do i make things happen <unk> . it 's a wonderful way to look at these questions when you write a story because after all in that framework between page one. page one and three hundred you have to answer this question of. why things happen how things happen in what order they happen what are the influences how do i as the narrator as the writer also influence that and it 's also <unk>. <unk> one that i think many of our scientists have been asking it 's a kind of cosmology and i have to develop a cosmology of my own universe <unk> as the creator of that. <unk> universe <unk> and you see <unk>. there 's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen trying to figure it out. so when i look at creativity <unk> i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress my looking at associations in practically anything in life and i got a lot of them. <unk> what 's been going on. throughout this conference <unk> almost everything that 's been going on <unk> and so i 'm going to use as the metaphor this association quantum mechanics which i <unk>. really don 't understand but i 'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor . <unk> quantum mechanics of course you have dark energy and dark matter and it 's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen there 's a lot of unknown <unk>. <unk> and you often don 't know what it is except by its absence but when you make those associations you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in <unk>. <unk> the story <unk> and what you 're finding is what matters the meaning <unk> and that 's what i look for in my work a personal. <unk> meaning <unk> . there is also the uncertainty principle which is part of quantum mechanics as i understand it and this happens constantly. in the writing . and there 's the terrible and dreaded observer effect in which you 're looking for something and you know things are happening simultaneously. <unk> you 're looking at it in a different way and you 're trying to really. look for the about ness or what is this story about and if you try too hard then you will only write the about . you won 't discover anything and what you were supposed to find what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way is no longer there <unk> . now i don 't want to ignore. the other side of what happens in our universe like many of our. <unk> scientists have and so i am going to just throw in string theory here and just say that creative people are multidimensional <unk> and there are eleven levels <unk>. i think of anxiety and they all operate at the same time. <unk> is operating but something is operating there and ambiguity to me is very uncomfortable in my life <unk> and i have it moral ambiguity. it is constantly there and just as an example this is one that recently came to me <unk> it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war. <unk> save a man from drowning you are responsible to him for life a very famous chinese saying she said <unk> and that means because we went into iraq we should stay there <unk>. until things were solved you know maybe even one hundred years so <unk> . <unk> not supposed to kill. anything <unk> and they also have to make a living and people need to be fed so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning and unfortunately in the process the fish die <unk> . now what 's encapsulated. in both these drowning metaphors. <unk> and it is a famous chinese saying because she said it to me. <unk> save a man from drowning you are responsible to him for life and it was a warning don 't get involved in other people 's business <unk> or you 're going to get stuck <unk> . ok <unk> i think if somebody really was drowning she 'd. save them but both of these sayings saving a fish from drowning or saving a man from drowning. to me they had to do with intentions . and all of us in life when we see a situation we have a response and then we have intentions there 's an ambiguity. <unk> of what that should be that we should do <unk> and then we do something and the results of that may not match what our intentions had been maybe things go wrong <unk> and so <unk>. after that what are our responsibilities what are we supposed to do do we stay in for life or do we do something else and justify and. <unk> my intentions were good and. therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it that is the ambiguity in my life. that really disturbed me and led me to write a book called saving fish from drowning . i saw examples of that once i identified this. question it was all over the place i got these hints everywhere <unk> and then in a way <unk> i knew that they had always been there and then writing that 's what happens. <unk> i get these hints these clues <unk> and i realize that they 've. been obvious and yet they have not been <unk> . and what i need in effect. is a focus and when i have the question it is a focus and all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question <unk> and. what happens is those particular things become relevant <unk> and it seems like it 's happening all the time <unk> you think there 's a sort of coincidence going on a serendipity in which you <unk>. <unk> 're getting all this help from the universe <unk> and it may also be explained that now you have a focus <unk> . <unk> may be something that is perhaps more serious <unk>. i was thinking that i shouldn 't go because somebody said if i did it would show that i approved of the military regime there <unk> and then <unk> after a while i had to ask myself why do we take on knowledge why do we take on assumptions that. <unk> and it was the same thing that i felt when i was growing up <unk> and was hearing these. rules of of moral conduct from my father who was a baptist minister. <unk> so i decided that i would go to burma for my own intentions . and still didn 't know that if i went there <unk> what the result of that would be if i wrote a book. and i just would have to face that. <unk> when the time came . we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of we come to this point and say what do i as an individual do not all of us can go to africa <unk> or work at hospitals . so what do we do if we have this moral response this feeling . also i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at and we talked about today is genocide. <unk> this leads to this question when i look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable <unk> and i consider what my intentions should be i realize it goes back to this identity question that i had when i was a child and. <unk> in some sense and yet. it is also absolutely necessary in writing a story it is the place where i begin . sometimes i get help from the universe it seems my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know. <unk> instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally from an overdose of opium while having too much of a good time i actually put down in the story that. the woman killed herself <unk> and that actually was the way it happened and my mother decided. that that information must have come from my grandmother . there are also things quite uncanny <unk> which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book in. <unk> i was writing a story that included some kind of detail period of history <unk> a certain location and i needed to find something historically that would match that and. i took down this book and i first page that i flipped it to was exactly the setting and the time period <unk> and the kind of character i needed was the taiping rebellion happening in the area near. guilin <unk> outside of that and a character who thought he was the son of god you wonder are these things random chance. <unk> well <unk> what is random . what is chance what is luck <unk> <unk> what are things that you get from the universe that you can 't really explain <unk> and that goes into the story too these are the things i constantly think about <unk>. <unk> from day to day especially when good things happen <unk> and in particular <unk> when bad things happen <unk> . <unk> them and also try to find them in my life <unk> because again i think that when i am aware of them more of them happen <unk> . another chance encounter is when i went to a place and. there was something quite mysterious and ominous a discomfort i felt <unk> and then i knew that had to be [ the ] setting of my book and. in writing one of the scenes it happened in that third valley for some reason i wrote about cairns stacks of rocks that a. man was was building and i didn 't know exactly why i had it but it was so. <unk> i got stuck and a friend when she asked if i would go for a walk with her dogs that i said sure and about forty five minutes later walking along the beach . i came across this <unk> and it was a man a chinese man and he was stacking these things not with glue not with anything <unk> and i asked him how is it possible to do this and he said well. i guess with everything in life there 's a place of. <unk> and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point <unk> i had so many examples i have so many instances like this when i 'm writing a story and i cannot <unk>. explain it is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain like the cosmological constant. <unk> a big thing that i also think about is accidents and as i said my mother did not believe in randomness <unk> . what is the nature of accidents and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a court of law i was. able to see that in a firsthand way when i went to beautiful dong village in guizhou the poorest province of china <unk> and i. saw this beautiful place i knew i wanted to come back and i had a chance to do that when national geographic asked me if i wanted to write anything about china <unk> . and i said yes about this village of singing people . singing minority <unk> and they agreed and between the time i saw this place and the next time i went there was a terrible accident a man an old man fell asleep <unk>. and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm sixty homes were destroyed . <unk> responsibility was assigned to the family the man 's sons were banished to live three kilometers away in a cowshed . and of course as westerners we say well it was an accident that 's not fair it 's the son not the father. <unk> when i go on a story i have to let go of those kinds of. beliefs it takes a while but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there and so i was there on three occasions different. and i began to sense something different about the history and what had happened before and the nature of life in a very poor village <unk> and what you find as your joys and your rituals your traditions your links with other families <unk> . and i saw how this. had a kind of justice in its responsibility. <unk> now you as westerners and i as westerners would say well that 's superstition but after being there for a while and seeing. <unk> the amazing things that happened . you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world determining how things happen <unk> . so i remained with them and the more i wrote that story the more i got into those beliefs and i think that 's important for me. <unk> and that is where i 'm gonna find the answers to how i feel about certain questions that i have in life <unk> years go by of course and the writing it. <unk> instantly as i 'm trying to convey it to you here. at ted the book comes and it goes when it arrives it is no longer my book it is in the hands of readers and they interpret it differently <unk> . but i go back to this question of how do i create. something out of nothing <unk> and how do i create my own life <unk> and i think it is by questioning. <unk> saying to myself that there are no absolute truths <unk> i believe in specifics the specifics of story <unk> and. the past the specifics of that past and what is happening in the story at that point <unk> . i also believe that in thinking about things my thinking about luck <unk> and. <unk> and coincidences and accidents god 's will and the synchrony of mysterious forces i will come to some notion of what that is how we create . i have to think of my role where i am in the universe and did somebody intend for me to be that way or is it just something i came up with and. i also can find that by imagining fully. <unk> and becoming. what is imagined and yet is in that real world the fictional world <unk> . and that is how i find particles of truth not the absolute truth or the whole truth <unk> . and they have to be in all possibilities including those i never considered before . so there are never complete answers <unk> or rather if there. <unk> an answer it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything and that is good . because then i will discover something new <unk> . and if there is a partial answer <unk> a more complete answer from me it is to simply imagine . and to imagine is to put myself in that story <unk> until there was only there is a. <unk> transparency between me and the story that i am creating.
