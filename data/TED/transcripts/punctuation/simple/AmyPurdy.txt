 <unk> if your life were a book. and you were the author how would you want your story to go that 's the question that changed my. <unk> growing up in the hot last vegas desert all i wanted was to be free <unk> i would daydream. about traveling the world <unk> living in a place where it snowed . and i would picture all of the stories that i would go on to tell . at the age of nineteen the day after i graduated. <unk> i moved to a place where it snowed. and i became a massage therapist . with this job all i needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and i could go anywhere . for the first time in my life i felt free <unk> independent. and completely. in control of my. <unk> that is until my life took a detour <unk> . i went home from work early one day with what i thought was the flu <unk> . and less than twenty four hours later i was in the hospital on life support. with less than a two percent chance of living it wasn 't until days later as i lay in a coma. that the doctors diagnosed me with. <unk> bacterial meningitis. <unk> blood infection . over the course of two and a half months. i lost my spleen my kidneys the hearing in my left ear. and both of my legs below the knee when my parents wheeled me out of the hospital. i felt like i had been pieced back. <unk> together like a patchwork doll <unk> i thought the worst was over. until weeks later when i saw my new legs for the first time the calves were. bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot. with a raised rubber line from the toe. <unk> to the ankle to look like a vein i didn 't know what to expect <unk> but i wasn 't expecting that . with my mom. by my side. and tears streaming down our faces <unk> i strapped on these chunky legs. and i stood up they were. <unk> so painful. and so confining. that all i could think was . how am i ever going to travel the world in these things <unk> . how was i ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories as i always wanted <unk> . and how was i going to snowboard again. <unk> i went home <unk> i crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months . me passed out escaping from reality <unk> with my legs resting by my side . i was absolutely. physically. and emotionally. broken <unk> . but i knew that in order to. <unk> forward <unk> i had to let go of the old amy. and learn to embrace the new amy . and that is when it dawned on me that i didn 't have to be five foot five anymore i could be as tall as i wanted. <unk> or as short as i wanted <unk> depending on who i was dating . and. if i snowboarded again <unk> my feet aren 't going to get cold . and best of all i thought <unk> i can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales. <unk> and i did so there were benefits here <unk> it was this moment that i asked myself that <unk>. <unk> question if my life were a book. and i were the author <unk> . how would i want the story to go and i began to daydream <unk> i daydreamed like i did as a little girl. and i imagined myself walking gracefully. helping other people through my journey. and snowboarding again <unk> . and i didn 't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder. <unk> i could actually feel it i could feel the wind against my face and the beat. of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment <unk> and that. <unk> is when. a new chapter in my life began <unk> . four months later i was back up on a snowboard <unk> although things didn 't go quite as expected . my knees and my ankles wouldn 't bend and at one point. i traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when. i i fell and my legs still attached to my snowboard. went flying down the mountain . and i was on top of the mountain still <unk> i was so shocked i was just as shocked as everybody else and i was. so discouraged but i knew that if i could find the right pair of feet that i would be able to do this again <unk> . and this is when i learned that our borders. <unk> and our obstacles can only do two things one stop us in our tracks. or two force us to get creative <unk> . i did a year of research <unk> still couldn 't figure out what kind of legs to use couldn 't find any resources that could help me so i decided to make a pair. <unk> my leg maker and i put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that i could snowboard in . as you can see <unk> rusted bolts <unk> rubber wood and neon pink duct tape. <unk> and yes i can change my toenail polish. <unk> it was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift i could ever receive a new kidney from my dad that allowed me to follow my dreams again. i started snowboarding <unk> . then i went back to work then i went back to school <unk> then in two thousand and five i cofounded a nonprofit organization for youth and young adults with physical disabilities so they could get involved with action sports . from there <unk> i had the opportunity to go to south africa . where i helped to put shoes on thousands of children 's feet so they could attend school <unk> . and just this past february. <unk> i won two back to back world cup gold medals . which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. <unk> eleven years ago when i lost my legs <unk> i had no idea what to expect <unk> but if you ask me today if i would ever want to change my situation . i would have to say no . because my legs haven 't disabled me if anything they 've enabled me they 've forced me to rely on my imagination and to believe in the possibilities <unk>. <unk> and that 's why i believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for. <unk> breaking through borders because in our minds we can do anything and we can be anything . it 's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head on. that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits <unk> . and although today is about innovation. <unk> i have to say that in my life innovation has only been possible because of my borders <unk> . i 've learned that borders are where the actual ends <unk> but also where the imagination and the story begins.
