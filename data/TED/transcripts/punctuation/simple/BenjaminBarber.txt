 <unk> democracy is in trouble no question about that and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded . it 's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with. global pandemics. a cross border problem with hiv a transnational problem with markets and immigration something that goes beyond national borders with terrorism with war all now <unk>. problems in fact we live in a. <unk> look for solutions in politics and in democracy <unk> . we are faced with political institutions designed four hundred years ago <unk> autonomous <unk> sovereign. with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people. transnational world of problems and challenges. <unk> world of political institutions in that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy <unk> . and like many others i 've been thinking about what can one do about this this asymmetry. <unk> and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like <unk>. and my suggestion is that we change the subject that we stop talking. about nations about bordered states and we start talking about cities <unk> . because i think you will find when we talk about cities we are talking about. the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born <unk> we are talking about the cradle of democracy <unk> we are talking about the venues <unk>. in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy <unk> and at the same time. <unk> great names <unk> the place de la bastille <unk> . zuccotti park tahrir square . taksim square in today 's headlines in istanbul or yes <unk> . tiananmen square. in beijing . those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens. as participants as people with the right. to write our own. narratives . cities are not only the oldest of institutions they 're the most enduring if you think about it <unk> . constantinople istanbul much older than turkey alexandria much. <unk> older than italy cities endure the ages <unk> . they are the places where we are born <unk> grow up are educated work marry. <unk> pray <unk> play get old and in time die they are home <unk> . very different than nation states which are abstractions we pay taxes. we vote occasionally. <unk> we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us <unk> . not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live moreover today more than half of the world 's population. <unk> more than three out of four people live in urban. institutions urban places in cities today so cities are where the action is cities are us <unk> aristotle said in the ancient world man is a political animal <unk> . i say we are. <unk> we are an urban species at home in our cities so to come back to the dilemma if the dilemma is we have <unk> old fashioned political <unk>. <unk> to govern the world respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change <unk> then maybe it 's time. for mayors. <unk> for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance . when i say if mayors ruled the world when i first came up with that phrase it occurred to me that actually they already do . there are scores of international. <unk> networks of cities in which cities are already quite quietly <unk> . below the horizon . working together to deal with climate change to deal with security to deal with immigration to deal with all of those tough . interdependent problems that we face . they have strange names. <unk> and the list goes on citynet in asia city protocol a new organization out of barcelona that is using the web to share best practices. among countries and then all the things we know a little better the u s conference of mayors the mexican conference of mayors the european. conference. <unk> mayors mayors. are where this is happening <unk> and so the question is . how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role <unk> well . to understand that we need to understand. why cities are special why mayors are so different than prime. <unk> ministers and presidents because. my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends. of a political spectrum to be a prime minister or a president you have to have an ideology you have to have a <unk>. you have to have a theory of how things work you have to belong to a. <unk> on the whole don 't get elected to office but mayors are just the opposite mayors are pragmatists <unk>. their job is to get things done and if they don 't they 're out of a job mayor nutter. of philadelphia said we could never get away here in philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in washington <unk> the paralysis. <unk> because potholes have to get filled <unk> . because the trains have to run because kids have to be able to get to school . and that 's what we have to do and to do that is about pragmatism in that deep american sense reaching outcomes. <unk> real city mayors have to be pragmatists <unk> they have to get things done they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together <unk> . we saw this a couple of decades ago when teddy kollek the great mayor of jerusalem in the ' 80s and the ' 90s . was besieged. besieged one day in his office. by. religious leaders from all of the backgrounds <unk> . christian prelates rabbis imams they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites and the squabble went on and on and kollek listened and listened and he finally said gentlemen . spare me your sermons <unk> and i will fix your sewers. <unk> fix sewers <unk> they get the trains running there isn 't a left or a right way of doing boris johnson in london calls himself an. strange term but in some ways he is he 's a libertarian he. 's an anarchist he rides to work on a bike but at the same time he 's in some ways a conservative <unk> bloomberg in new york. was a democrat then he was a republican and finally he was an independent and said. <unk> the party label just gets in the way luzhkov . twenty years mayor in moscow though he helped found a party united party with putin <unk> in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally in fact lost his job not under brezhnev . not under gorbachev but under putin <unk> . who wanted a more faithful. <unk> they get things done <unk> but the second thing about mayors is they are also. what i like to call homeboys . or to include the women mayors homies <unk> . they 're from the neighborhood <unk> they 're part of the neighborhood they 're known ed koch used to wander around new york city saying how am i doing . imagine david cameron wandering around the united kingdom. asking how am i. <unk> doing he wouldn 't like the answer or putin <unk> or any national leader <unk> he could ask that because he knew new yorkers and they knew him . mayors are usually from the places they govern it 's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor you can run for the senate out of a different state but it 's hard to do that as a mayor . <unk> mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level and this is the third feature about mayors than national governing <unk>. <unk> officials in the united states we know the pathetic figures eighteen percent of americans approve. <unk> court has fallen way down from what it used to be but when you ask do you trust your city councillor do you trust your mayor . the rates shoot up to seventy seventy five even eighty percent . because they 're from the neighborhood <unk> because the people they work with are their neighbors because like mayor. <unk> a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building. that happened to mayor booker. or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees it no head of state would be permitted by their security details to do it nor be in a position to do it . that 's the difference and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves because. <unk> able to work with one another when states face each other china and the u s they face each other like this <unk> . when cities interact they interact. like this <unk> . <unk> in california . are locked in all kinds of anger resentment <unk> and rivalry for number one we heard more about who will be number one . cities don 't worry about number one they have to work together and they do work together they work together in climate change for example <unk> . organizations like the c40 like. <unk> which i mentioned . have been working together many many years before copenhagen in copenhagen four or five years ago one hundred and eighty four nations came together to explain to one another <unk>. <unk> why their sovereignty didn 't permit them to deal with the grave grave crisis of climate change <unk> . <unk> and through inter city organizations eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities which means cities are in a position to solve. the carbon problem or most of it whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another and they are doing it los angeles cleaned up its port . which was forty percent of carbon emissions . and as a result got rid of about twenty percent. <unk> of carbon new york has a program to upgrade its old buildings make them better insulated in the winter . to not leak energy in the summer not leak air conditioning . that 's having an impact bogota where mayor mockus when he was mayor he introduced a transportation system. that saved energy that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways express buses. <unk> with corridors it helped unemployment because people could get across town . and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there singapore . as it developed its high rises and its remarkable public housing also. developed an island of parks and if you go there you 'll see how much of it is green land and park land cities are doing this but not just one by one they are doing it together they. <unk> are sharing. what they do <unk> and they are making a difference by shared best practices . bike shares many of you have heard of it started twenty or thirty years ago in latin america now it 's in hundreds of cities around the world <unk> pedestrian zones <unk> congestion fees <unk> emission limits in cities like california cities. <unk> 's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque <unk> stubborn nations refuse. to act . so what 's the bottom line. here . the bottom line is we still live politically in a world of borders a world of boundaries a world of walls a world where states. <unk> we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders . a world of diseases without borders and. doctors without borders. <unk> borders of terrorism and war without borders . that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization . we will <unk>. not only risk. the failure to address all of these transnational problems but we will risk losing democracy itself. <unk> up in the old. box <unk> unable to address global problems democratically so. where does that leave us i 'll tell you the road to global democracy doesn 't run through states it runs through cities . democracy was born. in the ancient polis. i believe it can be reborn. in the global cosmopolis <unk> . in that journey from polis to cosmopolis <unk> we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level <unk> we can create not a league of nations which failed but a league of cities . <unk> but united cities of the world <unk> we can create a global parliament of mayors that 's an idea it 's in. my conception of the coming world but it 's also on the table in city halls in seoul korea in amsterdam in hamburg . and in new york mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors and i love that idea because a parliament of mayors is a. parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us of you. and of me if ever there were citizens without borders <unk> i think it 's the citizens of ted. who show the promise to be those citizens without borders <unk> i am ready. to reach out and embrace a new. <unk> global democracy to take back our. democracy <unk> and the only question is are you thank you so much my fellow citizens.
