 <unk> about your mindset does your mindset correspond to my dataset . if not one or the other needs upgrading isn 't it when i talk to. <unk> we learned it in college and what is the definition then the definition everyone knows they say but then you know i press them like this <unk> so one girl said very. <unk> it 's very easy western world is a long life in a small family developing world is a short life in a large family . and i like that definition because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset <unk> and here you have the dataset . so you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family one two three four five children per woman on this axis <unk> and here length of life life expectancy. <unk> concept about the world <unk> and really this is about the bedroom whether the man and woman decide to have small family and take care of their kids <unk> and how long <unk>. <unk> they will live it 's about the bathroom and the kitchen if you have soap water and food you know <unk> you can live long . developing world and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world they had small families and long life <unk> . and you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime <unk> then the developing countries applied soap and water vaccination <unk>. and all the developing world started to apply family planning <unk> and partly to usa who help to provide. <unk> technical advice and investment <unk> and you see all the world moves over to a two child family and a life with sixty to seventy years but some countries <unk>. <unk> remain back in this area here <unk> and you can see we still have afghanistan down here we have. <unk> had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born . and we in fact when we have played this over the world i was at the global <unk>. <unk> health conference here in washington last week <unk> and i could see the wrong concept even. <unk> 't realize the improvement of mexico there and china in relation to united states <unk> look here when i move them forward here we go <unk> . they catch up there 's mexico it 's on par with. <unk> united states in these two social dimensions there was less than five percent of the specialists in global health that was aware of this. this <unk> this great nation mexico has the problem that arms are coming from north across the borders so they had to stop that . because they have this strange relationship to the united states you know <unk> but if i would change this axis here i would instead <unk> put income per person. <unk> income per person i can put that here <unk> and we will then see a completely different picture . by the way i 'm teaching you how to use our website gapminder world while i 'm correcting this <unk> . because this is a free free utility on the net <unk> and when i now finally got it right <unk> i can go back. two hundred years in history <unk> and i can find united states up there <unk> and i can let the other countries be shown. and now i have income per person on this axis <unk> and united states only had some one two thousand dollars at that time <unk> . and the life expectancy was thirty five to forty years on par with afghanistan today. and. what has happened in the world <unk> i will show now <unk> this is instead of studying history for one year at university you can watch me for one minute now. <unk> you can see how the brown bubbles <unk> which is west europe <unk> . and the yellow one <unk> which is the united states <unk> they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier and this is now one hundred years ago <unk> where the rest of the world remains behind <unk>. here we come <unk> . <unk> we are so scared about flu isn 't it it 's still remembered <unk> the fall of life expectancy <unk> and then we come up not until. independence started look here you have china over there <unk> you have india over there and this is what has happened did. <unk> you note there that we have mexico up there <unk> . mexico is not at all on par with the united states but they are quite close and especially it 's interesting to see china and the united states during two hundred years. because i have my oldest son now working for google after google acquired this software because in fact this is child labor my son and his wife sat in a closet. for many years and. <unk> and my youngest son who studied chinese in beijing <unk> so they come in with the two perspectives i have you know <unk> and my son youngest son who studied in beijing in china he got a <unk> long term perspective <unk> . whereas when my oldest son who works for google he should develop develop by quarter . or by half year or google is quite generous so he can have one or two years to go <unk> but in china they look generation after generation because they. remember the very embarrassing period for one. <unk> hundred years when they went backwards <unk> . and then they would remember the first part of last century <unk> which was really bad <unk> and we could go by this <unk> so called great leap forward but this was <unk>. eventually brought health to china and then he died and then deng xiaoping started this amazing. <unk> isn 't it strange to see that the united states first grew the economy and then gradually got rich <unk> whereas china could. get healthy much earlier <unk> because they applied the knowledge of education nutrition <unk> and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning <unk>. and asia could have social development before they got. <unk> so to me as a public health professor <unk> it 's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now because what you see here <unk> what you see here is the flat world of thomas friedman isn 't it it. 's not really really flat but the middle income countries and this is where i suggest to my students stop using the concept developing world . because after all talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the united states the last. <unk> chapter is about present and president obama <unk> and the other is about the past where you cover everything from washington to eisenhower <unk> . because washington to eisenhower that is what we find in the developing world <unk> we could actually go to mayflower to eisenhower <unk> . and that would be put together into a developing. <unk> which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way <unk> which have great entrepreneurs but also have the collapsing countries so how could we make better sense about this <unk>. <unk> well one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution <unk> this is the income distribution of peoples in the world <unk> from $ one this is where you have food to eat these people go to bed hungry and this is the number of. <unk> whether you have a public or a private health service system this is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children and this is oecd countries green latin america <unk>. east europe <unk> this is east asia <unk> and the light blue there is south asia <unk> and this is how the world changed it changed like this <unk> . <unk> projections <unk> but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there you know because . that 's where the projections are not valid any longer. <unk> probably the world will do this and then it will continue forward like this <unk> but more or less this is what will happen <unk> and we have a world which cannot be looked <unk>. <unk> upon as divided we have the high income countries here <unk> with the united states as. <unk> leading power we have the emerging economies in the middle which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout <unk> and we have the low income countries here yeah . this is a fact that from where the money comes they have been saving you know over the last decade. <unk> and here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are and here we have the countries in. <unk> we have all this at the same time <unk> that 's why it 's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world <unk> because it 's so different what has happened there . and that 's why i suggest a slightly different approach of what what you would call it and you have huge differences within countries also i heard that your departments here were. <unk> and on this axis <unk> gdp and on this heath child survival <unk> and it doesn 't come as a surprise that africa south of sahara is at the bottom <unk> but when i split it when <unk>. <unk> i split it into into country bubbles the size of the bubbles here is the population then you see sierra leone and mauritius completely different . <unk> can split the others here is the south asian arab world <unk> . now all your different departments east europe latin america <unk> and oecd countries <unk> and here were are we have a continuum in the world . we cannot put it into two parts it is mayflower down here it is washington here <unk> building building countries <unk> it 's. lincoln here advancing them it 's eisenhower bringing modernity into. <unk> the countries <unk> and then it 's united states today up here <unk> and we have countries all this way . now <unk> this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed . at this point i decided to make a pause . and it is my task on behalf of the rest of the world to convey a thanks to the u s taxpayers. <unk> for demographic health survey many are not aware of no this is not a joke <unk> this is very serious <unk> . it is due to usa 's continuous sponsoring during twenty five years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what 's happening in the world. <unk> providing facts that it 's useful for the society and providing data free of charge on the internet for the world to use thank you very much quite the opposite of the world bank who compiled data. with government money tax money and then they sell it to add a little profit in a very inefficient. <unk> gutenberg way <unk> . but. the people doing that at the world bank are among the best in the world and they are highly skilled professionals <unk> . it 's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way <unk> as we do and when it comes to free data and transparency united states of america. <unk> is one of the best and that doesn 't come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor . and i 'm not paid to come here no . i would like to show you what happens with the data what we can show with this data look here <unk> <unk> this is the world with income down there and child mortality <unk> and what has happened in the world <unk>. <unk> and fifty during the last fifty years we have had a fall in child mortality <unk> and it is the dhs that makes it possible to know this <unk> and we had an increase in income and the blue former <unk>. <unk> developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world <unk> we have a continuum but we still have of course congo <unk> up there <unk> we still have as poor countries as we have. <unk> and that 's the bottom billion where we 've heard today about a completely new approach to do it and how fast has this happened <unk> . well <unk> mdg four the. united states has not been so eager to use mdg four <unk> . but you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it because it 's the only child mortality that we can measure <unk> . and we used to say that it should fall four percent per year . let 's see what sweden has done we used to boast about. fast social progress <unk> that 's where we were one thousand nine hundred one thousand nine hundred sweden was there <unk> same child mortality as bangladesh had one thousand nine hundred and ninety though they had lower income <unk>. they started very well they used the aid well they vaccinated the kids they get better water and they reduced child mortality with an amazing four point seven percent per year they beat sweden <unk> i run sweden the same sixteen year period second round. <unk> 's sweden one thousand nine hundred and sixteen against egypt one thousand nine hundred and ninety here we go <unk> once again the usa is part of the reason here <unk> they get safe water they get food for the poor <unk> and they <unk>. <unk> get malaria eradicated five point five percent they are faster than the millennium development goal and third chance for sweden against brazil here. <unk> amazing social improvement over the last sixteen years and they go faster than sweden <unk> this means that the world is converging . the middle income countries the emerging economy <unk> they are catching up they are moving to cities where they also get better assistance for that well the swedish students protest at <unk>. <unk> this point they say this is not fair <unk> because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for sweden. <unk> i give you singapore the year i was born <unk> singapore had twice the child mortality of sweden it 's the most tropical country in the world <unk> a marshland on the equator and here we go <unk> it took a little <unk>. <unk> time for them to get independent but then they started to grow their economy <unk> and they made the social investment they got away malaria <unk> they got a magnificent health system that beat both the u s and sweden we never thought it would happen that they would win over sweden. <unk> these green countries are achieving millennium development goals these yellow are just about to be doing this <unk> these red are the countries that doesn 't do it and the policy has to be improved not simplistic extrapolation. <unk> we have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way we have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing <unk> and we have to. <unk> we look at the world <unk> this is dollar per person this is hiv in the countries the blue is africa <unk> . the size of the bubbles is how many are hiv affected you see the tragedy in south africa there <unk> about twenty percent of the adult population are infected and in spite of them having quite a high income <unk> they have a huge number of hiv infected <unk> . but you also see that there are african countries down here <unk> . there is no such thing as an hiv epidemic in africa . there 's a number five to ten countries in in africa that has the same level as sweden and united states <unk> . and there are others who are extremely high <unk> and i will show you that what has happened in. one of the best countries with the most vibrant economy in africa and a good governance botswana they have a very high level it 's coming down but now it 's not falling because there. <unk> with help from pepfar <unk> it 's working with treatment and people are not dying <unk> and you can see it 's not that easy that it is war which caused this because here in congo <unk> there is war <unk> and here in zambia there is peace <unk> . and it 's not the economy richer country has a little higher if i split tanzania in its income the richer twenty percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one and. <unk> 's really different within each country look at the provinces of kenya <unk> they are very different and this is. the situation you see it 's not deep poverty it 's the special situation probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population <unk>. in some countries or some parts of countries in south and eastern africa don 't make it africa <unk> don 't make it a race issue make it a local issue <unk> and do. <unk> prevention at each place in the way it can be done there <unk> so to just end up there are things. of suffering in the one billion poorest which we don 't know <unk> . those who live beyond the cellphone <unk> those who have yet to see a computer <unk> those who have no electricity at home this. <unk> this is the disease konzo i spent twenty years elucidating in africa <unk> it 's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation <unk> it 's similar to <unk>. <unk> the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the ' 30s it 's similar to other nutritional diseases it will never affect a rich person <unk> we have seen it here here in mozambique <unk>. <unk> this is the epidemic in mozambique <unk> this is an epidemic in northern tanzania you never heard about the disease <unk> . <unk> cause crippling throughout the world and over the last two years two thousand people has been crippled in the southern tip of bandundu region that used to be the illegal diamond trade from the. <unk> area in angola that has now disappeared <unk> and they are now in great economic problem and one week ago for the. <unk> were four lines on the internet.
