 <unk> guatemala is recovering from a 36 year armed conflict a conflict that was fought during the cold war it was really just. a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state. <unk> what we have as a result is two hundred thousand civilian victims one hundred and sixty thousand of those killed in the communities small children men women the elderly even . and then we have about forty thousand others <unk> the missing <unk> the ones we 're still looking for today we call them. now eighty three percent of the victims are mayan victims victims. that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of central america and only about seventeen percent are of european. <unk> descent but. the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us . the police the military are the ones that committed most of the crimes . now the families they want information they want to know what happened they want the bodies of their loved ones <unk> . but most of all what they want is they want you they want everyone to know. <unk> that their loved ones did nothing wrong . now my case was that my father received death threats. in one thousand nine hundred and eighty and we left we left guatemala and we came here <unk> so i grew up in new york i grew up in brooklyn as a matter of fact and i went to new utrecht high school. and i graduated from brooklyn college <unk> the only thing was that i really didn 't know what was happening in guatemala i didn. <unk> care for it it was too painful <unk> but it wasn 't <unk>. <unk> decided to. do something about it <unk> so i went back i went back to guatemala . to look for the bodies to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well <unk> . the way we work is that we give people information. <unk> we talk to the family members and we let them choose . we let them decide to tell us the stories to tell us what they saw to tell us about their loved ones <unk> and even more important we let them choose. to give us a piece of themselves . a piece an essence of who they are and that dna is what we 're going to compare to the dna that comes from the skeletons . while we 're doing that though <unk> we 're looking for the bodies and these are skeletons by now most of these crimes happened. when we find the grave <unk> we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body <unk> document it and exhume it <unk> we literally bring the skeleton out of the ground <unk> . once we have those bodies though we take them back to the city to our lab <unk> and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things one is how people died <unk> . so here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head. or a machete wound for example. <unk> the other thing we want to understand is who they are <unk> whether it 's a baby . or an adult <unk> whether it 's a woman or a man <unk> . but when we 're done with that analysis what we 'll do is we 'll take a small fragment of the bone and we 'll extract dna from it we. 'll take that dna and then we 'll compare it with the dna of the families. <unk> way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases the first is the case of the military diary <unk> now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in one thousand nine hundred. and ninety nine and what you see there is the state following individuals people that like you wanted to change their country <unk> . and they. <unk> of the things that they wrote down is when they executed them inside that yellow rectangle you see a code it 's a secret code three hundred . and then you see a date the three hundred means executed and the date means when they were executed <unk> now that 's going to come into play in a second . what we did is we conducted an exhumation in two thousand and three where we exhumed two hundred and twenty. <unk> in a military base . grave nine though matched the family of sergio saul linares now sergio was a professor at the university . he graduted from iowa state university and went back to guatemala to change his country <unk> . and he was captured on february <unk>. and if you can see there he was executed on march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four which was. <unk> we had the body we had the family 's information and their dna and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened <unk> . but most important is about two weeks later <unk> we go another hit <unk> another match from the same grave. the dna of that body also matched the dna of that family . and then we noticed that he was also in the diary <unk> but it was amazing to see that he was also executed on march. <unk> think hmm how many bodies were in the grave <unk> six so then we said how many people. were executed on. march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four that 's right six. as well <unk> so we have juan de dios <unk> hugo <unk> moises. <unk> all of them executed on the same date <unk> all captured at different locations and at different moments . all put in that grave <unk> the only thing we needed now was the dna of those four families so we went. and we looked for them. and we found them and we identified those six bodies. and gave them back to the families <unk> the other case i want to tell you about is that of a military base. called. <unk> to believe in peace but the acronym really means regional command center for peacekeeping operations and this is where the guatemalan military. trains peacekeepers from other countries the ones that serve with the u n . and go to countries like haiti and the congo . well <unk> we have testimony that said that within this military base there were bodies there were graves <unk> . so we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in we found the first of. eighty four graves a total of five hundred and thirty three bodies <unk> now if you think about that . peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies it 's very ironic <unk> . but the bodies. face down most of them hands tied behind their backs <unk> blindfolded all types of trauma these were people who were defenseless who were being executed people. that five hundred and thirty three families are looking for . so we 're going to focus on grave fifteen grave fifteen what we noticed was a grave full of women and children sixty three of them . and that immediately made us think <unk> my goodness where is there a case like this when i got to guatemala in one thousand nine <unk>. <unk> i heard of a case of a massacre that happened on may fourteen. eighty two where the army came in killed the men <unk> and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location well . guess what the clothing from this grave matched. the clothing from the region where these people were taken from where these women and children were taken from <unk> . so we conducted some dna analysis and guess what we identified martina rojas and manuel chen <unk> both of them disappeared in that case. <unk> we could prove it we have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people were taken to this base . now manuel chen was three years old his mother went to. to the river to wash clothes and she left him with a neighbor . that 's when the army came and that 's when he was taken away in a helicopter and never seen again until we found him in grave fifteen <unk> so now with science. <unk> with archaeology with anthropology with genetics what we 're doing is we 're giving a voice to the voiceless <unk> . but we 're doing more than that we 're actually providing evidence for trials . like the genocide trial that happened last year in guatemala where general ros montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to eighty years <unk> . so i came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere it 's happening in mexico right in front of us today and we. <unk> 't let it go on anymore we have to now. come together and decide that we 're not going to have any more missing <unk> so no more missing guys okay no more missing <unk> thank you.
