 <unk> this story is about taking imagination seriously <unk> . fourteen years ago <unk> i first encountered this ordinary material fishnet used the same way for centuries <unk> . <unk> i 'm using it to create permanent billowing voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world . i was an unlikely person to be doing this i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture . in fact after college i applied to seven art schools. and was rejected by all seven <unk> i went off on my own to become an artist and i painted for ten years. <unk> years <unk> when i was offered a fulbright to india . promising to give exhibitions of paintings i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram the deadline for the show arrived. my paints didn 't . i had to do something this fishing village was famous for sculpture <unk> so i tried bronze casting <unk> . but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive. <unk> went for a walk on the beach <unk> watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand i 'd seen it every day <unk> but this time i saw it differently. a new approach to sculpture a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials . my first satisfying sculpture was made. <unk> we hoisted them on poles to photograph <unk> . i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns i was mesmerized <unk> . i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans next in lithuania. <unk> with lace makers <unk> i liked the fine detail it gave my work <unk> . but i wanted to make them larger to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in . returning to india to work with those fishermen <unk> we made a net of a million and a half. thousands of people saw it . and one of them was the urbanist manual <unk> sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto portugal. <unk> he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city <unk> i didn 't know if i could do that and preserve my art <unk> durable <unk>. <unk> those are in opposition to idiosyncratic delicate and ephemeral . for two years i searched for a fiber. that could survive ultraviolet rays salt air <unk> pollution and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind . we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic. <unk> we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds <unk> . but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving <unk> . i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america 's cup racing yachts named peter heppel <unk> . he helped me tackle the twin. <unk> challenges of precise shape. and gentle movement <unk> . i couldn 't build this the way i knew because hand tied knots weren 't going to withstand a hurricane . so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory <unk> learned the variables of their machines and figured out a way to make lace with. <unk> there was no language to translate this ancient idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce <unk> . so we had to create one <unk> three years and two children later. <unk> we raised this <unk>. lace net it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built permanent and had lost nothing in. <unk> translation . this intersection had been bland and anonymous . now it had a sense of place <unk> . i walked underneath it for the first time . as i watched the wind 's choreography unfold <unk> i felt sheltered and at the same time connected to limitless sky. my life was not going to be the same . i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world <unk> . i 'm going to share. two directions that are new in my work <unk> historic philadelphia city hall. <unk> its plaza i felt needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting <unk> . so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind. and in testing discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet. <unk> i 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time. like an x ray of the city 's circulatory system unfolding <unk> . next challenge . the biennial of the americas in denver asked could i represent the thirty five nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture. i didn 't know where to begin <unk> but i said yes <unk> . i read about the recent earthquake in chile. and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean . it shifted the earth 's tectonic plates <unk> sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened. <unk> so i contacted noaa and i asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami and translated it into this . its title one point two six refers to the number of microseconds that the earth 's day was shortened <unk> . i couldn 't build this with a steel ring the way i knew <unk> its shape was too complex now so i replaced the metal armature with a soft. <unk> fine mesh of a fiber fifteen times stronger than steel . the sculpture could now be entirely soft <unk> which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings. literally becoming part of the fabric of the city . there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity <unk> so we had to create it. then i got a call from new york city. asking if i could adapt these concepts. to times square or the high line . this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers . they don 't have funding yet. <unk> now of bringing these to cities around the world where they 're most needed <unk> . fourteen years ago <unk> i searched for beauty. in the traditional things in craft forms . <unk> materials and engineering. to create voluptuous billowing forms the scale of buildings . my artistic horizons continue to grow i 'll leave you with this story i got a call from a friend in phoenix . an attorney in the office who 'd never been interested in art never visited the local art museum <unk> . dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down. <unk> underneath the sculpture there they were in their business suits laying in the grass noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn 't know . sharing the rediscovery of wonder <unk> . thank you.
