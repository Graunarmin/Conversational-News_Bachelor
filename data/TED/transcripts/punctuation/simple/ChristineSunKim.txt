 <unk> my favorite musical symbol it means to play softly if you 're playing a musical instrument and you notice a p in the. <unk> you need to play softer two p 's even softer <unk> four p 's extremely soft <unk> . this is my drawing of a p tree . which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p 's there may be you 'll never reach complete silence . that 's my current definition of silence a very obscure sound. 'd like to share a little bit about the history of american sign language asl plus a bit of my own background <unk> . french sign language was brought to america during the early <unk>. and as time went by mixed with local signs it evolved into the language we know today as. <unk> of about two hundred years . i was born deaf <unk> . and i was taught to believe that sound wasn 't a part of my life <unk> . and i believed it to be true <unk> . yet i realize now that that wasn 't the case at all sound was very much a part of my life <unk> really on my mind. <unk> every day . as a deaf person living in a world of sound it. 's as if i was living in a foreign country blindly following its rules customs behaviors and norms. without ever questioning them. <unk> so how is it that i understand sound <unk> well i watch how people behave and respond to sound . you people are like my loudspeakers and amplify sound i learn and mirror that behavior . at the same time <unk> i 've learned that i create sound <unk> and i 've seen how people respond to me. <unk> i 've learned <unk> for example don 't slam the door don 't make too much noise when you 're eating from the <unk>. don 't burp <unk> . and when you 're eating make sure you don 't scrape your utensils on the plate . all of these things i term sound etiquette . maybe i think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person. <unk> does i 'm hyper vigilant around sound <unk> . and i 'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation. around sound about what 's to come next <unk> hence this drawing <unk> tbd to be decided <unk> . <unk> to be announced . and you notice the staff there are no notes contained in the lines that 's because the lines already contain sound through. the subtle smudges and smears . in deaf culture movement is equivalent to sound <unk>. <unk> typical staff contains five lines <unk> . yet for me signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn 't feel natural that 's why you 'll notice in my drawings i stick to four lines on paper . in the year two thousand and eight i had the opportunity to travel to berlin germany for an artist residency there . prior to this time i had been working as a painter. during this summer i visited different museums and gallery spaces . and as i went from one place to the next i noticed there was no visual art there . at that time <unk> sound was trending <unk> and this struck me . there was no visual art everything was auditory . now sound has come into my art territory. is it going to further distance me from art <unk> . i realized that doesn 't have to be the case at all i actually know sound <unk> i know it so well. that it doesn 't have to be something just experienced through the ears it could be felt tactually . or experienced as a visual or even as an idea. <unk> so i decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice <unk> . and everything that i had been taught regarding sound <unk> i decided to do away with and unlearn <unk> . i started creating a new body of work and when i presented this to the art community i was blown away with the amount of support. <unk> and attention i received <unk> i realized . sound. is like money <unk> power control. social currency . in the back of my mind i 've always felt that sound was your thing a hearing person 's thing. <unk> and sound is so powerful. that it could either disempower me and my artwork or it could empower me <unk> . i chose to be empowered . there 's a massive culture around spoken language <unk> and just because. i don 't use my literal voice to communicate in society 's eyes. it 's as if i don 't have a voice at all <unk> . so i need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice . and that way i 'm able to maintain relevancy in society today so at school at work and institutions i work with many. <unk> and their voice becomes my voice and identity . they help me to be heard <unk> . and their voices hold value and currency <unk> . ironically by borrowing out their voices <unk> i 'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency. kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate . if i didn 't continue this practice <unk> i feel that i could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency <unk> . so with sound as my new art medium <unk> i delved into the world of music. <unk> and i was surprised to see the similarities between music and asl . for example a musical note. cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper and the same holds true for a concept in. <unk> meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds i. 'd like to share with you a piano metaphor to have you have a better understanding of how asl works so envision a piano. asl is broken down into many different grammatical parameters. <unk> assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano. such as facial expression body movement speed hand shape. and so on as you play the piano. english is a linear language as if one key is being pressed at a time <unk> . <unk> asl is more like a chord all ten fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in asl . if just one of those keys were to change the chord . it would create a completely different meaning the same applies to music in regards to pitch <unk> tone and volume. <unk> by playing around with these different grammatical parameters you can express different ideas for example take the sign to look at this is the sign to look at . i 'm looking at you . staring at you. <unk> i then started thinking what if i was to look at asl through a musical lens if i was to create a sign and repeat it over and over. <unk> it could become like a piece of visual music <unk> . for example this is the sign for day as the sun rises and sets <unk> . this is all day . if i was to repeat it and slow it down visually it looks like a piece of music . all. <unk> represented in this drawing <unk> . and this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights. <unk> i feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two . this represents how time is. <unk> and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time <unk> for example. 1h is one hand 2h is two hand . present tense happens closest and in front of the body . future is in front of the body and the past is to your back . so the first example is a long time ago. <unk> and the last one <unk> which is my favorite with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it once upon a time . common time is a musical term. with a specific time signature of four beats per measure <unk> yet when i see the word common time. <unk> comes to mind for me is at the same time . so notice rh right hand <unk> lh left hand we have the staff across the head and the chest. now we 're going to do it in both the head and the chest <unk> kind of like common time or at the same time <unk> . yes <unk> got it that means to fall in love in international [ sign ] . international [ sign. <unk> as a note is a visual tool. to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world . the second one i 'd like to demonstrate is this please follow along with me again <unk> . and now this . <unk> so let 's do all three together . fall in love. <unk> notice how all three signs are very similar they all happen at the head and the chest <unk> . but they convey quite different meanings <unk> so it 's amazing to see how asl is alive and thriving just like music is <unk> . however <unk> in this day and age we live in a very. <unk> and just because asl has no sound to it it automatically holds no social currency <unk> . we need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency. and allow asl to develop its own form of currency. without sound <unk> and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive. society . and maybe people will understand. that you don 't need to be deaf to learn asl nor do you have to be hearing to learn music. asl is such a rich treasure that i 'd like you to have the same experience <unk> . and i 'd like to invite you to open your ears to open your eyes <unk> . take part in our culture and experience our visual language <unk> and you never know. <unk> might just fall in love with us.
