 <unk> what i want to tell you about today is. how i see robots invading our lives at multiple levels . over multiple timescales <unk> and when i look out in the future i can 't imagine a world five hundred years from now where we don 't have robots everywhere assuming. despite all the dire predictions from many people about. our future assuming we 're still around i can 't imagine the world not being populated with robots and then the question is well if they 're going to be here in five hundred years . are they going to be everywhere sooner than that are they going to be around in fifty years yeah i think that 's pretty likely there 's going to be lots of robots everywhere and in fact i think that 's going. to be a lot sooner than that i think we 're sort of on the cusp of. <unk> in personal computer years where the first few robots are starting to appear <unk> computers sort of came around. through games and toys <unk> and you know . the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong a little microprocessor embedded and then. other games that came after that and. <unk> to see that same sort of thing with robots lego mindstorms furbies. who here did anyone here have a furby yeah there. million of them sold worldwide . they are pretty common and they 're a little tiny robot a simple robot with some sensors a little bit of processing actuation on the right there is another robot doll who you could get a couple of years ago <unk> . and. just as in the early days when there was a lot of. sort of amateur. <unk> on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics where you put a pc on and you. program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff <unk> . and then there 's a higher price point sort of robot toys the sony aibo <unk> and on the right there is one that the nec developed the papero <unk> . which i don 't think they 're going to release <unk> but. nevertheless those sorts of things are out there <unk> and we 've seen over the last two. <unk> or three years lawn mowing robots husqvarna on the bottom friendly robotics. on top there. an israeli company <unk> and then in the last twelve months or so we 've started to see a bunch of. home cleaning robots appear the top left one is a very nice home cleaning robot from a company called dyson <unk> in the u k except it was so. <unk> five hundred dollars they didn 't release it but at the bottom left you see electrolux which is on sale . another one from karcher at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about ten years ago and we finally turned that into. a product and let me just show you that we 're going to give this away i think chris said after the talk this is a. robot that you can go out and buy and that will clean up your floor. <unk> starts off sort of just going around in ever increasing circles. if it hits something you people see that now it 's doing wall following it 's following around my feet to. to clean up around me let 's see let 's. oh <unk> who stole my rice krispies they stole my rice krispies. <unk> i put a bunch of rice krispies there <unk> i put some pennies let 's just shoot it at that see if it cleans up. <unk> the trick was. building a better cleaning mechanism actually the intelligence on board was fairly simple. and that 's true with a lot of robots we 've all i think become sort of computational chauvinists and think that computation is everything but the mechanics still matter here. 's another robot. <unk> the packbot that we 've been building for a bunch of years it 's a military surveillance robot to go in ahead of. troops looking. at caves for instance <unk> but we had to make it fairly robust <unk> much more robust than the robots we build in our labs. <unk> on board that robot is a pc running linux <unk> it can withstand a 400g shock. <unk> the robot has local intelligence it. can. flip itself over can get itself into communication range can go upstairs by itself et cetera. <unk> it 's doing local navigation there a soldier gives it a command to. go upstairs and it does . that was not a controlled descent . now it 's going to head off . <unk> we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening <unk> couldn 't do a lot in the main rubble pile things were just too. there was nothing left to do but we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated . and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into. <unk> companions are helping to reduce the combat risks <unk> nick robertson has that story. <unk> in afghanistan every day <unk> and that 's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening. <unk> sea change happening in how. where technology 's going thanks and. over the next couple of months we 're going to be. sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground <unk> . very hostile environments one hundred and fifty c ten thousand psi. <unk> autonomous robots going down doing this sort of work but robots like this they 're a little hard to program . how in the future are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use <unk> and i want to actually use a robot here a robot named chris. stand up <unk> yeah <unk> okay <unk> come over here <unk> now notice he. thinks robots have to be a bit. <unk> i 'm going to show this robot a task it 's a very complex task. <unk> now notice he nodded there he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication <unk> and if i 'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me and regulated the conversation . so now i brought this up. <unk> looked at his eyes <unk> and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top . and i 'm doing this task here and he 's checking up his eyes are going back and forth up to me to see what i 'm looking at so we 've got shared attention . and so i do this task <unk> and he looks and he looks to me to see what 's happening next and now i 'll give him. the bottle and we 'll see if he can do the task can you do that okay he. 's pretty good <unk>. <unk> i didn 't show you how to do that now see if you can put it back together . laughter and he thinks a robot has to be really slow <unk> good robot that 's good so we saw a bunch of things there <unk> we saw. when we 're interacting we 're trying to show someone how to do something we direct their visual attention the other thing communicates. their internal state to us whether he 's understanding or not regulates a social interaction there was shared attention. <unk> looking at the same sort of thing and recognizing socially. communicated reinforcement at the end <unk> and we 've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you 're going to want to interact with robots in the future <unk> . i just want to show you one technical diagram here the most important thing. for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system because what it pays attention to is what it 's seeing and interacting with and what. <unk> 're understanding what it 's doing so in the videos i 'm about to show you you 're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has. it looks for skin tone in hsv space so it works across all human. colorings it looks for highly saturated colors from toys and it looks for things that move around and it weights those together into an attention window and it looks for the. <unk> place the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening and that is what its eyes then segue. to . and it looks right at that at the same time some top down sort of stuff might decide that it 's lonely and look for skin tone or might decide that it 's bored and look for a toy to play with and so these weights change and over here. <unk> on the right this is what we call the steven spielberg memorial module <unk> did people see the movie ai rb yeah it was really bad but. remember especially when haley joel osment the little robot <unk> looked at the blue fairy for two thousand years without taking. his eyes off it well this gets rid of that because. this is a habituation gaussian that gets negative and more and more intense as it looks at one thing and it gets. <unk> so it will then look away at something else so <unk> once you 've got that and here 's a robot here. 's kismet looking around for a toy <unk> . you can tell what it 's looking at you can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera <unk> . and you can tell when it 's actually seeing the toy and it 's got a little bit of an emotional response here . laughter but it 's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view such as cynthia breazeal. the builder of this robot from the right it sees her pays attention to her <unk> . kismet has an underlying three dimensional emotional space a vector space of where it is. emotionally and at different places in that space <unk> it expresses. <unk> so it 's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice <unk> . and when i was dealing with my robot over here <unk> . chris the robot was measuring the prosody in my voice <unk> and so we have the robot measure prosody for four. <unk> basic messages that mothers give their children. here we 've got naive subjects praising the robot. <unk> it smiles she imitates the smile this happens a lot these are naive subjects here we asked them to get the robot 's attention. and indicate when they have the robot 's attention. <unk> here they 're asked to prohibit the robot and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner. <unk> we put that together then we put in turn taking when we talk to someone we talk then we sort of raise our eyebrows <unk> . move our eyes give the other person the idea it 's their turn to talk <unk> and then they talk and then we pass the baton back and forth. between each between each other so we put this. <unk> in the robot we got a bunch of naive subjects in we didn 't tell them anything about the robot <unk> sat them down in front of the robot and said talk to the robot <unk> now what they didn 't know was the robot wasn 't understanding a word they said <unk> . and that the robot wasn 't speaking english it was just saying random english phonemes and i want you to watch carefully at the beginning of this where this person ritchie who happened to talk to the robot. <unk> i want to show you my watch and he brings. the watch center into the robot 's field of vision points to it gives it a motion cue and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully we don 't know whether he understood or not that the robot. notice the. <unk> and they successfully have that sort of communication <unk> and here 's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing. christie looks over at this toy <unk> the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she 's looking at . so we 're going to see more and more of this sort of robot. over the next few years in in labs <unk> but then the big questions two big questions that people ask me are . if we make these robots more and more human like will we accept them will we will they need rights. eventually. <unk> and the other question people ask me is will they want to take over . and on the first you know this has been a very hollywood theme with lots of movies you probably recognize these characters here. where in each of these cases the robots want more respect <unk> well do you ever need to give robots respect they. 're just machines after all <unk> but i think you know we have to accept that we are just machines after all. <unk> 's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us you don 't see a description of. how you know <unk> molecule a you know comes up and docks with this other molecule <unk> and it 's moving forward you. know propelled by various charges <unk> and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect it 's all mechanistic we are. <unk> if we are machines then in principle at least <unk> we should be able to build machines out of other stuff <unk> which are just as as. alive as we are <unk> but i think for us to admit that we have to give up on our special ness in a certain way and we 've had the. retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years at least <unk> five hundred years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe. when the earth. <unk> started to go around the sun one. hundred and fifty years ago with darwin we had to give up the idea we were different from animals <unk> and to imagine you know it 's always hard for us <unk> recently we 've been battered with the idea <unk>. that maybe we didn 't even have our own creation event here on earth which people didn 't like much and then the human genome said maybe we only have thirty five thousand genes and that was really. <unk> so you know having the idea that robots could really have emotions or that robots could be living creatures i think is going to be hard for us to accept <unk> but we 're going to come to accept it over the next. fifty years or so.
