 <unk> i 'd like to apologize first of all to all of you because i have no form of powerpoint presentation. <unk> so what i 'm going to do is every now and again i will make this gesture <unk> and in a moment of powerpoint democracy <unk> you can imagine what you 'd like to. i do a radio show the radio show is called the infinite monkey cage it 's about science it 's about rationalism so therefore we get a lot of complaints every single week. complaints including one we get very often <unk> which is to say the very title infinite monkey cage celebrates the idea of. <unk> we have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy . laughter we also had someone else who said ' the infinite monkey cage ' idea is ridiculous an infinite number of monkeys could never write the works of shakespeare <unk> . we know this because they did an experiment . yes they gave twelve monkeys a typewriter for a week and after a week they. <unk> the main element though the main complaint we get and one that i find most worrying is that people say oh <unk> why do you insist on ruining the magic <unk> . you bring in science and it ruins the magic now i 'm an arts graduate i love myth and magic and existentialism and <unk>. <unk> self loathing that 's what i do <unk> . but i also don 't understand how it does ruin the magic all of the magic i think that may well be taken away by science. is then replaced by something as wonderful astrology for instance like many rationalists i 'm a pisces now. astrology we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted that you 'll perhaps today <unk> meet a lucky man who 's wearing a hat. <unk> that is gone <unk> but if we want to look at the sky and see predictions we still can we can see predictions of galaxies forming of galaxies colliding into each other <unk>. of new solar systems this is a wonderful thing if the sun could one day and indeed the earth in fact if the earth. <unk> that to me as well that if you think i 'm worried about losing worlds well many worlds theory one of the most beautiful fascinating sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation is a wonderful thing . that every person here every decision that you 've made today every decision you 've made in your life you 've not really made that decision but in fact. <unk> every single permutation of those decisions is made each one going off into a new universe <unk> that is a wonderful idea . if you ever think that your life is rubbish <unk> . always remember there 's another you that 's made much worse decisions than that . if you ever think ah i want to end it all don 't end it all remember that in the majority of universes you don 't even exist in the first place. <unk> this to me in its own strange way. <unk> is very very comforting now reincarnation that 's another thing gone the afterlife but it 's not gone science actually says. we will live forever. <unk> well there is one proviso. <unk> we won 't actually live forever you won 't live forever your consciousness the you ness of you the me ness of me that that gets this one go <unk> . but every single thing that makes us. <unk> every atom in us <unk> . has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things we have been mountains and apples and pulsars <unk>. and other people 's knees who knows maybe one of your atoms was once napoleon 's knee <unk> that is a good thing <unk> unlike the occupants of the universe the universe itself is not wasteful we are. <unk> all totally recyclable <unk> and when we die we don 't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs this is a wonderful thing <unk> . understanding to me does not remove the wonder and the joy . for instance my wife could turn to me and she may say why do you love me . and i can with all honesty look her in the eye and say. matched our olfactory receptors . though i 'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well and. that that is a wonderful thing there love does not die because of that thing. <unk> pain doesn 't go away either this is a terrible thing <unk> even though i understand pain if someone punches me and because of my personality this is recently a regular occurrence. i. <unk> understand where the pain comes from it is basically momentum to energy where the four vector is constant that that 's what it is but at no point can i react and go ha . is that the best <unk>. <unk> fourth vector constant you 've got no i just spit out a tooth and that is all of these different things the love for my child. i have a son his name is archie <unk> i 'm very lucky because he 's better than all the other children <unk> . now i know you don 't think that you may well have your own children and think oh no my child 's best that 's the wonderful thing about evolution the predilection to believe <unk>. that our child is best <unk> now in many ways that 's just a survival thing the fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes . <unk> unconditionally love that is a wonderful thing <unk> though i should say that my son is best and is better than your children <unk> i 've. done some tests <unk> and. all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework for instance <unk> perhaps you. been at home for a week on your own you house is in a terrible state your partner is about to return you think what should i do do nothing . all you have to do is when she walks in using a quantum interpretation say i 'm so sorry <unk> i stopped observing the house for a moment and when i started observing again <unk> . everything had happened . that 's. the strong. <unk> principle of vacuuming . for me it 's a very very important thing <unk> even on my journey up here the joy that i have on my journey up here every single time if you actually think <unk> you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful i 'm sitting on a train every time i breathe in i 'm breathing in a <unk>. atoms of oxygen <unk> i 'm sitting on a chair even though i know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways. <unk> empty space i find it comfortable i look out the window <unk> and i realize that every single time we stop and i look out that window <unk> framed in that window <unk> wherever we are . i am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet earth <unk> . if you go to the safari parks on saturn or jupiter <unk> you will be disappointed. i realize i 'm observing this with the brain the human brain the most complex thing in the known universe that to me is an incredible thing and do you know what that might be enough . steven weinberg the nobel laureate . once said the more the universe seems comprehensible <unk> the more it seems pointless now for some people that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism <unk> . but for me it doesn 't that is a wonderful. <unk> i 'm glad the universe is pointless it means if i get to the end of my life the universe can 't turn to me and go what have you been doing you idiot <unk> that 's not the point . i can make my own purpose you can make your own purpose we have the individual power to go this is what i want to do and in a pointless universe that to me is a wonderful <unk>. <unk> thing <unk> i have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation you i imagine can do much better things with your time thank you very much goodbye.
