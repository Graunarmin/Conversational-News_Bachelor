 <unk> i normally teach courses on. how to rebuild states after war <unk> but today i 've got a personal story to share with you this is a picture of my family my four. <unk> and this picture is taken in vietnam <unk> so how did a cambodian family end up in vietnam in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven . well to explain that i 've got a short video clip to explain the khmer rouge regime during. and american bombing campaigns <unk> . led by peasant born pol pot the khmer rouge evacuates people to the countryside. in order to create a rural communist utopia <unk> much like mao tse tung 's cultural revolution in china . the khmer rouge closes the doors to the outside world <unk> but after four years. <unk> the grim truth seeps out . in a country of only seven million people one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders their. bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields sophal ear so notwithstanding the 1970s narration on april <unk>. we lived in phnom penh and my parents were told by the khmer rouge to evacuate the city because of impending. american bombing for three days <unk> and here is a picture of the khmer rouge they were young soldiers typically. child soldiers and this is very normal now of modern day conflict because they 're easy to bring into wars . the reason that they gave about american bombing wasn 't all that far off i mean from one thousand nine hundred and sixty five to one thousand nine hundred and seventy three there were. more munitions that fell on cambodia than in all of world war ii japan. <unk> including the two nuclear bombs of august <unk>. the khmer rouge didn 't believe in money <unk> so the equivalent of the federal reserve bank in cambodia was bombed but not just that they actually. banned money i think it 's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used and we know money is the root of all evil but it didn 't actually stop evil from happening in cambodia in fact. <unk> my family was moved from phnom penh to pursat province this is a picture of what pursat looks like it 's actually a very pretty area of cambodia . where rice growing takes place and in fact they were forced to work the fields so my father and mother ended up. in a sort of concentration camp labor camp <unk> and it was at. <unk> that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the vietnamese were actually. asking for their citizens to go back to vietnam <unk> . and she spoke some vietnamese as a child having grown up with vietnamese friends <unk> and she decided <unk> . despite the advice of her neighbors that she would take the chance and and claim to be vietnamese so that. we could have a chance to survive because at this point they 're forcing everybody to work and they 're giving about. in. <unk> diet i guess they 're giving porridge with a few grains of rice and at about this time actually my father. got very sick <unk> and he didn 't speak vietnamese so. he died actually in january one thousand nine hundred and seventy six and it. made it possible in fact for us to take on this plan so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev which is across from the border from. <unk> vietnam <unk> and there they had a detention camp where. alleged vietnamese would be tested <unk> language tested <unk> and my mother 's vietnamese was so bad that. to make to make our story more credible she 'd given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names but she 'd given the boys girls ' names <unk> and the. <unk> it wasn 't until she met a vietnamese lady who told her this and then tutored her for two days. intensively that she was able to go into her exam and you know this was a moment of truth. <unk> if she fails we 're all headed to the gallows if she passes <unk> we can leave to vietnam <unk> and she actually of course i 'm here she passes <unk> . and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side and then onwards to chau doc <unk> and this is a picture of hong ngu vietnam today. idyllic place on the mekong delta but for us it meant freedom and freedom from from persecution from the khmer rouge. <unk> last year the khmer rouge tribunal which the u n is helping cambodia take on started and i decided that as a matter of record i should file a civil complaint with the tribunal. about my father 's passing away and i got word last month that. <unk> complaint was officially accepted by the khmer rouge tribunal <unk> and it 's for me a matter of. justice for history and accountability for the future because cambodia remains a pretty. lawless place at times <unk> five years ago my mother and i went back to chau doc and she was able to return to a place that. <unk> just come out of cambodia i 'm happy actually today to present her she 's here today with us in the audience <unk> thank you mother.
