 <unk> a guy named bob mckim he was a creativity researcher in the ' 60s and ' 70s and also led the. stanford design program and in fact my friend and ideo. <unk> studied under him at stanford and. he. liked to do an exercise with his students. where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them their neighbor <unk> . very quickly just as quickly as they could <unk> and in fact were going to do that exercise right now <unk> you all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper. <unk> bunch of circles on it <unk> i need you to turn that piece of paper over you should find that its blank on the other side <unk> <unk> and there should be a pencil <unk> and. i want you to pick somebody thats seated next to you and when i say go youve got thirty seconds to draw your neighbor. <unk> seconds youd better be fast come on those masterpieces. <unk> i think i probably am. and thats exactly thats exactly what happens every time every time you do this with adults <unk> mckim found this every time he did it with his students he got exactly the same. <unk> he would point this out as evidence. that we fear the judgment of our peers <unk> and that were embarrassed about showing our ideas. to to people we think of as our peers to those around us. and this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our. <unk> so we might have a wild idea but were afraid to share it with with anybody else <unk> ok so if you try the same exercise with kids they have no embarrassment at all . they just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever whoever wants to. wants to look at it <unk> but as they learn to become adults they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others <unk>. <unk> they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed. and in studies of of kids playing its been shown time after time that. kids who feel secure <unk> who are in a kind of trusted environment theyre the ones that feel. feel most free to play <unk> and if youre starting a design firm lets say <unk> then you probably also want to create. a place where people have the same kind of. <unk> security where they have the same kind of security to take risks maybe have the same kind of security to play <unk> . before founding ideo <unk> david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company. where all the employees are my best friends now <unk> that wasnt just. <unk> he knew that friendship is a short short cut to play <unk> and. he knew that it gives us a sense of trust <unk> and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers and so that decision to. work with his friends now he has five hundred and fifty of them. was was what got. <unk> and our studios like i think many creative workplaces today are designed to help people. feel relaxed <unk> familiar with their surroundings <unk> comfortable with the people that theyre working with . it takes more than decor but <unk> i think weve all seen that. creative companies. do often have. <unk> symbols in the workplace that <unk>. remind people to be playful . and that its a permissive environment so whether its this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at ideo <unk> or at pixar where the animators work in. wooden huts and decorated caves <unk> or at the googleplex where its famous for its [ beach ] volleyball courts <unk> and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on. <unk> dont know the reason for the pink flamingos <unk> but anyway theyre there in the garden <unk> or even in the swiss office of google which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all and my theory is thats so the swiss can prove to their californian colleagues that theyre not boring <unk> so they have the slide and they even have a <unk>. what they do with that but they have one <unk> so all of these places have these symbols now <unk> our big symbol. at ideo is actually not so much the place <unk> its a thing <unk> and its actually something that we invented a few years ago or created a few years ago its a toy. <unk> its called a finger blaster and i forgot to bring one up with me so if somebody can reach under the chair thats next to them <unk> youll find something taped underneath it thats great if you could pass it up thanks david i appreciate it . so this is a finger blaster <unk> and. you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair <unk> and im going to run a little experiment . another little experiment but before we start i need just. <unk> to put these on thank you . all right now. <unk> what im going to do is im going to see how i cant see out of these ok <unk> im going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage <unk> <unk> so the way they work is you know. you just. put your finger in the thing <unk> pull them back and off you go so <unk> . <unk> my only recommendation here i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage. <unk> theyre still coming in from the back there theyre still coming in some of you havent fired them yet can you not figure out how to do it or something its not that. hard most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first ten seconds when they pick it up all. right <unk> this is pretty good <unk> this is pretty good <unk> okay all right lets. i suppose we 'd better i. <unk> the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly boring and then you can fire at me all right i think im going to take these off now because i cant see a damn thing when ive. all right. <unk> so we have the finger blasters other people have dinosaurs <unk> you know why do we have them well as i said we have them because we think maybe playfulness. is is important but why is it important <unk> . we use it in a pretty pragmatic way to be honest. <unk> we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions helps us do our jobs better and helps us feel better when when we do them now. <unk> an adult encountering a new situation. when we encounter a new situation we we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can you know. and theres a reason for that. <unk> we want to settle on an answer lifes complicated we want to figure out whats going on around us very quickly <unk> i suspect. <unk> that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categorize new things. very very quickly one of them might be you know when we see this funny stripy thing. is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us or is it just some weird shadows on the tree we need to figure that out pretty fast well at least we did once most of us dont need to anymore i suppose this is some aluminum foil right you use it in the kitchen thats what it is. <unk> now theyll certainly when they come across something new theyll certainly ask . what is it of course they will but theyll also ask what can i do with it and you know . the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example <unk> and this openness is the beginning of exploratory play. any parents of young kids in the audience. our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them <unk> and. you know from an exploration perspective . this behavior makes complete sense because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy even one like say <unk> tickle me elmo which despite its ingenuity. <unk> really only does one thing <unk> whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices <unk> . so again this is another one of those playful activities that as we get older we tend to forget and we have to relearn. <unk> so another one of bob mckims favorite exercises is called the thirty circles test so were back to work you guys are going to get back to work again. <unk> turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over and youll find those. <unk> printed on the piece of paper so it should look like this you should be looking at something like this so what im going to do is im going to give you minute <unk> . and i want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form so for example you could turn one into a football. or another one into a sun all im interested in is quantity i want you to do as many of them as you can in the minute that im just about to give you so everybody ready. <unk> put down your pencils as they say <unk> . so who got more than five circles figured out <unk> hopefully everybody more than ten keep your hands up if you did ten fifteen. anybody get all thirty no oh somebody did fantastic . did anybody to a variation on a theme like a smiley face <unk> happy face <unk> sad face sleepy face <unk> anybody do that. <unk> anybody use my examples <unk> the sun and the football great <unk> cool. <unk> so i was really interested in quantity i wasnt actually very interested in whether they were all different i just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. <unk> and one of the things we tend to do as adults again is. we edit things we stop ourselves from doing things we self edit as were having ideas and in some cases our desire to be original. is actually a form of editing <unk> and. that actually isnt necessarily really really playful so that ability just to just to go for it and explore. <unk> lots of things even if they dont seem that different from each other is actually something that kids do well and it is a form of play <unk> . so now bob mckim did another version of this test in a in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s anybody know what this is <unk> . its the peyote. <unk> its the plant from which you can create mescaline one of the psychedelic drugs for those of you around in the ' 60s you probably know it well <unk> mckim published a paper in one thousand nine <unk>. describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. <unk> them to come along one evening and to bring a problem. with them that they that they were working on . he gave each of them some mescaline <unk> and had them listen to some nice relaxing music for a while. <unk> and then he did. whats called the purdue. <unk> how many uses can you find for a paper clip its basically the same thing as the thirty circles thing that i just had you do. <unk> now actually he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs to see. what the difference was in peoples. facility and speed with coming up coming up with ideas <unk> and then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that. <unk> that theyd been working on <unk> and so some of the things that they figured out some of these individuals figured out in one case a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients . a design of a solar space probe experiment a redesign of the linear electron accelerator . an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder you can tell this is a while ago. <unk> completion of a line of furniture <unk> and even a new conceptual model of the photon so it was a pretty successful evening . in fact <unk> maybe this experiment was the reason that silicon valley got off to its great start with innovation <unk> we dont know but it may be we need to ask some of the ceos whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment <unk> but really it wasnt the drugs. that were important it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking <unk> and getting them. <unk> to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas <unk> . but its hard to break our habits our adult habits . at ideo we have brainstorming brainstorming rules written on the walls <unk> edicts like defer judgment . or go for quantity and somehow that seems wrong i mean <unk> can you have rules about creativity. <unk> it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise. we might bring to the creative process and weve certainly learnt that over time you get much better brainstorming much more creative outcomes. when everybody does play by the rules now of course many designers many individual designers <unk> achieve this is in a much more organic way i think the <unk>. <unk> are wonderful examples of experimentation and they experimented with. <unk> plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind <unk> they were exploring following. what was interesting to them <unk>. they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war i think and from this experiment they moved on to chairs through constant experimentation with materials they developed a wide range of iconic solutions. we know today eventually resulting in of course the legendary lounge chair now if the eameses had stopped with that first great solution <unk> then we wouldnt be the beneficiaries of so many. wonderful designs today. <unk> and of course they used experimentation in all aspects of their work <unk> from films to buildings from. games to graphics so theyre great examples i think of exploration and experimentation in design now while the. the <unk> eameses were exploring those possibilities they were also exploring physical objects <unk> and they were doing that through building prototypes and building is the next of the behaviors that i thought id talk about . so the average. western first grader spends as much as fifty percent of their play time taking part in whats called construction. <unk> but also a powerful way to learn. when play is about building a tower out of blocks the kid begins to learn a lot about towers and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again. learning is happening as a sort of by product of play its classically learning by doing. <unk> now <unk> david kelley calls this behavior when its carried out by designers thinking with your hands and it typically involves. <unk> making multiple low resolution prototypes very quickly often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution <unk>. on one of his earliest projects <unk> the team was kind of stuck and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together. a prototype made from a roll on deodorant <unk> now <unk> that became the first commercial computer mouse for the apple lisa and the macintosh. learned their way. to that by building by building prototypes . another example is a group of of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons <unk> they were meeting with them they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device <unk>. <unk> and one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium and a clothespin he taped them all together ran back. <unk> into the room and said you mean something like this and the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said well i want to hold it like this or like that and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design. around a tangible. a tangible object <unk> and in the end it turned into. a real device and so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world and having your thinking advanced as a result. <unk> at ideo theres a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment <unk> the prototyping carts <unk> filled with. colored paper and play doh and glue sticks and stuff i mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them but the important idea is that everythings at hand everythings around so when designers are working on ideas they can start building stuff. whenever they want they dont necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal. <unk> workshop to do it and we think thats pretty important <unk> . and then the sad thing is although preschools are full of this kind of stuff . as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away they lose this stuff that facilitates this sort. of playful and building mode of thinking <unk> and of course by the time you get to the average workplace <unk> . maybe the best construction tool we have might be the. but by giving project teams. and. <unk> and the clients who theyre working with permission to think with their hands <unk> quite complex ideas can can. spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily <unk> this is a nurse using a very simple as you can see plasticine. <unk> explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her. in a hospital and just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way . and of course by building quick prototypes <unk> we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if were trying to describe them. through through words. <unk> but what about designing something that isnt physical something like a service or an experience something that exists as a series of interactions over time instead of <unk>. of building play this can be approached with role play so if youre designing an interaction between two people such as i dont know ordering. food at a fast food joint or something you need to be able to imagine how that experience. <unk> might feel over a period of time <unk> and i think the best way to achieve that and get a feeling for any flaws in your design is to act it out. <unk> so we do quite a lot of work at ideo trying to convince our clients of this they can be a little skeptical ill come back to that <unk> . but a place <unk> i think where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems. things like education or security or finance or health <unk> and this is another example in a healthcare. <unk> environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care but you know <unk> many adults are pretty reluctant to engage. with role play some of its embarrassment and some of it is because they just dont believe that what emerges is necessarily valid. they dismiss an interesting interaction by saying you know thats just happening because theyre acting it out research into kids ' behavior actually suggests that its worth. <unk> taking role playing seriously <unk> . because when children play a role <unk> they actually follow social scripts quite closely that theyve learnt from us as adults <unk> if one kid plays store and another ones playing house then the whole kind of play falls down so they get used to. quite quickly to. to understanding the rules for social. <unk> actually quite quick to point out when theyre broken <unk> . so when as adults we role play . then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized weve gone through lots of experiences in life . and they provide a strong intuition intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work <unk> so were very good when acting out a solution <unk> . at spotting whether something lacks. <unk> quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences another way for us as designers to explore role play is to put ourselves. through an experience which were designing for. and project ourselves into an experience <unk> so here are some designers <unk> who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane <unk> and so they grabbed some very simple. <unk> just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite <unk> quite small places on on airplanes this is one of our designers kristian simsarian and hes <unk>. <unk> putting himself through the experience of being an er patient now this is a real hospital in a real emergency room one of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didnt want the doctors and nurses thinking. <unk> he was actually sick and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later so anyhow <unk> he went there with his video camera. <unk> and its kind of interesting to see what he brought back because when we when we looked at the video when he got back we saw twenty minutes of this . and also the amazing thing about this about this video as soon as you see it you immediately project. <unk> know what it feels like all of that uncertainty while youre left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case. in one of the emergency rooms wondering what the hecks going on <unk> and so this notion of using <unk>. or in this case living through the experience as a way of creating empathy particularly when you use video is really powerful <unk> or another one of our designers altay sendil hes here having his chest waxed not because hes very vain although actually he is no. im kidding. but in order to empathize with. <unk> pain that chronic care patients go through when theyre having dressings removed <unk> . and so sometimes these analogous experiences analogous role play can also be quite valuable so. when a kid dresses up as a firefighter <unk> you know hes beginning to try on that identity he wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter were doing the same thing as designers were trying on these experiences <unk> . and so the idea of. <unk> as an empathy tool as well as a tool for prototyping experiences <unk> and you know <unk> we kind of admire. people who do this. at ideo anyway not just because they lead to insights about the experience but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves. to the experience in short we admire their willingness to play. playful exploration playful building and role play those are some of the ways that designers. use play in their work <unk> and so far i admit . this might feel like its a message just to go out and play like a kid <unk> and to certain extent it is. <unk> i want to stress a couple of points the first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. play has rules especially when its group play <unk>. when kids play tea party or they play cops and robbers theyre following a script that theyve agreed to . and its this code negotiation. that leads to productive play <unk> so remember the sketching task we did at the beginning the kind of little face. <unk> portrait you did well imagine. if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist <unk>. <unk> bought the next round of drinks that framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing difficult situation into a fun game as a result. <unk> all feel perfectly secure and and have a good. <unk> but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together <unk> but there arent just. rules about how to play <unk> there are rules about when to play <unk> kids dont play all the time <unk> obviously. <unk> they transition in and out of it and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences <unk> as designers. we need to be able to transition in and out of play also and if were running design studios we need to be able to figure out how can we transition designers through. through these different experiences <unk> i think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of i think whats very different about design. is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation <unk> we go through. a sort of generative mode where were exploring many ideas <unk> and then we come back together again. come back looking for that solution and developing that solution <unk> i think theyre two quite different modes. divergence and convergence <unk> and i think its probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness . perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious and so being able to move between those modes is really really. <unk> a more nuanced version view of play i think is required because its very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute youre either playful or youre serious and you cant be both. <unk> but. thats not really true you can be a serious professional adult and at times be playful <unk> its not an either or. <unk> trust to play <unk> and we need trust to be creative <unk> so theres a connection <unk> . and there are a series of behaviors that weve learnt as kids <unk> and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers <unk> they include exploration . which is about going for quantity . building and thinking with your. <unk> where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which were designing and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic.
