 <unk> i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine . my lab at the swiss federal institute of technology. focuses on spinal cord injury. <unk> affects more than fifty thousand people around the world. every year with dramatic consequences for affected individuals <unk> whose life literally shatters. in a matter of a handful of seconds . and for me <unk> the man of steel <unk> christopher reeve has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured. <unk> and this is how i started my own personal journey in this field of research working with the christopher and dana reeve foundation <unk> i still remember. this decisive moment it was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation <unk> chris addressed us the scientists. and. experts you have to be more pragmatic when leaving your laboratory tomorrow <unk> i want you to stop by the rehabilitation center. to watch injured people fighting to take a step <unk> struggling to maintain their trunk <unk> . and when you go home think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better . these words they stuck with me <unk> . this was more than ten years. <unk> ever since my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury . and my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well controlled experimental conditions <unk> . and for this purpose <unk> we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body <unk> they completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord. complete and permanent paralysis of the leg . but as observed . after most injuries in humans there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur <unk> . but how to make it happen <unk> . well <unk> the classical approach consists. of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber. <unk> to the original target <unk> and while this certainly remained the key for a cure this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me . to reach clinical fruition rapidly it was obvious <unk> i had to think about the problem differently it. turned out that more than one hundred years of research. on spinal cord physiology <unk> starting with the nobel prize. <unk> that. the spinal cord <unk> below most injuries <unk> contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion . but because input from the brain is interrupted. <unk> they are in a nonfunctional state like kind of dormant my idea <unk> we awaken this network . <unk> fellow in los angeles after completing my ph d in france <unk> where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted . i was. afraid to talk to my new boss <unk> . but decided to muster up my courage i knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor reggie edgerton to share my new idea <unk> . he listened to me carefully <unk> and responded with a grin. <unk> grin why don 't you try . and i promise to you this was such an important moment in my career . when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas . and this was the idea <unk> i 'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated. <unk> the locomotor system is a car. <unk> the engine is the spinal cord the transmission is interrupted <unk> the engine is turned off how could we re engage the engine . first we have to provide the fuel . second press the accelerator pedal <unk> third steer the car <unk> it turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion my idea <unk> replace this missing input. provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk . for this i leveraged twenty years of past research in neuroscience first. to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire <unk>. <unk> to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation so here imagine an electrode. implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation it took many years but eventually we developed an electrochemical <unk>. that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state <unk> . <unk> as soon as the treadmill belt starts moving <unk> the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg <unk> . but without the brain <unk> . here what i call the spinal brain cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle. <unk> i was. completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain <unk> but at the same time so frustrated <unk> . this locomotion was completely involuntary <unk> the animal had virtually no control over the legs <unk> clearly <unk> the steering system was. <unk> missing . and it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm <unk> . stepping on a treadmill <unk> and develop conditions that would encourage. the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg . with this in mind we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in. <unk> any direction of space imagine this is really cool so imagine the little <unk> 200 gram rat. attached at the extremity of this 200 kilo robot <unk> but the rat does not feel the robot <unk> the robot is transparent . just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure. <unk> me summarize the rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord <unk> the electrochemical <unk>. enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks the robot. provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs <unk> . and for motivation we used what i think is the most powerful pharmacology of switzerland <unk> . fine swiss chocolate. laughter actually the first results were very very . very disappointing here. is my best physical therapist. <unk> the rat to take a single step <unk> whereas the same rat five minutes earlier <unk> walked beautifully on the treadmill <unk> we were so frustrated <unk> . but you know one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance <unk> . we insisted we refined our paradigm <unk> and after several months of training <unk> . <unk> and whenever she decided initiated full weight bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards . this is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis . in fact. <unk> initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground . they could even adjust leg movement for example to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase . i can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory . it took us ten years of hard work to reach this goal <unk> . but the remaining question. <unk> was how i mean how is it possible <unk> and here what we found was completely unexpected <unk> this. novel training paradigm. encouraged the brain to create new connections <unk> some relay circuits. that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control. over the locomotor networks below the injury . and here you can see one such example <unk> where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red <unk> . this blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center . and what this constellation. of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. but the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area it occurred throughout the central nervous system <unk> . including in the brain stem <unk> where we observed. increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain <unk> we did not aim to repair the spinal cord <unk> yet. we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling. <unk> of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury . and there is a very important message. hidden behind this discovery <unk> . they are the result of a young team of. <unk> have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals <unk> this is truly a <unk>. <unk> team they are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of dna <unk> we are creating the next generation of m d '. <unk> capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside <unk> and me <unk> . i am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony now i am sure. you are all wondering. <unk> enough yet <unk> this is certainly not a cure. for spinal cord injury <unk> but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery. and people 's quality of life i would like you all. to take a moment and dream with me <unk> imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. after a few weeks of recovery <unk> . we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord <unk> . at the same time <unk> we will implant an electrode array a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement. <unk> and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person 's needs <unk> this defines. a personalized electrochemical <unk>. that will enable locomotion. during training with a newly designed supporting system <unk> . and my hope is that after several months of training there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion. without the robot. <unk> even without pharmacology or stimulation <unk> my hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition. to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord <unk> and this is a radically new concept. that may apply to other neurological disorders <unk> what i termed. <unk> interfaces <unk> i implanted throughout the nervous system . in the brain in the spinal cord <unk> even in peripheral nerves <unk> based on. impairments <unk> but not to replace the lost function <unk> no to help the brain help. <unk> this enticed your imagination because i can promise to you. this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur <unk> but when . and remember <unk> we are only as great as our imagination as big as our dream <unk> . thank you.
