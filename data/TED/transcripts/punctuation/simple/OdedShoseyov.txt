 <unk> two hundred years. of modern science . we have to admit that our performance is not great the machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures <unk> . <unk> the houses we build. do not survive severe earthquakes but we shouldn 't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason they didn 't have much time . two hundred years is not a lot of time <unk> while nature. had three billion years. to perfect some of the most amazing materials that we wish we had in our possession <unk> . remember these materials carry a quality assurance. of three billion years. take for example sequoia trees <unk> they carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years. in cold weather <unk> in warm climates uv light <unk> . yet <unk> if you look at the structure by high resolution electron microscopy <unk> and you ask yourself what is it made of surprisingly. <unk> made of sugar <unk> . well not exactly as we drink in our tea it 's actually a nanofiber called nanocrystalline cellulose <unk> and this nanocrystalline cellulose. is so strong on a weight basis <unk> it 's about ten times stronger than steel <unk> yet it 's made of sugar <unk> . so scientists all over the world believe that <unk>. is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry <unk> but here 's the. <unk> problem say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose to build a boat or an airplane <unk> well <unk> you can google you can ebay you can even alibaba . you won 't find it of course you 're going to find. thousands of scientific papers great papers where scientists are going to say this is a great. <unk> lots of things we can do with it but no commercial source <unk> . so we at the hebrew university <unk> together with our partners in sweden decided to focus on the development. process to produce this <unk>. <unk> of course <unk> we didn 't want to cut trees <unk> so we were looking for another source of raw material <unk> and we found one. in fact <unk> the sludge of the paper industry. the reason <unk> there is a lot of it europe alone produces eleven million tons of that material annually it. 's the equivalent. of a mountain three kilometers high <unk> sitting on a soccer field . and we produce this mountain every year <unk> so for everybody <unk> it 's an environmental problem <unk> and for us it 's a gold mine. so now we are actually producing on an industrial scale in israel <unk> nanocellulose and very soon in sweden . we can do a lot of things with the material for example <unk> . we have shown that by adding only a small percent of <unk>. into cotton fibers the same as my shirt is made of it increases its strength dramatically so this can be used for. <unk> making. amazing things like <unk> super fabrics for industrial and medical applications <unk> but this is not the only thing . for example. <unk> structures like the shelters that you can see now actually are now showcasing in the venice biennale. <unk> nature actually didn 't stop its wonders. in the plant kingdom <unk> . think about insects cat fleas for example have the ability to jump about a hundred times their height . that 's amazing <unk> it 's the equivalent of a person standing in the middle of liberty island. in new york. <unk> and in a single jump going to the top. of the statue of liberty . i 'm sure everybody would like to do that . so the question is how do cat fleas do it it turns out they make this wonderful material <unk> which is called resilin . in simple words resilin which is a protein . is the most. elastic. <unk> you can squish it and it doesn 't lose almost any energy to the environment. when you release it snap it brings back all the energy <unk> . so i 'm sure everybody would like to have that material <unk> but here 's the problem . to catch cat fleas is difficult. <unk> it 's actually enough to catch one now we can extract its dna and read how cat fleas make the resilin and clone it. into a less jumpy organism. like a plant <unk> . so that 's exactly what we did <unk> now we have the ability to produce lots of resilin well <unk> my team decided to do something really cool at the university. <unk> decided to combine the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom. nanocellulose with resilin and the result is amazing . this material <unk> in fact is tough elastic and transparent <unk> . so there are lots of things that can be done with this material for example. <unk> shoes <unk> so we can jump higher <unk> run faster and even touch screens for computers. and smartphones that won 't break <unk> well <unk> the problem is we continue. to implant synthetic implants in our body <unk> which we glue and screw. into our body <unk> and i 'm going to say that this is not a good idea <unk> why <unk> because they fail this synthetic. <unk> fails just like this. plastic fork . that is not strong enough for its performance . but sometimes they are too strong <unk> and therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit their surrounding tissues <unk> . but in fact the reason is much more fundamental <unk> the reason is. that in nature there is no one there. that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck. or takes my skin and glues it onto my body <unk> . in nature everything is self assembled . so every living cell <unk> whether coming from a plant insect or human being has a dna. that encodes for <unk> nanobio building blocks many times they are proteins other times they are enzymes that make other materials like polysaccharides. <unk> fatty acids and the common feature about all these materials. is that they need no one they recognize each other and <unk> self assemble into structures. scaffolds on which cells are proliferating. to give tissues <unk> they develop into organs and together bring. <unk> so we at the hebrew university about ten years ago decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial. for humans which is collagen <unk> . why collagen <unk> because collagen accounts for about twenty five percent of our dry weight we have nothing more than collagen <unk> other than water . in our body <unk> . so i always like to say anyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings. <unk> like to have collagen . admittedly before we started our project there were already more than one thousand medical implants made of collagen you. know simple things like dermal fillers. to reduce wrinkles <unk> augment lips and other more sophisticated medical implants like heart valves <unk> so where is the problem well. the problem is the source the source of. <unk> all that collagen is actually coming from dead bodies <unk> dead pigs <unk> dead cows. and even human cadavers <unk> so safety is a big issue <unk> . but it 's not the only one also the quality now here i have a personal interest this is my. <unk> in our winery in israel a heart valve very similar to the one that i showed you before seven years ago was implanted in his body <unk> . now the scientific literature says that these heart valves. start to fail. ten years after the operation . no wonder they are made from old used tissues <unk> just like this. wall made of bricks that is falling apart yeah. of course i can take those bricks and and build a new wall <unk> but it 's not going to be the same <unk> so the us food and drug administration. made a notice already in two thousand and seven asking the companies to start to look for better alternatives <unk> . so that 's exactly what we did <unk> . we decided to clone. all the five human genes responsible for making. type i collagen in humans. into a transgenic. tobacco plant <unk> so now the plant has the ability to make human collagen. brand new untouched <unk> this is amazing actually it 's happening now <unk> today in israel we. <unk> thousand square meters of greenhouses all over the country <unk> . the farmers receive small plantlets of tobacco it looks exactly like regular tobacco <unk> except that they have five human genes they 're. responsible for making type i collagen <unk> . we grow them for about fifty to seventy days <unk> . we harvest the leaves and then the leaves are transported by cooling trucks to the factory there the process of extracting the collagen starts. now <unk> if you ever made a pesto essentially the same thing . you crush the leaves <unk> you get the juice that contains the collagen we. concentrate the protein transfer the protein to clean rooms for the final purification and the end result. is a collagen identical to what we have in our body. untouched brand new and from which we. <unk> make different medical implants bone void fillers for example <unk> for severe. bone fractures <unk> spinal fusion and more recently even we 've been able to launch into the market. here in europe a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers. <unk> that is now approved for use in the clinic <unk> this is not science fiction this is happening now we are using plants. to make medical implants for replacement parts for human beings . in fact more recently we 've been able to make collagen fibers which are six times stronger than the achilles tendon <unk>. that 's amazing. together with our partners from ireland <unk> we thought about the next thing. to those fibers by doing that we 've been able to make a superfiber which is about three hundred and eighty percent. tougher and three hundred percent more elastic . so oddly enough in the future <unk> when a patient is transplanted with. artificial tendons. <unk> have better performance after the surgery than we had before the injury. <unk> so what 's for the future <unk> in the future we believe we 'll be able to make. many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us. collagen. and many more and that will enable us to make better machines perform better. <unk> heart is not going to be the same as we can get from a donor <unk> it will be better it actually will perform better. and will last longer my friend zion suliman once told me a smart. sentence <unk> he said if you want a new idea <unk> you should open an old book and i 'm going to say. that the book was written it was written over three billion years. <unk> of evolution and the text is the dna of life all we have to do. is read this text embrace nature 's gift to us and start our progress from here thank you.
