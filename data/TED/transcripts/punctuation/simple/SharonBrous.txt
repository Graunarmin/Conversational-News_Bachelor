 <unk> a new mother. and a young rabbi in the spring of two thousand and four and the world was in shambles maybe you remember every day we heard devastating reports from the. war in iraq there were waves of terror rolling across the globe it seemed like humanity was spinning out of control . i remember the night that i read about the series of coordinated bombings in the subway system in madrid <unk> . and i got up and i walked over to the crib where my six month old baby girl lay sleeping sweetly <unk> and i heard the rhythm of her breath <unk> . and i felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body we were living through a time of tectonic shifts in. <unk> ideologies in politics in religion in populations everything felt so precarious <unk> . and i remember thinking my god <unk> what kind of world did we bring this child. into <unk> and what was i as a mother. and a religious leader willing to do about it . <unk> i knew it was clear that religion would be a principle battlefield in this rapidly changing landscape <unk> and it was already clear that religion was a significant part of the problem <unk> . the question for me was could religion also be part of the solution <unk> . now throughout history people have committed horrible crimes and atrocities in the name of religion . and as we entered the 21st century it was very clear that religious extremism. was once again on the rise . our studies now show that over the course of the past fifteen twenty years <unk> hostilities and religion related violence have been on the increase all over the world . but we don 't even need the studies to prove it because i ask you how many of us are surprised today when we hear the stories of a bombing or a shooting when we later find out that the last word that was uttered before the. <unk> trigger is pulled or the bomb is detonated is the name of god . it barely raises an eyebrow today when we learn that yet another person has decided to show his love of god by taking the lives of god 's children . in america religious extremism looks like a white <unk> antiabortion christian extremist walking into planned parenthood in colorado springs. <unk> and murdering three people . it also looks like a couple inspired by the islamic state walking into an office party in san bernardino and killing fourteen <unk> and even when. extremism does not lead to violence it is still used as a political wedge issue <unk> cynically leading people to justify the subordination of women <unk> the stigmatization of lgbt people. <unk> racism islamophobia and and anti semitism this ought to concern deeply those of us who care about the future of religion. and the future of faith <unk> we need to call this what it is a great failure of religion . but the thing is this isn 't even the only challenge that religion faces today . at the very same. <unk> time that we need religion to be a strong force against extremism it is suffering from a second pernicious trend <unk> . what i call religious routine ism . this is when our institutions and our leaders are stuck in a paradigm that is rote and perfunctory devoid of life devoid of vision and devoid. <unk> let me explain what i mean like this one of the great blessings of being a rabbi is standing under the chuppah under the wedding canopy with a couple . and helping them proclaim publicly and make holy the love that they found for one another . i want to ask you now though to think maybe from your own experience or maybe just imagine it about the difference between the intensity of the experience under the wedding canopy <unk> . and maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary. and if you 're lucky enough to make it sixteen or seventeen years if you 're like most people you probably wake up in the morning realizing that you forgot <unk>. <unk> to make a reservation at your favorite restaurant and you forgot so much as a card and then you just hope and pray that your partner also forgot . to be a container in which we would hold on to the remnants of that sacred revelatory encounter that birthed the religion in the first place the problem is that after a few centuries <unk> the date remains on the calendar <unk> . but the love affair is long dead that 's when we find ourselves in endless. <unk> mindless repetitions of words that don 't mean anything to us rising and being seated because someone has asked us to holding onto jealously guarded doctrine <unk>. that 's completely and wildly out of step with our contemporary reality <unk> engaging in perfunctory practice simply because that 's the way things have always been done . <unk> across the board churches and synagogues and mosques are all complaining. about how hard it is to maintain relevance. for a generation of young people who seem completely uninterested not only in the institutions that stand at the heart of our traditions but even in religion itself <unk> . and what they need to understand. is that there is today a generation of people who are as disgusted by the violence of religious. <unk> extremism. as they are turned off by the lifelessness. of religious routine ism . of course there is a bright spot to this story <unk> . given the crisis of these two concurrent trends in religious life about twelve or thirteen years ago i set out to try to determine if there was any way that i could reclaim the heart of my own jewish. <unk> tradition to help make it meaningful and purposeful again in a world on fire <unk> . i started to wonder . what if we could harness some of the great minds of our generation and think in a bold and robust and imaginative way again about what the next iteration of religious life would look like . now we had no money no. <unk> no space no game plan but we did have email . so my friend melissa and i sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues it basically said this . before you bail on religion . why don 't we come together this friday night and see what we might make of our own jewish inheritance . we hoped maybe twenty people would show up <unk> it turned out one hundred. <unk> people came . they were cynics and seekers atheists and rabbis <unk> many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience. in their entire lives <unk> and so i set out to do the only rational thing that someone would do in such a circumstance i quit my job. and tried to build this audacious dream a reinvented rethought religious. <unk> is not alone out there in the religious landscape today there are jewish and christian and muslim and catholic religious leaders many of them women <unk> by the way . who have set out to reclaim the heart of our traditions who firmly believe that now is the time for religion to be part of the solution . we are going back into our sacred traditions. <unk> and recognizing that all of our traditions contain the raw material to justify violence and extremism and also contain the raw material to justify. compassion coexistence and kindness that when others choose to read our texts as directives for hate and vengeance we can choose to read those same texts as directives for love and for. <unk> forgiveness <unk> i have found now in communities as varied as jewish indie start ups on the coasts. to a woman 's mosque . to black churches in new york and in north carolina . to a holy bus loaded with nuns that traverses this country with a message of justice and peace . that there is a shared religious ethos that is now emerging in the form. <unk> of revitalized religion in this country . and while the theologies. and the practices vary very much between these independent communities what we can see are some common consistent threads between them i 'm going to share with you four of those commitments now . the first is wakefulness we live in a time today in which we have unprecedented access to. <unk> information about every global tragedy that happens on every corner of this earth <unk> within twelve hours twenty million people saw that image of aylan kurdi 's little body washed up on the turkish shore . we all saw this picture <unk> . we saw this picture of a <unk> five year old child pulled out of the rubble of his building in aleppo and once we see these images <unk> we are. <unk> called to a certain kind of action . my tradition tells a story of a traveler who is walking down a road when he sees a beautiful house on fire <unk> . and he says how can it be that something so beautiful would burn <unk> and nobody seems to even care so too we learn that our world is on fire <unk> and. <unk> our job to keep our hearts and our eyes open . and to recognize that it 's our responsibility to help put out the flames this is extremely difficult to do psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what 's <unk>. <unk> broken in our world the less likely we are to do anything it 's called psychic numbing we just shut down at a certain point <unk> . <unk> our job to make people uncomfortable it 's our job to wake people up to pull them out of their apathy and into the anguish <unk> and to insist that <unk>. <unk> we do what we don 't want to do and see what we do not want to see because we know that social change only happens . and hope is not an opiate hope may be the single greatest act of defiance against a politics of pessimism and against a culture. <unk> of despair <unk> because what hope does for us is it lifts us out of the container that holds us and constrains us from the outside and. <unk> you can dream and think expansively again that they cannot control in you . i saw hope made manifest in an african american church in the south side of chicago this summer <unk> . where i brought my little girl who is now thirteen and a few inches taller than me to hear my friend rev otis moss preach . that summer <unk> there had already been. three thousand people shot between january and july in chicago. <unk> we went into that church and heard rev moss preach and after he did . this choir of gorgeous women one hundred women strong <unk> stood up and began to sing . i need you you need me <unk> i love you <unk> i need you to survive . and i realized in that moment that this is what religion is supposed to be about it 's supposed to be. <unk> about giving people back a sense of purpose . a sense of hope a sense that they and their dreams fundamentally matter in this world that tells them that they don 't matter at all . the third principle is the principle of mightiness there 's a rabbinic tradition that we are to walk around with two slips of paper in our pockets one says i am but dust and ashes. <unk> it 's not all about me <unk> i can 't control everything and i cannot do this on my own . the other slip of paper says for my sake the world was created which is to say it 's true that i can 't do everything <unk> . but i can surely do something <unk> . i can forgive <unk> i can love i can show up <unk> i can protest i can be a part. of this conversation . we even now have a religious ritual a posture that holds the paradox between powerlessness and power in the jewish community the only time of year <unk>. that we prostrate fully to the ground is during the high holy days it 's a sign of total submission . when we get up off the ground we stand with our hands raised to the heavens and we say . i am strong <unk> i am mighty <unk> and i am worthy <unk> i can 't do everything <unk> . but i can do something . in a world that conspires. to make us believe that we are invisible and that we are impotent religious communities and religious ritual can remind us that for whatever amount of time we have here on this earth whatever gifts and blessings. we were given whatever resources we have we can and we must use them to try to make the world a little bit more just and a little bit more loving <unk> . the fourth and final is interconnectedness a few years ago there was a man walking on the beach in alaska when he came across a soccer ball that had some japanese letters written on it he took a picture of it and posted it up on social media . and a japanese. <unk> teenager contacted him he had lost everything in the tsunami that devastated his country . but he was able to retrieve that soccer ball after it had floated all the way across the pacific <unk> how small our world has become <unk> . it 's so hard for us to remember how interconnected we all are as human beings. <unk> and yet we know that it is systems of oppression that benefit the most from the lie of radical individualism <unk> let me tell you how this works <unk>. <unk> i 'm not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police because my white looking jewish kids probably won 't ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black well. <unk> and islamophobia and racism of all forms those are also all of our problems <unk> and so too is anti semitism all of our problems <unk> because emma lazarus was right . emma lazarus was right when she said until all of us are free <unk> we are none of us free <unk> . we are all in this together . and now somewhere at the intersection of these four trends of wakefulness and hope and <unk> mightiness and interconnectedness there is a burgeoning <unk>. multifaith justice movement in this country that is staking a claim on a countertrend saying that religion can and must be a force for good in the world . <unk> and we deserve more than the failed religion of routine ism . it is time for religious leaders and religious communities to take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift that this country and the world so desperately needs a shift toward love . toward justice toward equality and toward dignity for all i believe that our children deserve no less than that .
