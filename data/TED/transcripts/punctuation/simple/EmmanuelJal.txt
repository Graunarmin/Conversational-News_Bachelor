 <unk> say my name is emmanuel jal <unk> and i come from a long way i 've been telling a story that has been. so painful for me it 's been. a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a book. <unk> also telling it like now <unk> and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music so i have. branded myself as a war child <unk> . i 'm doing this because of an old lady in my. <unk> have lost her children . there is no newspaper to cover her pain and what she wants to change in this society <unk> and i 'm doing it for a young man. who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can 't write <unk> . or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to. to talk . also one thing that kept me. <unk> pushing this story this painful stories out <unk> the dreams i have sometimes is like. the voices of the dead that i have seen. would tell me don 't give up keep on going because sometime i feel like. stopping and not doing it because i didn 't know what i was putting myself into <unk> well. i was born in the most difficult time. when my country was at war . i saw my village burned down the world that meant a lot to me <unk> i saw it vanish in my face <unk> . i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five . my mother was claimed by the war my brothers and sisters. were scattered and up to now me and my father were. <unk> detached and i still have issues with him . seeing people die every day my mother crying it 's like i was raised in a violence <unk> . and. that made me call myself a war child <unk> and not only that when i was eight. i became a child soldier. <unk> i didn 't know what was the war for . but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head. when i went to the training camp i say i want to kill as many muslims <unk> and as many arabs <unk> as possible . the training wasn 't easy <unk> but that was the driving force because i wanted to revenge for my family i wanted to revenge for my village. luckily now things have changed because. i came to discover the truth . what was actually killing us wasn 't the muslims wasn 't the arabs it. was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system <unk> . and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil. <unk> oil the diamond <unk> the gold and the land <unk>. so realizing the truth gave me. a position to choose should i continue to hate or let it go so i happened to forgive now i sing. music with the muslims <unk> i dance with them i even had. <unk> funded by muslim people so. that pain has gone out <unk> but my story is huge so i 'm just going to go into a different step now <unk> . which is easier for me i 'm going to give you poem. called forced to sin which is from my album war child i talk about my story. <unk> one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around four hundred and only sixteen people survived that journey <unk> . so i hope you 're going to hear this my dreams are like torment <unk> . my every moment . voices in my brain of friends that was slain friends like lual who died by my side of starvation . in the burning jungle. and the desert plain . next was i but jesus heard my cry as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh. of my comrade <unk> he gave me comfort we used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and sheeps anything we could. <unk> i knew it was rude <unk> but we needed food and therefore i was forced to sin forced to sin to make a living <unk> . forced to sin to make a living <unk> . sometimes you gotta lose to win . never give up never give in left home at the age of seven one year later live with an <unk>. by my side <unk> slept with one eye open wide. <unk> dead and hide i 've seen my people die like flies <unk> . but i 've never seen a dead body at least one that i 've killed <unk> . but still as i wonder <unk> i won 't go under guns barking like lightning and thunder as a child so young and tender <unk> words i can 't forget i still remember <unk> i saw sergeant command raising his. <unk> retreat no surrender . i carry the banner of the trauma war child child without a mama still fighting in the saga <unk> yet as i wage this new war i 'm not alone in this <unk>. <unk> drama <unk> no sit or stop as i reach for the top i 'm fully dedicated like a patriotic. 's like i 'm living a dream <unk> first time i 'm feeling like a human being ah the children of <unk>. your empty bellies on the telly and now it 's you that i 'm fighting for <unk> . left home don 't even know the day i 'll ever return. <unk> music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns so many people die that i don 't even cry no more <unk> . ask god question what am i here for <unk> and why are my people poor <unk> and why why. when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write i was learning how to fight <unk> i ate snails. <unk> was ready to eat i know it 's a shame but who is to be blamed that 's my story shared in the form of a lesson. <unk> is the music i do i never saw anybody. to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy so the music had been my therapy for me it 's been. where i actually see heaven where i can. be happy where i can be a child again in dances. <unk> so one thing i know about music music is the only thing that has power. to enter your cell system your mind your heart <unk> influence your soul and your spirit <unk> and can even. influence the way you live without even you knowing music is the only thing that can. make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg without even wanting to do it. the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn 't see a color you know if you fall in love with a frog that 's it one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when. i was still a soldier back then <unk> i hated the people in the north <unk> but i don 't know. why i don 't hate their music so. we party and dance to their music and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought. an arab musician. to come and entertain the soldiers and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music <unk> . but i had this question so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is . so what 's happening here i 've been in a painful journey <unk> today is day number two hundred and. and thirty three in which i only eat dinner i don 't eat breakfast <unk> no lunch <unk> and i 've done a campaign called. lose to win where i 'm losing. so that i could win the battle that i 'm fighting now <unk> so my breakfast my lunch <unk> . i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan <unk> and i 'm doing this because also. it 's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day here i am in the west <unk> i choose not to . so in my village now kids there they normally listen to bbc <unk> or any radio and they are waiting to know the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school <unk> . and so i made a. <unk> i 'm gonna not eat my breakfast i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month <unk> but i 've been humbled so. it 's taken me two hundred and thirty two days and i said no stop until we get it . and like it 's been done on facebook myspace the people are giving three dollars <unk> . the lowest amount we ever got was twenty cents somebody donated twenty cents online i don 't know how they did it. that moved me and so . the importance of education to me. is what i 'm willing to die for i 'm willing to die for this because i know what it can do. to my people education enlighten your brain give you so many. <unk> and you 're able to survive <unk> as a nation we have been crippled for so many years we have fed on aid you see a <unk>. <unk> families in a refugee camps they only. get the food that drops from the sky from the u n so these people . you 're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid . if anybody want to help us this is what we need give us tools <unk> give the farmers. <unk> tools it 's rain africa is fertile <unk> they can grow the crops . invest. in education . education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything because we have. all those. <unk> old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then. we 'll be able to change africa that 's what i 'm asking so. in order to do that . i founded a charter called gua africa <unk> where we put kids in school <unk> . and now we have a couple in university we have like forty kids. <unk> that we feel like we want to support <unk> and i said i 'm going to put it in practice . and with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things that 's what i want to do to change to make a difference in the world <unk> . well now my time is going so i want to sing a song <unk> but i 'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker. called emma mccune. that made it possible for me to be here. i 'm gonna sing this song . just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference she came to my country and saw the importance. of education she said the only way to help sudan is to invest in the women educating them <unk> educating the. <unk> so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society <unk> so she even ended up marrying a commander from. from the spla . and she rescued over one hundred and fifty child soldiers one of them happened to be me now <unk> and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate. emma with me are you guys ready to celebrate emma. <unk> to know the. <unk> was somebody.
