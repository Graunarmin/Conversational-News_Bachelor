 <unk> many of the tests are conducted while yves is strapped onto the wing <unk> because yves ' body is an integral part of the aircraft [ wind tunnel tests ] narrator . the wing has no steering controls no flaps no rudder <unk> yves uses his body to steer the wing. <unk> even with the leg <unk> he 's 's acting as a as a human fuselage so to say and that 's quite unique narrator . when he arches his back . he gains altitude <unk> . <unk> when he pushes his shoulders forward <unk> he goes into a dive. <unk> on. <unk> the wing is open so our first critical moment <unk> it 's open he is down . is he flying <unk> . commentator two it looks like he 's stabilized he 's starting to make his climb commentator one there 's that ninety degree turn <unk> he 's out over the channel there. is yves rossy there is no turning back now he is over the english channel. and under way ladies and gentlemen. <unk> a historic flight has begun. <unk> on those toggles to flare <unk> slow himself down just a little bit <unk> and then come in for for a nice. <unk> those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities and there were many many others <unk> so it 's possible to fly almost like. <unk> i don 't have feathers but i feel like a bird sometimes it 's really. an unreal feeling because normally you have a big thing a plane around you and. when i strap just this little. <unk> you start to become jetman yr it was. about twenty years ago when i discovered free falling when you go out of an airplane <unk> you are almost naked you take a position like that . and especially when you take a tracking position you have the feeling that you you are flying. <unk> and that 's the. nearest thing to the dream you have no machine around you you are just in the element <unk> it 's very short and only in one direction . so the idea. was okay <unk> keep that feeling of freedom <unk> but change the vector and increase the time. <unk> hundred and ninety miles per hour bg what 's the weight of the equipment you 're carrying yr when i exit full of kerosene. i 'm about <unk> fifty five kilos i have <unk> fifty five kilos on my back bg . and you 're not piloting there is no handle no steering nothing it is purely your body and the wings become part of. <unk> i wanted to keep this freedom. of movement and it 's really like the kid playing the airplane i want to go down. like that <unk> and up i climb i turn <unk> it 's really pure flying <unk> it 's not steering it 's. <unk> try to stay just fit <unk> i don 't do special physical training i just try to. to keep my mobility through new activities <unk>. for example <unk> last winter i began with kite surfing so new things so you have to adapt. i 'm quite an experienced. manager of systems as a pilot <unk> but this is really you need fluidity you need to be. agile and also to adapt really fast bg somebody in the audience asked me how does he breathe up there because you 're going fast and you 're up at three thousand. <unk> up to three thousand meters it 's. not. such a big problem with oxygen but for example bikers they have the same speed . just with the helmet <unk> integral helmet it 's really no problem to breathe bg . describe for me the equipment. <unk> working with kerosene <unk> harness . parachute my only instruments are an altimeter and time i know i have about eight minutes fuel so i just check. before it 's finished. <unk> if i have a problem with the first one i pull <unk> . i still have the possibility to open the second one and this is my life that 's the real important thing about safety . i did use that during these last fifteen years about twenty times . never with that type of wing but at the beginning. <unk> of the gibraltar. strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean <unk> so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go right yr yeah <unk> i <unk>. <unk> did try in the clouds <unk> but you lose orientation completely so i did try. <unk> you have not the right altitude <unk> so the next thing i saw was just blue it was the sea <unk> . i have also an audible altimeter so i i was at my minimum altitude in that vector. fast so i. pulled that <unk> and then i did open my chute bg so the wings have their own parachute and you have your two parachutes yr exactly there is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons so i can repair it afterward and especially. risky stuff indeed people have died trying to do this kind of of thing and you don 't look like a crazy guy you 're a swiss airline pilot so you 're rather a checklist kind of guy <unk> . i assume you have. standards yr yeah <unk> i have no checklist for that. <unk> know very well <unk> we have a hundred years of. experience <unk> and you can. adapt really. precisely with that i have to adapt to something new that means. improvise <unk> . so it 's really a play between these two approaches something that i know very well these principles for example <unk> we have two engines on an airbus . with only one engine you can fly. <unk> so plan b <unk> always a plan b in a fighter you have an ejection seat <unk> that 's my ejection seat <unk> so i have the approach of a professional pilot. with. the respect of a pioneer in front of mother nature bg it 's well said. <unk> a roll <unk> and. then i stabilize and according to my altitude <unk> i continue on two or three engines it 's sometimes possible it. 's quite complicated to explain but according to which. regime i was i can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land and then i open my parachute bg so the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off. <unk> plane or a helicopter <unk> and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines and then you basically take off <unk> mid air somewhere <unk> and then the landing as we have seen arriving on this. side of the channel is through a parachute <unk> so just as a curiosity where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon did. you land on the rim. down at the bottom yr it was down on the bottom <unk> and i came back afterward. on the sled of the helicopter back <unk> but it was too stony and full of cactus on top bg that 's exactly why i asked the question yr. and also the currents are are quite. funny there there is big thermal activity big difference in altitude also <unk> so it was it was much. <unk> for me to land at the bottom. <unk> what 's next for you what 's next for jetman yr first to. instruct a younger guy <unk> i want to share it to do formation flights and. i plan to start from a cliff like catapulted from a cliff bg so instead of. jumping off a plane yes yr yes with the final goal to take off <unk> but with initial speed. <unk> i go step by step it seems a little bit crazy <unk> but it 's not it 's possible to start already now it 's just too dangerous <unk>. the increasing technology <unk> better technology it will be safe <unk> and i hope it will be for everybody.
