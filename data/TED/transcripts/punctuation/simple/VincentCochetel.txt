 <unk> i cannot forget them <unk> their names were aslan. <unk> the list is longer . for many their existence their humanity <unk> has been reduced to. statistics <unk> coldly recorded as security incidents . for me they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers. <unk> tried to bring a bit of comfort. to the victims of the wars in chechnya in the ' 90s . they were nurses <unk> logisticians shelter experts paralegals <unk> interpreters . and for this service <unk> they were murdered their families torn apart . <unk> and their story largely forgotten <unk> no one was ever sentenced for these crimes <unk> . i cannot forget them <unk> they live in me somehow . their memories giving me meaning every day <unk> but they are also haunting the dark street of my mind <unk> . as humanitarian aid workers they made the choice to be at the side of the victim . to provide some assistance some comfort some protection. <unk> when they needed protection themselves <unk> it <unk>. <unk> you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in iraq or in syria aid worker abducted <unk> hostage executed. but who were they why were they there what motivated them <unk> how did we become so indifferent to these crimes. is why i am here today with you we need to find better ways to remember them <unk> . we also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives . we also need to demand justice . when in ' ninety six i was sent by the united nations high commissioner for refugees to the north caucasus i knew some of the. five colleagues had been killed three had been seriously injured <unk> seven had already been taken hostage <unk> so we were careful <unk> . we were using armored vehicles <unk> decoy cars <unk> changing patterns of travel changing homes all sorts of security measures <unk> . yet on a cold winter night of january. <unk> turn when i entered my flat in vladikavkaz with a guard <unk> we were surrounded by armed men <unk> . they took the guard they put him on the floor <unk> they beat him up in front of me tied him <unk> dragged him away <unk> . i was handcuffed <unk> blindfolded. <unk> gun pressed against my neck <unk> when it happens to you there is no time for thinking no time for praying . my brain went on automatic <unk> rewinding quickly the life i 'd just left behind <unk> . it took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me <unk> but. <unk> had ordered my kidnapping . then a process of dehumanization started that day <unk> i was no more than just a commodity <unk> . i normally don 't talk about this but i 'd like to share a bit with you some of those three hundred and seventeen days of captivity <unk> . i was kept in an underground. <unk> and then the guards would come normally two they would bring a big piece of bread a bowl of soup and a candle . that candle would burn for fifteen minutes <unk> fifteen minutes of precious light and then they would take. <unk> i was chained by a metal cable to my bed <unk> i could do only four small steps . i always dreamt of the fifth one . and no tv no radio no newspaper no one to talk to . i had no towel <unk> no soap <unk> no toilet paper just two metal buckets open one for water. one waste . can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic. or when they are just bored or drunk <unk> we are breaking my nerves very slowly <unk> . isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe how do you describe. <unk> nothing there are no words for the depths of loneliness i reached in that very thin border. between sanity and madness in the darkness sometimes i played. imaginary games of checkers <unk> i would start with the black play with the white back to the black trying to trick the other side. <unk> i don 't play checkers anymore. <unk> i was tormented by the thoughts of my family. and my colleague the guard edik i didn 't know what had happened to him i. was trying not to think <unk> i tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot <unk> . i tried to pray i tried all sorts of memorization games. but darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal . one part of your brain wants you to resist to shout to cry . and the other part of the brain orders you to <unk>. <unk> just go through it it 's a constant internal debate there is no one to arbitrate <unk> once a guard came to me. <unk> very aggressively and he told me today you 're going to kneel and beg for your food . i wasn 't in a good mood so i insulted him <unk> i insulted his mother i insulted his ancestors the. consequence was moderate he threw the food into my waste the day after he came back with the same demand . he got the same answer <unk> which had. <unk> same consequence <unk> . four days later the body was full of pain i didn 't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little . so. when the guards came down . i knelt <unk> i begged for my food. <unk> the only way for me to make it to another candle . after my kidnapping i was transferred from north ossetia to chechnya . three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars <unk> . and upon arrival i was interrogated for eleven days by a guy called ruslan . the routine was always the same a bit more light. <unk> he would come down to the cellar he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair and he would turn on the music loud <unk> . and then he would yell questions <unk> he would scream <unk> he would beat me i. 'll spare you the details there are many questions i could not understand and there are some questions i did not want to understand. <unk> of the interrogation was the duration of the tape <unk> fifteen songs forty five minutes <unk> i would always long for the last song . on one day one night in that cellar <unk> i don 't know what it was i heard a child crying above my head . a boy <unk> maybe two or three years old <unk> . footsteps <unk> . <unk> people running . so when ruslan came the day after <unk> . before he put the first question to me <unk> i asked him how is your son today is he feeling better ruslan was taken by surprise <unk> . he was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life . i kept talking about ngos supplying medicines to local clinics. that may help his son to get better and we talked about. <unk> we talked about families . he talked to me about his children <unk> i talked to him about my daughters and then he 'd talk about guns about cars about women and. i had to talk about guns about cars about women . and we talked until the last song on the tape <unk> . ruslan was the most brutal man i ever met. <unk> did not touch me anymore <unk> he did not ask any other questions i was no longer just a commodity <unk> two <unk>. <unk> days after i was transferred to another place there a guard came to me <unk> very close it was quite unusual and he said with a very soft. <unk> like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby dagestan . what could i possibly reply <unk> . it was so painful it was like a blade in the belly <unk> it took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile. the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier. of fortune he became <unk> he was young he was shy <unk> i never saw his face <unk> he probably meant well <unk> . but in those fifteen seconds <unk> he made me question everything we did . all the sacrifices <unk> . he made me think also how they see us <unk> until then i had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing. one cannot assume this. well explaining why we do this is not that easy <unk> even to our closest relatives <unk> . we are not perfect <unk> we are not superior <unk> we are not the world 's fire brigade <unk> we are not superheroes <unk> we. <unk> we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution <unk> . yet we do this because one life matters <unk> sometimes that 's the only difference you make one individual one family a small group of individuals. and it matters <unk> when you have a tsunami an earthquake or a typhoon you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the. <unk> searching for survivors for weeks why nobody questions this every life matters or. every life should matter . this is the same for us when we help refugees people displaced within their country by conflict or stateless persons <unk> . i know many people when they are confronted by. <unk> are so many ways people can help <unk> . we don 't stop with that feeling we try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance some protection some comfort <unk> . we have to we can 't do otherwise it 's what makes us feel i don 't know simply human. that 's a picture of me the day of my release <unk> months after my. <unk> release i met the then french prime minister . the second thing he told me you were totally irresponsible to go to the north caucasus you don 't know how many problems you 've created for us it. was a short meeting . i think helping people in danger is responsible in that war. <unk> war that nobody seriously wanted to stop and we have many of these today <unk> . bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity <unk> it was making a real difference for the people . why could he not understand this . we have a responsibility to try you 've heard about that concept responsibility to protect. <unk> outcomes may depend on various parameters . we may even fail but there is worse than failing it 's not even trying when we can . well if you are met this way if you sign up for this sort of job your life is going to be full of joy and sadness . because there are a lot of people we cannot help a lot of people we cannot protect a lot of people we. <unk> did not save <unk> i call them my ghost . and by having witnessed their suffering from close you take a bit of that suffering on yourself . many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness they are thrown into situations where they are witness <unk> . but they are powerless to bring any change they have to learn to accept it. and gradually turn this into positive energy <unk> it 's difficult many don 't succeed <unk> . but for those who do there is no other job like this you can see the difference you make every day . humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in. <unk> the sanctity of our life is fading . do you know that since the millennium the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled two thousand and. <unk> until the beginning of the civil war in somalia in the late ' 80s . humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages but by and large we were not. <unk> the target of these attacks. look at this picture baghdad august two thousand and three twenty four colleagues were killed <unk> gone are the days when a u n blue flag. or a red cross would automatically protect us <unk> criminal groups and some. <unk> over the last twenty years . and they 've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating . humanitarian principles are tested questioned and often ignored <unk> but perhaps more importantly <unk> . we have abandoned the search for justice there seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian. <unk> after my release i was told not to seek any form of justice it won 't do you any good that 's what i was told plus you 're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues <unk> . it took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated with my kidnapping <unk> . but this was the exception there was. <unk> the same all over the world . this is unacceptable this is inexcusable . attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law those crimes should not go unpunished <unk> . we must end this cycle of impunity <unk> we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid. <unk> workers are attacks against humanity itself that makes me furious i know i 'm very lucky. compared to the refugees i work for <unk> . i don 't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed <unk> i don 't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me <unk> . i don 't know what it is to lose the protection of my country. i also know that i 'm very lucky compared to other hostages <unk> four days before my eventful. release <unk> four hostages were beheaded. a few miles away from where i was kept in captivity <unk> why them <unk> . why am i here today . no easy answer. <unk> i was received with a lot of support that i got from my relatives from colleagues . from friends from people i didn 't know they have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness . not everyone was treated with the same attention how many of my colleagues after a traumatic incident . <unk> own life . i can count nine that i knew personally <unk> how many of my <unk>. <unk> difficult divorce after a traumatic experience. because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse i 've lost that count there. is a price for this type of life in russia all. <unk> no one is forgotten nothing is forgotten . i do not forget my lost colleagues i cannot forget anything <unk> . i call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better. <unk> we should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off . after my ordeal a lot of colleagues asked me but why do you continue why do you do this sort of job <unk> why do you have to go back to it . my answer was very simple <unk> . if i had quit . that would have meant my kidnapper had won <unk> they would have taken my soul and my humanity.
