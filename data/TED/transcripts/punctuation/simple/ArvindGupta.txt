 <unk> it was a very revolutionary time it was a political ferment so to say students out in the streets of paris revolting against authority. <unk> america was jolted by the. the civil rights movement in india we had the. naxalite movement <unk> the [ unclear ] movement but you know when there is a political churning of society it unleashes a lot of energy . the national movement of india. was testimony to that lots of people resigned from. <unk> one of the great programs in india was to revitalize primary science in village schools there was a person anil sadgopal did a ph d from caltech. and returned back as a molecular biologist in india 's cutting edge research institute <unk> the <unk>. <unk> he was not able to relate the kind of [ unclear ] research which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people so he designed and went and started a village science program. many people were inspired by this <unk> the slogan of the early ' 70s was go to the people . live with them <unk> love them <unk> start from what they know build on what they have . this was kind of the defining slogan . well i took one year i joined telco made tata trucks <unk> pretty close to pune i worked there for two years and i. i realized that i was not born to make trucks <unk> . often one doesn 't know what one wants to do but it 's good enough to know what you don 't want to do <unk> so i took one year off <unk> and i went to this village science program . and it was a turning point <unk> it was a very small village. a weekly bazaar where people just. once in a week they put in all the vats <unk> so i said i 'm going to spend a year over here so i just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside . and one thing which i found was this black rubber <unk> this is called. <unk> a cycle valve tube <unk> . when you pump in air in a bicycle you use a bit of this and some of these models so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube you can put two matchsticks inside this and you make a flexible joint <unk> . it 's a joint of tubes you start by teaching angles an acute angle a right angle an obtuse angle a straight angle <unk> it 's like its own little coupling <unk> if you have three of them <unk> and you loop them together <unk> well you make a triangle with four you make a square you make a pentagon. you make a hexagon <unk> you make all these kind of polygons <unk> . and they have some wonderful properties if you look at the hexagon for instance it 's like an amoeba which is constantly changing its own profile <unk> you can just pull this out this becomes a rectangle you give it a push this becomes a parallelogram <unk>. <unk> but this is very shaky <unk> look at the pentagon for instance <unk> pull this out it becomes a boat shape trapezium. <unk> very square and prim give it a little push this becomes a rhombus it becomes kite shaped but give a child a triangle <unk> he can 't do a thing to it . why use triangles because triangles are the only rigid structures <unk> . we can 't make a bridge with squares because the train would come <unk> it would start doing a jig <unk> ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in india. <unk> not have gone to engineering college but no one makes a roof placed like this because if they put tiles on top. it 's just going to crash <unk> they always make a triangular roof <unk> now this is people science and if you were to just poke. a hole over here and put a third matchstick you 'll get a t joint <unk> and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices. <unk> and once you make these you make a little house <unk> . put this on top you can make a joint of four you can make a joint of six you just need a ton now this was you make a joint of six you make an. <unk> put four marbles inside you simulate the molecular structure of methane. <unk> well since then i just thought that i 've been really privileged to. go to over two thousand schools in my country village schools <unk> government schools <unk> municipal schools <unk> ivy league schools i 've been invited by most of them and. every time i go to a school i see a gleam in the eyes of the children i see hope <unk> i see happiness in their faces children want to make things children want to do things. we make lots and lots of pumps <unk> now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon <unk> . it 's a real pump you could actually pop the balloon <unk> . and we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it so all you do is. it 's a very kind of provocative statement this old bicycle tube and. <unk> this filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube and this is how you make a valve you put a little sticky tape. <unk> this is one way traffic. well we make lots and lots of pumps <unk> and this is the other one that you just take a straw <unk> and you just put a stick inside and you make two half cuts now this is what you do is you bend both these legs into a triangle <unk> and you. just wrap some tape around <unk> and this is the pump and. <unk> now if you have this pump <unk> it 's like a great great sprinkler it 's like a centrifuge. if you spin something it tends to fly out . well in terms of if you were in andhra pradesh you would make this with the palmyra leaf many of our folk toys have great science principles <unk> if. <unk> it tends to fly out if i do it with both hands you can see this fun mr flying man . right <unk> . this is a toy which. is made from paper it 's amazing there are four pictures you see insects you see frogs <unk> snakes <unk> eagles <unk> butterflies frogs <unk> snakes <unk> eagles . here 's a paper which you could [ unclear ] designed by. <unk> documented by martin gardner in many of his many books but this is great fun for children . they all study about the food chain the insects are eaten by the frogs the frogs are eaten by the snakes the snakes are eaten by the eagles <unk> . and this can be if you had a whole photocopy paper a4 size paper. you could be in a municipal school you could be in a government school. a paper a scale and a pencil no glue no scissors in. <unk> three minutes you just fold this up . and what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination <unk> if you take a smaller paper you make a smaller flexagon . with a bigger one you make a bigger one <unk> . now this is a. pencil with a few slots over here and you put a little fan here <unk> and this is a hundred year old toy there have been six major research papers on this. <unk> there 's some grooves over here you can see <unk> and if i take a reed if i rub this <unk> something very amazing happens six major research papers on. <unk> this as a matter of fact feynman as a child was very fascinated by this <unk> he wrote a paper on this <unk> and you don 't need the three billion dollar hadron collider for doing this . applause this is there for every child . and every child can enjoy this. if you want to put. a colored disk well all these seven colors coalesce <unk> and this is what newton. newton talked about four hundred years back that white light 's made of seven colors just by spinning this around. <unk> this is a straw <unk> . what we 've done we 've just sealed both the ends with tape <unk> nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner so there 's holes in the opposite corners there 's a little hole over here <unk> this is a kind of a blowing straw i just put this inside this there 's. a hole here <unk> and i shut this and. <unk> this costs very little money to make great fun for children to do . what we do is make a very simple electric motor <unk> now this is the simplest motor on earth . the most expensive thing is the battery inside this <unk> if you have a battery it costs five cents to make it . this is an old bicycle tube which gives you a broad rubber band two safety pins this is a permanent. <unk> whenever current flows through the coil this becomes an electromagnet it 's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin we. made thirty thousand teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years they just muck up the definition and they spit it out <unk> . when teachers make it children make it you can see a gleam in their eye. <unk> get a thrill of what science is all about <unk> and this science is not a rich man 's game in a democratic country. <unk> must reach to our most oppressed to the most marginalized children <unk>. this program started with sixteen schools and spread to one thousand five hundred government schools . over one hundred thousand children learn science this way <unk> and we 're just trying to see possibilities <unk> look this is the tetrapak awful materials from the point of view of the. <unk> are fused together so you can 't separate them now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron <unk> . so something which is trash which is choking all the seabirds. <unk> you could just recycle this into a very very joyous all the platonic solids can be made with things like this <unk> . this is. a little straw <unk> and what you do is. <unk> you just nip two corners here and this becomes like a baby crocodile 's mouth you put this in your mouth and you blow <unk>. children 's delight a teacher 's envy as they say you 're not able to see how the sound is produced <unk> because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth <unk> i 'm going to keep this. <unk> muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations the other is that you keep blowing at it keep making the sound <unk> and you keep cutting it and something very very nice happens. <unk> what the kids teach you you. can also do this . well before i go any further <unk> . this is something worth sharing <unk> this is a touching slate meant for blind children this is strips of velcro <unk> this is my drawing slate <unk> and this is my drawing pen . which is basically a film box <unk> it 's basically like a. <unk> like a. fisherman 's line a fishing line <unk> and this is wool over here if i crank the handle all the wool goes inside and. what a blind child can do is to just draw this <unk> wool sticks on velcro <unk> . there are twelve million blind children. come as a great boon to them . there 's a factory out there making our children blind <unk> not able to provide them with food not able to provide them with vitamin a . but this has come as a great boon for them there are no patents <unk> anyone can make it . this is very very simple <unk> you can see this is the generator <unk> it 's a crank generator these are two magnets <unk> this is a large pulley. made by sandwiching rubber between. <unk> two old cds small pulley <unk> and two strong magnets <unk> and this fiber turns a wire attached to an led if i spin this pulley the small one 's going to spin much faster there will be a spinning magnetic field. <unk> you can do is just <unk> if you give it a twirl <unk> well they just keep going on . and imagine a. bunch of kids standing in a in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on and they 'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. <unk> well in the end what we can also do we use a lot of old newspapers to make. caps <unk> this is worthy of sachin tendulkar it 's a great cricket cap when first. you see nehru and gandhi <unk> this is the the nehru cap just half a newspaper we make lots of toys with newspapers and this is one of them <unk> and this is. you can see this is. <unk> this is a flapping bird all of our old newspapers we cut them into little squares <unk> . and if you have one of these birds children in japan have been making this bird for many many years <unk> and. you can see this is a little. fantail bird <unk> well in the end <unk> i 'll just end with a story <unk> this is called the captain 's hat story the captain was a captain of a. <unk> wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance and i 'll provide you with good food and drinks and the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia <unk> the first day it was a huge umbrella cap like a captain 's cap. that night <unk> when the passengers would be sleeping he would give it one more fold <unk> and the second day <unk> he would be wearing a fireman 's cap with a little shoot just like a designer cap <unk> because it protects the spinal cord. <unk> and the second second night he would take the same cap and give it another fold <unk> and the third day it would be a shikari cap just like an. adventurer 's cap . and the third night <unk> he would give it two more folds and this is a very very famous cap <unk> if you 've seen any of our bollywood films <unk> . this is what the policeman wears it 's called a zapalu cap. <unk> and we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship <unk> so that 's a ship and now the. end everyone was enjoying the journey very much they were singing and dancing suddenly there was a storm. and huge waves <unk> and all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves a huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down <unk> and another. <unk> and knocks it down <unk> and the ship sinks <unk> and the captain has lost everything but for a life jacket.
