 <unk> i am in charge of making this country 's food secure that is my job for the next two years to design an entire master plan <unk> and then for the next ten years to implement it of course with so many other people but first <unk> i need to talk to you about a story <unk> which is my story  about the story of this country that you 're all here in today  and of course most of you have had three meals today and probably will continue to have after this event <unk> so going in what <unk> were about eleven thousand people living here there was no water <unk>  there was no energy <unk> no oil no cars <unk>  none of that most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages <unk> fishing or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water <unk> none of the glamour that you see <unk> today existed no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh it wasn 't that they couldn 't develop cities resources weren 't there to develop them  and you can see that life expectancy was also short most people died around the age of fifty so let 's move to chapter two the oil era one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine that 's when they discovered oil <unk> but unfortunately it wasn 't really fully exploited commercially until after the second world war what did it do it changed the face of this country as you can see today and witness it also made all those people who roamed around the desert looking for water <unk> looking for food <unk> trying to take care of their livestock urbanize you might find this strange <unk> but in my family we have different accents my mother has an accent that <unk> is so different to my father <unk> and we 're all a population of about three hundred thousand people in the same country <unk>  there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak <unk> someone says how so how could this happen because we lived scattered we couldn 't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no <unk> and when the resources came be it oil we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration  people started to get to know each other <unk> and we realized that there are some differences in accents <unk> so that is the chapter two the oil era <unk>  let 's look at today this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha <unk> so what 's the population today it 's one point seven million <unk> people that is in less than sixty years the average growth of our economy is about fifteen percent for the past five years <unk> lifespan has increased to <unk> seventy eight water consumption has increased to four hundred and thirty liters and this is amongst the highest worldwide <unk> from having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree higher than any other nation i don 't know if this was a reaction to lack of water <unk>  but what is interesting about the story that i 've just said the interesting part is that we continue to grow fifteen percent every year for the past <unk> never happened before in history cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water <unk> this is history being made in this region <unk> not only cities that we 're building but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists doctors build a nice home bring the architect design my house <unk>  these people are adamant that this is a livable space but of course with the use of technology so brazil has one thousand seven hundred and eighty two millimeters per year of precipitation of rain qatar has seventy four and we have that growth rate the question is how how could we survive that we have no water whatsoever  simply because of this gigantic mammoth machine <unk> desalination  energy is the key factor here it changed everything  it is that thing that we pump out of the ground we burn tons of probably most of you used it coming to doha <unk>  so that is our lake if you can see it that is our river that is how you all happen to use <unk> use and enjoy water <unk> this is the best technology that this region could ever have desalination <unk>  so what are the risks do you worry much <unk>  i would say <unk>  perhaps if you look at the global facts you will realize of course i have to worry there is growing demand growing population we 've turned seven billion only a few months ago <unk> and so that number also demands food and there 's predictions that we 'll be nine billion by two thousand and fifty <unk> so a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders there 's also changing diets  by elevating to a higher <unk> socio economic level they also change their diet they start eating more meat and so on and so forth on the other hand there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors and so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen this is the situation in qatar for those who don 't know  we only have two days of water reserve <unk>  we import ninety percent of our food <unk>  and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land the limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result open market policy and bringing the big competitions etc etc <unk> so we also face risks these risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity the question is is there a solution is there a sustainable solution <unk>  indeed there is this slide sums up thousands of pages <unk> of technical documents that we 've been working on over the past two years let 's start with the water <unk> so we know very well i showed you earlier that we need this energy <unk>  so if we 're going to need energy what sort of energy a depletable energy <unk> fossil fuel or should we use something else do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy i guess most of you by now realize that we do three hundred days of sun <unk> so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need <unk> and we will probably put one thousand eight hundred megawatts of solar systems to produce three point five million cubic meters of water and that is a lot of water  that water will go then to the farmers and the farmers will be able to water their plants  and they will be able then to supply society with food <unk> but in order to sustain the horizontal <unk> line because these are the projects these are the systems that we will deliver we need to also develop the vertical line system sustenance high level education <unk> research and development <unk> industries technologies to produce these technologies for application and finally markets but what gels all of it what enables it is legislation <unk> without it we can 't do anything so that 's what we are planning to do within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation our objective is to be a millennium city <unk> just like many millennium cities around istanbul <unk> rome <unk> london <unk> paris <unk> damascus <unk> we are only sixty years old <unk> but we want to live forever as a city to live in peace <unk> thank you very much
