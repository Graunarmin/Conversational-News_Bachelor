 <unk> i 'd like to talk today about how we can change our brains and our society <unk> meet joe joe 's thirty two years old and a murderer <unk> i met joe thirteen years ago on the lifer wing at wormwood scrubs high security prison in london i 'd like you to imagine this place it looks and feels like it sounds wormwood scrubs built at the end of the victorian era by the inmates themselves <unk> it is where england 's most dangerous prisoners are kept  these individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil <unk> and i was there to study their brains <unk>  i was part of a team of researchers from university college london on a grant from the <unk> u k department of health  my task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths  that meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population  what lay at the root of their behavior  was there a neurological cause for their condition <unk> and if there was a neurological cause could we find a cure <unk>  so i 'd like to speak about change and especially about emotional change growing up <unk> i was always intrigued by how people change  my mother a clinical psychotherapist would occasionally see patients at home in the evening <unk> she would shut the door to the living room and i imagined <unk> magical things happened in that room <unk> at the age of five or six i would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door on more than one occasion i fell asleep and they had to push me out of the way at the end of the session <unk> and i suppose that 's how i found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first <unk> sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression <unk> the prison warden looking equally indifferent <unk>  said any trouble just press the red buzzer and we 'll be around as soon as we can  laughter i sat down <unk> the heavy metal door slammed shut behind me <unk>  i looked up at the red buzzer far behind joe on the opposite wall i looked at joe <unk> perhaps detecting my concern he leaned forward and said as reassuringly as he could looking specifically at their ability to to categorize different images of emotion and we looked at their physical response to those emotions  so for example when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad we instantly have a slight <unk> measurable physical response <unk> increased heart rate sweating of the skin whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately they failed to show the emotions required <unk>  they failed to show a physical response <unk> it was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy <unk>  so we wanted to look closer at this to use mri to image their brains that turned out to be not such an easy task <unk> imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central london in shackles and handcuffs in rush hour <unk> and in order to place each of them in an mri scanner you have to remove all metal objects including shackles and handcuffs and as i learned all body piercings <unk>  after some time however we had a tentative answer these individuals <unk> were not just the victims of a troubled childhood <unk> there was something else people like joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala the amygdala is an almond shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain <unk>  it is thought to be key to the experience <unk> the more empathic a person is <unk> the larger and more active their amygdala is  our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior <unk>  so let 's take a step back <unk> normally <unk> acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up <unk> like learning <unk> to speak at the age of six months <unk> virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects at the age of twelve months <unk>  most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others <unk> so for example your mother raises her hands to stretch and you imitate her behavior <unk>  at first this isn 't perfect <unk> i remember my cousin sasha <unk> two years old at the time <unk> looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand <unk> licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand  bit by bit we build the foundations of the social brain so that by the time we 're three four years old most children not all have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others <unk> another prerequisite for empathy <unk> fact that this developmental progression is universal <unk>  irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit <unk> strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn  if you doubt this <unk> try as i 've done to renege on a promise you 've made <unk> you will find that the mind of a four year old is not nave in the slightest it is more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness <unk>  the early years are crucial there seems to be a window of opportunity <unk> after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult <unk> say it 's impossible a recent wonderful study from stanford university showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero <unk> actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards <unk>  <unk> i am suggesting that we need to find ways to get joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior <unk> for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us <unk>  so can brains change <unk> for over one hundred years neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood <unk> no new brain cells could grow in the adult <unk> human brain the brain could only change within certain set limits that was the dogma but then in the <unk> studies starting showing following the lead of elizabeth gould at princeton and others <unk> studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis <unk> the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian <unk> first in the olfactory bulb which is responsible for our sense of smell then in the hippocampus involving short term memory <unk> and finally in the amygdala itself  in order to understand how this process works <unk> i left the psychopaths and joined a lab in oxford specializing in learning and development instead of psychopaths i studied mice because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals <unk> so if you rear a mouse in a standard cage a shoebox essentially with cotton wool <unk> alone and without much stimulation not only does it not thrive <unk> but it will often develop strange <unk> repetitive behaviors this naturally <unk> <unk> sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice even becoming aggressive when introduced to them <unk> however mice reared in what we called an enriched environment a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore <unk>  demonstrate neurogenesis the birth of new brain cells  and as we showed they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks now  they don 't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street their improved environment results in healthy sociable behavior <unk> mice reared in a standard cage by contrast  not dissimilar you might say from a prison cell have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain <unk> it is now clear that the amygdala of mammals including primates like us can show <unk> in some areas of the brain more than twenty percent of cells are newly formed we 're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood <unk> however our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment stress <unk> released by the brain <unk> suppress the growth of these new cells <unk> the more stress the less brain development which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels this is the interplay between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes <unk> when you <unk> is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth  of course imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society  our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their mri scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they 've got a faulty amygdala <unk>  the evidence is actually the other way because <unk> our brains are capable of change <unk> we need to take responsibility for our actions and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation  one way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs <unk> here victims if they choose to participate <unk> and perpetrators meet face to face <unk> and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and the victim plays an active role in the process in such a setting the perpetrator can see <unk> perhaps for the first time  the victim as a as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response this stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective <unk> rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration such programs won 't work for everyone <unk> but for many it could be a way to break the frozen sea within so what can we do now how can we apply this knowledge i 'd like to leave you with three lessons that i learned <unk> the first thing that i learned was that we need to change <unk> since wormwood scrubs was built one hundred and thirty years ago society has advanced in virtually every aspect in the way we run our schools our hospitals  yet the moment we speak about prisons <unk> it 's as though we 're back in dickensian times <unk>  if not medieval times for too long <unk>  i believe  we 've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human nature cannot change and as a society it 's costing us dearly we know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change  and the best way to achieve that even in adults is to change and modulate our environment <unk> the second thing i have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral to bringing about social change <unk> it 's easy enough for a neuroscientist to <unk> place a high security inmate in an mri scanner <unk> well actually <unk> that turns out not to be so easy but ultimately what we want to show is is whether we 're able to reduce the reoffending rates in order to answer complex questions like that we need people of different backgrounds lab based scientists and clinicians social workers and policy makers <unk>  philanthropists and human rights activists to work <unk> together finally i believe we need to change our own amygdalae because this issue goes to the heart not just of who joe is  but who we are  we need to change our view of joe as someone wholly irredeemable <unk> because if we see joe as wholly irredeemable how is he going to see himself as any different <unk> in another decade joe will be released from wormwood scrubs <unk>  will he be among the seventy percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system  wouldn 't it be better if while serving his sentence joe was able to train his amygdala which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections <unk> so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released surely that would be in the interest of all of us
