 <unk> what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed at nasa 's glenn research center in cleveland ohio <unk> but before i do that we have to go over the definition of what green is ' cause a lot of us have a different definition of the product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means there 's plenty of things that are being called green now what does it actually mean  we use three metrics to determine green the first metric is is it sustainable <unk>  which means are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations <unk> is it alternative is it different than what is being used today or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what 's used conventionally <unk>  and three is it renewable does it come from earth 's natural replenishing resources such as sun <unk>  wind and water <unk>  now my task at nasa is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels extreme green why aviation <unk> the field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined  we need to find an alternative also it 's a national aeronautics directive  one of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels biofuels using domestic and safe friendly resources <unk> <unk> combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric actually extreme green for us is all three together that 's why you see the plus there i was told to say that  so it has to be the big three at grc that 's another metric <unk> ninety seven percent of the world 's water is saltwater <unk> how about we use that  combine that with number three do not use arable land because crops are already growing on that land that 's very scarce around the world number two  don 't compete with food crops that 's already a well established entity they don 't need another entry <unk>  and lastly the most precious resource we have on this earth is fresh water <unk> don 't use fresh water <unk> <unk> point five percent of the world 's water is saltwater two point five percent is fresh water <unk> less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use but sixty percent of the population lives within that one percent  so combating my problem was now i have to be extreme green and meet the big three ladies and gentlemen <unk> welcome to the <unk> greenlab research facility this is a facility <unk> we also are using weeds and we are also using algae  the good thing about our lab is we 've had three thousand six hundred visitors in the last two years <unk> why do you think that 's so <unk>  because we are on to something special  so in the lower you <unk> see the greenlab obviously and on the right hand side you 'll see algae <unk> if you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels algae is a viable option there 's a lot of funding right now and we have an algae to fuels program  there 's two types of algae growing one is a closed photobioreactor that you see here <unk> and what you see on the other <unk> our job at nasa is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors  now the problems with closed photobioreactors are they are quite expensive they are automated and it 's very difficult to get them in large scale <unk> so on large scale what do they use  we use open pond systems <unk>  now around the world they are growing algae with <unk> this racetrack design that you see here looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well <unk> but when it gets around the last turn which i call turn four it 's stagnant <unk>  we actually have a solution for that in the greenlab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature waves <unk>  we actually use wave technology on our open pond systems we have ninety five percent mixing and our <unk> content is higher than a closed <unk> <unk> system which we think is significant  there is a drawback to algae however <unk> it 's very expensive is there a way to produce algae inexpensively and the answer is yes we do the same thing we do with <unk> have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater  what we do we take a potential species we start at freshwater <unk> we add a little bit more salt <unk> when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as brazil right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants the next tank represents africa the <unk> next tank represents arizona the next tank represents florida <unk> and the next tank represents california or the open ocean  what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world where there 's barren desert <unk>  we are being very successful so far  now here 's one of the problems if you are a farmer <unk> you need five things to be successful you need seeds <unk> you need soil <unk> you need <unk> water and you need sun <unk> and the last thing that you need is fertilizer  most people use chemical fertilizers but guess what  we do not use chemical fertilizer wait a second i just saw lots of greenery in your greenlab  you have to use fertilizer <unk> believe it or not in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems eighty percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves the twenty percent that 's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous <unk> we have a natural solution fish no we don 't cut up the fish and put them in there  fish waste is what we use  as a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies that we 've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way <unk> they love to make babies <unk>  and they love to go to the bathroom <unk> and the more they go to the bathroom the more fertilizer we get the better off we are believe it or not  it should be noted that we use sand as our soil <unk> regular beach sand fossilized coral so a lot of people ask me how did you get started <unk> started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab it 's a seedling lab we have twenty six different species of halophytes and five are winners  what we do here is actually it should be called a death lab ' cause we try to kill the seedlings make them rough and then we come to the greenlab what you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing a <unk> about in a minute <unk> and lastly it 's me actually working in the lab to prove to you i do work i don 't just talk about what i do here 's the plant species <unk> salicornia virginica  it 's a wonderful plant i love that plant <unk> everywhere we go we see it it 's all over the place from maine all the way to <unk> very difficult to get around the world it is the highest lipid content that we have <unk> but it has a shortcoming it 's short  now you take europaea <unk> which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have <unk>  and what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology combine all three <unk> when a hurricane decimated the delaware bay soybean fields gone we came up with an idea can you have a plant that has a land reclamation positive in delaware and the answer is yes <unk> it 's called seashore mallow biofuels the rest <unk> cattle feed it 's there for ten years it 's working very well now we get to chaetomorpha  this is a macro algae that loves excess nutrients if you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks  this species is so significant to us the properties <unk> are very close to plastic we are trying right now to convert this macro algae into a <unk> if we are successful we will revolutionize the plastics industry so  we have a seed to fuel program we have to do something with this biomass that we have and so we do g c  <unk> lipid optimization so on and so forth <unk> because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels aviation specifics so on and so forth so far we talked about water and fuel <unk> but along the way we found out something interesting about salicornia it 's a food product <unk> so we talk about ideas worth spreading right <unk> how about this in sub saharan africa next to the sea saltwater <unk>  barren desert <unk> how about we take that plant plant it <unk>  half use for food <unk> half use for fuel we can make that happen inexpensively  you can see there 's a greenhouse in germany that sells it as a health food product <unk> harvested <unk> and in the middle here is a shrimp dish and it 's being pickled so i have to tell you a joke salicornia is known as sea beans  saltwater asparagus and pickle weed <unk> so we are pickling pickle weed in the middle oh i thought it was funny  and at the bottom is seaman 's mustard it does make sense this is a logical snack you have mustard you are a seaman the halophyte you mix it together it 's a great snack with some crackers and last garlic with salicornia which is what i like  so water <unk> fuel and food <unk>  none of this is possible without the greenlab team just like the miami heat has the big three <unk> we have the big three at nasa grc that 's myself professor bob hendricks our fearless leader and dr arnon chait <unk> the backbone of the greenlab is students over the last two years we 've had thirty five different students from around the world working at greenlab as a matter fact my division chief says a lot you have a green <unk> i 'm okay with that ' cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers <unk> which is significant  so in first summary i presented to you what we think is a global solution for food <unk> fuel and water <unk> there 's something missing to be complete <unk> clearly we use electricity <unk> we have a solution for you we 're using clean energy <unk> sources here <unk> so we have two wind turbines connected to the greenlab we have four or five more hopefully coming soon <unk>  we are also using something that is quite interesting there is a solar array field at nasa 's glenn research center hasn 't been used for fifteen years <unk> along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues we realized that they are still viable  so we are refurbishing them right now in about thirty days or so they 'll be connected to the greenlab  and the reason why you see red red and yellow is a lot of people think nasa employees don 't work on saturday this is a picture taken on saturday <unk> there are no cars around but you see my truck in yellow i <unk> this is a proof to you that i 'm working <unk> ' cause we do what it takes to get the job done most people know that here 's a concept with this  we are using the greenlab for a <unk> micro grid test bed for the smart grid concept in ohio <unk> we have the ability to do that and i think it 's going to work <unk> renewable energy ecosystem was presented today <unk> we really really hope this concept catches on worldwide we think we have a solution for food <unk> water <unk> fuel and now energy  <unk> don 't compete with food crops
