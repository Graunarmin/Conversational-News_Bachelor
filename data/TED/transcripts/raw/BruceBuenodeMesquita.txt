 <unk> what i 'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict and illustrate it with some predictions about what iran is going to do in the next couple of years  <unk> we need to use science  and the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we 're doing it 's not just wisdom or guesswork <unk>  and if we can predict <unk> then we can engineer the future so if you are concerned to influence energy policy <unk>  or you are concerned to influence national security policy <unk> or health policy or education science and a particular branch of science is a way to do it not the way we 've been doing it which is <unk> seat of the pants wisdom  now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising because i 'm not engaged in the business of magic there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict <unk> and there are some that it can 't it can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion that is in essence everything that has to do with politics much of what has to do with business  but sorry <unk> if you 're looking to speculate in the stock market <unk>  i don 't predict stock markets ok <unk> it 's not going up any time really soon <unk> i 'm not engaged in doing that i 'm not engaged in predicting random number generators i actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win <unk>  i don 't have a clue <unk>  i engage in the use of game theory game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means sorry that even in the study of politics <unk> math has <unk> <unk> come into the picture we can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics we <unk> need to look at this in a rigorous way <unk> now what is game theory about it assumes that people are looking out for what 's good for them that doesn 't seem terribly shocking although it 's controversial for a lot of people that we are self interested  in order to look out for what 's best for them or what they think is best for them people have values they identify what they want <unk> what they don 't want <unk> and they have beliefs about what other people want and what other people don 't want <unk> how much power other people have how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want <unk>  and they face limitations <unk> constraints <unk> they may be weak they may be located in the wrong part of the world they may be einstein <unk>  stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed as was the case for ramanujan for a long time a great mathematician but nobody noticed <unk>  now who is rational a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about you know  what if people are rational mother theresa <unk> she was rational <unk>  terrorists they 're rational <unk>  pretty much everybody is rational <unk> i think there are only two exceptions that i 'm aware <unk> of two year olds they are not rational <unk> they have very fickle preferences <unk> they switch what they think all the time  and schizophrenics are probably not rational but pretty much everybody else is rational that is they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest <unk>  now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests we have to think <unk> about who has influence in the world if you 're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior with regard to producing pollutants  one approach the common approach is to exhort them to be better to explain to them what damage they 're doing to the planet <unk>  and many of you may have noticed that doesn 't have as big an effect as perhaps you would like it to have  but if you show them that it 's in their interest then they 're responsive  so we have to work out who influences problems <unk> if we 're looking at iran <unk> the president of the united states we would like to think may have some influence certainly the president in iran has some influence but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn 't know much about iran <unk> or about energy <unk> policy <unk> or about health care <unk> or about any particular policy <unk> that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers if we 're talking <unk> <unk> about national security problems maybe it 's the secretary of state <unk> maybe it 's the secretary of defense the director of national intelligence maybe the ambassador to the united nations or somebody else <unk> who they think is going to know more about the particular problem but let 's face it <unk> the secretary of state doesn 't know much about iran <unk> the secretary of defense doesn 't know much about iran <unk> each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them so they can advise the president  there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the pinnacle pyramid <unk>  unfortunately a lot of times we don 't do that there 's a good reason that we don 't do that and there 's a good reason that using game theory and computers we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people  imagine a problem with just five <unk> <unk> imagine for example that sally over here <unk> wants to know what harry and jane and george and frank are thinking <unk> and sends messages to those people sally 's giving her opinion to them <unk> and they 're giving their opinion to sally <unk>  but sally also wants to know what harry is saying to these three <unk> and what they 're saying to harry and harry wants <unk> to know what each of those people are saying to each other and so on and sally would like to know what harry thinks those people are saying <unk> that 's a complicated problem that 's a lot to know  there are a lot of linkages one hundred and twenty as a matter of fact if you remember your factorials five factorial is one hundred and twenty <unk>  now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep one hundred and twenty things straight in their head <unk> suppose we double the number of <unk> influencers from five to ten does that mean we 've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know from one hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty <unk> no how about ten times to one thousand two hundred no we 've increased it to three point six million <unk>  nobody can keep that straight in their head <unk> but computers <unk> they can  they don 't need coffee breaks <unk> they don 't need vacations <unk> they don 't need to go to sleep at night <unk>  they don 't ask for raises either <unk> they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information <unk>  so i 'm going to talk to you about how to process it and i 'm going to give you some examples out of iran <unk> and you 're going to be wondering  why should we listen to this guy <unk> why should we believe what he 's saying going to show you a factoid this is an assessment by the central intelligence agency of the percentage of time that the model i 'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known  when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong  <unk> a cia claim you can read it it was declassified a while ago you can read it in a volume edited by h bradford westerfield yale university press  so what do we need to know in order to predict  you may be surprised to find out we don 't need to know very much  we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision <unk>  we need to know what they say <unk> not what they want in their heart of hearts not what they think they can get but what they say they want because that is a strategically chosen position <unk> and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision making  we need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand  that is how willing are they to drop what they 're doing when the issue comes up and attend to it instead of something <unk> that 's on their plate how big a deal is it to them  and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue  if we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision <unk> they care about the outcome they 'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible they 're careerists they also care about getting credit ego involvement they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome <unk> or as important if it 's their druthers to block an outcome <unk> and <unk> <unk> so we have to figure out how they balance those two things different people trade off between standing by their outcome <unk> faithfully holding to it going down <unk> a blaze of glory <unk> or giving it up putting their finger in the wind and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position most people fall in between and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior <unk>  so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they 're willing to take what they 're after what they <unk> what they want <unk> and what they believe about other people you might notice what we don 't need to know <unk>  there 's no history in here <unk>  how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know where they are we 're worried about where they 're going to be headed in the future how they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting i remind you of that ninety <unk> so where are we going to get this information we can get this information from the internet from the economist <unk> the financial times the new york times  u s news and world report lots of sources like that or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems  because those experts know this information if they don 't <unk> who are the people trying to influence the decision how much clout do they have how much they care about this issue and what do they say they want <unk> are they experts <unk> that 's what it means to be an expert that 's the basic stuff an expert needs to know <unk>  alright <unk> lets turn to iran let me make three important predictions you can check this out time will tell what is iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program <unk> how secure is the theocratic regime in iran what 's its future <unk>  and everybody 's best friend <unk>  ahmadinejad how are things going for him how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two  you take a look at this this is not based on <unk> i want to be very clear here i 'm not projecting some past data into the future <unk> i 've taken inputs on positions and so forth run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction <unk> and these are the simulated dynamics the predictions about the path of policy <unk>  the bomb  at one hundred and thirty <unk> we start somewhere above one hundred and thirty <unk>  between building a bomb and making enough weapons grade fuel so that you could build a bomb <unk> that 's where according to my analyses the iranians were at the beginning of this year <unk>  and then the model makes predictions down the road at one hundred and fifteen they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how but they wouldn <unk> 't build a weapon they would build a research quantity it would achieve some national pride <unk> but not go ahead and build a weapon and down at one hundred they would build civilian nuclear energy which is what they say is their objective <unk>  the yellow line shows us the most likely path the yellow line includes an analysis of eighty seven decision makers in iran and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure iran <unk> into changing its behavior <unk> various players in the united states and egypt and saudi arabia and russia european union japan so on and so forth <unk> the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left iran to make its own internal decisions under its own domestic political pressures <unk> that 's not going to be happening <unk> but you can see that the line comes down faster if they 're not put under international pressure if they 're allowed to pursue their own devices <unk> but in any event by the end of this year beginning of next year <unk> we get to a stable <unk> equilibrium outcome and that equilibrium is not what the united states would like but it 's probably an equilibrium that the united states can live with and that a lot of others can live <unk> and that is that iran will achieve that nationalist pride by making enough weapons grade fuel through research so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel but not enough to actually build a bomb <unk>  how is this happening over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today <unk> this is what that power <unk> block is predicted to be like by the late parts of two thousand and ten early parts of two thousand and eleven  just about nobody supports research on weapons grade fuel today <unk>  but by two thousand and eleven that gets to be a big block and you put these two together that 's the controlling influence in iran <unk>  out here today <unk> a bunch of people ahmadinejad for example who would like not only to build a bomb <unk> but test a bomb <unk>  that power disappears completely nobody supports that by two thousand and eleven  these guys are all shrinking the power is all drifting out here <unk> so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel  who are the winners and who are the losers in iran <unk> take a look at these guys <unk> they 're growing in power  and by the way this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis <unk> and that 's probably going to get steeper <unk>  these folks are the moneyed interests in iran the bankers <unk>  the oil people the bazaaries they are growing in political clout as the mullahs are isolating themselves with the exception of one group of <unk> <unk> mullahs who are not well known to americans that 's this line here growing in power  these are the ayatollahs mostly based in qom who have great clout in the religious community have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind here is mr ahmadinejad <unk> two things to notice he 's getting weaker <unk> and while he gets a lot of attention in the united states he is not a major player in iran <unk> he is on the way down  ok <unk> so i 'd like you to take a little away from this everything is not predictable the stock market is at least for me not predictable <unk>  but most complicated negotiations are predictable <unk> again whether we 're talking <unk> all of these are complicated problems that are predictable <unk> that this sort of technology can be applied to  and the reason that being able to predict those things is important  is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it <unk> but because if you can predict what people will do you can engineer what they will do and if you engineer what <unk> they do you can change the world you can get a better result <unk> i would like to leave you with one thought which is for me the dominant theme of this gathering <unk> and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world <unk> when people say to you  that 's impossible you say <unk> that was fascinating <unk> i love that you put it out there  i got very nervous halfway through the talk though just panicking whether you 'd included in your model the possibility that putting this prediction out there might <unk> change the result we 've got eight hundred people in tehran who watch tedtalks bruce bueno de mesquita i 've thought about that <unk> and since i 've done a lot of work for the intelligence community <unk> they 've also pondered that it would be a good thing if people paid more attention took seriously <unk> and engaged in the same sorts of <unk> because it would change things but it would change things in two beneficial ways it would hasten how how quickly people arrive at an agreement <unk> and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time  and it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with without having to manipulate them so much which is basically what i do i manipulate them so it would be a good thing ca so you 're kind of trying to say people of iran <unk> this is your destiny <unk> lets go there <unk> well people of iran <unk> this is what many of you are going to evolve to want <unk> and we could get there a lot sooner and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic <unk> <unk> sanctions <unk> and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end and the world would be a better place ca
