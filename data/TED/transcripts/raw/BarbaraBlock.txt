 <unk> i 've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty form and function of giant bluefin tuna bluefin are warmblooded like us they 're the largest <unk> fish in the sea bony fish <unk> they actually are a fish that is endothermic powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal  that 's one of our bluefin at the monterey bay aquarium you can see in its shape and its streamlined design it 's powered for ocean swimming it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins gets lift powers <unk> its movements with a lunate tail it 's actually got a naked skin for most of its body so it reduces friction with the water this is what one of nature 's finest machines now bluefin were revered by man for all of human history for four thousand years we fished sustainably for this animal  and it 's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago bluefin are in cave paintings in <unk> france they 're on coins that date back three thousand years this fish was revered by humankind it was fished sustainably till all of time except for our generation bluefin are pursued wherever they go there is a gold rush on earth and this is a gold rush for bluefin there are traps that fish sustainably up <unk> until recently <unk>  and yet the type of fishing going on today with pens  with enormous stakes  is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet now bluefin in general goes to one place japan  some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin <unk> they 're delectable muscle rich in fat absolutely taste delicious <unk> and that 's their problem we 're eating them to death now in the atlantic the story is pretty simple  bluefin have two populations one large one small <unk> the north american population is fished at about two thousand ton  the european population and north african the eastern bluefin tuna is fished at tremendous levels fifty thousand tons over the last decade almost every year <unk> result is whether you 're looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population there 's been tremendous decline on both sides as much as ninety percent if you go back with your baseline to one thousand nine hundred and fifty for that bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers to lions to certain african elephants and to pandas these fish have been proposed for an <unk> species listing in the past two months they were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of cites <unk> i and if it 's tunas you don 't care about perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks sharks <unk> marlin albatross these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries the challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an african lion takes down its prey <unk> i doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed this tuna symbolizes what <unk> 's the problem for all of us in the room it 's the 21st century <unk> but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way  technology has come of age that 's allowing us to see the earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely <unk> and we 've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better better understanding of how our ocean realm works  most of us from the ship even i look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea <unk>  we don 't know where the structure is we can 't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an african plain we can 't see the corridors <unk> and we can 't see what it is that brings together a tuna a leatherback and an <unk> 're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot the reasons these challenges are great is that technically it 's difficult to go to sea it 's hard to study a bluefin on its turf <unk> the entire pacific realm it 's <unk> really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it  and then imagine being bruce mate 's team from osu <unk> getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays an engineering challenge we 've yet to really overcome <unk>  so the story of our team  a dedicated team is fish and chips <unk> we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts or the same parts that are in your computer chips <unk> 're putting them together in unusual ways <unk> and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before <unk> and for the first time we 're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset  now i 've been working with tunas for over fifteen years <unk> i have the privilege <unk> of being a partner with the monterey bay aquarium <unk>  we 've actually taken a sliver of the ocean put it behind glass <unk>  and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display  when the veil of bubbles lifts every morning <unk>  we can actually see a community from the pelagic ocean one of the only places on earth you can see giant bluefin swim by  we can see in their beauty of form and <unk> their ceaseless activity they 're flying through their space ocean space and we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty  behind the scenes is a working lab at stanford university partnered with the monterey bay aquarium <unk>  here for over fourteen or fifteen years we 've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity we 'd been studying these fish  but first we had to learn how to husbandry them what do they like to eat <unk> what is it that they 're happy with  we go in the tanks with the tuna we touch their naked skin it 's pretty amazing it feels wonderful <unk>  and then better yet we 've got our own version of tuna whisperers our own chuck farwell <unk>  alex norton who can take a big tuna and in one motion put it into an envelope of water <unk>  so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not <unk> injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea <unk> jeff and jason there are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill a flume <unk>  and that tuna thinks it 's going to japan but it 's staying in place we 're actually measuring its oxygen consumption its energy consumption <unk>  we 're taking this data and building better models <unk> and when i see that tuna this is my favorite view <unk> i begin to wonder how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did so take a look at that animal that 's the closest you 'll probably ever get  now the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean <unk> so in a program called tag a giant we 've actually gone from ireland to canada from corsica to spain  with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas <unk>  we 've actually tagged one thousand one hundred tunas and i 'm going to show you three clips because i tagged one thousand one hundred tunas <unk>  it 's a very hard process but it 's a ballet <unk> we bring the tuna out we measure it a team of fishers captains scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes <unk> we put water over its gills give it oxygen and then with a lot of effort  after tagging putting in the computer <unk> making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment we send this fish back into <unk> and when it goes <unk> we 're always happy we see a flick of the tail <unk>  and from our data that gets collected when that tag comes back because a fisher returns it <unk> <unk> reward <unk> we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now on a backboned animal now sometimes the tunas are really large such as this fish off nantucket <unk> but that 's about half the size of the biggest tuna we 've ever tagged it takes a human effort a team effort to bring the fish in in this case what we 're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna  this tag rides on the tuna senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish <unk> detach <unk> float to the surface and send <unk> satellites position data estimated by math on the tag pressure data and temperature data  and so what we get then from the pop up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag  both the electronic tags i 'm talking about are expensive these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in north america they are some of our finest <unk> our new technology in the ocean today <unk>  one community in general has given more to help us than any other community <unk> and that 's the fisheries off the state of north carolina there are two villages harris and morehead city every winter for over a decade held a party called tag a giant  and together fishers worked with us to tag eight hundred to nine hundred fish in this case <unk> we 're actually going to measure the fish we 're going to do something that in recent years we 've started <unk> take a mucus sample watch how shiny the skin is you can see my reflection there  and from that mucus we can get gene profiles <unk> we can get information on gender <unk> checking the pop up tag one more time <unk> and then it 's out in the ocean  and this is my favorite with the help of my former postdoc gareth lawson  this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna this tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean the warm <unk> is the gulf stream <unk> the cold up there in the gulf of maine that 's where the tuna wants to go it wants to forage on schools of herring but it can 't get there  it 's too cold but then it warms up and the tuna pops in gets some fish maybe comes back to home base  goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in north carolina and then on to the bahamas <unk> and my favorite scene three tunas going into the gulf of mexico three tunas tagged astronomically we 're calculating positions they 're coming together that could be tuna sex and there it is that is where the tuna spawn <unk>  so from data like this we 're able now to put the map up and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a <unk> of tagging and now we 're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side <unk> so two populations of tunas that is we have a gulf population one that we can tag they go to the gulf of mexico i showed you that and a second population <unk>  living amongst our tunas our north american tunas are european tunas that go back to the med  on the hot spots the hope spots they 're mixed populations and so what we 've done with the science is we 're showing the international commission building new models <unk> model to this day <unk> used to reject the cites treaty that model isn 't the right model this model a model of overlap is the way to move forward <unk>  so we can then predict where management places should be  places like the gulf of mexico and the mediterranean are places where the single species the single population can be captured these <unk> become forthright in places we need to protect the center of the atlantic where the mixing is i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish because they manage their fisheries well they 're doing a good job  but in the international realm where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild these are the places that we have to make hope spots in that 's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna  now in a second project called tagging of <unk> pacific pelagics we took on the planet as a team <unk> those of us in the census of marine life and funded primarily through sloan foundation and others <unk>  we were able to actually go in in our project we 're one of seventeen field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators not just tunas <unk> so what we 've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in alaska <unk> salmon shark on their home territory <unk> followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that if we take a salmon and put it on a line <unk> we can actually take up a salmon shark this is the cousin of the white shark and very carefully note i say very carefully we can actually keep it calm put a hose in its <unk> keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message <unk> and that shark leaping there if you look carefully has an antenna  it 's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon sending home its data  salmon sharks aren 't the only sharks we tag but there goes salmon sharks with this meter level resolution on an ocean of temperature warm colors are warmer salmon <unk> sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into monterey <unk> now right next door in monterey and up at the farallones are a white shark team led by scott anderson there and sal jorgensen they can throw out a target it 's a carpet shaped like a seal and in will come a white shark a curious critter that will come right <unk> or something like that acoustically with a ping  and then we 'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the <unk> long distance journeys with the light based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that 's on the fish <unk>  <unk> sal 's looking at two tags there and there they are the white sharks of california going off to the white shark cafe and coming back <unk>  we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues blue sharks  and now together what we can see on this ocean of color that 's temperature we can see <unk> ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks  we have white sharks and blue sharks for the first time an ecoscape as large as <unk> the tuna team from topp has done the unthinkable three teams tagged one thousand seven hundred tunas bluefin yellowfin and albacore all at the same time carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out pick up juvenile tunas put in the tags that actually have the sensors <unk> stick out the tuna <unk> and then let them go  they get returned and when they get returned  here on a nasa numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor <unk> returning to the western pacific  our team from ucsc has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads that come off when they slough  these elephant seals cover half an ocean take data down to one thousand eight hundred feet amazing data and then there 's scott shaffer and our <unk> wearing tuna tags light based tags that now are going to take you from new zealand to monterey and back  journeys of thirty five thousand nautical miles we had never seen before <unk>  but now with light based geolocation tags that are very small <unk> we can actually see these journeys  same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes  up to the same zone the tunas use you can <unk> why they might be caught  then there 's george schillinger and our leatherback team out of playa grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are  and scott benson 's team that showed that leatherbacks go from indonesia all the way to monterey <unk>  so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are we can actually see how they 're using <unk> ecospaces as large as an ocean  and from this information we can begin to map the hope spots so this is just three years of data right here and there 's a decade of this data <unk> we see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on so what we 're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots four thousand deployments <unk> huge herculean task  two thousand tags in an area shown here for the first time off the california coast that appears to be a gathering place <unk>  and then for sort of an encore from these animals they 're helping us  they 're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to two thousand meters <unk> they 're taking information from our planet at very <unk> critical places like antarctica and the poles those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles <unk>  this data when visualized is captivating to watch we still haven 't figured out best how to visualize the data  <unk> as these animals swim and give us the information that 's important to climate issues <unk> we also think it 's critical to get this information to the public to engage the public with this kind of data we did this with the great turtle race tagged turtles brought in four million hits <unk> and now with google 's oceans <unk>  we can actually put a white shark in that ocean  and when we do and it swims <unk> we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii <unk> but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can 't see we 've got the capacity nasa has the ocean <unk> we just need to put it together <unk>  so in conclusion  we know where yellowstone is for north america it 's off our coast <unk>  we have the technology that 's shown us where it is what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity <unk> how is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere <unk> and then finally to basically get the message home maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks  make killer apps if you will  a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge let 's connect the public to this activity right on their iphone  that way we do away with a few internet myths so we can save the bluefin tuna we can save the white shark we have the science and technology  hope is here yes we can we need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans <unk> thank you
