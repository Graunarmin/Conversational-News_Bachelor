 <unk> it is very fashionable and proper to speak about food in all its forms all its colors <unk> aromas <unk> after the food goes through the digestive system  when it is thrown out as crap  it is no longer fashionable to speak about it it is rather revolting  i 'm a guy who has graduated from <unk> gram vikas which means village development organization  was working in the area of renewable energy on the most part we were producing biogas  biogas for rural kitchens <unk> we produce <unk> person that i am i would like to call it bullshit <unk>  but realizing later on how important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way <unk>  we <unk> in india and most developing countries are because of poor quality water <unk>  and when we look at the reason for poor quality water you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste <unk> rawest form <unk> finds its way back to drinking water <unk> bathing water <unk> washing water <unk> irrigation water <unk> whatever water you see <unk>  and this is the cause for eighty percent of the diseases in rural areas in <unk> it is unfortunately only the women who carry water <unk> so for all domestic needs women have to carry water <unk>  so that is a pitiable state of affairs  open defecation is rampant seventy percent of india defecates in the open  they sit there out in the open with the wind on their sails <unk> hiding their faces <unk> their bases <unk> and sitting there in pristine glory seventy percent of india and if you look at the world total <unk>  sixty percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by indians <unk> i don 't know if we indians can be proud of such a distinction  so we  together with a lot of villages we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation  and we came together and formed a project called mantra mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas so we are speaking about transformation transformation in rural areas  villages that agree to implement this project <unk>  they organize a legal society where the general body consists of all members who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and <unk> on who look after the operation and maintenance <unk> they decide to build a toilet and a shower room <unk> and from a protected water source water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through <unk> three taps one in the toilet one in the shower one in the kitchen twenty four hours a day  the pity is that our cities like new delhi and bombay <unk> do not have <unk> which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions this combined with a nobel <unk> most economic is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink we are fighting against this <unk> we feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries <unk> and even in sanitation <unk> they should not be humiliated sanitation is more about dignity than about <unk> human disposal of waste <unk> and so you build these toilets and very often we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses and you can see that in front are the attached houses and the others are the toilets so these people <unk> a single exception of a family in a village decide to build a toilet a bathing room <unk> and for that they come together collect all the local materials local materials like rubble <unk>  sand <unk> aggregates  usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost of external materials like cement steel toilet commode and they build a toilet and a bathing room <unk>  also all the unskilled laborers that is daily wage earners <unk> mostly landless are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and plumbers so while these people are being trained others are collecting the materials <unk> and when both are <unk> ready <unk> they build a toilet a shower room <unk> and of course also a water tower <unk> an elevated water reservoir  we use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste <unk> from the toilet the muck comes into the first leach pit <unk>  and when it is full it is blocked and it can go <unk> to the next <unk> but we discovered that if you plant banana trees <unk> papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits  they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas papayas if any of you come to <unk> i would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you so there you can see the completed toilets the water towers this is in a village where most of the people <unk> are even illiterate <unk>  it is always a 24 hour water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it a child dips his his or her hand into it something falls into it so no water is stored it 's always on tap  this is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed <unk> and that is the end product <unk>  because it has to go high <unk>  and there is some space available <unk> two or three rooms are made under the water tower <unk> which are used by the village for different <unk> committee meetings <unk> we have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program <unk>  before we started there were as usual more than eighty percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases <unk> but after this <unk> we have empirical <unk> usually used to spend especially in the summer months about six to seven hours a day carrying water <unk>  and when they went to carry water <unk> because as i said earlier it 's only women who carry water they used to take their little children girl children <unk> also to carry water or else to be back at home to look after the siblings <unk> so there <unk> nine percent of girl children attending school even if there was a school <unk> and boys <unk> about thirty percent <unk>  but girls it has gone to about ninety percent and boys <unk> almost to one hundred percent  <unk> vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners  because they have gone through this training to be masons and plumbers and bar benders <unk> now their ability to earn has increased three hundred to four hundred percent <unk> so this is a democracy in action because <unk> governing board the committee people are questioning people are governing themselves <unk> people are learning to manage their own affairs <unk>  they are taking their own futures into their hands <unk>  and that is democracy at the grassroots level in action  more than one thousand two hundred villages have so far done this  it benefits over four hundred thousand people and it 's still going on and i hope it continues to move ahead  for india and such developing countries armies and armaments <unk>  software companies and spaceships may not be as important as taps and toilets <unk> thank you <unk> thank you very much
