 <unk> that 's one of the things that i enjoy most about this convention it 's not so much as so little has to do with what everything is  but it is within <unk> to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves <unk> there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living  common knowledge <unk> but important nonetheless  as we face fear in these times and fear is all around us we also have <unk> it 's hard to imagine or measure the background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis  but we feel as though there are times when a lot of us you know what i 'm saying <unk> and i hope you guys dig it it 's a song about people and sasquatches and other french science stuff that 's french science okay here we go <unk> you could use as many of those things and the computer models no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use  are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions  four years ago i worked with a few people at the brookings institute and i arrived at a conclusion <unk> not just any day <unk> but it is a day <unk> it will get here there 's no question <unk> and the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one  it 's believable it 's tactile you can reach out things are solid you can move objects from one area to another <unk> can feel your body you can say i 'd like to go over to this location and you can move this mass of molecules through the air over to another location at will  that 's something you live inside of every day <unk>  now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves <unk> comporary or <unk> will figuratively figure into the folding of our <unk> and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from <unk> as i say before the last piece feel not as though it is a sphere we live on rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin  laughter once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes it will be plain to see <unk> remember everything you are it 's more important to realize the negative space  as music is only the division of space it is the space we are listening to divided as such which gives us the information in comparison to something other that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be <unk> this is a fun one it goes like this <unk> for the last piece i 'd like to do this one goes very similar to this i hope you guys recognize it here we go  <unk> thank you enjoy the rest
