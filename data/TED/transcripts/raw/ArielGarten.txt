 <unk> has been around since the ancient greeks some attribute this golden world knowledge to plato <unk> others to pythagoras but the truth is it doesn 't really matter which sage said it first because it 's still <unk> it 's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless <unk> but it rings familiar and true doesn 't it know thyself  i understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems or more exactly the confusions of consciousness <unk>  i 've always been fascinated with knowing the self <unk> this <unk> led me to submerge myself in art study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist <unk>  today i combine all my passions as the ceo of interaxon a thought controlled computing company  my goal quite simply is to help people become more in tune with themselves i take it from this little dictum know thyself  if you think about it <unk> this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind today we 're often too busy tending to our iphones and ipods to really stop and get to know ourselves <unk> under the deluge of <unk> minute to minute text conversations e mails relentless exchange <unk> <unk> of media channels and channels and passwords and apps and reminders and tweets and tags we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place ourselves much of the time we 're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world and we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves <unk>  we 've cluttered ourselves up with all this and we feel like we have to get far far away to a secluded retreat leaving it all behind <unk>  <unk> go far away to the top of a mountain assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter the chaotic everyday  and find ourselves again  but on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind <unk> what are we really achieving <unk> it 's really only a successful escape <unk>  think of the term we use retreat <unk> this is the term that armies use when they 've lost a battle it means we 've got to get out of here is this how we feel about the pressures of our world that in order to get inside ourselves you have to run for the hills  and the problem with escaping your day to day life is that you have to come home eventually <unk>  so when you think about it we 're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there and eventually that vacation 's got to come to an end <unk>  so my question to you is can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape  can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self awareness that we seek  can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions know thyself <unk> i say the answer is yes and i 'm here today to share a new way that we 're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before humanizing technology and furthering that age old quest of ours to more fully know the self <unk> it 's called you may or may not have noticed that i 'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead this is actually a brainwave <unk> sensor that 's reading the electrical activity of my brain as i give this talk these brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph <unk>  let me show you what it looks like  that blue line there is my brainwave it 's the direct signal being recorded from my head rendered in real time <unk>  the green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here you 're actually looking inside my head as i speak  these graphs are compelling they 're undulating <unk> but from a human 's perspective <unk> they 're actually not very useful  that 's why we 've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it <unk> for instance what if i could use <unk> find out how relaxed i am at any moment or what if i can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen <unk> the shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what 's going on in my head <unk> the more relaxed i am <unk> the more the energy 's going to fall through it <unk>  i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am <unk> so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side and the more focused my <unk> the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy <unk> ordinarily <unk> i would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed i was in any tangible way  as we know our feelings about how we 're feeling are notoriously unreliable we 've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn 't deserve it and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier  this new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves 're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever  i 'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit <unk> but first i want to take a look at how we got here  by the way <unk> feel free to check in on my head at any time  my team at interaxon and i have been developing almost a decade now  in the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind <unk> we were making things activate  light up and work just by thinking <unk>  we were transcending the space between the mind and the device <unk>  we brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with <unk> home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair <unk>  we created technology and applications that engaged people 's imaginations and it was really exciting <unk> and then we were asked to do something really big for the olympics <unk>  we were invited to create a massive installation at the vancouver two thousand and ten winter olympics were used in vancouver got to control the lighting on the cn tower <unk> the canadian parliament buildings and niagara falls from all the way across the country using their minds  over seventeen days at the olympics seven thousand visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the cn tower parliament and niagara in real time with their minds from across the country three thousand km away  so controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool <unk> but we 're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction and so we began looking into inventing <unk> complex frame than just control and that was responsiveness <unk>  we realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you and it could join into the relationship with you  we created the responsive room where the lights <unk> music and blinds adjusted to your state <unk>  they followed these little shifts in your mental activity <unk> so as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day on the couch <unk> in our office <unk> the music would mellow with you  when you read <unk> the desk lamp would get brighter if you nod off the system would know <unk> dimming to darkness as you do  we then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you there 's an even more valuable application than that  that you could know something about yourself <unk>  we could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden <unk>  let me show you an example of what i 'm talking about here here 's an application that i created for the ipad <unk> so the goal of the original game zen bound is to wrap a rope <unk> <unk> around a wooden form so you use it with your headset <unk> the headset connects wirelessly to an ipad or a smartphone in that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear  <unk> zen bound game <unk> you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad  in the game that we created of course <unk> you control the wooden form that 's on the screen there with your mind  as you focus on the wooden form <unk> it rotates <unk> the more you focus <unk> the faster the rotation this is for real  this is not a fake what 's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats <unk> and feedback about how you did <unk>  you have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing not just how much rope you used or what your high score is but what was going on inside of your mind and this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what 's going on inside of ourselves <unk> think about technology as interactive this technology is it understands what 's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information <unk> so you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop at interaxon intra active technology is one of our really defining mandates <unk>  it 's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop  for example <unk> can teach children with add how to improve their focus  with <unk> add children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states <unk>  so you can create applications that reward focused brain states <unk>  so you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their add symptoms as they do it <unk>  this can be as effective as ritalin <unk>  perhaps even more importantly <unk> computing can give children with add insights into their own fluctuating mental states <unk> so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs <unk>  the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with we can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us what once mystified and separated us  brainwave technology can understand us anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs <unk> imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight  it would be like plugging into your own personal google on the subject of google today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them you can tag <unk> pictures of baby animals as happy or whatever baby animals are to you  and then you can search that database <unk> navigating with your feelings <unk> rather than the keywords that just hint at them  or you could tag facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention just like <unk> humanizing technology is about taking what 's already natural about the human tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it as it aligns with our human behaviors <unk> it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and more importantly <unk> why <unk> creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are  with humanized technology we can monitor the <unk> quality of your sleep cycles  when our productivity starts to slacken we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play  do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk <unk> imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest  or what activities brought you joy would you make more time for those people would you prioritize would you get a divorce  what thought controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives and with this we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time we can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what 's going on and from this <unk> we can learn how to change the plot <unk> the outcome and the character of our personal stories <unk>  two millennia ago <unk> those greeks had some powerful insights they knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase when you come into contact with yourself <unk>  they understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing evolving and growing <unk>  but they understood something more fundamental the sheer joy in discovery <unk> the delight and fascination that we get from the <unk> and being ourselves in it the richness that we get from seeing feeling and knowing the lives that we are  my mom 's an artist and as a child i 'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush one moment it was all white space pure possibility <unk> the next it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions  as i sat easel side watching her transform canvas after canvas <unk> i learned that you could create your own world <unk> i learned that our own inner worlds our ideas emotions and imaginations were in fact not bound by our brains and bodies if you could think it <unk> if you could discover it you could bring it to life  to me thought controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us <unk> i look forward to the day <unk> day that i can sit beside you easel side watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves <unk> thank you
