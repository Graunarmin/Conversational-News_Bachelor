 <unk> how many people here have heard of pms <unk> everybody right everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period  that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and <unk> irritability <unk> there 's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions and that the great majority of women are affected by this well i am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true <unk> i 'm here to give you the good news about pms <unk>  <unk> let 's take a look at how firmly the idea of pms is entrenched in american culture <unk>  if you examine newspaper or magazine articles you 'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets pms  in an article in the magazine redbook titled you pms free readers were informed that between eighty to ninety percent of women suffer from pms <unk> muscle magazine warned its readers that forty to fifty percent of women suffer from pms and that it plays a major role in women 's mental and physical health <unk>  and a couple of years ago even the wall street journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for pms <unk> asking its female readers do you turn into a witch every month  from all these articles you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of pms <unk> however after five decades of research  there 's no strong consensus on the definition the cause the treatment or even the existence of pms  as most commonly defined by psychologists  pms involves negative behavioral cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation  but here 's where it gets tricky over one <unk> hundred and fifty different symptoms have been used to diagnose pms and here are just a few of those  now i want to be clear here i 'm not saying women don 't get some of these symptoms  what i 'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn 't amount to a mental disorder  and when psychologists come up with a <unk> that 's so vaguely defined the label eventually becomes meaningless  with a list of symptoms this long and wide i could have pms you could have pms <unk> the guy in the third row here could have pms <unk> my dog could have pms  some researchers said you had to have five symptoms some said three  other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you but others said minor symptoms were just as important for many years because there was no standardization in the definition of pms <unk>  when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates their estimates ranged from five percent of women to ninety seven percent of women <unk>  so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had pms <unk>  <unk> the weaknesses in the methods of research on pms have been considerable  first many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively looking to the past and relying on memory <unk> which is known to inflate reporting of pms compared to what 's called prospective reporting <unk> which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row  many studies also exclusively focused on white middle class women <unk> which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women <unk>  we know there 's a strong cultural component to the belief in pms because it 's nearly unheard of outside of western nations  third many studies failed to use control groups  if we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have pms we need to be able to compare them to women who don 't have pms and finally many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose pms focusing on different symptoms symptom duration and severity  to do reliable research on any condition scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they 're all talking about the same thing <unk> this has not been the case <unk> according to these new dsm guidelines  in most menstrual cycles in the last year at least five of eleven possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts  the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended  one of these symptoms must come from this list of four marked mood swings irritability <unk> anxiety or depression  the other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite  the dsm also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row <unk>  and finally <unk> the dsm required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder <unk>  so scientifically speaking this we now have a limited number of symptoms and a high impact on functioning that 's required  and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific  well <unk> using this criteria and looking at most recent studies we see that on average <unk> three to <unk> not all women <unk> not most women <unk> not the majority of women not even a lot of women <unk> three to eight percent  for everyone else variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month <unk>  and this is the information the scientific community has had since the <unk> in two thousand and two <unk> my colleagues and i published an article describing the pms and pmdd research and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals <unk>  the questions is why hasn 't this information trickled down to the public <unk> why do these myths persist well certainly the onslaught of messages that women <unk> from books tv movies the internet that everyone gets pms go a long way in convincing them it must be true <unk>  research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets pms the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it let me tell you what i mean by erroneously  you might ask her do you have pms and she says yes <unk>  <unk> when you have her keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month <unk>  another reason for the persistence of the pms myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role  feminist psychologists like joan chrisler have suggested that taking on the label of pms allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered <unk> the near universal definition of a good woman is one who is happy loving caring for others and taking great satisfaction from that role well pms has become a permission slip to be angry complain be irritated <unk> without losing the title of good woman  we know that the variables in a woman 's environment are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones <unk> but when she attributes anger to hormones she 's absolved of responsibility or criticism oh that 's not who she is it 's out of her control  and while this can be a useful tool  it serves to invalidate women 's emotions when people respond to a woman 's anger with the thought oh  <unk> 's just that time of the month her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited  so who else benefits from the myth of pms <unk>  well i can tell you that treating pms has become a profitable thriving industry amazon com currently offers over one thousand nine hundred books on pms treatment  a quick google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics workshops and seminars reputable internet sources of medical information like webmd or the mayo clinic list pms as a known disorder it 's not a known disorder but they list it  and they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it like anti depressants or hormones <unk>  interestingly though both websites say that the success of medication in treating pms <unk> symptoms vary from woman to woman  well that doesn 't make sense  if you 've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause which pms is supposed to be then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women <unk>  this has not been the case with these treatments  and fda regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement <unk> so we have not had that at all with these so called treatments <unk>  however <unk> the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that pms is a common mental disorder and is treatable is quite substantial  when women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones  medical protocol requires that they have physician follow up every three months that 's a lot of doctor visits <unk> visits  pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their <unk> child bearing lives <unk> over the counter drugs like midol even claim to treat pms symptoms like tension and irritability <unk> even though they only contain a diuretic <unk> a pain reliever and caffeine  now far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine <unk> but i don 't think reducing tension is one of them  since two thousand and two midol has marketed a teen midol to adolescents  they are aiming at young girls early  to convince them that everyone gets pms and that it will make you a monster <unk> but wait there 's something you can do about it take midol and you will be a human being again <unk> in two thousand and thirteen midol took in forty eight million dollars in sales revenue  so while perpetuating the myth of pms has been lucrative for some it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women <unk>  first it contributes to the medicalization of women 's reproductive health <unk> <unk> the medical field has a long history of conceptualizing women 's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment <unk>  and this has come at many costs including excessive cesarean deliveries hysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments that have harmed rather than enhanced women 's health <unk>  second the pms myth also contributes to the stereotype <unk> when the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts  it becomes easy to question the competence of all women  women have made tremendous strides in the workforce but still there 's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business <unk>  and when we think about who makes for a good ceo or senator <unk> who has qualities like rationality <unk> steadiness competence come to mind  and in our culture <unk> that sounds more like a man than a woman and the pms myth contributes to that  psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different one study followed men and women for four to six months and found that the number of mood swings they experienced and the severity of those mood swings were no different <unk>  and finally the pms myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset  individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood sweeping emotions under the rug of pms keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them  so the good news about pms is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle the great majority don 't get a mental disorder <unk> they go to work or school take care of their families and function at a normal level  we know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different  so let 's walk away from the tired old pms myth of women as witches and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day thank you
