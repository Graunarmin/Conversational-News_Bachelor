 between seventy and eighty percent recycled material stuff that was headed to the mulcher the landfill the burn pile it was all just gone this is the first house i built  this double front door here with the three light transom that was headed to the landfill  have a little turret there <unk> and then these buttons on the corbels here right there those are hickory nuts and these <unk> buttons there those are chicken eggs of course first you have breakfast <unk> and then you you fill the shell full of bondo and paint it and nail it up and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time <unk> this is a look at the inside you can see the three light transom there with the eyebrow windows <unk> certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill even the lockset is probably worth two hundred dollars <unk> in the kitchen was salvaged <unk> <unk> merritt stove if you like to cook cool stove <unk> this is going up into the turret <unk> i got that staircase for twenty dollars including delivery to my lot  then looking up in the turret you see there are bulges and <unk> this is a laundry chute and this right here is a shoe last those are those cast iron things you see at antique shops so i had one of those so i made some <unk> low tech gadgetry where you just stomp on the shoe last <unk> and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down <unk>  and then if you 're smart enough it goes on a basket on top of the washer if not it goes goes into the toilet this is a bathtub i made made out of scrap two by four started with the rim <unk> and then glued and nailed it up into a flat corbeled it up and flipped it over then did did the two profiles on this side it 's a two person tub <unk> after all it 's not just a question of hygiene but there 's a possibility <unk> this faucet here is just a piece of osage orange <unk> it looks a little phallic but after all it 's a bathroom  this is a house based on a budweiser can it doesn 't look like a can of beer but the design take offs are absolutely unmistakable the barley hops <unk> <unk> design worked up into the eaves then the dentil work comes directly off the can 's red white blue and silver  going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can i just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until i got the size i want then  on the can it says this is the famous budweiser beer we know of no other beer blah blah blah so we changed that and put this is the famous budweiser house <unk> we don 't know of any other house and so forth and so on  this is a deadbolt it 's a fence from a 1930s shaper which is a very angry woodworking machine <unk> and they gave me the fence but they didn 't give me the shaper <unk> so we made a deadbolt out of it that 'll keep bull elephants out i promise and sure enough we 've had no problems with bull elephants  the shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer <unk> we 've got bubbles going up there then suds at the top with lumpy tiles where do you get lumpy tiles well of <unk> i get a lot of toilets and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer and then you have lumpy tiles and then the faucet is a beer tap  then <unk> this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle class front door in america <unk> we 're getting tired of it it 's kind of clichd now if you put it in the front door  your design fails so don 't put it in the front door put it somewhere else it 's a pretty panel of glass but if you put it in the front door people say oh you 're trying to be like those guys and you didn 't make it so don 't put it there <unk>  then <unk> another bathroom upstairs this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in america  don 't put it in the foyer put it in the shower or in the closet but not in the foyer  then somebody gave me a bidet so it got a this little house here  those branches there are made out of bois d 'arc or osage orange <unk> these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit in order to do what i do you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry our housing has become a commodity <unk> i 'll talk a little bit about that but the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our dna <unk> human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass <unk> what does that mean <unk> what it means is for every perception we have it needs to tally with the one like it before <unk> or we don 't have continuity and we become a little bit disoriented <unk> so i can show you an object you 've never seen before  that 's a cell phone <unk>  <unk> but you 've never seen this one before what you 're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features <unk> and then you go through your databanks <unk> cell phone oh that 's a cell phone if i took a bite out of it you 'd go wait a second that 's not a cell phone that 's one of those new chocolate cell phones you 'd have to start a new category <unk> how we process information you translate that to the building industry if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked we go oh dear <unk>  that 's cracked let 's repair it let 's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in because that 's what you do with a cracked pane  never mind that it doesn 't affect our lives at all it only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural <unk> if we took a small hammer and we added cracks to all the other windows  then we have a pattern <unk> because gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern we 'll go ooh  that 's nice so  that serves me every day repetition creates pattern if i have one hundred of these one hundred of those it makes no difference what these and those are if i can repeat anything  i have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs <unk> shards of glass branches it doesn 't make any difference <unk>  that causes a lot of waste in the building industry the second cause is friedrich nietzsche along about one thousand eight hundred and eighty five wrote a book titled the birth of tragedy  and in there <unk>  he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives on the one hand we have an apollonian perspective <unk>  which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect <unk> on the other end of the spectrum we have a dionysian perspective which is more given to the passions and intuition tolerant of organic texture and human gesture <unk>  so the way the apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is they 'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer ok honey a thousandth of an inch to the left that 's where we want the picture <unk> square and centered the dionysian personality takes the picture and goes  that 's the difference <unk> i feature blemish <unk> i feature organic process dead center john dewey <unk> apollonian <unk> the third thing is arguably the industrial revolution started in the renaissance with the rise of humanism then got a little jump start along about the french revolution by the middle of the 19th century it 's in full flower <unk>  and we have dumaflaches and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we  up to that point had to do by hand so now we have standardized materials <unk> well <unk> trees don 't grow two inches by four inches eight ten and twelve feet tall  we create mountains of waste and they 're doing a pretty good job there in the forest working all the byproduct of their industry with <unk> and particle board and so forth and so on but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption and that 's what 's happening <unk>  and so if something isn 't standard <unk> the fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials well that 's just a myth  and there 's a story <unk> jim tulles one of the guys i trained i said jim it 's time now <unk> i got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew time for you to go dan i just don 't think i 'm ready  jim now it 's time you 're the down oh  <unk> so we hired on and he was out there with a tape measure  going through the trash heap looking for header material or the board that goes over a door  thinking he 'd impress his boss that 's how we taught him to do it the superintendent walked up and said what are you doing oh just looking for header material waiting for that <unk> <unk> not paying you to go through the trash get back to work and jim had the wherewithal to say you know <unk> if you were paying me three hundred <unk> an hour i can see how you might say that but right now i 'm saving you five dollars a minute do the math  good call tulles from now on you guys hit this pile first and the irony is that he wasn 't very good at math but once in a while you get access to the control room and then you can kind of mess with the dials and that 's what happened there the fifth thing is that maybe after two thousand five hundred years plato is still having his way <unk> with us in his notion of perfect forms he said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want <unk>  and we force environmental resources to accommodate that so we all have in our head the perfect house the american dream <unk> which is a house <unk> the dream house  the problem is we can 't afford it so we have the american dream look alike which is a mobile <unk> now there 's a blight on the planet  it 's a chattel mortgage  just like furniture just like a car you write the check and instantly it depreciates thirty percent after a year you can 't get insurance on everything you have in it only on seventy percent  wired with 14 gauge wire typically nothing wrong with that unless you ask it to do what 12 gauge wire 's supposed to do and that 's what happens  it out gasses formaldehyde so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile <unk> home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger  are we just being numbingly stupid the walls are this thick the whole thing has the structural value of corn  so i thought palm harbor village was over there no no we had a wind last night <unk> it 's gone now  then when they degrade what do you do with <unk> all that that apollonian platonic model is what the building industry is predicated on and there are a number of things that exacerbate that  one is that all the professionals all the tradesmen vendors  inspectors engineers architects all think like this <unk>  and then it works its way back to the consumer who demands the same model it 's a self fulfilling prophecy we can 't get out of <unk> then here come the marketeers and the advertisers <unk> we buy stuff we didn 't know we needed  all we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice how disgusting  laughter but you know what they did they hooked a metaphor into it and said i drink dr pepper <unk> and pretty soon we 're swilling that stuff by the lake ful by the billions of gallons it doesn 't even have real prunes doesn 't even keep you regular  my oh my that makes it worse and we get sucked into that faster than anything  then a man named jean paul sartre wrote a book titled being and nothingness it 's a pretty quick read you can snap through it in maybe  maybe two years if <unk> read eight hours a day in there he talked about the divided self he said human beings act differently when they know they 're alone than when they know somebody else is around so if i 'm eating spaghetti <unk> and i know i 'm alone i can eat like a backhoe <unk> i can wipe my mouth on my sleeve <unk> napkin on the table chew with my mouth open  make little noises <unk> scratch wherever i want  but as soon as you <unk> chew with my mouth closed no scratching now what i 'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how i should live my life  i feel that expectation and so i accommodate it and i 'm living my life according to what you expect me to do  that happens in the building industry as well <unk> that 's why <unk> the same sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations i 'll bet all your shoes match sure enough we all buy into that laughter and with gated communities <unk>  we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners ' association sometimes those guys are nazis my oh my  that exacerbates and continues <unk> the last thing is gregariousness <unk> human beings are a social species we like to hang together in groups  just like wildebeests just like lions wildebeests don 't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests  human beings are like that we do what that group does that we 're trying to identify with you see this in junior high a lot those kids they 'll work all summer long kill themselves so that they can afford one <unk> pair of designer jeans <unk> so along about september they can stride in and go i 'm important today see don 't touch my designer jeans <unk> i see you don 't have designer jeans <unk> you 're not one of the beautiful see i 'm one of the beautiful people see my jeans right there is reason enough to have uniforms  and so that happens in the building industry as well <unk> have confused maslow 's hierarchy of needs just a little bit  on the bottom tier we have basic needs shelter clothing food water <unk>  mating and so forth second <unk> security third relationships fourth status self esteem that is vanity and we 're taking vanity and shoving it down here <unk> and so we end up with vain decisions  and we can 't even afford our mortgage we can 't afford to eat anything except beans that is our housing has become a commodity <unk>  and it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity but make it something <unk> that bubbles up from seminal sources that takes a little bit of nerve and darn it <unk> once in a while you fail but that 's okay <unk> if failure destroys you then you can 't do this i fail all the time every day <unk> and i 've had some whopping failures i promise <unk> big  <unk> he tried it a fifth time and it still didn 't work what a moron early on <unk> contractors come by and say dan you 're a cute little bunny but you know this just isn 't going to work what don 't you do this why don 't you do that and your instinct is to say well why don 't you suck an egg  but you don 't say that <unk> because they 're the guys you 're targeting and so what we 've done <unk> and this isn 't just in housing it 's in clothing and food and our transportation needs our energy we sprawl just a little bit and when i get a little bit of press <unk> i hear from people all over the world and we may have invented excess <unk> but the problem of waste is <unk> and i don 't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana  but we 're clearly in trouble <unk> and what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say you know i think i would like to put cds across the wall there what do you think honey <unk> down what we need to do is reconnect with who we really are and that 's thrilling indeed <unk> thank you very much
