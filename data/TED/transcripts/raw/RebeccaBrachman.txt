 <unk> is a tuberculosis ward and at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s  one in seven of all people died from tuberculosis we had no idea what was causing this disease  the hypothesis was actually it was your constitution that made you susceptible <unk> and it was a highly romanticized disease it was also called consumption <unk> and it was the disorder of poets and artists and intellectuals and some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred <unk> we instead knew that tuberculosis was caused by a highly contagious bacterial infection which is slightly less romantic  but that had the upside of us being able to maybe develop drugs to treat it  so doctors had discovered a new drug iproniazid that they were optimistic might cure tuberculosis <unk>  and they gave it to patients  and patients were elated they were more <unk> social more energetic one medical report actually says they were dancing in the halls and unfortunately this was not necessarily because they were getting better a lot of them were still dying  another medical report describes them as being antidepressant was discovered <unk>  so accidental discovery is not uncommon in science <unk> but it requires more than just a happy accident you have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur  as a neuroscientist i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about my firsthand experience with whatever you want to call the opposite of dumb luck let 's call it smart luck a bit more background <unk>  thankfully since the 1950s we 've developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis <unk>  and at least in the united states though not necessarily in other countries we have closed our sanitoriums and probably most of you are not too worried about tb <unk> but a lot of what was true <unk> about infectious disease <unk> we can say now about psychiatric disorders <unk>  we are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders like depression and post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd  one in four of all adults in the united states suffers from mental illness <unk>  which means that if you haven 't experienced it personally or someone in your family hasn 't <unk> it 's still very likely that someone you know has <unk> though they may not talk about it depression has actually now surpassed hiv aids <unk> malaria <unk> diabetes and war as the leading cause of disability worldwide <unk> and also like tuberculosis in the 1950s  we don 't know what causes it <unk> once it 's developed <unk> a lifetime and there are no known cures  the second antidepressant we discovered also by accident in the 1950s  from an antihistamine that was making people manic  and in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the antihistamine someone had to be able to recognize that a drug that was designed to do one thing treat tuberculosis or suppress allergies could be used to do something <unk> very different treat depression  and this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging when doctors first saw this mood enhancing effect of iproniazid  they didn 't really recognize what they saw <unk> they were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug that they actually just listed it as a side effect an adverse side effect as you can see here a lot of these patients fifty four are experiencing severe euphoria <unk> and they were worried that this might somehow interfere with their recovering from tuberculosis so they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme tb and in patients that were highly emotionally stable <unk> which is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant <unk> they were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease <unk> they could not see the larger implications for another disease <unk>  and to be fair it 's not entirely their fault  functional fixedness is is a bias that affects all of us it 's a tendency to only be able to think of an object in terms of its traditional use or function  and mental set is another thing right that 's sort of this preconceived <unk> framework with which we approach problems <unk> and that actually makes repurposing pretty hard for all of us which is i guess why they gave a tv show to the guy who was like really great at repurposing  so the effects in both the case of <unk> but it does make you wonder what else we 've missed so <unk> more than just a case study in repurposing they have two other things in common that are really important <unk> one they have terrible side effects that includes liver toxicity <unk> weight gain of over fifty pounds <unk> they both increase levels of serotonin <unk> which is a chemical signal in the brain or a neurotransmitter <unk>  and those two things together right one or the two may not have been that important but the two together meant that we had to develop safer drugs <unk> and that serotonin seemed like a pretty good place to start <unk> so we developed drugs to <unk> more specifically focus on serotonin the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors so the ssris the most famous of which is prozac <unk>  and that was thirty years ago <unk>  and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs  and the ssris they are better than the drugs that came before them but they still have a lot of side effects including weight gain insomnia <unk>  suicidality and they take a really long time to work something like four to six weeks in a lot of patients and that 's in <unk> patients where they do work there are a lot of patients where these drugs don 't work <unk>  and that means now in two thousand and sixteen <unk>  we still have no cures for any mood disorders just drugs that suppress symptoms <unk> which is kind of the difference between taking a painkiller for an infection versus an antibiotic a painkiller will make you feel better but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease and it was this flexibility in our thinking that let us recognize that iproniazid and <unk> imipramine could be repurposed in this way which led us to the serotonin hypothesis which we then ironically <unk> fixated on  this is brain signaling serotonin from an ssri commercial in case you 're not clear this is a dramatization <unk>  and in science <unk> we try and remove our bias right <unk> running double blinded experiments or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be but bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study and how we choose to study it <unk>  so we 've focused on serotonin now for the past thirty years <unk> often to the exclusion of other things we still have no cures and what if serotonin isn 't all there is to depression what if it 's not even the key part of it that means no matter how much time or money or effort we put into it <unk> it will never lead to a cure in the past few years doctors have discovered probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the <unk> and this drug works very quickly <unk> within a few hours or a day <unk> and it doesn 't work on serotonin <unk> it works on glutamate which is another neurotransmitter <unk>  and it 's also repurposed it was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery <unk>  but unlike those other drugs which were recognized pretty quickly <unk> it took us twenty years to realize that calypsol was an antidepressant despite the fact that it 's actually a better antidepressant probably than those other <unk> probably because of the fact that it 's a better antidepressant that it was harder for us to recognize there was no mania to signal its effects <unk>  so in two thousand and thirteen <unk> up at columbia university i was working with my colleague dr christine ann denny <unk>  and we were studying calypsol as an antidepressant in mice  and calypsol has like a really short half life which means it 's out of your body within a few hours <unk> and we were just piloting <unk> so we would give an injection to mice <unk> and then we 'd wait a week <unk> and then we 'd run another experiment to save money  and one of the experiments i was running we would stress the mice and we used that as a model of depression and at first it kind of just looked like it it didn 't really work at all <unk>  so we could have stopped there  but i have run this model of depression for years <unk> and the data just looked kind of weird it didn 't really look right to me <unk> so i went back and we reanalyzed it based on whether or not they had gotten that one injection of calypsol a week beforehand <unk> and it looked kind of like this so if you look at the far left if you put a mouse in a new space this is the box it 's very exciting  a mouse will walk around and explore and you can see that pink line is actually the measure of them walking <unk> and we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup that it can decide to interact with this is also a dramatization in case that 's not clear <unk> and a normal mouse will explore <unk> it will be social <unk>  check out what 's going on if you stress a mouse in this depression model <unk> which is the middle box  they aren 't social they don 't explore they mostly just kind of hide in that back corner behind a cup yet the mice that had <unk> gotten that one injection of calypsol here on your right <unk> they were exploring they were social <unk> they looked like they had never been stressed at all <unk>  which is impossible <unk>  so we could have just stopped there  but christine had also used calypsol before as anesthesia  and a few years ago she had seen that it seemed to have some weird effects on cells and some other behavior that also seemed <unk> to last long after the drug maybe a few weeks so we were like ok maybe this is not completely impossible but we were really skeptical <unk> so we did what you do in science when you 're not sure <unk>  and we ran it again  and i remember being in the animal room  moving mice from box to box to test them and christine was actually sitting on the floor with the computer in her lap so the mice couldn 't see <unk> her and she was analyzing the data in real time and i remember us yelling which you 're not supposed to do in an animal room where you 're testing because it had worked <unk>  it seemed like these mice were protected against stress  or they were inappropriately happy however you want to call it <unk> and we were really excited <unk> and then we were really skeptical because it was too good to be true <unk> so we ran it again and then we ran it again in a ptsd model <unk> and we ran it again in a physiological model where all we did was give stress hormones <unk> and we had our undergrads run it <unk>  and then we had our collaborators halfway across the world in france run it <unk>  and every time someone ran it they confirmed the same thing it seemed like this one injection of <unk> was somehow protecting against stress for weeks <unk> and we only published this a year ago but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect so we don 't know what causes depression  but we do know that stress is the initial trigger in eighty percent of cases  and depression and ptsd are different diseases but this is something they share in common right it is traumatic stress like active combat or natural disasters or community violence or <unk> sexual assault that causes post traumatic stress disorder <unk> and not everyone that is exposed to stress develops a mood disorder <unk> and this ability to experience stress and be resilient and bounce back and not develop depression or ptsd is known as stress resilience <unk> and it varies between people and we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property it 's the <unk> absence of susceptibility factors and risk factors for these disorders <unk>  but what if it were active <unk> maybe we could enhance it <unk> sort of akin to putting on armor <unk> we had accidentally discovered the first <unk> drug and like i said we only gave a tiny amount of the drug and it lasted for weeks <unk> and that 's not like anything you see with <unk> antidepressants but it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines <unk>  so in immune vaccines  you 'll get your shots <unk> and then weeks <unk> months years later when you 're actually exposed to bacteria <unk> it 's not the vaccine in your body that protects you it 's your own <unk> <unk> immune system that 's developed resistance and resilience to this bacteria that fights it off <unk> and you actually never get the infection <unk> which is very different from <unk> say our treatments right in that case you get the infection you 're exposed to the bacteria you 're sick <unk> and then you take say an antibiotic which cures it and those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria  or similar to as i said before with this palliative you 'll take something that will suppress the symptoms <unk>  but it won 't treat the underlying infection <unk> and you 'll only feel better during the time in which you 're taking it which is why you have to keep taking it  and in depression <unk> and ptsd here we have your stress exposure we only have palliative care  antidepressants only suppress symptoms <unk> and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease <unk> which is often the length of your own life <unk> <unk> because it seems like they might have the potential to protect against stress and prevent mice from developing depression and post traumatic stress disorder also not all antidepressants are also paravaccines we tried prozac as well <unk> and that had no <unk> so if this were to translate into humans <unk>  we might be able to protect people who are predictably at risk against stress induced disorders like depression and ptsd so that 's first <unk> <unk> responders and firefighters <unk> refugees <unk> prisoners and prison guards <unk>  <unk> of disease was estimated at two point five trillion dollars  and since they are chronic that cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise up to six trillion dollars in just the next fifteen years  as i mentioned before repurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases <unk> has another name ketamine  which also goes by another name <unk> special k <unk> which is a club drug and drug of abuse <unk>  it 's still used across the world as an anesthetic it 's used in children we use it on the battlefield it 's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations <unk> because it doesn 't affect breathing it is on the world health organization list of most essential medicines  <unk> ketamine as a paravaccine first it 'd be pretty easy for us to develop it  but as is we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere  fortunately it 's not the only compound we have discovered that has these prophylactic  <unk> but all of the other drugs we 've discovered or compounds if you will they 're totally new <unk> they have to go through the entire fda approval process if they make it before they can ever be used in humans <unk> and that will be years <unk> so if we wanted something sooner  ketamine is already fda approved it 's generic <unk> it 's available  we could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time  but actually <unk> functional fixedness and mental set there 's a real other challenge to repurposing drugs <unk> which is policy  there are no incentives in place once a drug is generic and off patent and no longer exclusive to encourage pharma companies to develop them because they don 't make money <unk>  and that 's not true for just ketamine that is true for all drugs <unk>  regardless the idea itself is completely novel in psychiatry to use drugs to prevent mental illness as opposed to just treat it it is possible that twenty fifty one hundred years from now we will look back now at depression and ptsd the way we look back at <unk> as a thing of the past this could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic <unk> but as a great scientist once said only a fool is sure of anything a wise man keeps on guessing
