 <unk> suicide bomber would actually teach me a valuable lesson <unk> but he <unk> he taught me to never presume anything about anyone you don 't know  on a thursday morning in july two thousand and five  the bomber and i unknowingly <unk> boarded the same train carriage at the same time standing <unk> apparently <unk> i didn 't see him actually i didn 't see anyone you know not to look at anyone on the tube but i guess he saw me  i guess he looked at all of us  as his hand hovered over the detonation switch <unk>  i 've often wondered <unk> what was he thinking in those final seconds <unk>  i know it wasn 't personal  he didn 't set out to kill or maim me gill hicks i mean he didn 't know me  instead he gave me an unwarranted <unk> allowed him to dehumanize us it allowed him to push <unk> precious lives were taken in my carriage alone <unk> and i was almost one of them  in the time it takes to draw a breath  we were plunged into a darkness so immense that it was almost tangible <unk>  what i imagine wading through tar might be like <unk> we didn 't know we were the enemy <unk> we were just a bunch of commuters who minutes earlier had followed the tube etiquette <unk>  no direct eye contact no talking and absolutely no conversation <unk>  but in the lifting of the darkness we were reaching out <unk> we were helping each other  we were calling out our names a little bit like a roll call <unk> waiting for responses <unk> i didn 't know alison <unk> but i listened for her every few minutes <unk> i didn 't know richard <unk> but it mattered to me that he survived <unk> all i shared with them was my first name they didn 't know that i was a head of a department at the design council <unk>  and here is my beloved briefcase <unk> also rescued from that morning  they didn 't know that i published architecture and design journals that i was a fellow of the royal society <unk> of arts that i wore black still do that i smoked cigarillos  i don 't smoke cigarillos anymore <unk> i drank gin and i watched ted talks of course never dreaming that one day i <unk> on prosthetic legs <unk> giving a talk <unk>  i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london  and i wasn 't ready for that all to end  i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my <unk> and i just shut everything and everyone out  to focus to listen to myself to be guided by instinct alone <unk>  i lowered my breathing rate  i elevated my thighs <unk> i held myself upright and i fought the urge to close my eyes <unk> to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point <unk>  perhaps i should have done more <unk> perhaps i could have lived more seen more <unk> maybe i should have gone running <unk> dancing taken up <unk> but my priority and my focus was always my work <unk> i lived to work <unk> who i was on my business card mattered to me  but it didn 't matter down in that tunnel  by the time i felt that first touch from one of my rescuers i was unable <unk> speak unable to say even a small word like gill  i surrendered my body to them <unk>  i had done all i possibly could and now i was in their hands <unk>  i understood just who and what <unk> humanity really is when i first saw the id tag that was given to me when i was admitted to hospital <unk> and it read <unk> words were my gift <unk>  what they told me very clearly was that my life was saved <unk>  purely because i was a human being <unk>  difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go to save my life to save <unk> as many unknowns as they could and putting their own lives at risk to them it didn 't matter if i was rich or poor the color of my skin <unk> whether i was male or female my sexual orientation  who i voted for whether i was educated if i had a faith or no faith at all nothing mattered other than i was a precious human life <unk>  i see myself as a living fact <unk> i am proof that unconditional love and respect can not only save but it can transform lives <unk> here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers <unk> andy <unk> and i taken just last year <unk>  ten years after the event <unk> and here we are arm in arm <unk>  throughout all the chaos my hand was held tightly  my face was stroked gently  what did i feel i felt loved <unk>  what 's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution what 's given me the courage to say  this ends with me is love i was loved <unk> potential for widespread positive change is absolutely enormous because i know what we 're capable of i know the brilliance of humanity  so this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder and some questions for us all to consider  is what unites us not far greater <unk> than what can ever divide <unk>  does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species  as human beings <unk>  and when will we embrace the wisdom of our era to rise above mere tolerance and move to an acceptance for all who are only a label until we know them <unk> thank you
