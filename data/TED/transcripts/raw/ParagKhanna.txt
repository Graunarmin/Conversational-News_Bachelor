 <unk> do we live in a borderless world <unk>  before you answer that have a look at this map contemporary political map shows that we have over two hundred countries in the world today <unk> that 's probably more than at any time <unk> many of you will object for you this would be a more appropriate map you could call it tedistan  in tedistan there are no borders just connected spaces and unconnected spaces most of you probably reside in one of the forty dots on this screen of the many more that represent ninety percent of the world economy <unk>  but let 's talk about the ninety percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born <unk> for them <unk> nations countries boundaries borders still matter a great deal and often violently <unk>  now here at ted we 're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe <unk> well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved our basic political geography how do we distribute ourselves around the world <unk>  now this is important because border conflicts justify so much of border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here so i think we need a deeper understanding of how people money power <unk>  religion culture technology interact to change the map of the world <unk> and we can try to anticipate those changes and shape them in a more constructive direction  so we 're going to look at some maps of the past <unk> the present and some maps you haven 't seen in order to get a sense of <unk> where things are going let 's start with the world of <unk> <unk> there were just one hundred countries in the world <unk>  after world war ii europe was devastated <unk> but still held large overseas colonies <unk> french west africa <unk> british east africa <unk> south asia and so forth <unk>  then over the late <unk> new countries were born you can see that africa has been fragmented india <unk> pakistan bangladesh south east asian nations created <unk>  then came the end of the cold war  the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union <unk> you had the creation of new states in eastern europe <unk> the former yugoslav republics and the balkans <unk> and the ' stans of central asia  today we have two hundred countries in the world the entire planet is covered by sovereign <unk> independent does that mean that someone 's gain has to be someone else 's loss <unk>  let 's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world <unk> eastern eurasia as you can see on this map  russia is still the largest country in the world <unk> and as you know china is the most populous and they share a lengthy land border what you don 't see on this map is that most of russia 's one hundred and fifty million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to europe <unk>  and only thirty million people are in its eastern areas  in fact the world bank predicts that russia 's population is declining towards about one hundred and twenty million people and there is another thing that you don 't see on this <unk> khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags labor camps nuclear cities whatever the case was  but as oil prices rose  russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country east and west but nothing has more perversely impacted russia 's demographic distribution <unk> because the people in the east <unk> who never wanted to be there anyway have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west  <unk> east today <unk> which is twice the size of india you have exactly six million russians <unk>  so let 's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world <unk> we can start with mongolia or as some call it mine golia why do they call it that <unk> because in <unk> chinese firms operate and own most of the mines copper zinc gold and they truck the resources south and east into mainland china china <unk> isn 't conquering mongolia <unk> it 's buying it <unk>  colonies were once conquered today countries are bought <unk>  so let 's apply this principle to siberia siberia most of you probably think of as a cold desolate unlivable place <unk>  but in fact with global warming and rising temperatures all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness and grain being produced in siberia <unk> but who is it going to feed <unk>  well just on the other side of the amo river in the heilongjiang and harbin provinces of china you have over one hundred million people <unk> that 's larger than the entire population of russia  every single year for at least a decade or more [ sixty thousand ] of them have been voting with their feet <unk> crossing <unk> moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain  they set up their own bazaars and medical clinics they 've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east back into china <unk>  again like mongolia <unk> china isn 't conquering russia <unk> it 's just leasing it  that 's what i call globalization chinese style <unk> now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in ten to twenty <unk> but hold on this map is seven hundred years old  this is the map of the yuan dynasty led by kublai khan <unk> the grandson of genghis khan <unk>  so history doesn 't necessarily repeat itself <unk> but it does rhyme  this is just to give you a taste of what 's happening in this part of the world <unk>  again globalization chinese style <unk> because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography  so the history <unk> of east asia in fact people don 't think about nations and borders they think more in terms of empires and hierarchies usually chinese or japanese <unk> well it 's china 's turn again <unk> so let <unk> <unk> 's look at how china is re establishing that hierarchy in the far east it starts with the global hubs remember the forty dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global <unk> east asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world <unk>  tokyo seoul beijing shanghai <unk> hong kong <unk> singapore and sidney these are the filters and funnels of global capital <unk> trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region so much of it being invested into china <unk>  then there is trade these vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that china has with every country in the region specifically it targets japan and korea <unk> korea and australia countries that are strong allies of the united states australia for example is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to china  for poorer countries china reduces tariffs so that laos and cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to china as well <unk> and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the rebound the economic rebound not <unk> just in asia but potentially for the world <unk> the asian free trade zone <unk> almost free trade zone that 's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific <unk>  so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy china has signed military agreements with many countries in the <unk> has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the east asian community  some of these organizations don 't even have the united states as a member  there is a treaty of nonaggression between countries such that if there were a conflict between china and the united states most countries vow to just sit it out including american allies like korea and australia <unk>  another pillar of the strategy like russia is demographic <unk> china exports business people nannies students <unk> teachers to teach chinese around the region to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies already ethnic chinese people in malaysia <unk> thailand and indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result <unk> singapore for example used to ban chinese language education <unk> now it encourages it <unk> if you add it all up what do you get  well <unk> if you remember before world war ii japan had a vision for a greater japanese co prosperity sphere  what 's emerging today is what you might call a greater chinese co prosperity sphere  so no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures but in a much more fluid imperial zone all of this is happening without firing a shot <unk>  that 's most certainly not the case in the middle east where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by european colonialists <unk>  so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world what lines on the map should we focus on what i want to present to you is what i call state building day by day  let 's start with iraq <unk> six years after the u s invasion of iraq the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality  oil used to be one of the forces holding iraq together <unk> now it is the most significant cause of the country 's disintegration  the reason is kurdistan the kurds for three thousand years have been waging a struggle for independence and now is their chance to finally have it these are pipeline routes which emerge from kurdistan which is <unk> and today if you go to kurdistan you 'll see that kurdish peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the sunni iraqi army but what are they guarding is it really a border on the map <unk> no it 's the pipelines  if the kurds can control their pipelines they can set the terms of their own statehood <unk> now should we be upset about this about the potential disintegration of <unk> i don 't believe we should iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world behind saudi arabia  and we 'll have a chance to solve a three thousand year old dispute <unk> now remember kurdistan is landlocked <unk> it has no choice but to behave  in order to profit from its oil it has to export it through turkey or syria and other countries and iraq itself and therefore it has to have amicable relations with them <unk>  now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region that is of course in palestine <unk> is something of a cartographic anomaly because it 's two parts palestinian one part israel <unk>  thirty years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict what might  i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure today donors are spending billions of dollars on this these two arrows are an arc an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the west <unk> bank and gaza if gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the west bank you can have a viable palestinian state palestinian economy  that i believe is going to bring peace to this particular conflict the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine is that independence alone <unk> without infrastructure <unk> now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders when the insecurities might abate <unk>  the last time that was the case was actually a century ago during the ottoman empire  this is the hejaz railway the hejaz railway ran from istanbul to medina via damascus <unk> it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel <unk> on the mediterranean sea <unk> but today the hejaz railway lies in tatters <unk> ruins  if we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map <unk> infrastructure that cross the straight lines the borders  i believe the middle east would be a far more peaceful region <unk>  now let 's look at another part of the world <unk>  the former soviet republics of central asia the ' stans these countries ' borders originate from stalin 's decrees he purposely did not want these countries to make sense  he wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule fortunately for them most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the soviet union collapsed <unk>  now i know some of you may be thinking oil oil oil why is it all he 's talking about is oil  well there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we 're talking about it now before it was how do we control their oil <unk>  now it 's their <unk> oil for their own purposes and i assure you it 's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists  here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades a great deal of them  for a number of countries in this part of the world having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves <unk> just take azerbaijan azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the caucuses but now with the <unk> <unk> pipeline into turkey it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west <unk> then there is turkmenistan <unk> which most people think of as a frozen basket case  but now it 's contributing gas across the caspian sea to provide for europe <unk> and even a potentially which didn 't even have a name before it was more considered south siberia during the soviet union today most people recognize kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player <unk> why <unk>  because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the caspian  north through russia <unk> and even east to china  more pipelines means more silk roads instead of the great game the great game connotes dominance of one over the other <unk> road connotes independence and mutual trust <unk> the more pipelines we have the more silk roads we 'll have and the less of a dominant great game competition we 'll have in the 21st century  now let 's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders <unk> and how that has enhanced its strength <unk> and that is of course europe <unk> the european union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries  and their main purpose was really to <unk> keep the rehabilitation of germany to happen in a in a peaceful way <unk>  but then eventually it grew into twelve countries and those are the twelve stars on the european flag the e u also became a currency block <unk> and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world  on average the e u has grown by one country per year since the end of the cold war  in fact most of that happened on just one day in two thousand and four <unk> new countries joined the e u and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning twenty seven countries and four hundred and fifty million people <unk>  so what is next what is the future of the european union <unk>  well in light blue you see the zones or the regions that are at least two thirds or more dependent on the european union for trade <unk> trade and investment what does that tell us trade and investment tell us that europe is putting its money where its mouth is  even if these regions aren 't part of the e u they are becoming part of its sphere of influence just take the balkans <unk>  croatia <unk> serbia bosnia they 're not members of the e u yet <unk> but you can get on a german ice train and make it almost to albania  in bosnia you use the euro currency already and that 's the only currency they 're probably ever going to have  so looking at other parts of europe 's periphery such as north africa on average <unk> every year or two a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the mediterranean connecting north africa to europe <unk>  that not only helps europe diminish its reliance on russia for energy but if you travel to north africa today you 'll hear more and more people saying that they don 't really think of their region as the middle east  so in other words i believe that president sarkozy of france is right when he talks about a mediterranean union now let 's look at turkey and the caucasus i mentioned azerbaijan before  that corridor of turkey and the caucasus has become the conduit for twenty percent of europe 's energy supply <unk> so does turkey really have to be a member of the european union <unk> i don 't think it does i think it 's already part of a euro turkish superpower <unk>  so what 's next where are we going to see borders change and new countries born <unk> well south central asia <unk> south west asia is a very good place to start  eight years after the u s invaded afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability <unk>  pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism  this is the flag that flies in the minds of twenty million pashtuns who live on both sides of the afghan and pakistan border  let 's not neglect the <unk> insurgency just to the south balochistan two weeks ago balochi rebels attacked a pakistani military garrison and this was the flag that they raised over it  the post colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating <unk> and i expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment of course we can 't forget africa <unk> and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map <unk>  if we were to look at all of africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more tribal divisions and so forth <unk> but let 's just look at sudan the second largest country in africa it has three ongoing civil wars <unk> the genocide in darfur <unk> which you all know about  the civil war in the east of the country and south sudan south sudan is going to be having a referendum in two thousand and eleven in which it is very likely to <unk> vote itself independence <unk> now let 's go up to the arctic circle  there is a great race on for energy resources under the arctic seabed who will win canada russia the united states actually greenland  several weeks ago greenland 's [ sixty thousand ] people voted themselves self governance rights from denmark so denmark <unk> is about to get a whole lot smaller what is the lesson from all of this geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline it 's constantly morphing and changing the world <unk>  like climate change and like our relationship with the ecosystem we 're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet <unk>  now we fear changes on the map we fear civil wars death tolls having to learn the names of new countries but i believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today <unk> today is far worse and far more violent
