 <unk> like you to do is just really quickly <unk> is just sort of nod to the person on your right <unk> and then nod to the person on your left <unk>  now <unk> chances are that over the last winter <unk> if you had been a beehive <unk> you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died  now that 's an awful lot of bees <unk>  and this is the second year in a row we have lost over thirty percent of the colonies or we estimate we 've lost thirty percent of the colonies over the winter <unk> <unk> now that 's a lot a <unk> and that 's really important and most of those losses are because of things we know we know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses <unk>  and we also have this new phenomenon which i talked about last year colony collapse disorder and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december and below <unk> you can see all these out yards or temporary yards <unk> where the colonies are brought in <unk> and then they 're shipped out to the almonds <unk>  and one documentary writer who was here and looked at this two months after i was here <unk> described this not as beehives but as a graveyard with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them  now i 'm going to sum up a year 's worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is and what we know is that it 's as if the bees have caught a flu <unk> and this flu has wiped through the population of bees  in some cases and in fact in most cases in one year this flu was caused by a new virus to us or newly identified by us called israeli acute paralysis virus  it was called that because a guy in israel first found it and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease because of <unk> there 's the implication but we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous <unk>  it 's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus <unk> and so the question we 're still struggling with and the question that keeps us up at night is why <unk> <unk> have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases and we don 't have the answer to that yet and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out we think perhaps it 's a combination of factors <unk> we know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that you know we 're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive and surprisingly sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides and so we discover all these very strange things that we can 't begin to understand <unk> and so this opens up the whole idea of <unk> now of course <unk> if you lose a lot of colonies beekeepers can replace them very quickly and that 's why we 've been able to recover from a lot of loss if we lost one in every three cows in the winter you know the national guard would be out but what beekeepers can do is if they have one surviving colony they can split that colony in two <unk>  <unk> and you can introduce that queen <unk> and in fact america was the first country that ever did mail delivery queens and in fact it 's part of the postal code that that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country <unk> if you don 't just want a queen <unk> you can buy actually a three pound package of bees which comes in the mail <unk> and of course <unk> postal office is always very concerned when they get you know your three pound packages of bees <unk> and you can install this in your hive and replace that that dead out so it means that beekeepers <unk> <unk> are very good at replacing dead outs and so they 've been able to cover those losses <unk> so even though we 've lost thirty percent of the colonies every year the same number of colonies have existed in the country  now those losses are tragic on many fronts and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper <unk>  and it 's really important to talk about beekeepers first because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you 'll ever meet if this was a group of beekeepers <unk> you would have everyone from the <unk> <unk> member who 's you know <unk> live free or <unk> quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer and you get all of these people in the same room <unk> and they 're all engaged and they 're getting along <unk> and they 're all there because of the passion for bees <unk>  now there 's another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone <unk> and these <unk> inventive people you will ever meet  they 're just fascinating <unk>  and they 're like that all over the world i had the privilege of working in haiti just for two weeks earlier this year <unk> and haiti if you 've ever been there is just a tragedy <unk> i mean there may be one hundred <unk> <unk> explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor <unk> but you meet this beekeeper <unk> i met this beekeeper here  and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers i 've ever met no formal education but very knowledgeable we needed beeswax for a project we were working on he was so capable  he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung <unk> tin cans and his veil which he used as a screening right in this meadow <unk> and so that ingenuity is inspiring <unk>  we also have dave hackenberg who is the poster child of ccd he 's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells and he has a history of these trucks and he 's <unk> <unk> moved these bees up and down the coast and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees and that being bad but we 've done that for thousands of years the ancient egyptians used to move bees <unk> <unk> up and down the nile on rafts so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all and one of our real worries with colony collapse disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead out colonies <unk> and you can do that one year in a row you may be able to do it two years in a row <unk> but if you 're losing fifty percent to eighty percent of your colonies you can 't survive three years in a row and we 're really worried about losing this segment of our <unk> and that 's important for many fronts and one of them is because of that culture that 's in agriculture <unk> and these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of america <unk>  you know they pick up their hives they move their families once or twice in a year and if you look at florida in dade city florida that 's where all the pennsylvania beekeepers go <unk> and <unk> twenty miles down the road is groveland and that 's where all the wisconsin beekeepers go <unk> and if you 're ever in central valley in february <unk> you go to this caf at ten o 'clock in the morning <unk>  <unk> kathy and kate 's <unk> and that 's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves <unk> they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone <unk> that 's quite essential american experience <unk> and we see these families these nomadic families you know <unk> father to son <unk> father to son <unk>  and these guys are hurting and they 're not people who like to ask for help although they are the most helpful people ever if there 's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul <unk> everyone pitches in and gives twenty hives to help him replace those lost colonies <unk> and so it 's a very dynamic and i think  of course the real importance for bees is not the honey <unk> and although i highly encourage you all use honey i mean it 's the most ethical sweetener and you know it 's a dynamic and fun sweetener <unk>  but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly <unk> i want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast i had yesterday morning a little cranberry juice some fruits some granola <unk> i should have had whole wheat bread i realized but you know <unk>  jam on my on my wonderbread <unk> and some coffee and had we taken out all those ingredients <unk> or directly pollinated we wouldn 't have much on our plate so if we did not have bees <unk> it 's not like we would starve <unk> but clearly our diet would be diminished <unk>  it 's said that for bees the flower is the fountain of life and for flowers bees are the messengers of love and that 's a really great expression because <unk> you know they get paid for their services they get paid by pollen and nectar to move that male sperm the pollen from flower to flower and there are flowers that are <unk> <unk> that means they can 't the pollen in their bloom can 't fertilize themselves so in an apple orchard for instance you 'll have rows of ten apples of one variety <unk> and then you have another apple tree that 's a different type of pollen and bees are very faithful when they 're out pollinating or gathering <unk> pollen from one flower they stay to that crop exclusively in order to help generate and of course <unk> <unk> they 're made to carry this pollen they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom  however honeybees are a minority <unk> honeybees are <unk> not native to america they were introduced with the colonialists <unk> and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined  in pennsylvania alone we have been surveying bees for one hundred and fifty years and very intensely in the last three years <unk>  we have identified over four hundred species of bees in pennsylvania thirty two species have not been identified or found in the state since <unk> that could be because we haven 't been sampling right <unk>  but it does i think suggest that something 's wrong with the pollinator force <unk> and these bees are fascinating we have bumblebees on the top and bumblebees are what we call eusocial they 're not truly social because only the queen is over winter <unk>  we also have the sweat bees and these are little gems flying around they 're like tiny little flies and they fly around <unk>  and then you have another type of bee which we call kleptoparasites <unk> which is a very fancy way of <unk> saying murdering what 's the word i 'm looking for murdering audience bee dennis vanengelsdorp bee okay thanks  what these bees do is is <unk> they sit there these solitary bees <unk> they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch <unk> and they collect pollen and make it into a ball and they lay an egg on it well these bees hang out at that hole and they wait for that mother to fly away <unk> they go in eat the egg and lay their own egg there so they don 't do any work and so  <unk> bees <unk> and in fact there is now a red list of pollinators that we 're worried have <unk> disappeared and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites <unk> but also these bumblebees and in fact <unk> if you guys live on the west coast go to these websites here and they 're really looking for people <unk> to look for some of these bumblebees because we think some have gone extinct or some the population has declined <unk> and so it 's not just honeybees <unk> but we don 't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community and of course <unk> bees are not the only important factor here  there are other animals that pollinate like bats <unk> and bats are in trouble too <unk> and i 'm glad i 'm a bee man and not a bat man because there 's no money to research the bat problems <unk> and bats are dying at an extraordinary rate white nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats if there 's a cave in new york that had fifteen <unk> thousand bats in it and there are one thousand left that 's like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years and so that 's incredible and there 's no money to do that but i 'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions and that cause is ndd  nature deficit <unk> and that is that i think that what we have in our society is we forgot our connection with nature <unk> and i think if we reconnect to nature we 'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems <unk>  and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd <unk>  and that is make meadows and not lawns <unk> and i think we have lost our connection and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment  i 've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while and it is terribly engaging and if if we look at the history of lawns it 's actually rather rather tragic  it used to be two three hundred years ago that a lawn was a symbol of prestige <unk> and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually deserts <unk> they 're totally sterile <unk> in two thousand and one eleven percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns <unk> percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns <unk> and so it 's incredible the amount of resources we 've spent keeping our lawns which are these useless biosystems <unk>  and so we need to rethink this idea in fact <unk> you know <unk> the white house used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in world war i which probably is not a bad idea it wouldn 't be a bad idea <unk> i want to say this not because i 'm opposed completely to mowing lawns i think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale <unk> and i think we 're encouraged to do that  but i also want to reinforce some of the ideas we 've heard here because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational  that it is amazing that connection we can have with what 's there these milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years add to watch the different <unk> plants or insects that come to these flowers  to watch that and we 've heard about you know this relationship you can have with wine this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances <unk> and <unk> <unk> this is a companion and this is a relationship that never dries up you never run out of that <unk> as you drink this wine too and i encourage you to look at that <unk> i think that what we
