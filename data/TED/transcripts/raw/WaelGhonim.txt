encyclopedia in the world <unk>  and in the egyptian revolution the revolution two point zero <unk> everyone has contributed something <unk> small or big <unk> they contributed something to bring us one of the most <unk> inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions it was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing  if you look at the scene egypt for thirty years had been in a downhill going into a downhill everything was going <unk> everything was going wrong <unk> we only ranked high when it comes to poverty <unk>  corruption <unk>  lack of freedom of speech <unk> lack of political activism those were the achievements of our great regime  yet nothing was happening <unk> and it 's not because people were happy or people were not frustrated in <unk> people were extremely frustrated <unk> but the reason why everyone was silent is what i call the psychological barrier of fear  everyone was scared <unk> not everyone there were actually a few brave egyptians that i have to to thank for being so brave going into protests as a couple of hundred getting beaten up and arrested <unk> but in fact <unk> the majority were scared <unk> did not want really to get in trouble  a dictator cannot live without the force they want to make people live in fear <unk>  and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years <unk>  and here comes the internet <unk> technology <unk>  blackberry sms it 's helping all of us to connect <unk> platforms <unk> were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that wow i 'm not alone <unk> there are a lot of people who are frustrated there are lots of people who are frustrated <unk>  there are lots of people who actually share the same dream <unk>  there are lots of people who care about their freedom <unk> they probably have the best life in the world they are living in happiness they are living in their villas they are happy they don 't have problems <unk> but they are still feeling the pain of the egyptian a lot of us we 're not really happy when we see a video of an egyptian man who 's eating the trash while others are stealing billions of egyptian pounds from the wealth of the country  the internet has played a great role helping these people to speak up their minds to collaborate together to start thinking together it was an <unk> khaled saeed was killed in june two thousand and ten <unk> i still remember the photo i still remember every single detail of that photo the photo was horrible  he was tortured brutally tortured to death <unk> but then what was the answer of the regime he choked on a pile of hash <unk> that was their answer he 's a criminal he 's someone who escaped from all these bad things but people did not relate to this people did not believe this  because of the internet  the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth  and everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother he was a middle class guy <unk> his photo was remembered by all of us  a page was created an anonymous administrator was basically inviting people to join the page and there was no plan what are we going to do i don 't know in a few days tens of thousands of people there angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs enough  get those who killed this guy  to just bring them to justice  <unk> of course they don 't listen  it was an amazing story how everyone started feeling the ownership everyone was an owner in this page people started contributing ideas in fact  one of the most ridiculous ideas was  hey let 's have a silent stand <unk>  let 's get people to go in the street <unk> face the sea their back to the to the street dressed in black standing up silently for one hour doing nothing and then just leaving going back home  for some people <unk> was like wow silent stand <unk> and next time it 's going to be vibration  people were making fun of the idea but actually when people went to the street the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria it felt like it was amazing it was great because it connected people from the virtual world <unk> bringing them to the real world <unk> sharing <unk> the same dream the same frustration the same anger the same desire for freedom <unk> and they were doing this thing but did the regime learn anything not really  they were actually attacking them they were actually abusing them despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were they were not even protesting  and things had developed until the tunisian revolution this whole <unk> the anonymous admin job was to collect ideas <unk> help people to vote on them and actually tell them what they are doing <unk> people were taking shots and photos people were reporting violations of human rights in egypt people were suggesting ideas <unk> they were actually voting on ideas <unk> and then they were executing the ideas people were creating videos everything was done by the people to the people and that 's the power of the internet <unk> there was no leader <unk> the leader was everyone on that page <unk>  the tunisian experiment as amir was saying inspired all of us showed us that there is a way <unk> yes we can we can do it we have the same problems <unk> we can just go in the streets  and when i saw the street on the <unk> 25th  i went back and said egypt
