 <unk> they 're beautiful <unk> and there 's very little we know about them  these thoughts were going through my head when i looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book <unk> i was about five years old at the time  and i decided there and then that i would become a paleontologist <unk>  paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far flung corners of the world  and now a few years later i 've led several expeditions to the ultimate <unk> on this planet the sahara i 've worked in the sahara because i 've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre giant predatory dinosaur called spinosaurus a few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of egypt and were described about one hundred years ago by a german <unk> bones were destroyed in world war ii so all we 're left with are just a few drawings and notes  from these drawings we know that this creature <unk> which lived about one hundred million years ago  was very big it had tall spines on its back forming a magnificent sail <unk>  and it had long slender jaws a bit like a crocodile <unk> that may have been used to catch slippery prey like fish <unk> but that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next one hundred years  my fieldwork took me to the border region between morocco and algeria  a place called the kem kem it 's a difficult place to work in you have to deal with sandstorms and snakes <unk> and scorpions <unk>  and it 's very difficult to find good fossils there but our hard work paid off <unk>  we discovered many incredible specimens there 's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the sahara <unk>  we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs medium sized predatory <unk> these fossils were deposited in a river system the river system was also home to a giant car sized coelacanth  a monster sawfish and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs <unk> flying reptiles it was a pretty dangerous place not the kind of place where you 'd want to travel to if you had a time machine <unk> so we 're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside spinosaurus  but spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive we were just finding bits and pieces and i was hoping that we 'd find a partial skeleton at some point  finally very recently we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of <unk> we returned to the site we collected more bones and so after one hundred years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature  and we were able to reconstruct it we now know that spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile  very different from other predatory dinosaurs very different from the t rex <unk>  but the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton <unk>  spines the spines forming the big sail <unk> we had leg bones <unk> we had skull bones feet wide feet again very unusual no other dinosaur has feet like this and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment or maybe for paddling in the water <unk>  we also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone the inside structure of spinosaurus bones and it turns out that they 're very dense <unk> and compact again this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water <unk> it 's useful for buoyancy control in the water <unk>  we <unk> c t scanned all of our bones and built a digital spinosaurus skeleton <unk>  and when we looked at the digital skeleton <unk> we realized that yes this was a dinosaur unlike any other it <unk> written all over it but really the entire skeleton has water loving written all over it dense bone paddle like feet <unk> and the hind limbs are reduced in size and again this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water <unk>  so as we fleshed out our spinosaurus i 'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin we realize that we 're dealing with a river monster <unk> monster a predatory dinosaur bigger than t rex the ruler of this ancient river of giants <unk> feeding on the many aquatic animals i showed you earlier on  so that 's really what makes this an incredible discovery it 's a dinosaur like no other <unk> and some people told me wow this is a once in a lifetime discovery there are not many things left to discover in the <unk> i think nothing could be further from the truth <unk>  i think the sahara 's still full of treasures <unk> and when people tell me there are no places left to explore i like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter roy chapman andrews  and he said  always <unk> there has been an adventure just around the corner and the world is still full of corners that was true many decades ago when roy chapman andrews wrote these lines <unk> and it is still true today <unk> thank you
