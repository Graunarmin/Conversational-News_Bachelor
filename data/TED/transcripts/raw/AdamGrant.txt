 <unk> seven years ago a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company he said  i 'm working with three friends and we 're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online  and i said ok you guys spent the whole <unk> we all took internships just in case it doesn 't work out all right but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate  not exactly we 've all lined up backup jobs  six months go by <unk> it 's the day before the company launches <unk> and there is still not a functioning website  you guys realize the entire company is a website that 's literally all it is  so i obviously declined to invest and they ended up naming the company <unk> parker  they sell glasses online <unk>  they were recently recognized as the world 's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars <unk>  and now my wife handles our investments <unk>  why was i so wrong to find out i 've been studying people <unk> originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them  they are people who stand out and speak up originals drive creativity and change in the world <unk> they 're the people you want to bet on  and they look nothing like i expected  i want to show you today three things i 've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them  so the first reason that i passed on warby parker was they were really slow getting off the ground <unk> now <unk> you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator <unk>  well i have a confession for you i 'm the opposite <unk> i 'm a <unk> yes that 's an actual term you know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven 't done anything yet <unk>  i just feel that a few months ahead of time so this started early when i was a kid <unk> i took nintendo games very seriously <unk>  i would wake up at 5am start playing and not stop until i had mastered them  eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of <unk> since then i have traded hair for teeth  but this served me well in college because i finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline <unk>  and i was proud of that <unk> until a few years ago <unk> i had a student named jihae who came to me and said i have my most creative ideas when i 'm procrastinating and i was like that 's cute where are the four papers you owe me  no she was one of our most creative students and as an organizational psychologist this is the kind of idea that i test <unk>  so i challenged her to get some data <unk> she goes into a bunch of companies she has people fill out <unk> surveys about how often they procrastinate then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are <unk>  and sure enough the precrastinators like me who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately <unk>  so i want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators <unk> she was like <unk> are our results  you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don 't have any new ideas  and on the flip side the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don 't have original thoughts either there 's a sweet sweet spot where originals seem to live <unk>  why is this <unk> maybe original people just have bad work habits <unk> maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity  to find out  we designed some experiments <unk> we asked people to generate new business ideas and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are  and some of them are asked to do the task right away others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling <unk> minesweeper in front of them for either five or ten minutes <unk>  and sure enough <unk> the moderate procrastinators are sixteen percent more creative than the other two groups  now minesweeper is awesome but it 's not the driver of the effect <unk> because if you play the game first before you learn about the task there 's no creativity boost it 's only when you 're told that you 're going to be working on this problem <unk> and then you start procrastinating but the task <unk> is still active in the back of your mind  that you start to incubate procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas to think in nonlinear ways to make unexpected leaps <unk>  so just as we were finishing these experiments i was starting to write a book about originals and i thought this is the perfect time to teach myself to <unk> i woke up early the next morning and i made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate  laughter and then i worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal i started writing the procrastination chapter and one day i <unk> was halfway through i literally put it away in <unk> mid sentence for months it was agony <unk>  but when i came back to it i had all sorts of new ideas  as aaron sorkin put it you call it procrastinating <unk> i call it thinking  and along the way i discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators <unk> take leonardo da vinci he <unk> toiled on and off for sixteen years on the mona lisa he felt like a failure he wrote as much in his journal <unk>  but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter <unk> what about martin luther king jr the night before the biggest speech of his life the march on washington <unk> he was up past rewriting it he 's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage <unk> and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines  when he gets onstage <unk> eleven minutes in he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history i have a dream that was not in the script  by delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the <unk> very last minute <unk>  he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas and because the text wasn 't set in stone <unk> he had freedom to improvise  procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity <unk> but it can be a virtue for creativity <unk>  what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they 're slow to finish and this is what i missed with when they were dragging their heels for six months i looked at them and said you know a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online  they missed the first mover advantage <unk>  but what i didn 't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online <unk>  and it turns out the first mover advantage is mostly a myth  look at a classic study of over fifty product categories <unk> comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better  what you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of forty seven percent compared with only eight percent for the improvers look at facebook waiting to build a social network until after myspace and friendster look at google waiting for years after altavista and yahoo <unk> 's much easier to improve on somebody else 's idea than it is to create something new from scratch  so the lesson i learned is that to be original you don 't have to be first you just have to be different and better  but that wasn 't the only reason i passed on warby parker <unk> they were also full of doubts they had backup plans <unk> and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because i expected that originals would look something like this  now on the surface a lot of original people look confident but behind the scenes they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do  they just manage it differently <unk>  let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us laughter now in my research i discovered there are two different kinds of doubt there 's self doubt and idea doubt self doubt is paralyzing <unk>  it leads you to freeze <unk> but idea doubt is energizing it motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like mlk did  and so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four instead of saying i 'm crap you say the first few drafts are always crap <unk>  and i 'm just not there yet  so how do you get there well there 's a clue it turns out in the internet browser that you use we can predict your job performance and your commitment just by <unk> knowing what web browser you use <unk> now some of you are not going to like the results of this study  but there is good evidence that firefox and chrome users significantly outperform internet explorer and safari users  they also stay in their jobs fifteen percent longer by the way <unk> why it 's not a technical advantage <unk> the four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge it 's about how you got the browser  because if you use internet explorer or safari those came preinstalled on your computer and you accepted the default option that was handed to you  if you wanted firefox or chrome you had to doubt the default and ask is there a different option out there <unk> and then be a little resourceful and download a <unk> so people hear about this study and they 're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser  no <unk> it 's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option  and if you do that well <unk> you will open yourself up to the opposite of dj vu  there 's a name for it it 's called vuja de laughter <unk> de is when you look at something you 've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes <unk>  it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can 't get the green light for more than half a century  in every past version <unk> the main character has been an evil queen <unk>  but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense she rewrites the first act reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever <unk> so there 's a simple message from this story when you feel doubt don 't let it go  what about fear originals feel fear too  they 're afraid of failing <unk> but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they 're even more afraid of failing to try <unk>  they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all they know that in the long run our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions <unk>  the things we wish we could redo if you look at the science are the chances not taken <unk>  elon musk told me recently he didn 't expect tesla to succeed <unk> he was sure the first few spacex launches would fail to make it to orbit let alone <unk> but it was too important not to try <unk> and for so many of us when we have an important idea we don 't bother to try <unk>  but i have some good news for you  you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas a lot of people think they will if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion eighty five percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up  <unk> they were afraid of embarrassing themselves of looking stupid <unk> but guess what originals have lots and lots of bad ideas <unk> tons of them in fact <unk>  take the guy who invented this do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults <unk> you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb  if you look across fields <unk> the greatest originals are the ones <unk> who fail the most because they 're the ones who try the most <unk> take classical composers the best of the best <unk> why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times one of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate <unk>  the more output you churn out the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original <unk> even the three icons of classical music bach <unk> beethoven mozart had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces <unk>  now <unk> you may be wondering how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot <unk> i don 't know how wagner pulled that off <unk>  but for most of us <unk> if we want to be more original we have to generate more <unk> ideas  the <unk> warby parker founders <unk> when they were trying to name their company <unk>  they needed something sophisticated unique with no negative associations to build a retail brand <unk>  and they tested over two thousand possibilities before they finally put together warby and parker <unk>  so if you put all this together what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us <unk> they feel fear and doubt <unk> procrastinate <unk> they have bad ideas and sometimes it 's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed <unk>  so when you see those things don 't make the same mistake i did don 't write them off and when that 's you don 't count yourself out either  know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity  that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try <unk> need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones  look being original is not easy <unk> but i have no doubt about this <unk> it 's the best way to improve the world around us
