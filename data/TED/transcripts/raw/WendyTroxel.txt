 <unk> it 's six o 'clock in the morning <unk> pitch black outside my 14 year old son is fast asleep in his bed <unk> sleeping the reckless <unk> deep sleep of a teenager <unk>  i flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake because i know that like ripping off band aid it 's better to get it over with quickly  i have a friend who yells fire just to rouse her sleeping teen  and another who got so fed up that she had to dump cold water on her son 's head just to get him out of bed <unk> sound brutal <unk> but perhaps familiar <unk>  every morning i ask myself <unk> i knowing what i know and doing what i do for a living be doing this to my own son you see <unk> i 'm a sleep researcher  laughter so i know far too much about sleep <unk> and the consequences of sleep loss  i know that i 'm depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs as a rapidly growing teenager <unk> i also <unk> know that by waking him up hours before his natural biological clock tells him he 's ready <unk> i 'm literally robbing him of his dreams the type of sleep most associated with learning <unk> memory consolidation and emotional processing <unk>  but it 's not just my kid that 's being deprived of <unk> sleep deprivation among american teenagers is an epidemic <unk>  only about one in ten gets the eight to ten hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians <unk>  now if you 're thinking to yourself phew we 're doing good my kid 's getting eight hours  remember eight hours is the minimum recommendation <unk> you 're barely passing  eight hours is kind of like getting a c on your report card there are many factors contributing to this epidemic <unk> but a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need is actually a matter of public policy <unk> not hormones <unk> social lives or snapchat across the country <unk> many schools are starting <unk> despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high school start no earlier than eight 30am  these early start policies have a direct effect on how much or really how little sleep american teenagers are getting they 're also pitting teenagers and their parents in a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies around the time of puberty teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock <unk> which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy  this is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin teenagers ' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around <unk> which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children  this means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at <unk> <unk> the unfortunate days when i have to wake up at 4am  i 'm a zombie <unk> functionally useless i can 't think straight <unk> i 'm irritable and i probably shouldn 't be driving a car <unk> car  but this is how many american teenagers feel every single school day  in fact many of the shall we say <unk>  unpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager moodiness <unk> irritability laziness depression could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation for many teens battling chronic sleep loss their <unk> to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine in the form of venti frappuccinos or energy drinks and shots  so essentially we 've got an entire population of tired but wired youth <unk>  advocates of sleep friendly start times know that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain <unk> development <unk> particularly in the parts of the brain that are responsible for those higher order thinking processes <unk> including reasoning and good judgment in other words the very type of brain activity that 's responsible for reining in those impulsive and often risky behaviors that are so characteristic of adolescence and that are so terrifying to us parents of <unk> teenagers they know that like the rest of us when teenagers don 't get the sleep they need their brains their bodies and behaviors suffer with both immediate and lasting effects <unk> they can 't concentrate their attention plummets and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic but the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom sadly contributing to many of the mental health problems that skyrocket during adolescence  including substance use <unk> depression and suicide  in our work with teens from la unified school district  we found that teens with sleep problems were fifty five percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month  in another study with over thirty <unk> thousand high school students <unk> they found that for each hour of lost sleep <unk>  there was a thirty eight percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless  and a fifty eight percent increase in teen suicide attempts <unk>  and if that 's not enough teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems that plague our country obesity <unk> heart disease and diabetes <unk>  then there 's the risk of putting a sleep deprived teen with a newly minted driver 's license <unk> behind the wheel <unk>  studies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol <unk> start times and researchers in this area have produced tremendous science showing the tremendous benefits of later start times  the findings are unequivocal and as a sleep scientist <unk> i rarely get to speak with that kind of <unk> teens from districts with later start times get more sleep to the naysayers who may think that if schools start later teens will just stay up later  the truth is their bedtimes stay the same but their wake up times get extended <unk> resulting in more sleep  they 're more likely to show up for school school absences dropped by twenty five percent in one district <unk> and they 're less likely to drop out  not surprisingly <unk> they do better academically <unk> so this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap <unk>  standardized test scores in math and reading go up by two to three percentage points  that 's as powerful as reducing class sizes by <unk> one third fewer students  or replacing a so so teacher in the classroom with a truly outstanding one <unk> their mental and physical health improves <unk> and even their families are happier <unk>  i mean who wouldn 't enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens and a little less crankiness  even their communities are safer because car crash rates go down a seventy percent reduction in one district <unk> given these tremendous benefits you might think well this is a no brainer right <unk>  so why have we as a society failed to heed this call  often the argument against later start times goes something like this  why should we delay start times for teenagers we need to toughen them up so they 're ready for the real world but that 's like saying <unk> to the parent of a two year old don 't let johnny nap or he won 't be ready for kindergarten  delaying start times also presents many logistical challenges not just for students and their families but for communities as a whole <unk>  updating bus routes increased transportation costs <unk> impact on sports <unk> care before or after school these are are the same concerns that come up in district after district <unk> time and again around the country as school start times are debated <unk>  and they 're legitimate concerns  but these are problems we have to work through <unk>  they are not valid excuses for failing to do the right thing for our children <unk>  which is to start middle and high schools no earlier <unk> and in districts around the country big and small who have made this change <unk> they found that these fears are often unfounded and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits for student health and performance and our collective public safety  so tomorrow morning when coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour and you get that <unk> delicious extra hour of sleep  and the day seems a little longer <unk> and a little more full of hope  think about the tremendous power of sleep and think about what a gift it would be for our children to be able to wake up naturally in harmony with their own biology
