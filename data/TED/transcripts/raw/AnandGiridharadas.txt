 <unk> where are you from said the pale tattooed man where are you from <unk> the worst attack on america since world war ii  everyone wonders about the next plane people are looking for scapegoats <unk>  the president the night before <unk> pledges to bring our enemies to justice or bring justice <unk> surrounded by tire shops and strip joints a bangladeshi immigrant works the register back home was a big man an air force officer <unk> but he dreamed of a fresh start in america if he had to work <unk> briefly in a mini mart to save up for i t classes and his wedding in two months so be it  then on september twenty one that tattooed man enters the mart he holds a shotgun raisuddin knows the drill <unk> puts cash on the counter <unk> this time <unk> the man doesn 't touch the money where are you from <unk> feels millions of bees stinging his face <unk> in fact <unk> dozens of scalding birdshot pellets puncture his head behind the counter <unk> he lays in blood <unk> he cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains on which he 'd gambled everything <unk> verses from the koran begging his god to live he senses he is dying he didn 't die his right eye left him <unk> his fiance left him <unk> his landlord <unk> kicked him out soon he was homeless and sixty thousand dollars in medical debt including a fee for dialing for an ambulance  but raisuddin lived <unk> and years later he would ask what he could do to repay his god and become worthy of this second <unk> he would come to believe in fact that this chance called for him to give a second chance to a man we might think deserved no chance at all  twelve years ago <unk> i was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world  born in ohio to indian immigrants <unk> i settled on the ultimate rebellion against my parents <unk> moving to the country they had worked so damn hard to <unk> out of  what i thought might be a six month stint in mumbai stretched to six years  i became a writer and found myself amid a magical story the awakening of hope across much of the so called third world  six years ago <unk> i returned to america and realized something the american dream was thriving <unk> but only in india  in america not so much <unk> in fact <unk> i observed that america was fracturing into two distinct societies a republic of dreams and a republic of fears <unk> and then <unk> i stumbled onto this incredible tale of two lives and of these two americas that brutally collided <unk> in that dallas mini mart  i knew at once i wanted to learn more and eventually that i would write a book about them  for their story was the story of america 's fracturing and of how it might be put back together after he was shot  <unk> the day after admitting him <unk> the hospital discharged him <unk>  his right eye couldn 't see <unk> he couldn 't speak metal peppered his face <unk>  but he had no insurance so they bounced him <unk>  his family in bangladesh begged him come home  but he told them he had a dream <unk> he found telemarketing work then he became an olive garden waiter because where better to get over his fear of white people than the olive garden  now as a devout muslim  he refused alcohol didn 't touch the stuff then he learned that not selling it would slash his pay so he reasoned <unk> like a budding american <unk> pragmatist well god wouldn 't want me to starve would he  and before long <unk> in some months raisuddin was that olive garden 's highest grossing alcohol pusher <unk>  he found a man who taught him database administration he got part time i t gigs <unk> eventually he landed a six figure job at a blue chip tech company in dallas <unk> but as america began to work for raisuddin he avoided the classic error of the fortunate  assuming you 're the rule not the exception <unk>  in fact <unk> he observed that many with the fortune of being born american were nonetheless trapped in lives that made second chances like his impossible <unk> he saw it at the olive garden itself  where so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories of family dysfunction chaos <unk> addiction crime  he 'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him back when he attended his trial <unk> the closer <unk> to the america he had coveted from afar the more he realized there was another <unk> equally real america that was stingier with second chances <unk>  the man who shot raisuddin grew up in that stingier america from a distance <unk> mark stroman was always the spark of parties <unk> always making girls feel pretty always working no matter what drugs or fights he 'd had the night before <unk> but he 'd always wrestled with demons <unk> he entered the world through the three gateways that doom so many young american men <unk> bad parents <unk> bad schools <unk> bad prisons  his mother told him  <unk> as a boy that she 'd been just fifty dollars short of aborting him <unk> sometimes that little boy would be at school he 'd suddenly pull a knife on his fellow classmates <unk>  sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents ' tenderly feeding horses  he was getting arrested before he shaved first juvenile then prison he became a casual <unk> white supremacist and like so many around him <unk> a drug addled and absent father <unk>  and then before long <unk> he found himself on death row for in his two thousand and one he had shot not one <unk> death row was the first institution that left stroman better  his old influences quit him <unk>  the people entering his life were virtuous and caring <unk> pastors journalists <unk> european pen pals  they listened to him <unk> prayed with <unk> helped him question himself and sent him on a journey of introspection and betterment <unk> he finally faced the hatred that had defined his life <unk>  he read viktor frankl the holocaust survivor and regretted his swastika tattoos <unk> he found god <unk>  then one day in two thousand and eleven <unk> ten years after his crimes stroman received news one of the men he 'd shot the survivor was fighting to save his life  you see late in two thousand and nine <unk>  eight years after that shooting raisuddin had gone on his own journey a pilgrimage to mecca  amid its crowds <unk> he felt immense gratitude but also duty  he recalled promising god as he lay dying in two thousand and one that if he lived <unk> he would serve humanity all his days  then he 'd gotten busy relaying the bricks of a life <unk>  now it was time to pay his debts and he decided upon <unk> that his method of payment would be an intervention in the cycle of vengeance between the muslim and western worlds <unk> and how would he intervene  by forgiving stroman publicly in the name of islam and its doctrine of mercy <unk> and then suing the state of texas and its governor rick perry to prevent them from executing stroman exactly like most people shot in the <unk> face do  yet raisuddin 's mercy was inspired not only by faith a newly minted american citizen he had come to believe that stroman was the product of a hurting america that couldn 't just <unk> that insight is what moved me to write my book the true american this immigrant begging america to be as merciful to a native son as it had been to an adopted one  in the mini mart all those years earlier <unk> not just two men but two americas collided  an america that still dreams still strives still imagines that tomorrow can build <unk> on today <unk>  and an america that has resigned to fate <unk>  buckled under stress and chaos <unk> lowered expectations an ducked into the oldest of refuges <unk>  the tribal fellowship of one 's own narrow kind  and it was raisuddin despite being a newcomer despite being attacked <unk> despite being homeless and traumatized  who belonged to that republic of dreams and stroman who belonged to that other wounded country despite being born with the privilege of a native white man  i realized these men 's stories formed an urgent parable about america  the country i am so proud to call my own wasn 't living through a generalized decline as <unk> seen in spain or greece where prospects were dimming for everyone  america is simultaneously the most and the least successful country in the industrialized world  launching the world 's best companies  even as record numbers of children go hungry  <unk> for large groups <unk> even as it polishes the world 's best hospitals america today is a sprightly young body <unk>  hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side <unk> while leaving the other worryingly perfect on july twenty two thousand and eleven <unk> right after a sobbing raisuddin testified in defense <unk> of stroman 's life stroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved <unk> hours earlier  when raisuddin still thought he could still save stroman the two men got to speak for the second time ever here is an excerpt from their phone call  <unk> you should know that i am praying for god the most compassionate and gracious <unk> i forgive you and i do not hate you i never hated you  stroman  you are a remarkable person <unk> thank you from my heart <unk> i love you bro  even more amazingly after the execution <unk> and offered his help you may have lost a father he told her but you 've gained an uncle  he wanted her too to have a second chance  if human history were a <unk> america 's float would be a neon shrine to second chances <unk> but america <unk> generous with second chances to the children of other lands today grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own america still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an <unk> but it is losing its luster at allowing every american to become a somebody  over the last decade <unk> seven million foreigners gained american citizenship remarkable  in the meanwhile how many americans gained a place in the middle class  actually the net influx was negative <unk> go back further and it 's even more <unk> the middle class has shrunk by twenty percent <unk> mainly because of the people tumbling out of it  and my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer than simple inequality what i observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of american life an affluent secession of up up and away  into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix of work money and connections <unk> and an impoverished secession of down and out into disconnected dead end lives that the fortunate scarcely see  and don 't console yourself that you are the ninety nine percent <unk>  if you live near <unk> a whole foods <unk>  if no one in your family serves in the military  if you 're paid by the year not the hour <unk>  if most people you know finished college if no one you know uses meth <unk>  if you married once and remain married if you 're not one of sixty five million americans with a criminal record if any or all of these things describe you then accept the possibility that actually you may not know what 's going on and you may be part of the problem  other generations had to build a fresh society after slavery pull through a depression defeat fascism  <unk> in mississippi  the moral challenge of my generation i believe is to reacquaint these two americas to choose union over secession once again  this ins 't a problem we can tax or tax cut away <unk> it won 't be solved by tweeting harder <unk>  building slicker apps or starting one more artisanal coffee roasting service  it is a moral challenge that begs each of us <unk> in the flourishing america to take on the wilting america as our own as raisuddin tried to do  like him we can make pilgrimages <unk>  and there <unk> in baltimore and oregon and appalachia find new purpose as he did we can immerse ourselves in that other country bear witness to its hopes and sorrows <unk> and like raisuddin ask what we can do <unk>  what can you do  what can you do <unk>  what can we do how might we build a more merciful country  we the greatest inventors in the world can invent solutions to the problems of that <unk> america not only our own we the writers and the journalists can cover that america 's stories <unk> instead of shutting down bureaus in its midst  we can finance that america 's ideas <unk> instead of ideas from new york and san francisco  we can put our stethoscopes to its backs <unk> teach there <unk> go to court there <unk> make there live there <unk> pray there <unk> this i believe <unk> is the calling of a generation  an america whose two halves learn again to stride to plow to forge to dare together a republic of chances
