 <unk> i should tell you that when i was asked to be here <unk> i thought to myself that well <unk> it 's ted <unk> and these tedsters are you know <unk>  as innocent as that name sounds these are the philanthropists <unk> scientists who sort of shape our world and what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that and so i thought perhaps a really civilized sounding british accent might help things a bit and then i thought no no i should just get up there and be myself and and just talk the way i really talk because after all this <unk> and so i thought i 'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you <unk> although many of you already know that i do speak the queen 's english because i am from queens new york  but the theme of this session of course is invention and while i don 't have any patents that i 'm aware of  you will be meeting a few of my inventions today <unk> <unk> i suppose it 's fair to say that i am interested in the invention of self or selves <unk> we 're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits unique developmental experiences geographical and historical contexts <unk> but then what  to what extent do we <unk> how do we <unk> and how mutable is that identity like what if one could be anyone at any <unk> time <unk> well my characters <unk> like the ones in my shows <unk> allow me to play with the spaces between those questions and so i 've brought a couple of them with me  and well <unk> they 're very excited <unk> what i should tell you what i should tell you is that they 've each prepared their own little ted <unk> good evening everybody thank you so very much for having me here today ah thank you very much my name is lorraine levine <unk> i am here because of a young girl sarah jones she 's a very nice young black girl <unk> well you know she calls herself black she 's really more like a caramel color if you look at her <unk> but anyway  she has me here because she she puts me in her show what she calls her one woman <unk> and you know what that means of course <unk> that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work <unk>  but i don 't mind <unk> frankly i 'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this you know <unk>  really <unk> it 's amazing not only of course the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities  there are so <unk> many celebrities running around here i saw glenn close i saw earlier i love her <unk> and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe isn 't that adorable  so many others you see they 're just wonderful it 's lovely to know they 're concerned you know <unk> and oh i saw goldie hawn oh goldie hawn i love her too she 's wonderful yeah you know <unk> she 's only half jewish did you know that about <unk> but even so a wonderful talent and i you know when i saw her such a wonderful feeling <unk> yeah she 's lovely <unk>  but anyway i should have started by saying just how lucky i feel it 's such an eye opening experience to be here  you 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today you know i couldn 't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl made these advancements happen in such a short time you 're all so young you know your parents must be very proud <unk> but i i also appreciate the diversity that you have here i noticed it 's very multicultural you know  when you 're standing up here you can see all the different people it 's like a rainbow <unk> it 's okay to say rainbow <unk>  yeah <unk> i just i can 't keep up with whether you can say you know <unk> the different things what are you allowed to say or not say i just i don 't want to offend anybody you but anyway <unk> you know i just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people literally some of you the architects building our <unk> 's heartening to me <unk> even though quite frankly some of your presentations are horrifying <unk> absolutely horrifying it 's true <unk> it 's true <unk> you know between the environmental degradation and the the crashing of the world markets you 're talking about and of course we know it 's all because of the all the well i don 't know how else to <unk> just say it my way the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the you know the bankers and the wall street you know it anyway  the point is i 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements  thank you for all that you do and congratulations on being such big makhers that you 've become ted meisters continued success congratulations mazel tov hi  thank you everybody sorry this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything to be here right now my name is noraida <unk> and i 'm just i 'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you 're doing and everything like that dominican american actually you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic otherwise known as washington heights in new york city <unk> but i don 't know if there 's any other dominican people here but i know that juan enriquez he was here yesterday and i think he 's mexican so that 's honestly that 's close enough for me right now so  i just i 'm sorry i 'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything and i just <unk> used to doing the public speaking and whenever i get nervous i start to talk really fast nobody can understand nothing i 'm saying which is very frustrating for me as you can imagine <unk> i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath but then on top of that you know sarah jones told me we only have eighteen minutes so then i 'm like should i be nervous you know because maybe it 's better and i 'm just trying not to panic and freak out so i like <unk>  take a deep breath  okay sorry so anyway <unk> what i was trying to say is that i really love ted like i love everything about this <unk> over this right now and like people would not believe seriously where i 'm from that this even exists <unk> you know like even i mean i love like the name the ted <unk> i mean i know it 's a real person and everything but i 'm just saying that like <unk>  you know <unk> i think it 's very cool how it 's also an acronym you know which is like you know is like very high concept and everything like that i like that <unk> and actually i can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything because actually i 'm a sophomore at college right <unk> now <unk> at my school actually i was part of co founding an organization which is like a leadership thing you know like you guys you would really like it and everything <unk> and the organization is called da bomb a \ and da bomb not like what you guys can build and everything it 's like da bomb it means like dominican it 's an acronym <unk> benevolent organization for mothers and babies <unk> know see like the name is like a little bit long but with the war on terror and everything the dean of student activities has asked us to stop saying da bomb and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea whatever <unk> so <unk> basically like da bomb what dominican american benevolent organization for mothers and babies does is <unk> basically we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise <unk> and who also happen to be mothers like me <unk> i am a working mother and i also go to school full time and  you know it 's like it 's so important to have like role models out there i mean i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different whatever <unk> but like even at my job like i just got promoted  right now it 's very exciting actually for me because i 'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development that 's my new title <unk> but i think whether you own your own company or you 're just starting out like me like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning <unk> and if everybody like all people <unk> <unk> really had access to that it would be a very different world out there as i know you know so i think all people we need that but especially i look at people like me <unk>  <unk> two weeks so we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else so i 'm very happy that you 're you know <unk> doing this kind of thing making the talks available online that 's very good i love that <unk> and i just <unk> <unk> i love you guys i love ted and if you don 't mind <unk> privately now in the future i 'm going to think of ted as an acronym for <unk> that was noraida and just like lorraine and everybody else you 're meeting today <unk> these are folks who are based on real people from my real life <unk> friends <unk> neighbors family members i come from a multicultural family in <unk> the older lady you just met very very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother 's side it 's a long story believe me <unk> but on top of my family background my parents also sent me to the united nations school where i encountered a plethora of new characters including alexandre my french teacher <unk> okay well you know it was beginner <unk> it was like <unk> you know she was there in the class you know she was kind of typically french you know she was very chic but she was very filled with ennui <unk> you know and she would be there you know kind of talking with the class <unk> you know <unk> talking about the <unk> you know the existential <unk> i took german for three years [ german ] and it was quite the experience because i was the only black girl in the class <unk> even in the un school <unk> although you know it was wonderful the teacher herr schtopf he never discriminated never he always always treated each of us you know equally <unk> unbearably during the class <unk> so there were the teachers and then there were my friends classmates from everywhere  many of whom are still dear friends to this day <unk> and they 've inspired many characters as well <unk> for example a friend of mine  well i just wanted to quickly say good evening my name is praveen manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity of course ted the reputation precedes itself all over the world but you know i am originally from india and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california originally i was very pleased and frankly <unk> relieved because you know i am a human rights advocate <unk> and usually my work it takes me to washington d c and there i must attend these meetings mingling with some tiresome politicians trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown  so you can just imagine right so but i 'm thrilled to to be joining all of you here i wish we had more time together but that 's for another time okay <unk> i don 't think we 'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought but i i 'm trying to behave myself it 's my first time here <unk> but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize if <unk> my name is pauline ning and first i i want to tell you <unk> that i 'm of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york <unk> but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted <unk> you know first i don 't know that you know before two years ago <unk> you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that as an immigrant <unk> i do not have good english skills for speaking <unk> but then i decided just like <unk> my daughter my daughter wrote that she told me always start your speech with humor but my background i want to tell you story only briefly <unk> my husband and i we brought our son and daughter here <unk> to have the freedom we cannot have <unk> in china at that time and we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition but it 's very hard you know as immigrant i would speak chinese to them <unk> and they would always answer me back in english  they love rock music <unk> pop culture american culture <unk> but when they got older when the time comes for them to start think about getting married  that 's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture <unk> but that 's where we had some problems  my son he says he is not ready to get married <unk> and he has a sweetheart <unk> but she is american woman not chinese it 's not that it 's bad but i told him what 's wrong with a chinese woman  but i think he will change his mind soon so then i decide instead <unk> i will <unk> concentrate on my daughter the daughter 's marriage is very special to the mom but first <unk> she said she 's not interested she only wants to spend time with her friends <unk> and then at college it 's like she never came home <unk> and she doesn 't want me to come and visit <unk> so i said what 's wrong in this picture <unk> daughter to have like a secret boyfriend <unk> but she told me mom <unk> you don 't have to worry about boys because i don 't like them  and i said  yes <unk> men can be difficult but all women have to get used to that  she said no mom <unk> i mean i don 't like boys i like girls i am lesbian i always teach my kids to respect american ideas <unk> but i told my daughter that this is one exception  that she is not gay she is just confused by this american problem <unk> but she <unk> it 's not american she said she is in love in love with a nice chinese girl  laughter so <unk> these are the words i am waiting to hear but from my son not my daughter  laughter but at first i did not know what to do <unk> but then over time i have come to understand that this this is who she is so even though <unk> though sometimes it 's still hard <unk> i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant  usually because of places like this because of ideas like this and people like you with an open mind so i think maybe <unk> my name is habbi belahal and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought with her to be last today <unk> i am originally from jordan <unk> and i teach comparative literature at queens college <unk> it is not harvard <unk> but i feel a bit like a fish out of water but i am very proud of my students and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference so you will get the extra credit i promised you  but while i know that i may not look like the typical <unk> ted izen as you would say i do like to make the point that we in global society we are never as different as the appearances may suggest <unk> so if you will indulge me <unk> i will share quickly with you a bit of verse <unk> which i memorized as a young girl at sixteen years of age <unk> so <unk> back in the ancient times <unk> me hold your hand <unk> i want to hold your hand <unk> i want to hold your hand <unk> and when i touch you i <unk> it 's such a feeling that my love i can 't hide <unk> i can 't hide <unk> i can 't hide well <unk> so okay <unk> but please <unk> please <unk> <unk> but please <unk> if it is sounding familiar  it is because i was at the same time in my life listening to the beatles  on the radio <unk> say that i like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another  there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme <unk>  and i pray that this is the way that we will <unk> you very much for the opportunity okay <unk> for having me here
