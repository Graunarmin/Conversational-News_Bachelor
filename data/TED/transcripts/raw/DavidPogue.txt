 <unk> called for tech support again i ignored my boss 's now it 's evening and my dinner first grew cold and then grew mold <unk> i 'm still on hold <unk> i 'm listening to the sounds of silence <unk> i don 't think you understand <unk> i think your phone lines are unmanned  i punched every touch tone i was told <unk> i 've still spent eighteen hours on hold it 's not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs it erased my roms now the mac makes the sounds of silence in my dreams i fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys  <unk> motorcycle crashes blood comes gushing from your gashes with your fading strength <unk> and you pray for a trained md <unk> but you get me <unk> spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist  when i was offered the times column six years ago <unk> the deal was like this you 'll be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets every week it 'll arrive at your door <unk> <unk> you get to try them out play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out before you have to send them back and you 'll get paid for it <unk> think about it if you want <unk> so i 've always been a technology nut and i absolutely love it the job though came with one small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column <unk> and what i 've noticed is first of all you get an incredible amount of email if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds <unk> hundreds of emails <unk> and the email i 'm getting a lot today is about frustration people are feeling like things ok <unk> i just had an alarm come up on my screen <unk> lucky you can 't see it <unk>  people are feeling overwhelmed they 're feeling like it 's too much technology too fast it may be good technology <unk> but i feel like there 's not enough of a support structure there 's not enough help there 's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it <unk> easy and enjoyable to use one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support and within twelve hours there were seven hundred messages <unk> from readers on the feedback boards on the times website from users saying me too and here 's my tale of woe  oh how did that get up there just kidding  ok so why is the problem accelerating and part of the problem is ironically because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use i 'll show you what i mean <unk>  this is what the computer interface used to look like  dos <unk> over the <unk> it 's gotten easier to use this is the original mac operating system  reagan was president madonna was still a brunette <unk> and the entire operating system this is the good part the entire operating system fit in two hundred and eleven k <unk>  you couldn 't put the mac os x logo in two hundred and eleven k  laughter so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical  broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time  i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day <unk> the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to  and the calls that you know how they say  your call may be recorded for quality assurance  uh uh your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd and i have a copy it 's in your gift bag no no  with your voices on it <unk> so some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable a woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking making a squeaking noise and the technician said well ma 'am what do you mean your mouse <unk> i can tell you is that it squeaks louder <unk> the faster i move it across the screen  and the technician 's like ma 'am you 've got the mouse up against the screen she goes well the message said ' click here to continue '  laughter well <unk> if you like that one how much time have we got another one a guy <unk> this is absolutely true his computer had crashed and he told the technician he couldn 't restart it no matter how many times he typed eleven and the technician said  what why are you typing eleven he said the message says ' error type eleven '  so  we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users <unk> but why is the technical overload crisis <unk> the complexity crisis accelerating now in the hardware world it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller smaller smaller <unk> so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier <unk>  but our fingers are essentially staying the same size so it gets to be more and more of a challenge software is subject to another primal force <unk> the mandate to release more and more versions when you buy a piece of software it 's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it it 's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say we 've added more features <unk> and we 'll sell it to you for $ ninety nine i know one guy who 's spent $ four thousand just on photoshop over the years  <unk> which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it i mean  microsoft word was last just a word processor in you know the eisenhower administration  but what 's the alternative microsoft actually did this experiment they said well wait a minute everyone complains that we 're adding so many features let 's create a word processor that 's just a word processor simple pure does not do web pages <unk> it came out and it was called microsoft write and none of you are nodding in acknowledgment because it died it tanked no one ever bought it <unk>  i call this the sport utility principle people like to surround themselves with unnecessary power right they don 't need the database and the website <unk> but they 're like well i 'll upgrade because i might you know i might need that someday  so the problem is as you add more features where are they going to go <unk> where are you going to stick them you only have so <unk> many design tools <unk> you can do buttons you can do sliders pop up menus <unk> sub menus  but if you 're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this  this is an this is not a joke un retouched photo of microsoft word the copy that you have with all the toolbars open you 've obviously never opened all the toolbars <unk> but all you have to type <unk> in is this little teeny window down here  and we 've arrived at the age of of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal <unk> you guys all complain about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically <unk> the off switch is in there somewhere <unk>  i 'm telling you it 's there part of the art of designing a simple good interface is knowing when to use which one of these features so here is the log off dialogue box for windows two thousand there are only four choices <unk>  so why are they in a pop up menu <unk> it 's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need <unk> they could have put them all out in view here 's apple 's take on the exact same dialogue box thank you yes <unk> i designed the dialogue box no  no already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design <unk> microsoft 's approach to simplicity tends to be let 's break it down let 's just make it more steps <unk> there 's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue at this pace there 's absolutely no telling where they might wind up [ welcome to the type a word wizard <unk> so there is a limit that we don 't want to cross  so what is the answer how do you pack in all these features in a simple intelligent way <unk>  i believe in consistency when possible real world equivalents trash can folder when possible <unk> label things mostly <unk> but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence <unk> now what do i mean by that i 'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent <unk> but it 's better if you are buying something on the web you 're supposed to put in your address <unk> and you 're supposed to choose what country you 're from ok <unk> there are two hundred countries in the world we like to think of the internet as a global village <unk> i 'm sorry <unk> it 's not one yet <unk> it 's mainly like the united <unk> you have to scroll like seven screensful to get to it <unk> now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent <unk> this one 's been touched on before <unk> but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called start  here 's another pet one of mine you have a printer <unk> most of the time you want to print one copy of your document in page order on that printer <unk> so why in god 's name do you see this every time you print  it 's like a seven hundred and forty seven shuttle cockpit  and one of the buttons at the bottom <unk> i 'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the the cult of simplicity  palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the ' 90s and after the talk i met one of the employees <unk> palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus it 's too long <unk> and it has to be redesigned ' so i 'm the tap counter  so i 'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter  this is microsoft word ok <unk> when you want to create a new blank document in word <unk> you go up to the file menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new do you get a new blank document you do not  on the opposite side of the monitor  a task bar appears and somewhere in those links by the way not at the top somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document <unk>  ok so that is a company not counting taps <unk> you know i don 't want to just stand here and make fun of microsoft yes i do  the bill gates song i 've been a geek forever and i wrote the very first dos <unk>  i put my software and <unk> together i got profit and they got the loss  i write the code that makes the whole world run i 'm getting royalties from everyone sometimes it 's garbage but the press is snowed  <unk> 'll sell the code  every software company is doing microsoft 's r & d you can 't keep a good idea down these days <unk> even windows is a hack we 're kind of based loosely on the mac <unk> so it 's big so it 's slow you 've got nowhere to go i 'm not doing this for praise  <unk> and i write the code <unk> i believe there are really two microsofts there 's the old one responsible for windows and office  they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can 't they 're locked in because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old one thousand nine hundred and <unk> but there 's also a new microsoft that 's really doing good simple interface designs i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch  the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market but it wasn 't because it wasn 't simply and beautifully designed but let 's put it this way <unk> would you pay $ ten a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone and stops working when you leave your area code indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse so is there any hope the screens are getting smaller people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes <unk> things are coming out at a faster pace <unk> it 's funny when steve jobs came back to apple in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven after twelve years away it was the macworld expo he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of did this the crowd went wild <unk> but i had just seen i 'm like where have i seen this before i had just seen the movie evita  with madonna and i 'm like you know what i 've got to do one about steve jobs  it won 't be easy you 'll think i 'm strange  when i try to explain why i 'm back after telling the press apple 's future is black you all that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named woz  you try rhyming with garage <unk> are i made a fortune over at pixar don 't cry for me cupertino <unk> i 've still got the drive and vision <unk> i still wear sandals in any weather <unk> it 's just that these days <unk> they 're gucci leather <unk> steve jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty <unk> and the the truth is for years i was a little depressed because americans obviously did not value it <unk> because the mac had three percent market share windows had ninety five percent market share people did not think it was worth putting a price on it so i was i was a little depressed and i heard al gore 's talk and i realized i didn 't know the meaning of depressed  it turns out i was wrong right because the ipod came out and it violated every bit of common wisdom <unk> other products cost less other products had more features they had voice recorders <unk> <unk> and fm transmitters the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard <unk> not apple 's propriety standard <unk> but the ipod won this is the one they wanted the lesson was simplicity sells <unk> and there are signs that the industry is getting the message this is a little company that 's done very well with simplicity and elegance the sonos thing it 's catching on i 've got just a couple examples <unk> physically a really cool elegant thinking coming along lately <unk> when you have a digital camera <unk> how do you get the pictures back to your <unk> you either haul around a usb cable or you buy a card reader and haul that around either one you 're going to lose what i do is i take out the memory card <unk> and i fold it in half  revealing usb contacts i just stick it in the computer offload the pictures put it right back in the camera i never have to lose anything <unk> here 's another example <unk> chris you 're the source of all power will you be my power <unk> hold that and don 't let go <unk> you might 've seen this this is apple 's new laptop this the power cord it hooks on like this and i 'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives <unk> or one of your children <unk>  you walk along and i 'm about to pull this onto the floor i don 't care it 's a loaner here we go  whoa it 's magnetic it doesn 't pull the laptop onto the floor  <unk> lot of my work using speech recognition software and i 'll just you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous <unk> speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly period like i get hundreds of them a day period <unk>  and it 's not just what i dictate that it writes down period <unk> i also use this feature called voice macros period <unk> this is not an ideal situation because it 's getting the echo from the hall and stuff the point is i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word <unk> and having it write out a much longer thing so if somebody sends me a fan letter <unk> if somebody sends me hate mail which happens daily i say so the point is this is a really interesting story this is version eight of this software and do you know what they put in version eight no new features it 's never happened before in software the company put no new features they just said we 'll make this software work right  right <unk> because for years people had bought this software tried it out ninety five percent accuracy was all they got which means one in twenty words is wrong and they 'd put it in their drawer <unk> the company got sick of that so they said this version we 're not going to do anything <unk> but make sure it 's darned accurate and so that 's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread so my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology <unk> remember if it doesn 't work it 's not necessarily you ok it could be the design of the thing you 're using <unk> be aware in life of good design and bad design and if you 're among the people who create this stuff  easy is hard pre sweat the details for your audience  count the taps <unk> remember <unk> the hard part is not deciding what features to add <unk> it 's deciding what to leave out and best of all your motivation is <unk> simplicity sells
