 <unk> let 's start with a figure <unk> during two thousand and fifteen <unk> almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in europe from many different countries of course from syria and iraq  <unk> afghanistan and bangladesh and eritrea and elsewhere and there have been reactions of two different kinds welcoming parties and border fences <unk> but i want to look at it a little bit from the short term and the <unk> long term perspective and the first question is very simple <unk>  why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months ag well  i think basically what triggered this huge increase was the syrian refugee group there has been an increased <unk> movement into europe from africa from asia <unk> but slowly growing and all of a sudden we had this massive increase in the first months of this year <unk>  why i think there are three reasons two long term ones and the trigger the long term ones  in relation to syrians is that hope is less <unk> look at their own country and they don 't see much hope to go back home <unk> because there is no political solution so there is no light at the end of the tunnel <unk> second the living conditions of the syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating <unk> we just had research with the world bank  and eighty seven percent of the syrians in jordan and ninety three percent of the syrians in lebanon live below the national poverty lines only half of the children go to school <unk> which means that people are living very badly not only are they refugees out of home not only have they suffered what they have suffered but they are living in <unk> very very dramatic conditions <unk> and then the trigger was when all of a sudden international aid decreased <unk> thirty percent food support to the syrian refugees <unk> they 're not allowed to work  so they are totally dependent on international support <unk> and they felt the world is abandoning us and that in my opinion was the trigger all of a sudden <unk> there was a rush <unk> and people started <unk> <unk> to move in large numbers and to be absolutely honest <unk> if i had been in the same situation <unk> wasn 't supposed to be sudden the war in syria has been happening for five years millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around syria  you have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of libya for example <unk>  and yet europe looked totally unprepared ag  well <unk> unprepared because divided and when you are divided you don 't want to recognize the reality <unk> you prefer to postpone decisions because you do not have the capacity to <unk> them <unk> and the proof is that even when the spike occurred europe remained divided and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation you talk about one million people it looks enormous <unk> but the population of the european union is five hundred and fifty million people which means we are talking about one per <unk> refugee per three lebanese <unk> and lebanon <unk>  struggling of course <unk> but it 's managing <unk> so <unk> the question is is this something that could have been managed if not mentioning the most important thing which would have been addressing the root causes <unk> but forgetting about root causes for now looking at the phenomenon as it is <unk> able to come together in solidarity to create an adequate reception capacity of entry points but for that the countries at entry points need to be massively supported <unk> and then screening the people <unk> <unk> with security checks and all the other mechanisms distributing those that are coming into all european countries <unk> according to the possibilities of each country <unk>  too little too late bg it 's already breaking down ag my country is supposed to receive four thousand four thousand in portugal means nothing so this is perfectly manageable if it is managed <unk> but in the present circumstances the pressure is at the point of entry <unk> and then as people move in this chaotic way through the balkans then they come to germany sweden <unk>  <unk> and austria they are the three countries that are in the end receiving the refugees the rest of europe is looking without doing much bg let me try to bring up three questions playing a bit devil 's advocate <unk> i 'll try to ask them <unk> make them blunt but i think the questions are very present in the minds of many people in europe right now the first of course is about numbers you say five hundred and fifty million versus one million is not much but realistically how many people can europe take because refugees have the right to be protected <unk>  and there is such a thing as international law <unk> so there is no way you can say i take ten thousand and that 's finished  i remind you of one thing <unk> in turkey at the beginning of the crisis i remember one minister saying turkey will be able to receive up to one <unk> thousand or something of the sort if you count all refugees  so i don 't think it 's fair to say how many we can take what it is fair to say is how we can we organize ourselves to assume our international responsibilities <unk> <unk> and europe has not been able to do so because basically europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the european project <unk> and 's not only about refugees there are many other areas and let 's be honest this is the moment in which we need more europe instead of less europe <unk>  but as the public less and less believes in european institutions it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more europe to solve these problems bg we seem to be at the point where the numbers turn into political shifts particularly domestically we saw it again this weekend in france but we have seen it over and over in many countries in poland and in denmark and in switzerland and elsewhere the the mood changes radically because of of the numbers although they are not very significant in absolute numbers <unk> the prime minister of ag but if i may on these <unk> i mean <unk> what does a european see at home in a <unk> every single day a few months ago <unk> opening the news every single day a crowd coming uncontrolled moving from border to border and the images on television were of hundreds or thousands of people moving and the idea is that nobody is taking care of it this is happening without any kind of management and so their idea <unk> they are coming to my village so there was this completely false idea that europe was being invaded and our way of life is going to change <unk> and everything will and and the problem is that if this had been properly managed if people had been properly received <unk> welcomed <unk> sheltered at point of entry screened at point of entry <unk> and the moved by plane to different european countries this would not have scared people <unk> we have a lot of people scared just because europe was not able to do the job properly bg but there are villages in germany with three hundred inhabitants and one thousand refugees <unk> so what 's your position how do you imagine these people reacting ag if there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over europe  you would always have the percentage that i mentioned one per <unk> it is because things are not properly managed that in the end we have situations that are totally <unk> impossible to live with and of course if you have a village in lebanon there are many villages that have more syrians than lebanese lebanon has been living with that i 'm not asking for the same to happen in europe for all european villages to have more refugees than <unk> inhabitants <unk> what i am asking is for europe to do the job properly <unk> and to be able to organize itself to receive people as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past bg so if you look at the global situation not only at europe bg yes bg  if you look at the global situation so not only at europe i know you can make a long list of countries that are not really stepping up but i 'm more interested in the other part is there somebody who 's doing well eighty six percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world and if you look at countries like ethiopia ethiopia has received more than six hundred thousand refugees all the borders in ethiopia are open <unk> and they have as a policy <unk> they call the people to people policy that every refugee should be received <unk> and they have south sudanese <unk> they have sudanese they have somalis all the neighbors <unk> they have eritreans and in general <unk> african countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming  and i would say that in the middle east and in in asia we have seen a tendency for borders to be open <unk> now we see some problems with the syrian situation as the syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis <unk> but the truth is that for a large period all borders in the middle east were open  the truth is that for afghans the borders of pakistan and iran were open for at the time six million afghans that came <unk> so i would say that even today the trend in the developing world <unk> <unk> has been for borders to be open <unk> the trend in the developed world is <unk> opinion <unk> a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side and security questions in my opinion misinterpreted on the other side bg we 'll come back to that too but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers from the world food programme that reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these these issues <unk> now that the world seems to have woken up are you getting more funding and more support or it 's still the same ag we are getting more support i would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year <unk> we were much worse during the summer <unk> but that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people and here we have <unk> the priorities of development cooperation that is required for instance lebanon and jordan are middle income countries because they are middle income countries they cannot receive soft loans or grants from the world bank <unk> now today this doesn 't make any sense <unk> because they are providing a global public good they have millions of refugees there and to be honest <unk> they <unk> <unk> are pillars of stability in the region with all the difficulties they face and the first line of defense of our collective security <unk> so it doesn 't make sense that these countries are not a first priority in development cooperation policies <unk> and they are not  and not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries <unk> but the local communities themselves are suffering because salaries went down because there are more unemployed because prices <unk> if you look at today 's situation of the indicators in these countries it is clear that <unk> their poor groups of the population are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing bg who should be providing this support country by country international organizations the european union who should be coming up with this support <unk> to join all efforts it 's clear that bilateral cooperation is essential <unk> it 's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential it 's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest <unk> more massively in support to these countries <unk> we need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today in protracted situations at a certain moment that it doesn 't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid <unk> you are talking about children in school you are talking about health <unk> you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded you are talking about things that require a long term perspective a <unk> <unk> development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective bg i would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning <unk> for the republican nomination for us president donald trump <unk>  yesterday he said this no listen to this it 's interesting i quote  i am calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the us <unk> until our country 's representatives can figure out what 's going on  how do you react to that ag well it 's not only donald trump several people around the world with political responsibility saying for instance that muslims refugees should not <unk> received and the reason why they say this is because they think that by doing or saying this they are protecting the security of their countries <unk>  now i 've been in government <unk> i am very keen on the need for governments to protect the security of their countries and their people <unk> but <unk> if you say  like that in the us or in any european country we are going to close our doors to muslim refugees  what you are saying is the best possible help for the propaganda of terrorist organizations  because what you are saying what you are saying will be heard by all the muslims in your own country and it will pave the way for the <unk> and the mechanisms that through technology <unk> and all those other groups are today penetrating in our societies <unk> and it 's just telling them you are right we are against you so obviously <unk>  this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic multi religious multicultural this is creating a situation in which really <unk> is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective <unk> in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed bg have the recent attacks in paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult <unk> reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is close all borders not understanding that the terrorist problem in europe is largely homegrown <unk>  we have thousands and thousands of european fighters in syria and in iraq <unk> so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians to come in and i must say <unk> i am convinced <unk> it was on purpose because part of the strategies of daesh is against refugees because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders <unk> and i think that is part of daesh 's strategy to make europe react  closing its doors to muslim refugees and having an hostility towards muslims inside europe exactly to facilitate daesh 's work  and my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism i think as i said essentially terrorism in europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong by welcoming <unk> integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world <unk> and another thing that i believe is that to a large extent <unk> what we are today paying for in europe is the failures of integration models that didn 't work in the ' 60s in the ' 70s in the ' 80s in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time and generated what is today in many of the people for instance of the second generation of communities <unk> situation of feeling marginalized <unk> having no jobs <unk> having improper education living in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided by public infrastructure and this kind of uneasiness <unk> sometimes even anger that exists in this second generation is largely due to the failure of integration policies <unk> the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other for me it is clear but i also recognize that for that to work properly <unk> you need a huge investment in the social cohesion of your own societies and europe to a large extent <unk> failed in that investment <unk> in the past few decades bg question you are stepping down from your job at the end of the year <unk> after ten years if you look back at two thousand and five when you entered that office for the first time what do you see ag well look <unk> in two thousand and five we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity <unk> because conflicts had ended last year <unk> we helped one hundred and twenty four thousand  in two thousand and five we had about <unk> million people displaced by conflict in the world today we have more than sixty million  at that time we had had <unk> recently <unk> some conflicts that were solved <unk>  now we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died <unk> afghanistan somalia democratic republic of congo <unk>  it is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was  it is clear that the capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them is <unk> is <unk> unfortunately much worse than what it was ten years ago there are no clear power relations in the world  no global governance mechanisms that work <unk> which means that we live in a situation where impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail <unk> and that means that more and more people suffer <unk> namely those <unk> a tradition in american politics that when a president leaves the oval office for the last time he leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor that walks in a couple of hours later <unk> if you had to write such a note to your successor filippo grandi what would you write ag well i don 't think i would write any message you know one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver <unk> new one what to do so that i will not do <unk> if i had to say something to him
