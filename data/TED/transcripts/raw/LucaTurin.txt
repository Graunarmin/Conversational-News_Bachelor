 <unk> the fragrance that you will smell you will never be able to smell this way again its a fragrance called beyond paradise which you can find in any store in the nation except here its been split up in parts by este lauder and by the perfumer who did it <unk> calice becker <unk> and i 'm most grateful to them for this <unk> and its been split up in successive bits and a chord so what youre smelling now is the top note <unk> and then will come what they call the heart <unk> the lush heart note i will show it to you  the eden top note is named after the eden project in the <unk> <unk> u k  the lush heart note <unk> melaleuca bark note which does not contain any melaleuca bark because its totally forbidden and <unk> that the complete fragrance now what you are smelling is a combination of i asked how many molecules there were in there and nobody would tell me so i put it through a <unk> g c a gas chromatograph that i have in my in my office <unk> and its about four hundred  so what youre smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air hitting your nose and do not <unk> get the impression that this is very subjective you are all smelling pretty much the same thing ok smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person its not really true and perfumery shows you that cant be true <unk> because if it were like that it wouldnt be an art <unk> ok <unk> now <unk> while the smell wafts <unk> let me tell you the history of an idea everything that youre smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood  you really dont want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts and it didnt really work these are the five atoms from which just about everything that youre going to smell in real life from coffee to <unk> fragrance are made of the top note that you smelled at the very beginning the cut grass green what we call in perfumery theyre weird terms and this would be called a green note because it smells of something green like cut grass this is and i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years a very expensive high school chemistry education <unk> this has six carbon atoms so hexa hexene 1 ol it has one double bond it has an alcohol on the end so its ol and thats why they call it cis 3 hexene 1 ol once you figure this out you can really impress people at parties this smells of cut grass <unk>  now this is the skeleton of the molecule if you dress it up with atoms hydrogen atoms thats what it looks like when you have it on your computer but actually its sort of more like this in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate they repel <unk> ok <unk> now <unk> why does this thing smell of cut grass <unk> ok <unk> why doesnt it smell of potatoes or violets well there are really two theories but the first theory is it must be the shape  and thats a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology <unk> works by shape <unk> enzymes that chew things up antibodies its all you know the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing in this case a smell <unk> and i will try and explain to you whats wrong with this notion and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations <unk> now this is a totally insane idea and when i first came <unk> across it in the early ' 90s i thought my predecessor malcolm dyson and bob wright had really taken leave of their senses and ill explain to you why this was the case <unk>  however i came to realize gradually that they may be right and i have to convince all my colleagues that this is so but im working on it <unk> heres how shape works in in normal receptors  you have a molecule coming in it gets into the protein which is schematic here and it causes this thing to switch to turn to <unk> move in some way by binding in certain parts <unk> and the attraction the forces between the molecule and the protein cause the motion this is a shape based idea <unk>  now <unk> whats wrong with shape is summarized in this slide the way i expect everybody to memorize these compounds <unk> one page of work from a chemists workbook ok <unk> working for a fragrance company  hes making forty five molecules and hes looking for a sandalwood something that smells of sandalwood because theres a lot of money in sandalwoods and of these forty five molecules only four thousand six hundred and twenty nine actually smells of sandalwood and he puts an exclamation mark ok <unk> this is an awful lot of work this actually two hundred thousand dollars roughly if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits <unk> so this is a profoundly inefficient process and my definition of a theory is its not just something that you teach people its labor saving a theory is something that enables you to do less work i love the idea of doing less work <unk> so let me explain to you why a very simple fact that tells you <unk> and this smells of rotten eggs <unk> ok <unk> now <unk> you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs if it does you put the glass down you go to a different bar <unk> this is <unk> at no concentration even pure you know <unk> if you smelt pure ethanol it doesnt smell of rotten eggs <unk> conversely there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka  its very hard to explain this by molecular recognition now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology and he says thats easy the things are a different color <unk> color  we have to go a little beyond that now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it <unk> these molecules as you saw in the beginning the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other in fact molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them so this is the sound of the o h stretch translated into the audible range  s h quite a different frequency now this is kind of interesting because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact which is this <unk> nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except <unk> that frequency except s h if you look on this  imagine a piano keyboard the s h stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been so to speak damaged <unk> and there are no neighboring notes nothing is close to it you have a unique smell a unique vibration <unk>  so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story i went searching for a type of molecule any molecule that would have that vibration and that the obvious prediction was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur if it didnt the whole idea was toast <unk> and i might as well move on to other things <unk>  now <unk> after searching high and low for several months <unk> i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration <unk> now the good news is boranes you can get hold of the bad news is theyre rocket fuels most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air <unk> and when you call up the companies they only give you minimum ten tons <unk> ok  so this was not what they call a laboratory scale experiment <unk> and they wouldnt have liked it at my <unk> and it really does have the same if you calculate if you measure the vibrational frequencies they are the same as as <unk> s h now does it smell of sulfur  well <unk> if you go back in the literature theres a man who knew more about boranes than anyone alive then or since alfred stock he synthesized all of them  and in an enormous paper in german he says  at one point my wife is german and she translated it for me and at one point he says ganz widerlich geruch an absolutely repulsive smell which is good <unk> reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide so this fact that boranes smell of sulfur had been known since <unk> fly in the ointment is this that if we smell molecular vibrations <unk> we must have a spectroscope in our nose <unk>  now this is a spectroscope <unk> ok <unk>  on my laboratory bench <unk> and its fair to say that if you look up somebodys nose youre unlikely to see anything resembling this and this is the main objection to the theory ok great we smell vibrations how when people ask this kind of question they neglect something which is that physicists are really clever <unk> unlike biologists <unk> this is a joke im a biologist ok so its a joke against myself bob jacklovich and john lamb at ford motor company in the days when ford motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research discovered a a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically <unk> nano scale in other words no mirrors no lasers no prisms no nonsense just a tiny device and he built this device <unk> and this device uses electron tunneling <unk>  now <unk> i could do the the dance of electron tunneling but ive done a video instead which is much more interesting heres how it works electrons are fuzzy creatures <unk> and they can jump across <unk> but only at equal energy if the energy differs they cant jump <unk> unlike us they wont fall off the cliff <unk> ok <unk>  now <unk>  if something absorbs the energy the electron can travel so here you have a system you have something and theres plenty of that stuff in biology some substance giving an electron  and the electron tries to jump and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen ok <unk> is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built and every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology  in other words ive taken off the shelf components and ive made a spectroscope whats nice about this idea <unk> <unk> if you have a philosophical bent of mind is that then it tells you that the nose <unk> and then a magnificent thing happened i left academia and joined the real world of business and a company was created around my ideas to make new molecules <unk> using my method along the lines of lets put someone elses money where your mouth is and one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking for what they needed because of course <unk> if you could calculate smell you dont need chemists you need a computer a mac will do it if you know how to <unk> you can try a thousand molecules you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend <unk> and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one <unk> and so thats a direct path to making new odorants and one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in france and heres where i do my charles fleischer impression and one of them says  you cannot make a coumarin he says to me i bet you cannot make a coumarin now coumarin is a very common thing <unk> material in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from south america <unk> and it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical <unk>  ok <unk> its the molecule that has made mens fragrances smell the way they do since one thousand eight hundred and eighty one to be exact <unk>  and the problem is its a carcinogen so nobody likes particularly <unk> there are some reckless people but its not worth it <unk> ok <unk> so they asked us to make a new coumarin <unk>  and so we started doing calculations and the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin and you smooth it out so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord so to speak of coumarin is <unk> and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules <unk> unrelated that have the same vibrations <unk> and we actually in this case im sorry to say it happened it was serendipitous <unk> because i got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said look  ive just found this such a beautiful reaction that even if this compound doesnt smell of coumarin i want to do it its just such a nifty <unk> one step i mean chemists have weird weird minds one step ninety percent yield you know <unk> and you get this lovely crystalline compound let us try it and i said first of all let me do the calculation on that compound <unk> bottom right which is related to coumarin but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule  calculate the vibrations <unk> the purple spectrum is that new fellow <unk> the white one is the old one and the prediction is it should smell of coumarin <unk> they made it <unk> and it smelled exactly like coumarin <unk> and this is our new baby called tonkene <unk> you see when youre a scientist youre always selling ideas <unk> and people are very resistant to ideas and rightly so why should new ideas be <unk> when you put a little <unk> <unk> vial on the table in front of perfumers and it smells like coumarin and it isnt coumarin <unk> and youve found it in three weeks this focuses everybodys mind wonderfully  and people often ask me is your theory accepted and i said well by whom i mean most you know theres three attitudes <unk> youre right and i dont know why which is the most rational one at this point  youre right and i dont care how you do it in a sense you bring me the molecules you know and youre completely wrong and im sure youre completely wrong <unk> ok <unk> now <unk> were dealing with people who only want results and this is the commercial world and they tell us that even if we do it by astrology theyre happy <unk> were not actually doing it by astrology <unk> but for the last three years ive had what i consider to be the best job in the entire universe which is to put my hobby which is you know  fragrance and all the magnificent things plus a little bit of biophysics a small amount of <unk> self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works
