 <unk> i 've always had stage fright <unk> and not just a little bit it 's a big bit <unk> and it didn 't even matter until i was twenty seven that 's when i started writing songs and even then i only played them for myself just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable <unk> but after a couple of years just writing songs wasn 't enough i had all these stories and ideas and i wanted to share them with people but physiologically <unk>  i couldn 't do it i had this irrational fear but the more i wrote <unk> and the more i practiced the more i wanted to perform so on the week of my 30th birthday i decided i was going to go to this local open <unk> and put this fear behind me well when i got there it was packed there were like twenty people there  and they all looked angry <unk>  but i took a deep breath <unk> and i signed up to play <unk> and i felt pretty good <unk> pretty good  until about ten minutes before my turn when my whole body rebelled and this wave of anxiety just washed over me  now when you experience fear your sympathetic nervous system kicks in so you have a rush of your heart rate increases your breathing gets faster <unk> next your non essential systems start to shut down like digestion  so your mouth gets dry and blood is routed away from your extremities so your fingers don 't work anymore <unk>  your pupils dilate your muscles contract your spidey sense tingles basically your whole body <unk> that condition is not conducive to performing folk music  i mean <unk> your nervous system is an idiot really two hundred thousand years of human evolution <unk> and it still can 't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and twenty folksingers on a tuesday night open mic  i have never been more terrified <unk> then it was my turn <unk> and somehow i get myself onto the stage <unk> i start my song i open my mouth to sing the first line <unk>  and this completely horrible vibrato you know when your voice wavers comes streaming out and this is not the good kind of vibrato like an opera singer has this is my whole body just convulsing with fear i mean it 's a nightmare <unk> i 'm embarrassed the audience is clearly uncomfortable they 're focused on my discomfort it was so bad but that was my first real experience as a solo singer songwriter  and something good did happen i had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that i was hoping for and i wanted more but i knew i had to get past <unk> that night i promised myself i would go back every week until i wasn 't nervous anymore <unk> and i did i went back every single week <unk> and sure enough week after week  it didn 't get any better the same thing happened every week  laughter i couldn 't shake it and that 's when i had an epiphany <unk> and i remember it really well because i don 't have a lot of <unk> all i had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness that only seems authentic when i have stage fright and the more nervous i was the better the song would be  easy <unk>  so i started writing a song about having stage fright first  fessing up to the problem the physical manifestations how i would feel how the listener might feel <unk> and then accounting for things like my shaky voice and i knew i would be singing about a half octave higher than normal because i was nervous <unk> by having a song that explained what was happening to me <unk>  while it was happening that gave the audience permission to think about it they didn 't have to feel bad for me because i was nervous <unk> they could experience that with me <unk> and we were all one big happy nervous uncomfortable family  laughter by thinking about my audience by embracing and exploiting my problem i was able to take something that was blocking my progress and turn it into something <unk> that was essential for my success <unk> and having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance <unk> and then i could move on and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease <unk>  and eventually over time i didn 't have to play the stage fright song at all except for when i was really <unk> would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you <unk> was nervous
