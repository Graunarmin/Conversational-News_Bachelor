 <unk> i was born with bilateral retinoblastoma <unk> retinal <unk> right eye was removed at seven months of age <unk> i was thirteen months when they removed my left eye the first thing i did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care <unk> wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes the problem was getting caught <unk> it 's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself think for a moment about your own impressions of blindness think about your reactions when i first came onto the stage <unk>  or the prospect of your own blindness or a loved one going blind  the terror is incomprehensible to most of us because blindness is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness hapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown <unk> how poetic <unk> fortunately for me my parents were not poetic they were <unk> they understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind and the mind is adaptable they believed that i should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else in their own words i would move out which i did when i was eighteen i will pay taxes thanks and they knew the difference between love and fear fear immobilizes <unk> <unk> us in the face of challenge <unk> they knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge <unk> i was not raised with fear <unk>  now <unk> moving forward <unk> how do i manage today  the world is a much larger nursery <unk>  fortunately i have my trusty long cane <unk>  longer than the canes used by most blind people i call it my freedom staff  it will keep me <unk> undignified departure from the stage i do see that cliff edge <unk>  they warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage <unk> i don 't care to set a new precedent <unk> but beyond that many of you may have heard me clicking as i came <unk> those are flashes of sound that go out and reflect from surfaces all around me <unk> just like a bat 's sonar <unk> and return to me with patterns with pieces of information <unk>  much as light does for you and my brain <unk> thanks to my parents <unk> to form images in my visual cortex which we now call the imaging system from those patterns of information much as your brain does <unk>  i call this process flash sonar <unk> it is how i have learned to see through my blindness to navigate my journey through the dark unknowns of my own challenges <unk> which has earned me the moniker the remarkable batman now batman i will accept <unk> bats are cool <unk>  batman is cool <unk> but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable <unk> i have always regarded myself much like anyone else who <unk> navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges is that so remarkable <unk> i do not use my eyes <unk> i use my brain <unk>  now <unk> someone <unk> somewhere <unk> must think that 's remarkable or i wouldn 't be up here but let 's consider this for a moment <unk> who faces or who has ever faced a challenge <unk> raise your hands  whoosh okay <unk> lots of hands going up a moment let me do a head count  this will take a while okay  lots of hands in the air keep <unk> have an idea those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges <unk> put your hands down <unk>  okay anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own  so we all face challenges and we all face the <unk> which is endemic to most challenges which is what what most of us fear <unk> okay <unk> but we all have brains that allow us that activate to allow us to navigate the journey through these challenges <unk> wouldn 't tell me where the lectern was so you can 't trust those ted folks  find it yourself they said so  and the feedback for the p a system is no help at all so <unk> now i present to you a challenge <unk> so if you 'd all close your eyes for just a moment okay and you 're going to learn a bit of flash sonar <unk> i 'm going to make a sound  i 'm going to hold this panel in front of me but i 'm not going to move it just listen to the sound for a moment <unk> nothing very interesting now <unk> listen to what happens to that same exact sound when i move the panel <unk> you do not know the power of the dark side <unk> now keep your eyes closed because did you hear the difference <unk> okay <unk> now <unk> let 's be sure for your challenge <unk>  you tell me <unk> just say now when you hear the panel start to move okay we 'll relax into this <unk> open your eyes all right so just a few centimeters you would notice the difference you 've experienced sonar  you 'd all make great blind people  let 's have a look at what can happen when this activation <unk> see with your eyes and we can see with our ears brian bushway it 's not a matter of enjoying it more or less <unk> wouldn 't go back to being sighted jr the bigger the goal the more obstacles you 'll face and on the other side of that goal is victory <unk> these people look terrified not so much we have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly forty countries when <unk> blind people learn to see sighted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their way better more clearly with less fear  because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all to navigate any type of challenge through any form of darkness to discoveries unimagined when we are activated i wish you all a most activating journey <unk> spectacular standing ovation at ted thank you for an extraordinary talk <unk> just one more question about your world your inner world that you construct we think that we have things in our world <unk> you as a blind person don 't have but what 's your world like what do you have that we don 't have  dk three hundred and sixty degree view so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me <unk> it works around corners <unk> it works through surfaces  generally it 's kind of a fuzzy <unk> three dimensional geometry one of an instructor when he lost his vision <unk>  after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house conversations  people in the kitchen people in the bathroom <unk> several floors away several walls away he said it was something like having <unk> x ray vision ca  what do you picture that you 're <unk> a sound when they laugh when they fidget <unk> when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever <unk> i hear everything i hear every little movement that every single person makes none of it really escapes my attention <unk>  <unk> from a sonar perspective the size of the room the curvature of the audience around the stage <unk> it 's the height of the room  like i say it 's all that kind of three dimensional surface geometry all around me ca well daniel you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way
