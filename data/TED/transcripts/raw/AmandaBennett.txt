 <unk> like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in china the night i met my husband it was a city so long ago that it was <unk> so i went to a party <unk> i sat down next to a stout middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie <unk>  and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar there in china specifically to study <unk> sino soviet relations  what a gift it was to the eager young foreign correspondent that i was then i 'd pump him for information <unk> for the stories i plan to write i talk to him for hours <unk> only months later <unk> i discover who he really was <unk>  he was the china representative for the american soybean association  i don 't understand soybeans <unk> you told me you were a fulbright scholar <unk> you have talked to me if i told you we 're in soybeans <unk> we did  and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be  he was a chinese scholar who later <unk> a licensed pilot <unk> he had once been a san francisco cable car operator <unk> he was an expert in swine nutrition dairy cattle <unk> dixieland jazz <unk> film noir and we did travel the country <unk>  and the world  and we did have a lot of kids <unk> we followed my job and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn 't do <unk>  so when we found the cancer it doesn 't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other <unk> we believed that if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough and we worked hard enough <unk> we could keep him from <unk> and for years it seemed like we were succeeding <unk>  the surgeon emerged from the surgery what 'd he say he said what surgeons always say we got it all  then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely <unk> it turned out to be a rare exceedingly aggressive type with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in in several weeks at most <unk> and yet he did not die <unk> mysteriously <unk> he lived on  he coached little league for our son <unk>  he built a playhouse for our daughter <unk> and meanwhile i 'm burying myself in the internet looking for specialists <unk> i 'm looking for a cure  so a year goes by before the cancer as cancers do <unk> and with it comes another death sentence this time nine months <unk>  so we try another treatment aggressive <unk> nasty <unk> it makes him so sick he has to quit it yet still he lives on  then another year goes by two years go by more specialists we take the kids to italy <unk> we take the kids to australia  and then more years pass the cancer begins to grow  this time there 's new treatments on the horizon <unk> they 're exotic they 're experimental  they 're going to attack the cancer in new ways <unk> so he enters a clinical trial <unk>  and it works the cancer begins to shrink <unk> and for the third time  we 've dodged <unk> now i ask you how do i feel when the time finally comes and there 's another dark night <unk> sometime between midnight and two a m this time it 's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that i 've never met before tells me that terence is dying <unk> perhaps tonight <unk> so what do i say when he says <unk> what do you want me to do  there 's another drug out there it 's newer it 's more powerful he started it just two weeks ago <unk>  perhaps there 's still hope ahead <unk>  so what do i say i say keep him alive if you can  and terence died six days later <unk>  so we fought we struggled we triumphed it was an exhilarating fight and i 'd repeat the fight today without a moment 's hesitation  we fought together <unk> we lived together <unk> it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious it was also an expensive fight <unk> was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end of life care and of healthcare for all of us <unk> and for me for us <unk> we pushed the fight right over the edge and i never got the chance to say to him what i say to him now almost every day hey buddy it was a hell of a ride we never got the chance to <unk> we never thought it was the end <unk> we always had hope <unk>  so what do we make of all of this being a journalist <unk>  after terence died <unk> i wrote a book the cost of hope i wrote it because i wanted to know why i did what i did <unk>  why he did what he did <unk>  <unk> why everyone around us did what they did and what did i discover well one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to what i did at the end was a piece of paper <unk> the advance directive  to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices yet i had that piece of paper <unk>  we both did <unk> and they were readily available i had them right at hand <unk> both of them said the same thing <unk> do nothing if there is no further hope  i knew terence 's wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own  yet we never got to no further hope even with that clear cut paper in our hands <unk> we just kept redefining <unk> i could keep him from dying <unk>  and i 'd be embarrassed to say that if i hadn 't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way right up until days before his death <unk>  i felt strongly and powerfully and you might say <unk> could keep him from dying ever  now what do the experts call this  they say it 's denial it 's a strong word isn 't it  yet i will tell you that denial isn 't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through and i hear the medical professionals <unk> say well we 'd like to do such and such but the family 's in denial <unk>  the family won 't listen to reason they 're in denial <unk>  how can they insist on this treatment at the end it 's so clear yet they 're in denial now i think this maybe isn 't a very useful way of thinking it 's not just families either the medical professionals too <unk> you out there you 're in denial too <unk>  you want to help you want to fix <unk> you want to do  you 've succeeded in everything you 've done <unk> and having a patient die <unk>  well that must feel like failure <unk>  i saw it firsthand just days before terence died <unk> tell terence that better days are just ahead days before he died <unk> yet ira byock the director of palliative medicine at dartmouth said you know <unk> the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal  so what the experts call denial i call <unk> and i 'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design <unk> you just redefine denial and hope <unk> and it becomes a feature of being human <unk> it 's not a bug <unk>  it 's a feature  laughter so we need to think more constructively about <unk> it 's part of the human condition and yet our system and our thinking isn 't built to accommodate it  so terence told me a story on that long ago night and i believed it maybe i wanted to believe it  and during terence 's <unk> to believe the story of our fight together too <unk> giving up the fight for that 's how it felt it felt like giving up meant giving up not only his life but also our story our story of us as fighters <unk> the story of us as invincible <unk>  and for the doctors the story of themselves as healers <unk> so what do we need  maybe we don 't need a new piece of paper <unk> maybe we need a new story  not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness  but rather a story of victory and triumph  of a valiant battle <unk> a graceful retreat a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal <unk>  and that no wife no matter how hard she tried has ever <unk> and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go  people did mention hospice but i wouldn 't listen  hospice was for people who were dying and terence wasn 't dying as a result he spent just four days in hospice which i 'm sure as you all know is a pretty typical outcome and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end <unk> we have a noble path to curing the disease <unk> patients and doctors alike <unk>  but there doesn 't seem to be a noble path to dying  dying is seen as failing <unk> and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together <unk> heroic narrative for letting go so maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end and for saying goodbye <unk>  and maybe our new story will be about a hero 's fight and a hero 's goodbye terence loved <unk> is one of my favorite poets <unk> so i 'll give you a couple lines from him this is a poem about mark antony <unk> you know mark antony the conquering hero cleopatra 's guy <unk> actually one of cleopatra 's guys <unk> and he 's been a pretty good general he 's won all the fights he 's eluded all the people that are out to get him <unk>  <unk> yet this time finally he 's come to the city of alexandria and realized he 's lost the people are leaving they 're playing instruments they 're singing <unk> and suddenly he knows he 's been defeated <unk>  and he suddenly knows he 's been deserted by the gods <unk> and it 's time to let go and the poet tells him what to do <unk> he tells him how to say a noble goodbye a goodbye that 's fit for <unk> becomes you who were worthy of such a city approach the window with a firm step <unk> and with emotion <unk>  but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward as a last enjoyment listen to the sounds <unk> exquisite instruments of the musical troops and bid her farewell the alexandria you are losing  that 's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life  a goodbye for a man for whom anything <unk>  well <unk> almost anything was possible  a goodbye for a man who kept <unk> and isn 't that what we 're missing how can we learn that people 's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly powerfully many times irrationally on the slimmest of hopes <unk>  the overwhelming presence of hope isn 't denial <unk> it 's part of our dna as humans <unk> and maybe it 's time our healthcare system doctors started accounting for the power of that hope hope isn 't a bug <unk> it 's a feature
