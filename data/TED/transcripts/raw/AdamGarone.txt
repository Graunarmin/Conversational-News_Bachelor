 <unk> i think the beautiful malin [ akerman ] put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury <unk>  ladies and gentlemen and more importantly mo bros and mo sistas for seventeen minutes i 'm going to share with you my movember journey <unk>  and how through that journey <unk> we 've redefined charity <unk>  we 're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world  and i hope <unk> through that process  that i inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place <unk> the most common question i get asked and i 'm going to answer it now so i don 't have to do it over drinks tonight <unk> is how did this come about how did movember <unk> <unk> normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause <unk> they then go on to create an event <unk> and beyond that a foundation to support <unk> pretty much in every case that 's how a charity starts  not so with movember  movember started in a very traditional australian way it was on a sunday afternoon i was with my brother and a mate having a few beers <unk> and i was watching the world go by had a few more beers and the conversation turned to ' 70s fashion  and how everything manages to come back into style <unk> and a few more beers i said there has to be some stuff that hasn 't come back <unk> back  then one more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache <unk> why hasn 't that made a comeback  so then there was a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back  so in australia mo <unk> is slang for mustache <unk> so we renamed the month of november movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today <unk> and they are start the month <unk> rock a mustache not a beard not a goatee a mustache for the thirty days of november <unk> and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache themed party  and award a prize for the best and of course the worst <unk> now trust me when you 're growing a mustache back in two thousand and three and there were thirty of us back then and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement it created a lot of controversy  so my boss wouldn 't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who 's no longer my girlfriend  hated it parents would <unk> shuffle kids away from us  but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey <unk> and we had a lot of fun and in two thousand and four i said to the guys that was so much fun <unk> we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer and we thought you know what there 's nothing for men 's health <unk>  why is that <unk> <unk> why can 't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men 's health and i started to research that topic <unk> and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed <unk> but there was nothing for this cause <unk> so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer  and then we created our tagline <unk> which is changing the face of men 's health and that eloquently describes the challenge changing your appearance for the thirty days and also the outcome that <unk> <unk> we 're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health <unk> having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face  <unk> the ceo of the prostate cancer foundation i said to him i 've got the most amazing idea that 's going to transform your organization  laughter and i didn 't want to share with him the idea over the phone so i convinced him to meet with me for coffee in melbourne in two thousand and four <unk>  and we sat down and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia raising awareness for this cause <unk>  and funds for his organization and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that i said we 're going to come together at the end we 're going to have a mustache themed party we 're going to have djs <unk> we 're going to celebrate life <unk> and we 're going to change the face of men 's health  and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said adam that 's a really novel idea <unk>  but we 're an ultraconservative organization <unk> we can 't have anything to do with you  so i paid for coffee that day and his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we 'll gladly take it  so my lesson that year was persistence <unk> and we persisted <unk> and we got four hundred and fifty <unk> and we donated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they 'd ever received <unk>  so from that day forward <unk> my life has become about a mustache <unk> every day this morning i wake up and go my life is about a mustache <unk> so in two thousand and five the campaign got more momentum was more successful in australia and then new zealand <unk>  and then in two thousand and six we came to a pivotal point it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level  it 's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches  let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in <unk> not even the prostate cancer foundation <unk> who we 'd raised about one point two million dollars for at that stage  so again we persisted <unk> and foster 's brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job i did consulting on the side <unk> and leading into movember two thousand and six we 'd run through all <unk> run through all the money i had and essentially we had no money left <unk> and we 'd convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies <unk> whatnot to delay their billing until december  so we 'd racked up at this stage about six hundred thousand dollars worth of debt <unk> so if movember two thousand and six didn 't happen the four founders <unk> well <unk> we would 've been broke <unk> we would 've been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches <unk> you know what if that 's the worst thing that happens <unk> so what we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks  then in early two thousand and seven a really interesting thing happened  we had mo bros from from canada from the u s and from the u k emailing us and calling us and saying hey there 's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries <unk>  so we thought why not let 's do it <unk>  so i cold called the ceo of prostate cancer canada <unk> and i said to him i have this most amazing concept it 's going to transform your organization  i don 't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to toronto so i flew here met down on front street east <unk> and we sat in the boardroom <unk> and i said <unk> vision of getting men growing mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization  and he looked at me and laughed and said adam <unk> sounds like a really novel idea but we 're an ultraconservative organization  i 've heard this before i know how it goes <unk>  but he said we will partner with you <unk> but we 're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country the u s and the u k and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely <unk> <unk> more money globally than we could just in australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure and we 're not about finding an australian cure or a canadian <unk> about finding the cure <unk>  so in two thousand and seven <unk> we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage for the campaign it wasn 't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia and new zealand at that stage <unk> so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets <unk> but what i 'm really pleased to say is in two thousand and ten movember became a truly global movement canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world <unk>  last year we had four hundred and fifty thousand mo bros spread across the world and together we raised <unk> and that makes movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world <unk>  and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches  laughter and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon  our ambassadors are the mo bros and <unk> the mo sistas and i think that 's been fundamental to our success <unk>  we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way <unk>  so now i live in in los angeles because the prostate cancer foundation of the u s is based there <unk> and i always get asked by the media down there because <unk> single person every single mo bro and mo sista that participates in movember is our celebrity ambassador <unk> and that is so so important and fundamental to our success  now what i want <unk> share with you is one of my most touching movember moments <unk> and it happened here in toronto last year at the end of the campaign  i was out with a team it was the end of movember we 'd had a great campaign and to be honest we 'd had our fair share of beer that night <unk> but i said you know what i think we 've got one more bar left in us  so we piled into a <unk> i know it 's about men 's health i know it 's about prostate cancer <unk> but this is for breast cancer and i said  <unk> last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka <unk> because we couldn 't afford proper treatment for her and he said  this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi <unk>  and i didn 't tell him who i was because i didn 't think it was appropriate and i just shook his hand and i said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache <unk> having a joke  it 's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way <unk> and being significant in their own life  for us now at movember <unk>  we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact <unk>  awareness and education <unk>  survivor support programs and research <unk> now we always focus naturally on how much we raise because it 's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because i know that is changing and saving lives today and it 's probably best exampled by a young guy that i met at south by southwest in austin texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember <unk> but i went home for thanksgiving dinner <unk> and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on  and we talked i talked to them about movember <unk> and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of <unk> for the first time ever i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men 's health <unk> i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn 't know that <unk> and he hadn 't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate <unk> so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise  now to the funds we raise <unk> and research and how we 're redefining research  we fund prostate cancer foundations now in thirteen countries <unk>  we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there 's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions let alone nationally let alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is cancer research the world over  and so we said right we 'd redefined charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that <unk>  <unk> so what we did was we created a global action plan and we 're taking ten percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund and we 've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund <unk>  and they come together each year and identify the number one priority <unk>  and that <unk> last year was getting a better screening test <unk> so they identified that as a priority and then they 've got and recruited now three hundred researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially <unk> same topic <unk> so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together <unk> and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes <unk>  and that 's how we 're redefining the research world <unk> <unk> what i know about my movember journey is that with a really creative idea  with passion with persistence <unk> and a lot of patience  four mates four mustaches can inspire a room full of people <unk> and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city <unk> and that city is melbourne my <unk> and that city can go on and inspire a state <unk> and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men 's health
