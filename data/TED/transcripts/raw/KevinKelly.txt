 <unk> i don 't know about you but i haven 't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life <unk> i 've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about should i be <unk> be wary like you i 'm very tempted by the latest thing but at the other hand a couple of years ago i gave up all of my possessions sold all my technology except for a bicycle and rode across three thousand miles on the u s back roads under the power of my one body fuelled mostly by twinkies and junk food <unk> i 've since then tried to keep technology at arm 's length in many ways so it doesn 't master my life  at the same time <unk> i run a website on cool tools where i issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology so i 'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity as it relates to nature as it relates to the spiritual and i 'm not even sure we <unk> we know what technology is <unk> and one definition of technology is that which is first recorded this is the first example of the modern use of technology that i can find it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in <unk> exist but obviously it did i like one of the definitions that alan kay has for technology <unk> he says technology is anything that was invented after you were born  so it sums up a lot of what we 're talking about danny hillis actually has an update on that he says technology is anything that doesn 't quite work yet <unk> think gets into a little bit of of our current idea <unk> but i was interested in another definition of technology <unk> something again that went back to something more fundamental something that was deeper and as i struggled to to understand that i came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to to work <unk> this morning going to talk about this for the first time so this is a very rough attempt to to think out loud the question that i came up with was this question <unk> what does technology want <unk> and by that i don 't mean does it want chocolate or vanilla  by what it wants i mean <unk> what are its inherent trends and biases what are its tendencies <unk> one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms which we 've heard a lot about <unk> and the trick that richard dawkins does which is to say to look at them as simply as genes as vehicles for genes so he 's saying what do genes want the selfish gene <unk>  <unk> and i 'm applying a similar trick to say <unk> what if we looked at the universe in our culture <unk> what does technology want  obviously this in an incomplete question just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it but it 's still very very productive <unk>  so i 'm attempting to say if we take technology 's view of the world <unk>  what does it want <unk>  and i think once we ask that question we have to go back actually to life <unk> because obviously if we <unk> extending the origins of technology far back i think we come back to life at some point so that 's where i want to begin my little exploration is in life <unk> and like you heard from the previous speakers <unk>  we don 't really know what life there is on earth right now <unk> we have really no idea craig venter 's tremendous and brilliant attempt to to dna sequence things in the ocean is great brian farrell 's work is all part <unk> this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth and one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the all the places that the grid intersects just to see what 's on life and if we did that with our little martian probe which we have not done on earth <unk> we would begin to see some incredible species this is not on another planet <unk> these are things that are hidden away on our planet <unk> this is an ant <unk> honey in its abdomen each one of these organisms that we 've described that you 've seen from jamie and others these magnificent things what they 're doing  each one of them is they 're hacking the rules of life <unk> i can 't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism every single thing that we can think of <unk> and if you heard olivia 's talk about the sexual habits <unk> you 'll realize that <unk> isn 't anything we can say that 's true for all life <unk> because every single one of them is hacking something about it this is a <unk> sea slug it 's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy <unk>  this is another version of that this is a sea dragon <unk> and the one on the bottom the blue one is a juvenile that has not yet <unk> swallowed the acid has not yet taken in the <unk> brown green algae pond scum into its body to to give it energy these are hacks <unk> and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are  current consensus six kingdoms <unk> six different broad approaches the plants the animals the fungi <unk> the protests the little things <unk> bacteria and the archaea bacteria the archaeas  those are the general approaches to life <unk>  that 's one way to look at life on earth today but a more interesting way the current way to take the long view is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective and here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time we <unk> it coming out from the center <unk> so in the center is the most primitive <unk> and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth <unk> this is all the same six kingdoms you see four thousand representative <unk> species and you can see where we are but what i like about this is it shows that every living organism on earth today <unk> fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans they 've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of of trial and error to get here <unk>  but we see that each one of these is actually hacking and has a different way of finding out how to do life and if we take the <unk> long term trends of life if we begin to say <unk> <unk> what does evolution want <unk>  there 's several things that we see one of the things about <unk> have we ever been where we don 't find life <unk> we find life at the bottom of every <unk> <unk> drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up and there 's bacteria in the pores of that rock  and wherever life is it never retreats <unk> it 's ubiquitous and it wants to be more more and more of the inert matter of the of the globe is being touched and animated by life <unk> the second thing is is we see diversity <unk> we also see specialization we see the movement from a general purpose cell to the more specific and specialized and we see a drift towards complexity that 's very intuitive and actually we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over <unk> and the last thing i bring back this nudibranch one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability and by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life <unk> like those chloroplast cells they 're completely surrounded by other life they never touch the inner matter there is more and more <unk> complexity and socialization now <unk> i took that and said ok <unk> what are the <unk> long term trends in technology and again my question is what does technology want and so remarkably <unk> i discovered that there 's also a drift toward specialization  <unk> we see there 's a general hammer and hammers become more and more specific over time <unk> there 's obviously diversity huge numbers of things <unk> this is all the contents of a japanese home i actually had my daughter gave her a tally counter and i gave her an assignment last <unk> <unk> summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household <unk> and it came up with six thousand different species of products <unk> i did some research and found out that the king of england <unk> henry viii had only about seven thousand items in his household and he was the king of england <unk> and that was the entire wealth of england at the time <unk> so we 're seeing huge numbers of of diversity in the kinds of things  this is a scene from star wars where the 3po comes out and he sees machines making machines how depraved <unk> well <unk> this is actually what we 're headed towards world machines <unk> is only being thrown out by other technologies most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not not non technology or even life <unk>  and thirdly the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche and i 'm happy to say i was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological but that 's pretty evident so the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution <unk> the same drives that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization <unk> towards complexity that is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out say the evolution of of armor <unk> you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary type cladistic tree <unk>  i suggest that in fact technology is the seventh kingdom of life <unk> that its operations and how it <unk> works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom <unk>  and so it would be sort of approximately up there coming out of the animal kingdom <unk>  and if we were to do that we would find out we could actually approach technology in this way <unk> this is niles eldredge  <unk> with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium <unk> but as a sideline he happens to collect cornets he has one of the world 's largest collections about five hundred of them and he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites or snails and to do a morphological analysis <unk> and try to derive their genealogical history over time <unk> this is his chart which is not quite published yet but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom those <unk> indicate basically a parentage of of a type of of cornet that was no longer made  that does not happen in biology  when something is extinct you can 't have it as your parent <unk> but that does happen in technology and it turns out that that 's so distinctive that you can actually look at <unk> this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system in fact this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about what happens with old technology and it turns out that in fact <unk>  technologies don 't die <unk> so i suggested this to an historian of science and he said well what about you know come on what about steam <unk> so around that you can buy new parts for a stanley steam automobile <unk>  and this is a website of a guy who 's selling brand new parts for the stanley automobile <unk> and the thing that <unk> think about well maybe that 's just a random sample maybe i should do this sort of in a more conservative way so i took the great big one thousand eight hundred and ninety five montgomery ward 's catalog <unk> and i randomly went through it and i took a page not quite a random page i took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made <unk> but i took this page <unk> things are still being made and not antiques <unk> i want to know how many of these things are still in production <unk> and the answer is all of them  all of them are still being produced  so you 've got corn shellers i don 't know who needs a corn sheller be it corn shellers you 've <unk> you 've got fan mills all these things and these are not again antiques these are you can order these you can go to the web and you can buy them now brand new made <unk> so in a certain sense <unk>  technologies don 't die in fact <unk> you can buy for fifty bucks <unk> a stone age knife made exactly the same way that they were made ten thousand <unk> what 's important is that this information actually never died out it 's not just that it was resurrected it 's continued all along and in papua new guinea they were making stone axes until two decades ago just as a course of of practical matters even when we try to get rid of a technology it 's actually very hard <unk> so we 've all heard about the <unk> amish giving up cars we 've heard about the japanese giving up guns we 've heard about this and that <unk> but i actually went back and took what i could find <unk> the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology <unk>  and then i tried to find out when they came back in because they always came back in and it turns out that the time <unk> the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited is decreasing over time <unk> <unk> and that basically you can delay technology <unk> but you can 't kill it <unk> so this makes sense because in a certain sense what culture is  is the accumulation of ideas <unk> that 's what it 's for it 's so that ideas don 't die out and when we take that  we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long term trajectory again in life 's evolution we find that each case each of the major transitions in life what they 're really about is accelerating and changing the way <unk> which evolution happens  they 're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated <unk>  so all these steps in evolution are increasing basically the evolution of evolvability so what 's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas these new hacks  are increasing <unk> and the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring <unk>  and then what we see in the singularity that prophesized by kurzweil and others his idea that technology is accelerating evolution it 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas <unk> so if you have life hacking life means hacking  the game of survival then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game and what technology is really about is better ways to evolve <unk>  that is what we call an that 's the definition of infinite game a finite game is play to win and an infinite game is played to keep playing  and i believe that technology is actually a cosmic force the origins of technology was not in one thousand eight hundred and twenty nine but was actually at the beginning of the big bang and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed the entire universe was compressed into a <unk> quantum dot <unk> and it was so tight in there there was no room for any difference at all that 's the definition there was no temperature there was no difference whatsoever <unk> and at the big bang what it expanded was the potential for difference  so as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences diversity <unk> options <unk> possibilities and freedoms those are all basically the same thing <unk> and those are the things that technology brings us <unk>  that 's what technology is bringing us <unk> choices <unk> possibilities <unk> freedoms <unk> that 's what it 's about it 's this expansion of room to make differences <unk> and so a hammer <unk> when we grab a hammer that 's what we 're grabbing and that 's why we continue to grab technology because we want those things those things <unk> each time we make a new opportunity place we 're allowing a platform to make new ones <unk> and i think it 's really important because if you can imagine mozart before the technology of the piano was invented what a loss to society there would be imagine van gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints <unk> imagine hitchcock <unk> there are millions of young children being born whose technology of of self expression has not yet been invented we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true <unk> difference we want a trillion zillion species of one individuals <unk> that 's what technology really <unk> 'm going to skip through some of the objections because i don 't have answers to why there 's deforestation i don 't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies i don 't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom because it 's so close to what life is about  maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life <unk> maybe in some ways the fact that that what we 're trying to do with <unk> technology is find a good home for it it 's a terrible thing to spray ddt on cotton fields but it 's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village  our humanity is actually defined by technology all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology <unk>  this is the infinite game <unk> that 's what we 're talking about you see <unk> technology is a way to evolve the evolution it 's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more and it 's actually a way of playing the game of playing all the games <unk>  that 's what technology wants <unk> and so when i think about what technology wants i think that it has to do with the fact that every person here and i really believe this every person here <unk> has an assignment and your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is  that recursive nature is the infinite game <unk> and if you play that well you 'll have other people involved so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone that <unk> is the infinite game and what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game <unk> and so i think that we should embrace
