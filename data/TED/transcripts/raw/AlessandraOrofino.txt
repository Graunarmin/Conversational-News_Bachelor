 <unk> of the world 's population lives in our cities <unk> in developing countries one third of that population is living in <unk> of global energy consumption occurs in our cities <unk> and eighty percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities <unk>  so things that you and i might think about as global problems <unk> like climate change the energy crisis or poverty <unk> are really in many ways city problems <unk>  they will not be solved unless people who live in cities <unk> like most of us  actually start doing a better job because right now <unk> we are not doing a very good one  and that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life  first our citizens ' willingness to engage with democratic institutions  second our cities ' ability to really include all of their residents <unk>  and lastly our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives  when it comes to engagement <unk> the data is very clear <unk>  voter turnout around the world peaked in the late ' 80s and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before  and if those numbers are bad at the national level at the level of our cities <unk> they are just dismal  in the last two years two of the world 's most consolidated <unk> nationwide municipal elections <unk>  in france <unk> voter turnout hit a record low <unk>  almost forty percent of voters decided not to show up  in the u s the numbers were even scarier in some american cities <unk> voter turnout was close to five percent <unk> in for a second we 're talking about democratic cities in which <unk> percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders  the city of l a a city of four million people elected its mayor with just a bit over two hundred thousand votes  that was the lowest turnout the city had seen in one hundred years right here <unk> in my city of rio <unk>  in spite of mandatory voting almost thirty percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home <unk> and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections <unk>  <unk> you don 't need to look very far in order to find proof of that the city of rio is incredibly unequal  this is leblon leblon is the city 's richest neighborhood <unk> and this is <unk> this is where over seventy thousand of the city 's poorest residents <unk> it sits somewhere in between the hdi of algeria and gabon <unk> so <unk> like so many cities across the global south  is a place where you can go from northern europe to sub saharan africa in the space of thirty minutes  if you drive that is if you take public transit it 's about two hours <unk>  and lastly <unk> perhaps most importantly  cities <unk> with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable could be the ideal places <unk> for human happiness to flourish we like being around people we are social animals <unk>  instead countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy <unk>  the united states population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the <unk> past three decades <unk> and the main reason is this the american way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many many american cities <unk>  and as a result <unk> they have seen a decline of relations  of the things that make us happy many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity <unk> honesty and social and civic participation so how do we start building cities that make us care  cities that value their most important asset <unk> the incredible diversity of the people who live in them cities that make <unk> us happy <unk>  well i believe that if we want to change what our cities look like  then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results that we have right now <unk>  we need a participation revolution <unk> and we need <unk> the idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore  people are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it 's time to delegate that power to someone else  if the protests that swept brazil in june two thousand and thirteen have taught us anything 's that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context <unk>  we are beaten up <unk> humiliated or arrested <unk>  and this needs to change because when it does not only <unk> with the structures of representation but also complement these structures with direct <unk>  effective and collective decision making  decision making of the kind that attacks inequality by its very inclusive nature <unk>  decision making of the kind that can change our cities into better places for us to live <unk>  but there is a catch <unk> obviously  enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare and there 's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role  by making it easier for people to organize communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time <unk>  unfortunately for <unk> us when it comes to fostering democratic processes our city governments have not used technology to its full potential <unk>  so far most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data <unk> fallen trees or broken lamps  they have also to a lesser extent <unk> invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them  just like my mom when i was eight and she told me that i had a choice i had to be in bed by eight p m but i could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas that 's not participation and in fact governments <unk> not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters the way we allocate our budget <unk>  the way we occupy our land <unk> and the way we manage our natural resources those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest <unk> the good news is and i do have good news to share with you we don 't need to wait for governments to do this i have reason to believe that it 's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation  three years ago i cofounded an organization called meu rio  and we make it easier for people in the city of rio to organize around <unk> causes and places that they care about in their own city and have an impact on those causes and places every day <unk>  in these past three years meu rio grew to a network of one hundred and sixty thousand citizens of rio  about forty percent of those members are young people aged twenty to <unk> is one in every fifteen young people of that age in rio today <unk>  amongst our members is this adorable little girl bia to your right <unk> and bia was just eleven years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition her school actually ranks among <unk> the best public schools in the country <unk>  and it was going to be demolished by the rio de janeiro state government to build i kid you not a parking lot for the world cup right before the event happened <unk>  bia started a campaign and we even watched her school twenty four seven through webcam monitoring <unk>  and many months afterwards <unk> the government changed their minds bia 's school stayed in place there 's also jovita  she 's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about ten years ago <unk>  and since then she has been looking for her daughter in that process she found out that first <unk> she was not alone  in the last year alone two thousand and thirteen <unk> <unk> six thousand people disappeared in the state of rio <unk>  but she also found out that in spite of that rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases <unk>  in other brazilian cities <unk> those systems have helped solve up to eighty percent of missing persons cases <unk> she started a campaign <unk> and after the secretary of security got sixteen thousand emails from people asking him to do this  and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases it was open to the public at the end of last month <unk> and jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy <unk>  and then <unk> there is leandro leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in rio <unk> and he created a recycling project in the slum  at the end of last year december sixteen he received an eviction <unk> order by the rio de janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years <unk>  the plan was to hand it over to a developer who planned to turn it into a construction site  leandro started a campaign using one of our tools <unk> the pressure <unk> and the state government changed their minds before christmas eve  these stories make me happy <unk>  but not just because they have happy endings they make me happy because they are happy beginnings <unk>  the teacher and parent community at bia 's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further  leandro has <unk> ambitious plans to take his model to other low income communities in rio <unk> and jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created <unk>  bia <unk> jovita and leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city governments around the world need to know <unk> <unk> are ready to decide on our common destinies because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone <unk>  and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another <unk> and we are <unk> ready to do this in cities around the world right now <unk>  with the our cities network the meu rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities  we have already started doing it in so paulo with incredible results <unk> that can inspire us <unk>  challenge us <unk> and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives  it is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking <unk> recycling projects or construction sites <unk>  loneliness or solidarity cars or buses and it is our responsibility to do that now <unk>  for ourselves for our families for the people who make our lives worth living and for the incredible creativity <unk> <unk> beauty <unk> and wonder that make our cities <unk> in spite of all of their problems <unk> the greatest invention of our time
