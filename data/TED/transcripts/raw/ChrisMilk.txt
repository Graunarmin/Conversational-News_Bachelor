 <unk> virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place it was the <unk> i got into the field very young i was seven years old <unk> and <unk> this was my joy back then <unk> i rode this motorcycle everywhere <unk> and i was there with evel knievel we jumped the snake river canyon <unk> i wanted the rocket <unk> i never got the rocket i only got the motorcycle i felt so connected to this world i didn 't want to be a storyteller when i grew up i wanted to be stuntman <unk> i was there <unk> evel knievel was my friend <unk> i had so much empathy for him <unk>  but it didn 't work out i went to art school  <unk> beginning of a filmmaker <unk> and i started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker to try to tell the most compelling stories that i can to an audience  and film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely foreign from our own <unk>  unfortunately <unk> evel knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him <unk> and he sued us for this video <unk> the upside the man that i worshipped as a child the man that i wanted to become as an adult <unk> i was finally able to get his autograph  <unk> but essentially it 's the same now as it was then <unk> it 's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence <unk>  and we 've done incredible things with those rectangles <unk>  but i started thinking about is there a way that i can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe i couldn <unk> 't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we 've been using for one hundred years so i started experimenting <unk> and what i was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine <unk> and here 's one of the early experiments  <unk> was a collaboration with arcade fire it asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it it 's a website <unk> and out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows <unk>  and you see this teenager running down a street and then you see google street view and google maps imagery and you realize the street he 's running down is yours <unk>  and when he stops in front of a house <unk> he stops in front of your house <unk> and this was great and i saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that i had made in rectangles <unk>  and i 'm essentially taking a piece of your history and putting it inside the framing of the story <unk> but then i started thinking okay well that 's a part of you <unk> but how do i put i put all of you inside of the frame so to do that i started making art installations <unk> and this is one <unk> the treachery of sanctuary it 's a triptych i 'm going to show you the third panel <unk> inside of the frame <unk> and i saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one <unk>  but then i started thinking about frames <unk> and what do they represent <unk> and a frame is just a window <unk> <unk> i mean all the media that we watch television cinema they 're these windows into these other worlds <unk>  and i thought <unk> well great i got you in a frame but i don 't want you in the frame i don 't want you in the window i want you through the window i want you on the other side  in the world inhabiting the world  so that leads me back to virtual reality <unk> let 's talk about virtual reality <unk>  unfortunately talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture <unk> and this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality  so <unk> it 's difficult to explain why is it difficult to explain it 's difficult because it 's a very experiential medium <unk> you feel your way inside of it it 's a machine but inside of <unk> it feels like real life <unk> it feels like truth <unk> and you feel present in the world that you 're inside and you feel present with the people that you 're inside of it with  so  i 'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film  a full screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality <unk> so we 're shooting in every direction this is a camera system that we built that has 3d cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction we take this and we <unk> build basically a sphere of a world that you inhabit  so what i 'm going to show you is not a view into the world it 's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle <unk>  so this film is called clouds over sidra  and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called <unk> vrse and the united nations and <unk> we went to a syrian refugee camp in jordan in december and shot the story of a 12 year old girl there named sidra <unk>  and she and her family fled syria through the desert into jordan and she 's been living in this camp for the last year and a half <unk> camp in jordan for the last year and a half i have a big family <unk> three brothers one is a baby he cries a lot <unk>  i asked my father if i cried when i was a baby and he says i did not i think i was a stronger baby than my brother so when you 're inside of the headset you 're not seeing it like this <unk> you 're looking around through this world you 'll notice you see full three hundred and sixty degrees in all directions <unk> and when you 're sitting there in her room watching her <unk> you 're not watching it through a television screen you 're not watching it through a window <unk> you <unk> you 're sitting there with her when you look down <unk> you 're sitting on the same ground that she 's sitting on <unk>  and because of that you feel her humanity in a deeper way <unk> you empathize with her in a deeper way <unk> and i think that we can change minds with this machine <unk> and we 've already started to try to <unk> so we took this film to the world economic forum in davos in january <unk> and we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people and these are people who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent in a refugee camp in jordan <unk> but in january <unk> one afternoon in switzerland they suddenly all found themselves there and they were affected by it  so we 're going to make more of them  we 're working with the united nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films we just finished shooting a story in liberia <unk> and now we 're going to shoot a story in india and we 're taking these films <unk>  and we 're showing them at the united nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there  and we 're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films <unk>  and that 's where i think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of <unk> it 's not a video game peripheral it connects humans to other humans in a profound way that i 've never seen before in any other form of media and it can change people 's perception of each other  and that 's how i think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world <unk>  so <unk> it 's a machine <unk> but through this machine we become more compassionate we become more empathetic <unk> and we become more connected and ultimately we become more human thank you
