 <unk> about today rarely makes the front pages <unk> it <unk> however is enormous in both scale and importance look <unk> you <unk> all are very well traveled this is tedglobal after all <unk> but i do hope to take you to some places you 've never been to before  so let 's start off in china <unk> this photo was taken two weeks ago <unk>  actually one indication is that little boy on my husband 's shoulders has just graduated from high school  laughter but this is tiananmen square many of you have been there it 's not the real china let me take you to the real china  this is in the dabian mountains in the remote part of hubei province in central china <unk>  dai manju is thirteen years old at the time the story starts <unk> she lives with her parents  her two brothers and her great aunt they have a hut that has no electricity no running water  no wristwatch no bicycle <unk> and they share this great splendor with a very large pig  dai manju was in sixth grade when her parents said we 're going to pull you out of school because the 13 dollar school fees are too much for us <unk> you 're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies <unk> why would we waste this money on you  this is what happens to girls in remote areas <unk>  turns out that dai manju was the best pupil in her grade <unk> she still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and <unk> tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors <unk> we wrote about her in the new york times <unk> we got a flood of donations mostly 13 dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts  but then <unk> we got a money transfer for $ ten thousand really nice guy <unk> we turned the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought <unk> i can renovate the school i can give scholarships to all the girls you know if they work hard and stay in school <unk> so dai manju basically finished out middle school she went to high school <unk> she went to vocational school for accounting <unk> she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends  she sent money back to her family they built <unk> a new house this time with running water electricity a bicycle no pig <unk>  what we saw was a natural experiment  it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls ' education  and over the years as we followed dai manju we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her she changed her family her village the village became a real standout of course most of china was flourishing at the time <unk> but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china <unk>  and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of half the sky  and that is that the <unk> was totalitarianism the cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender  so some of you may be thinking gosh that 's hyperbole <unk> she 's exaggerating well let me ask you this question <unk> how many of you think there are more males or more females in the world <unk> let me take a poll how many of you think there are more males in the world hands up please  how many of you think a few how many of you there are more females in the world <unk> okay most of you well you know this latter group you 're wrong <unk>  there are true enough in europe and the west when women and and men have equal access to food and health care there are more women we live <unk> in most of the rest of the world that 's not the case <unk> in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between sixty million and one hundred million missing females in the current population <unk> and you know <unk> it happens for several reasons for instance <unk> in the last half century  more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the <unk> 20th century <unk>  sometimes it 's also because of the sonogram girls get aborted before they 're even born when there are scarce resources this girl here for instance is in a feeding center in ethiopia <unk> the entire center was filled with girls like her  what 's remarkable is that her brothers in the same family were totally fine  in india <unk> in the first year of life from zero to one boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast and the breast shows <unk> no son preference from one to five girls die at a fifty percent higher mortality rate than boys in all of india <unk>  the second tenet of half the sky  is that let 's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on a purely practical level <unk> we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate <unk> girls and to bring women into the formal labor force  poverty for instance <unk> there are three reasons why this is the case  for one overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy  his family tends to have fewer kids but only slightly when you educate a <unk> she tends to have significantly fewer kids <unk> the second reason is it has to do with spending it 's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do poor people take in very little income <unk> but also the income that they take in they don 't spend it very wisely <unk> and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so research has shown if you look at people who live under two dollars a day one <unk> metric of of poverty two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here in education  twenty percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol <unk> tobacco <unk> sugary drinks and prostitution and festivals if you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a <unk> the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem <unk> you need to use scarce resources <unk> it 's a waste of resources if you don 't use someone like dai manju  bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however two thirds of the way there was a barrier on this side was men  and then the barrier and this side was women  and someone from this side of the room got up and said we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top ten countries when it comes to technology do you think we 'll make it  so bill gates as he was staring out at the audience he said  if you 're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten  so here is bill of arabia <unk> so what would some of the specific challenges look like  i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and i 'll just say two things about this  the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in there were about eighty thousand slaves transported from africa to the new world  <unk> modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number that are trafficked across international borders <unk> and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders <unk> which is a substantial portion  and <unk> if you look at another factor another contrast a slave back then is worth about $ forty thousand in today 's money <unk> today you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars which means she 's actually more disposable <unk>  but you know <unk> there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand we don 't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed  the second item on the agenda is <unk> this part of the world is a wonderful event  in niger one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth around the world  one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth you know <unk> it 's not as though we don 't have the technological solution <unk> but these women have three strikes against them they are poor they are rural and they are female <unk> you know <unk> for every woman who does die there are twenty who survive but end up with an injury <unk> and the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula it 's a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent <unk>  let me tell you about mahabuba <unk> she lives in ethiopia she was married against her will at age thirteen she <unk> got pregnant ran to the bush to have the baby but you know her body was very immature <unk> and she ended up having obstructed labor  the baby died <unk> and she ended up with a fistula so that meant she was incontinent she couldn 't control her wastes in a word she stank  the villagers thought she was <unk> they didn 't know what to do with her so finally they put her at the edge of the village in a hut <unk> they ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night  that night <unk> there was a stick in the hut <unk> she fought off the hyenas with that stick  and the next morning she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary she would be saved  because she had some damage to her nerves she crawled all the way thirty miles to that doorstep <unk> dead the foreign missionary opened the door knew exactly what had happened took her to a nearby fistula hospital in addis ababa <unk> and she was repaired with a 350 dollar operation <unk>  the doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor <unk> she was really clever <unk> and they made her a nurse <unk> she is saving the lives of hundreds <unk> thousands of women she has become part of the solution not the problem she 's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle  i 've talked about some of the challenges <unk> let me talk about some of the solutions and there are predictable solutions <unk> i 've hinted at them education and also economic economic opportunity <unk> so of course when you educate a girl <unk> she tends to get married later <unk> life <unk> she tends to have kids later on in life <unk> she tends to have fewer kids <unk> and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion  with economic opportunity <unk> it can be transformative  let me tell you about saima <unk> she lives in a small village outside lahore pakistan  and at the time she was miserable she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler <unk> type and unemployable therefore and took his frustrations out on her well when she had her second daughter her mother <unk> in law told her son  i think you 'd better get a second wife saima 's not going to produce you a son this is when she had her second daughter <unk> at the time there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a <unk> took that money <unk> and she started an embroidery business <unk>  the merchants liked her embroidery it sold very well <unk> and they kept asking for more  and when she couldn 't produce enough she hired other women in the village pretty soon she had thirty women in the village working for her embroidery business <unk>  and then when she <unk> all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace <unk> she needed someone to help her do the transport so she hired her husband <unk>  so now they 're in it together he does the transportation and distribution <unk> and she does the production and sourcing and now they have a third daughter <unk>  and the daughters all of them are being tutored in education because saima knows what 's really important <unk>  which brings me to the final element which is education <unk> larry summers when he was chief <unk> economist at the world bank once said that it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls ' education let me tell you about beatrice biira beatrice was living in uganda near the congo border and like dai manju she didn 't go to <unk> she had never been to school not to a lick one day  her parents again said why should we spend the money on her she 's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth  well it just so happens at that time there was a group in connecticut called the niantic community church group in connecticut they made a donation to an organization based in arkansas called heifer international heifer sent two goats to africa <unk> of them ended up with beatrice 's parents <unk>  and that goat had twins the twins started producing milk they sold the milk for cash the cash started accumulating  and pretty soon the parents said you know <unk> we 've got enough money let 's send beatrice to school  so at nine years of age beatrice started in first grade after all she 'd never been to a lick of school with a six year old  no matter she was just <unk> delighted to be in school <unk> she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of her class through elementary school <unk> middle school and then in high school <unk> she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village ever to come to the united states on scholarship <unk> she graduated from connecticut college  on the day of her graduation <unk> she said i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat  and that goat was $ one hundred and twenty so you see how transformative little bits of help can be but i want to give you a reality check look u s  <unk> helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u s aid there 's bill easterly 's book there 's a book called dead aid  you know <unk> the criticism is fair it isn 't easy <unk> you know <unk> people say how half of all water well projects a year later are failed when i was in zimbabwe <unk> we were touring a place with the village chief he wanted to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and i said what 's that  he sort of mumbled <unk> out that it 's a failed irrigation project a few yards away was a failed chicken coop one year all the chickens died and no one wanted to put the chickens in there it 's true <unk> but we think that you don 't through the baby out with the bathwater you actually improve you learn from your mistakes and you continuously improve <unk>  we also think that individuals can make a difference <unk> and they should because individuals together <unk> we can all help create a <unk> movement and a movement of men and women is what 's needed to bring about social change change that will address this great moral challenge  so then i ask what 's in it for you you 're probably asking that why should you care  i will just leave you with two things one is that research shows that once you <unk> have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room do research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness  one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself  and the second thing <unk> it 's an anecdote that i 'll leave you with and that is the <unk> story of an aid worker in darfur  here was a woman who had worked in darfur <unk> seeing things that no human being should see  throughout her time there <unk> she was strong she was steadfast <unk> she never broke down <unk> and <unk> she came back to the united states and was on break christmas break <unk> she was in her grandmother 's backyard <unk>  and she saw something that made her break down in tears  what that was was a bird feeder <unk> and she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted where we not only <unk> provide for wild birds so they don 't go hungry in the winter <unk> and she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility <unk> and so  like her you me we have all won the lottery of life <unk>  and so the question becomes how do we discharge that responsibility <unk> so here 's the cause join the movement <unk> feel happier and help save the world thank you very much
