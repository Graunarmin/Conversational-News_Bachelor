 <unk> whenever i get to travel for work i try to find out where my drinking water comes from and where my poop and pee go  this has earned me the nickname the poo princess in my family and it 's ruined many family <unk> because this is not normal <unk> but thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee  yeah <unk> and if we use them well <unk> we can live healthier and more beautifully <unk> check out this landscape in santa fe new mexico just notice what kinds of words and feelings come to mind  this landscape was watered with treated sewage water does that change anything for you i imagine it might <unk> and that 's ok  how we feel about this is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be <unk> and i want to explain how it works <unk> but <unk> poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community <unk> it looks more like a park than a treatment plant the poo at the very bottom of all those layers of gravel not touching anyone is providing solid food for those marsh plants and the clean clear water that comes out the other end is traveling underground to water each person 's yard <unk> so even though they 're in a desert they get their own personal oasis  this approach is called integrated <unk> water management or holistic or <unk> closed loop  whatever you want to call it it 's in conflict with the status quo of how we think about sanitation which is contain <unk> treat push it away <unk>  but in this approach we 're doing one step better we 're designing for reuse from the very beginning because everything does get reused <unk> now we 're planning for it and often that makes for really beautiful spaces <unk> but the most important thing about this system isn 't the technicals of how it works it 's how you feel about it  do you want this in your yard <unk> why not  i got really curious about this question <unk> why don 't we see more innovation <unk> why isn 't that kind of thing the new normal <unk>  and i care so much about this question <unk> that i work for a nonprofit called recode we want to accelerate adoption of sustainable building and development practices <unk>  we want more innovation  but a lot of times whole categories of innovation ones that can help us live more beautifully turn out to be illegal today 's regulations and codes were written under the assumption that best practices would remain best practices with incremental updates forever and ever  but innovation isn 't always incremental it turns out how we feel about any particular new technique gets into everything we do how we talk about it <unk> how we encourage people to study our jokes our codes and it ultimately determines how innovative we can be  so that 's the first <unk> reason we don 't innovate in sanitation <unk>  we 're kind of uncomfortable talking about sanitation <unk>  that 's why i 've gotten called the poo princess so much <unk> the second reason is  we think the problem is solved here in the us <unk> but not so here in the us we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water <unk> <unk> seven million people get sick every year nine hundred die annually and we 're not taking a holistic approach to making it better so we 're not solving it  where i live in portland oregon <unk> i can 't take echo for a swim during the rainy season because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river  our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant  too much rain overflows into the river <unk> and portland is not alone here forty <unk> percent of municipalities <unk> self report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways <unk>  the other bummer going on here with our status quo is that half of all of your poop and pee is going to fertilize farmland <unk> the other half is being incinerated or land filled and that 's a bummer to me because there are amazing nutrients in your daily doody it is comparable <unk> to pig manure we 're omnivores they 're omnivores think of your poo and pee as a health smoothie for a tree  the other bummer going on here is that we 're quickly moving all the drugs we take into our waterways <unk>  the average wastewater treatment plant can remove maybe half of the drugs that come in the <unk> other half goes right out the other side consider what a cocktail of pharmaceuticals hormones steroids vicodin does to a fish to a dog to a child <unk>  but this isn 't just some problem that we need to contain <unk>  if we flip this around we can create a resource that can solve so many of our other problems <unk>  and i want to get you <unk> comfortable with this idea <unk> so imagine the things i 'm going to show you these technologies <unk> and this attitude that says we 're going to reuse this let 's design to make it beautiful as advanced potty training  i think you 're ready for it <unk> i think we as a culture are ready for advanced potty training <unk> and there are three <unk> great reasons to enroll today number one  we can fertilize our food <unk>  each one of us is pooping and peeing something that could fertilize half or maybe all of our food depending on our diet <unk> that dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what dead stuff bacteria <unk>  that 's carbon <unk> and carbon if we 're getting that into the soil is going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients <unk> chemical fertilizers by definition don 't have carbon in them imagine if we could move our animal manure and our human manure to our soil we might not need to rely on fossil <unk> fuel based fertilizers mine minerals from far away <unk>  imagine how much energy we could <unk> some of us are concerned about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle  that can be addressed <unk> but we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee so we can calmly talk about how we want to reuse it and what things we don 't want to reuse and get this  if we change our approach to sanitation we can start to <unk> slow down climate change  remember that carbon in the poop <unk>  if we can get that into our soil bank it 's going to start to absorb carbon dioxide that we put into the air <unk>  and that could help slow down global warming <unk> i want to show you some brave souls who 've had the courage to <unk> embrace this advanced potty training approach  so those folks in new mexico why did they do it ' cause they 're in a desert ' cause they save money <unk> yeah <unk> but more importantly <unk> they felt comfortable seeing what was going down the toilet as a resource  here 's an average house in portland oregon <unk> this house is special because they have a composting toilet turning all their poo and <unk> over time into a soil amendment  their wash water their shower water is going underground to a series of mulch basins <unk> and then watering that orchard downhill <unk>  when they went to get this permitted <unk> it wasn 't allowed in oregon <unk> but it was allowed in five other states nearby that <unk> my organization 's first code change campaign  here 's a great example where the integrated water management approach was the cheapest this is three <unk> high rise residential buildings in downtown portland <unk> and they 're not flushing to the sewer system  how well their wash water is getting reused to flush toilets cool mechanical systems water the landscape <unk>  and then once the building has thoroughly used everything aka shat in it it 's treated to highest standard right <unk> on site by plants and bacteria <unk> and then infiltrated into the groundwater right below and all that was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure so that 's the last reason we should get really excited about doing things differently we can save a lot of money <unk> i keep showing examples where everyone 's reusing everything on site why well when we look at our aging infrastructure and it is old and we look at the cost of updating it three quarters of that cost is <unk> the pipes snaking through our city <unk> so as we build anew as we renovate it might make more sense to treat and reuse everything on site  san francisco realized that it made sense to invest in rebates for every household to reuse their wash water and their rainwater to water the backyard <unk>  because the amount of water they would save as a community would be so big <unk> but why were all these projects so innovative the money piece <unk> yeah <unk>  but more importantly they felt comfortable with this idea of advanced potty training  imagine if we embraced innovation for sanitation the way we have for say solar power <unk> think about it solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable now it 's more a part of our web of power than ever before  and it 's creating resiliency <unk> we now have sources of power like the sun that don 't vary with our earthly dramas  what 's driving all that innovation it 's us we 're talking about energy <unk> it 's cool to talk about energy  some folks are even talking about the problems with the limited resources where our current <unk> energy is coming from we encourage our best and brightest to work on this issue better solar panels better batteries everything  so let 's talk about where our drinking water is coming from where our poo and pee are actually going  if we can get over this discomfort with this entire topic we could create something that creates our future goldmine <unk> every time you flush the toilet i want you to think where is my poop and pee going will they be gainfully employed  or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway if you don 't know find out and if you don 't like the answer <unk> figure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change that you have advanced <unk> you are ready for reuse how all of you feel is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be thank you so much
