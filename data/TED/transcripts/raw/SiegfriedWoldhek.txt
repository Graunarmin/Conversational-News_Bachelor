 <unk> good morning let 's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all leonardo da vinci we 're all familiar with his fantastic work his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings <unk> but we do not know his face thousands of books have been written about him but there 's controversy <unk> and it remains about his looks  even this <unk> well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians so what do you think  is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn 't it  let 's find out  leonardo was a man that drew everything <unk> but no faces <unk> i find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here en face <unk> so surely a passionate drawer like leonardo must have made self portraits from time to time <unk>  so let 's try to find them i think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self portraits we would find his face looking at us  so i looked at all of his drawings more than seven hundred  and looked for male portraits there are about one hundred and twenty you see them here  which ones of these could be self portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw en face or <unk> so we can eliminate all the profiles  it also has to be sufficiently detailed <unk> so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized <unk>  and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures and look what happens only three candidates remain that fit <unk> and here they are  yes indeed the old man is there  as is this famous pen drawing of the homo <unk> vitruvianus and lastly the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted the musician <unk>  before we go into these faces <unk> i should explain why i have some right to talk about them <unk>  i 've made more than one thousand one hundred portraits myself for newspapers over the course of three hundred thirty years sorry thirty <unk> but there are one thousand one hundred and very few artists have drawn so many faces so i know a little about drawing and analyzing faces <unk>  ok <unk> now let 's look at these three portraits and hold onto your seats because if we zoom in on those faces <unk>  remark how they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrows the long nose the curved lips and the small well developed chin <unk>  i couldn 't believe my eyes when i first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike all we did was look for portraits <unk> that had the characteristics of a self portrait and look they are very similar <unk> now  are they made in the right order the young man should be made first and as you see here from the years that they were created it is indeed the case they are made in the right order <unk> what was the age of leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was <unk> <unk> when these were made so we have three pictures <unk> potentially of the same person of the same age <unk> as leonardo at the time <unk>  but how do we know it 's him <unk> and not someone else <unk> well we need a reference <unk> and here 's the only the only picture of leonardo that 's widely accepted it 's a statue made by verrocchio of david for which leonardo posed as a boy of fifteen and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician <unk> you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces
