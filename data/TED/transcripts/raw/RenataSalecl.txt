 <unk> when i was preparing for this talk i went to search for a couple of quotes that i can share with you  good news <unk> i found three that i particularly liked  the first by samuel <unk> when making your choice in life <unk> do not forget to live  the second by aeschylus who reminded us that happiness is a choice that requires effort  and the third is one by groucho marx who said i wouldn 't want to choose to belong to any club that would have me as a member <unk> i didn 't know which one of these quotes to choose and share with you the sweet anxiety of choice in today 's times of <unk> endless progress <unk>  but the underside of this ideology has been an increase of anxiety feelings of guilt <unk> it appears that this ideology was actually very efficient in pacifying us as political and social thinkers instead of making social critiques we are more and more engaging in <unk> sometimes to the point of <unk> is still so powerful even among people who have not many things to choose among how come that even people who are poor very much still identify with the idea of choice the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace  now the ideology of choice is very successful in us a space to think about some imagined future <unk>  let me give you an example <unk> my friend manya when she was a student at university in california was earning money by working for a car dealer now manya when she encountered the <unk> would debate with him about his lifestyle how much he wants to spend <unk> how many children he has what does he need the car for they would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a perfect car  now before <unk> manya 's customer would go home and think things through  she would say to him the car that you are buying now is perfect  but in a few year 's time <unk> your kids will be already out of the house when you will have a little bit more money  that other car will be ideal <unk> but what you are buying now is great  now <unk> the majority of manya 's customers who came back the next day bought that other car  the car they did not need the car that cost far too much money <unk> successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes  laughter and knowing so much about the psychology of people prepared her well for her current job which is that of a psychoanalyst <unk>  now <unk> why were <unk> 's success was that she was able to open in their heads an image of an idealized future  an image of themselves when they are already more successful freer <unk> and for them choosing that other car was as if they are coming closer to this ideal in which it was <unk> we rarely make really totally rational choices choices are influenced by our unconscious  by our community <unk> we 're often choosing by guessing what would other people think about our choice <unk> also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing we 're also guessing <unk> we actually even after we have already chosen like bought a car <unk>  endlessly read reviews about cars as if we still want to convince ourselves that we made the right choice <unk>  now <unk> choices are <unk> they are linked to risks <unk> losses they are highly unpredictable <unk> now because of this have now more and more problems that they are not choosing anything <unk>  not long ago i was at a wedding reception <unk>  and i met a young beautiful woman who immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice <unk>  she said to me i needed one month to decide which dress to wear <unk> for weeks i was researching which hotel to stay for this one night <unk> and now <unk> i need to choose a sperm donor  i looked at this woman in shock sperm donor what 's the rush  she said i 'm turning forty at the end of this year <unk> and i 've been so bad in choosing men in my life choice <unk> because it 's linked to risk is <unk> and it was already the famous danish philosopher sren kierkegaard who pointed out that anxiety is linked to the possibility of possibility  now we think today that we can prevent these risks we have endless market analysis projections of the future earnings even with market which is about chance randomness <unk> we think we can predict rationally where it 's going <unk>  now chance is actually becoming very traumatic <unk>  last year <unk> my friend bernard harcourt at the university of chicago organized an event a conference on <unk> of chance he and i were together on the panel and just before delivering our papers we didn 't know each other 's papers we decided to take chance seriously so we informed our audience that what they will just now hear will be a random paper <unk> a mixture of the two papers which <unk> i read my second paragraph in this way towards the end of our papers now you will be surprised that a majority of our audience did not think that what they 'd just listened to was a completely random paper <unk> couldn 't believe that speaking from the position of authority like two professors we were we would take chance seriously they thought we prepared the papers together and were just joking that it 's random <unk>  now <unk> we live in times with a lot of information <unk> big data <unk> a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies we decoded our genome we know about our brains more than before  but surprisingly people are more and more turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge  ignorance and denial are on the rise  now in regard to the current economic crisis <unk> we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before and no political or changes are needed in regard to ecological crisis we think nothing needs to be done just now <unk> or others need to act before us  or even when ecological crisis already happens like a catastrophe in fukushima often we have people living in the same environment with the same amount of <unk> half of them will be anxious about radiation and half of them will ignore it <unk> now <unk> psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don 't have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance <unk>  now what does that mean <unk> let 's say when we are facing a life threatening illness  a lot of people don 't want to know that they 'd rather prefer denying <unk> illness which is why it 's not so wise to inform them if they don 't ask <unk> surprisingly research shows that sometimes people who deny their illness live longer than those who are rationally choosing the best treatment <unk> now <unk> this ignorance however is not <unk> on the level of the social when we are ignorant about where we are heading <unk> a lot of social damage can be caused  now on top of facing ignorance we are also facing today some kind of an obviousness <unk>  now <unk> it was french philosopher louis althusser who pointed out that ideology functions in such a way <unk> necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness and to think through a little bit differently <unk>  if we go back to this ideology of individual rational choice we often embrace it 's necessary precisely here to lift this obviousness and to think a little bit differently <unk> now for me a question often is why we still embrace this <unk> <unk> man on which capitalism relied from its beginning <unk>  why do we think that we are really such masters of our lives that we can rationally make the best ideal choices that we don 't accept losses <unk> shocking to see sometimes very poor people for example not supporting the idea of the rich being taxed more  quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality okay maybe they don 't think that they will make it in the future but maybe they think my son might become the next bill gates <unk> and who would want to tax <unk> a question for me is also why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare  sometimes they don 't embrace it again identifying with the idea of choice <unk> but they have nothing to choose from  now <unk> margaret thatcher famously said that there is nothing like a society society doesn 't exist it is only individuals and their families sadly <unk> this ideology still functions very well  which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty we might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices and that 's why we didn 't succeed  we are anxious that we are not good enough that 's why we work very hard <unk> long hours at the workplace and equally long hours <unk> on remaking ourselves  now when we are anxious over choices <unk> sometimes we easily give our power of choice away <unk> we identify with the guru who tells us what to do self help therapist or we embrace a totalitarian leader who appears to have no doubts about choices who sort of knows <unk>  now <unk> often people ask me <unk> me what did you learn by studying choice and there is an important message that i did learn  when thinking about choices <unk> i stopped taking choices too seriously <unk> personally  first i realized a lot of choice i make is not rational it 's linked to my unconscious my guesses of what others are choosing or what is a socially embraced choice i also embrace the idea that we should go beyond thinking about individual choices that it 's very important to rethink social choices <unk>  since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us it really prevented us to think about social change <unk> we spend so much time choosing things for ourselves and barely reflect on communal choices we can make now we should <unk> not forget that choice is always linked to change we can make individual changes but we can make social changes <unk>  we can choose to have more wolves <unk> we can choose to change our environment to have more bees we can choose to have different rating <unk> we can choose to control corporations instead of allowing corporations to control us  we have a possibility to make changes <unk>  now i started with a quote from samuel johnson <unk> who said that when we make choice in life we shouldn 't forget to live <unk> finally <unk> you can see i did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which i wanted to start my lecture i did have a choice <unk> such as nations as people we have choices too to rethink in what kind of society we want to live in the future <unk> thank you
