 <unk> i 'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you something we 've been working on for over two years <unk>  and it 's in the area of additive manufacturing also known as 3d printing  you see this object here it looks fairly simple but it 's quite complex at the same time <unk> it 's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one  in its context <unk> it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques <unk>  it has a symmetry such that you can 't injection mold it  you can 't even manufacture it <unk> this is a job for a 3d printer but most 3d printers would take between three and ten hours to fabricate it <unk> and we 're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage during this 10 minute talk <unk> wish us luck  now 3d printing is actually a misnomer it 's actually 2d printing over and over again  and it in fact uses the technologies associated with <unk> think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters and then do that over and over again to build up a three dimensional object <unk>  in microelectronics they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure several times these are all 2d printing <unk> 'm a chemist a material scientist too <unk> and my co inventors are also material scientists one a chemist one a physicist <unk>  and we began to be interested in 3d printing  and very often as you know new ideas are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities <unk> and that 's our story <unk> <unk> operate in this fashion where you have an object arise out of a puddle in essentially real time with essentially no waste to make a great object okay just like the movies and could we be inspired by hollywood and come <unk> up with ways to actually try to get this to work and that was our challenge <unk>  and our approach would be if we could do this then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3d printing from being a manufacturing process  one 3d printing takes forever  there are mushrooms that grow faster <unk> the layer by layer process leads to defects in mechanical properties and if we could grow continuously we could eliminate those defects and in fact if we could grow really fast <unk> we could also start using materials that are <unk> self curing and we could have amazing properties so if we could pull this off imitate hollywood we could in fact address our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry to harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously  light and oxygen work in different ways light can take a resin and convert it to a solid can convert a liquid to a solid  oxygen inhibits that process <unk> so light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view <unk>  and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen we could control this process <unk> and we refer to this as clip [ continuous liquid interface production ] it has three functional components one <unk> it has a reservoir that holds the puddle just like the t 1000 at the bottom of <unk> the reservoir is a special window i 'll come back to that  in addition it has a stage that will lower into the puddle and pull the object out of the liquid <unk> the third component is a digital light projection system underneath the reservoir illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region now the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir <unk> 's not only transparent to light but it 's permeable to oxygen it 's got characteristics like a contact lens  so we can see how the process works you can start to see that as you lower a stage in there in a traditional process with <unk> <unk> window <unk> you make a two dimensional pattern <unk> and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window <unk> and so in order to introduce the next layer you have to separate it introduce new resin  reposition it and do this process over and over again <unk>  but with our very special window <unk> what we 're able to do is with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it  that oxygen inhibits the reaction <unk> and we form a dead zone this dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick that 's two or three diameters of a red blood cell right at the window interface that remains a liquid <unk> and we pull this object up  and as we talked about in a science paper as we change the oxygen content we can change the dead zone thickness <unk>  and so we have a number of key variables that we control oxygen content the light the light intensity the dose to cure the viscosity the geometry <unk> and we use very <unk> sophisticated software to control this process <unk> the result is pretty staggering to one hundred times faster than traditional 3d printers <unk> which is <unk> game changing in addition <unk> as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface  we can go one thousand times faster i believe <unk>  and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of <unk> and as a chemical engineer i get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have <unk> <unk> printers because they 're going so fast  in addition because we 're growing things we eliminate the layers  and the parts are monolithic <unk> you don 't see the surface structure you have molecularly smooth surfaces <unk> and the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3d printer are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation with which how you printed it because of the layer like structure <unk> but when you grow objects like this  the properties are invariant with the print direction <unk> these look like <unk> parts which is very different than traditional 3d manufacturing <unk> we 're able to throw the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this <unk> and we 're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want in a 3d printed object there it is that 's great  you always take the risk that something like this won 't work onstage right  <unk> have materials with great mechanical properties for the first time we can have elastomers that are high elasticity or high dampening <unk> think about vibration control or great sneakers for example  we can make materials that have incredible strength high strength to weight ratio really strong materials really great elastomers so throw that in the audience there so great material properties <unk> and so the opportunity now if you actually make a part that has the properties to be a final part and you do it in <unk> game changing speeds <unk> you can actually transform manufacturing  right now in manufacturing <unk> what happens is the so called digital thread in digital manufacturing we go from a cad drawing a design  to a prototype to manufacturing often digital thread is broken right at prototype because you can 't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don 't have the properties to be a final part  we now can connect the digital thread all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things from better fuel efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties with high strength to weight ratio <unk> new turbine blades all sorts of wonderful things <unk>  <unk> about if you need a stent in an emergency situation instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes having a stent that 's designed for you for your own anatomy with your own tributaries <unk> printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after eighteen months <unk> dentistry and making these kinds of structures even while you 're in the dentist chair  and look at the structures that my students are making at the university of north carolina <unk> these are amazing microscale structures you know the world is really good at <unk> <unk> moore 's law has driven things from ten microns and <unk> we 're really good at that but it 's actually very hard to make things from ten microns to one thousand microns the mesoscale  and subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can 't do that very well they can 't etch wafers that well <unk>  but this process is so gentle we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing and make amazing things in tens of seconds <unk> opening up new sensor technologies <unk>  <unk> so the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part really opens up 3d manufacturing and for us this is very exciting because this really is owning the intersection between hardware software and molecular science and i can 't wait to see what designers <unk> engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool thanks for listening
