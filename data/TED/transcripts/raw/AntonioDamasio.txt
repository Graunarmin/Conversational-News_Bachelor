 <unk> i 'm <unk> here to talk about the wonder and the mystery <unk> minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence <unk> yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder we should <unk> in fact because without <unk> having this possibility of conscious minds <unk> we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity we would have no knowledge whatsoever about <unk> we would have no pains but also no joys <unk> we would have no access to love or to the ability to create  and of course <unk> scott fitzgerald said famously that he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for but he also forgot that without consciousness he would have no access to true happiness and even the <unk> so much for the wonder now for the mystery this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate  all the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience <unk> this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation has got major controversies and there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it <unk> we should just leave it alone <unk> it 's not to be solved i don 't believe that <unk> and i think the situation is changing <unk> it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our in our brains but we certainly can begin to approach the question <unk> and we can begin to see the shape of a solution and one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow <unk> us to go inside the human brain and be able to do for example <unk> what you 're seeing right now these are images that come from hanna damasio 's lab <unk> and which <unk> <unk> show you in a living brain the reconstruction of that brain and this is a person who is alive this is not a person that is amazed about is what i 'm going to show you next which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real <unk> <unk> connections real pathways so all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons <unk> the fibers that join <unk> i 'm sorry to disappoint you they don 't come in color <unk> but at any rate <unk> they are there the colors are codes for the direction from whether it is back to front or vice versa  at any rate <unk> what is consciousness what is a conscious mind and we could take a very simple view and say well it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams or when we go under anesthesia <unk> and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia <unk> but what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia <unk> or when we are in deep dreamless sleep <unk>  well first of all it is a mind which is a flow of mental images <unk> and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns visual <unk> as you 're having right now in relation to the stage and me or auditory images as you are having now in relation to my to my words that flow of mental images is mind <unk>  but there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room we are not passive exhibitors of visual or <unk> we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now we own our minds and we have a sense that it 's everyone of us that is experiencing this not the person who is sitting next to you so in order to have a conscious mind <unk> you have a self within the conscious mind  so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it <unk> the self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind <unk>  so what we need to know to even address this mystery is number one how are minds are put together in the brain and number two how selves are constructed  now the first part the first problem <unk> 's not easy at all but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience <unk> and it 's quite clear that in order to make minds we need to construct neural maps <unk> so imagine a grid like the one i 'm showing you right now and now imagine within that <unk> <unk> grid that <unk> two dimensional sheet imagine neurons and picture if you will a <unk> digital billboard where you have elements that can be either lit or not and depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting <unk> <unk> the digital elements or for that matter the neurons in the sheet you 're going to be able to construct a map  <unk> or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate now to bring home the point of how close it is the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the the activity of the neurons and our mental experience i 'm going to tell you a personal story <unk>  so if i cover my left eye i 'm talking about me personally not all of you if i cover my left eye i look at the grid pretty <unk> much like the one i 'm showing you everything is nice and fine and perpendicular <unk> but sometime ago i discovered that if i cover my left eye <unk> instead what i get is this <unk> i look at the grid and i see a warping at the edge of my central left field very odd i 've analyzed this for a while <unk>  <unk> through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine carmen puliafito <unk> who developed a laser scanner of the retina <unk> i found out the the following <unk> if <unk> i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner what i get is the following on the right side my retina is perfectly symmetrical you see the going down towards the fovea <unk> which is marked there by the red arrow and it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below and that is exactly what causes the warping of my <unk> visual image so just think of this you have a grid of neurons and now you have a plane mechanical <unk> close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball or for that matter a sheet <unk> of visual cortex so from the retina you go onto visual cortex and of course the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina and in that image there <unk> see a variety of islands of what i call image making regions in the brain <unk> you have the green for example that corresponds to tactile information or the <unk> <unk> blue that corresponds to auditory information <unk> and something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps  <unk> purple that you see around which is the association cortex where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making and the great <unk> <unk> beauty is that you can then go from memory out of those association cortices <unk> and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the the brain is so it provides certain areas for perception and image making and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information so far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images <unk> but what about the self the self is really <unk> the elusive problem <unk> and for a long time people did not even want to touch it because they 'd say how can you have this reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day  and i thought about a solution to this problem <unk> we generate brain maps of the body 's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps <unk> so let me tell you just a little bit about how i came to this  i came to this because  if you 're going to have a reference that we know as self the me the i in in our own processing we need to have something that is stable something that does not deviate much from day to day <unk> well it so <unk> happens that we have a singular body we have one body not two not three and so that is a beginning <unk> there is just one reference point which is the body <unk>  but then of course the body has many parts <unk> and things grow at different rates and they have different sizes and different people however <unk> not so with the interior <unk> the things that have to do what is known as our internal milieu for example the whole management of the chemistries within our body are in fact extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason  if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that survival range you go into disease or death <unk> so we <unk> within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day because if you don 't have that <unk> <unk> sameness <unk> physiologically you 're going to be sick or you 're going to die <unk> so that 's one more element for this continuity  <unk> other coupling so for example i 'm making images of you <unk> but there 's no physiological bond between the images i have of you as an audience and my <unk> <unk> brain <unk> however there is a close permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own <unk> here 's how it looks <unk> look at the region there there is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord and it is within that region that i 'm going <unk> <unk> to highlight now that we have this housing of all the devices of the body <unk> this is so specific that for example <unk> if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem <unk> if you damage that <unk> as a result of a stroke for example <unk> what you get is coma or vegetative state <unk> which is a state of course in which your mind disappears your consciousness disappears <unk> what happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self you have no longer access to any feeling of your <unk> own existence and in fact there can be images going on being formed in the cerebral cortex <unk> except you don 't know they 're there <unk> you have in effect lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem but if you consider the green part <unk> <unk> of the brain stem <unk> nothing like that happens it is that specific <unk> so in that green component of the brain stem <unk> if you damage it and often it happens  but your conscious mind is maintained you feel <unk> you know you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly this is a horrific condition you don 't want to see it and people are in fact imprisoned within their own bodies <unk> but they do have a mind there was a very interesting film one of the rare good films done about a situation like this by julian schnabel some some years ago about a patient that was in that condition <unk> so now i 'm going to show you a picture i promise not to say anything about this <unk> except this is to frighten you it 's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem <unk> there are to make it simple all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our <unk> interior different aspects of our body <unk> they are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern <unk> and it is <unk> out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that i believe and i could be wrong but i don 't think i am <unk> comes in the form of feelings primordial feelings by the way so what is the picture that we get here look at cerebral cortex look at brain stem look at body and you get the picture of the interconnectivity <unk> in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body <unk> and you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with <unk> the profusion of images that are in fact the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to as we should because that 's really the film that is rolling in our minds <unk>  but look at the arrows they 're not there for looks they 're there because there 's this very close interaction <unk> you cannot have a conscious mind if you don 't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem you <unk> cannot have a conscious mind if you don 't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body <unk>  another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species <unk> so throughout vertebrates <unk> the design of the brain stem <unk> <unk> is very similar to ours <unk> which is one of the reasons why i think those other species have conscious minds like we do <unk> except that they 're not as rich as ours because they <unk> don 't have a cerebral cortex like we do that 's where the difference is and i strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great <unk> <unk> product of the cerebral cortex only the wealth of our minds is not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer <unk> there are three levels of self to consider the proto <unk> the core and the autobiographical the first two are shared with many many other species <unk> and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species <unk> it 's the autobiographical self <unk> which some species have i think cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to <unk> degree and everybody 's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree <unk> but the novelty is here the autobiographical self is built on the basis <unk> of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made <unk> it 's the lived past and the anticipated future and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory reasoning imagination creativity and language out of that came the instruments of culture religions <unk> justice trade the arts science technology <unk> and it is within that culture that we really can get and this is the novelty something that is not entirely set by our biology <unk> it is developed in the cultures it developed in collectives of human beings and this is of course <unk> the culture where <unk> have developed something that i like to call socio cultural regulation <unk> and finally <unk> you could rightly ask <unk> why care about this why care if it is the brain stem <unk> <unk> or the cerebral cortex and how this is made <unk> three reasons first curiosity  <unk> away from the earth <unk> why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings <unk> second understanding society and culture we should look at how society and culture in this socio cultural regulation are a work in progress <unk> and finally <unk> medicine let 's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression <unk> alzheimer 's disease drug addiction think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious <unk> you have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a <unk> way if you do not know how this works <unk> so that 's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we 're doing and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains
