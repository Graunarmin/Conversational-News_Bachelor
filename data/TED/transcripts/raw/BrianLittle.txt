 <unk> what an intriguing group of individuals you are to a psychologist  i 've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other and i think it 's fair to say <unk> already that there are <unk> people in this audience at this moment <unk> displaying psychological symptoms i would like to discuss today  laughter and i thought you might like to know who you are  but instead of pointing at you which would be gratuitous and intrusive <unk> thought i would tell you a few facts and stories in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself <unk> i 'm in the field of research known as personality psychology which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum <unk> from neurons to narratives <unk>  and what we try to do  in our own way is to make sense <unk> of how each of us each of you is in certain respects like all other people like some other people and like no other person now already you may be saying of yourself i 'm not intriguing in the western hemisphere or you may say of yourself i am intriguing <unk>  even if i am regarded by most people as a great why this is so  one of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed and that describe universally held aspects of difference between <unk> in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life <unk> in contrast to those who are more stable  all of these dimensions have implications for our well being for how our life goes <unk>  and so we know that for example <unk> openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success <unk> but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and occasionally odd the conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines to persevering as well as having some passion extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people  extroverts for example <unk> i find intriguing with my classes i sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality <unk>  i tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow  did you know that already some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow <unk> but extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried <unk> but they have <unk> successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them  those are the extroverts <unk>  let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion because it 's consequential and it 's intriguing and it helps us understand what i call our three natures first our biogenic nature our neurophysiology  <unk> or second nature which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives and third what makes you individually you idiosyncratic what i call your idiogenic nature let me explain  one of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation <unk> and that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting <unk> loud noises <unk> parties and social events here at ted you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core they all gather together and i 've seen you  the introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor  where they are able to reduce stimulation and may be misconstrued as being antisocial <unk> but you 're not <unk> necessarily antisocial <unk> it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation sometimes it 's an internal stimulant <unk>  from your body <unk> caffeine for example works much better with extroverts than it does introverts when extroverts come into the office at nine o 'clock in the morning and <unk> say i really need a cup of coffee they 're not kidding they really do  introverts do not do as well particularly if the tasks they 're engaged in and they 've had some coffee if those tasks are speeded and if they 're quantitative introverts may give the appearance of <unk> so here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing <unk> we 're not always what seem to be <unk> and that takes me to my next point  i should say <unk> before getting to this something about sexual intercourse <unk> although i may not have time and so <unk> if you would like me to yes you would ok  there are studies done on the frequency with which <unk> individuals engage in the conjugal act <unk>  as broken down by male female introvert extrovert so i ask you how many times per minute oh i 'm sorry that was a rat study  how many times per month <unk> extroverted men more or less <unk> yes more five point five almost twice as much  introverted women three point one <unk> extroverted women <unk> frankly speaking as an introverted male <unk> which i will explain <unk> they not only handle all the male extroverts they pick up a few introverts as well  we communicate differently <unk> extroverts and introverts extroverts when they interact want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness they 'd like to stand close for comfortable communication <unk>  they like to have a lot of eye contact or mutual gaze <unk> we found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody <unk> so when an extrovert meets a charles it rapidly becomes <unk> he 's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he 's talking to we speak differently <unk>  extroverts prefer concrete simple language introverts prefer and i must again tell you that i am as extreme an <unk> introvert as you could possibly imagine we speak differently we prefer contextually complex contingent we sometimes talk past each other <unk>  i had a consulting contract i shared with a colleague who 's as different from me as two people can possibly be <unk> first his name is tom <unk> mine isn 't  secondly he 's six foot five i have a tendency not to be  and thirdly he 's as extroverted a person as you could find i am seriously i overload so much i can 't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening we had seconded to this project a fellow called michael  and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt <unk> so the person who seconded him asked tom and me <unk> what do you make of michael well i 'll tell you what tom said in a minute he spoke in classic <unk> and here is how extroverted ears heard what i said which is actually pretty accurate i said well michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally <unk> called for  tom rolled his eyes and he said brian that 's what i said <unk>  he 's an asshole  now as an introvert i might gently allude to to certain assholic <unk> in this man 's behavior but i 'm not going to lunge for the a word but the extrovert says if he walks like one if he talks like one i call him one and we go past each other <unk>  now is this something that we should be heedful of of course it 's important that we know this is that all we are are we just a bunch of traits <unk> remember you 're like some other people and like no other person how about that idiosyncratic you as elizabeth or as george you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism  but are there some distinctively elizabethan features of your behavior <unk> or georgian of yours  that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits <unk> that make us love you  not just because you 're a certain type of person <unk> i 'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes <unk>  i don 't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes <unk> so what is it that makes us different <unk> it 's the doings that we have in our life the personal projects you have a personal project right now but <unk> nobody may know it here it relates to your kid you 've been back three times to the hospital and they still don 't know what 's wrong  or it could be your mom and you 'd been acting out of character <unk> these are free traits you 're very agreeable <unk> but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital to get something for your mom or your child <unk> what are these free traits <unk> they 're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives <unk> and they are what matters don 't ask people what type you are ask them <unk> projects in your life and we enact those free traits <unk> i 'm an introvert <unk> but i have a core project which is to profess <unk> i 'm a professor <unk> and i adore my students <unk>  and i adore my field and i can 't wait to tell them about what 's new what 's exciting what i can 't wait to tell <unk> them about and so i act in an extroverted way because at eight in the morning the students need a little bit of humor a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study <unk> but we need to be very careful when we act out of character sometimes we may find that we don 't take care of ourselves <unk> example after a period of <unk> behavior <unk> i need to repair somewhere on my own  as susan cain said in her quiet book  in a chapter that featured the strange canadian professor who was teaching at the time at harvard <unk> i sometimes go to the men 's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts <unk> particular day when i was retired to a cubicle <unk> trying to avoid <unk> and a real extrovert came in beside me not right in my cubicle but in the next cubicle over and i could hear various evacuatory noises which we hate even our own <unk> if anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months it 's talking on the john  that 's where i 'm going now <unk> don 't follow me <unk> thank you
