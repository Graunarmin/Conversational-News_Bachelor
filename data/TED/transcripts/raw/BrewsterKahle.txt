 <unk> we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children <unk> if we don 't do that we 're going to get the generation we deserve <unk> they 're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them and <unk> a bunch of our activities are in fact in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us or as broadly as we can i 'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone  one is what 's on the boston public library  carved above their door is free to all it 's kind of an inspiring statement and i 'll go back at the end of this i 'm a librarian and what i 'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it and the idea of using technology is perfect for us i think we have the opportunity to one up the greeks it 's not easy to one up the greeks <unk> but with the industriousness of the egyptians they were able to build the library of alexandria the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world <unk> problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it on the other hand if you did then great things happened i think we can one up the greeks and achieve something and i 'm going to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp <unk> so if i 'm successful then you 'll actually come away thinking <unk> we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published  everything that was ever meant for distribution available to anybody in the world that 's ever wanted to have access to it <unk> yes there 's issues about how money should be distributed and that 's still being refigured out but i 'd say there 's plenty of money and there 's plenty of demand <unk> so we can actually achieve that but i 'm going to go over the technological social and sort of where are we as a whole trying to get <unk> to that particular vision <unk> and the way i 'm going to try to do this is do it like the <unk> <unk> website the books <unk> music video and just go step media type by media type just go and say all right how 're we doing on this <unk> so if we start with books you know  sort of where are we well first you have to as an engineer scope the <unk> how big is it if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available  well how big a problem is it well we don 't really know <unk> but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress it 's twenty six million volumes twenty six million volumes it is by far and away the largest print library in the world and a book <unk> if you had a book is about a megabyte <unk> so you know  <unk> terabytes fits in a computer system that 's about this big on spinning spinning linux drives and it costs about sixty thousand dollars so for the cost of a house or around here a garage you you can put you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress that 's pretty neat then the question is <unk> do you get you know is it worth trying to get there do you actually want it online some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books and that <unk> <unk> 's kind of fun and you can download these things and look around them in new and different ways and you can get at them remotely <unk> if you happen to have <unk> like books in certain ways and you can search them make little tabs and it 's kind of cute still very book like on your laptop <unk> but i don 't know reading things on a laptop whenever i pull up my laptop it always feels like work  i think that 's one of the reasons why the kindle is so great i don 't have to feel like i 'm at work to read a kindle it 's starting to be a little bit more specified specified <unk> but i have to say that there 's <unk> that i tend to like  i like the physical book <unk>  and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things put them on the net <unk> and then download print them and bind them and end up with books again <unk> and we sort of said well how hard is this and it turns out to not be very hard we actually went off to make a <unk> and a bookmobile the size of a van with a satellite dish a printer binder and cutter and kids make their own books <unk> it costs about three dollars to download print and bind a normal old book <unk> and they actually come out kind of nice looking you can actually get really good looking books for on the order of one penny per page <unk> sort of the parts cost for doing this <unk> so the idea of this technology actually may end up putting books back in people 's hands again <unk> there are some other bookmobiles running around this is eric eldred making books at walden pond <unk> thoreau 's works this is just before he got kicked out by the parks services for competing with the bookstore there <unk> in india they 've got another couple bookmobiles running around and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria the new library of alexandria in egypt  it was quite popularly attended and kids starting to make their own books and a happy kid with the first book that he 's ever owned <unk> so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro but i think it still has its place and being from the silicon valley sort of utopian <unk> <unk> sort of world we thought <unk> if we can make this technology work in rural uganda we might have something <unk> so we actually got some funding from the world bank to try it out <unk> and we found in about thirty days we could go and <unk> a couple folks from from silicon valley fly them to uganda <unk> buy a car <unk> set up the first internet connection at the national library of uganda <unk>  figure out what they wanted and get a program going making books in rural uganda <unk> and it actually so technologically <unk> it works what we found out of this is we didn 't have the right books <unk> <unk> so the books were in the library we could get it to people if they 're digitized <unk> but we didn 't know how to quite get them digitized <unk> everybody thought the answer is <unk> send things to india and china <unk> and so we 've tried that and i 'll go over that in a moment there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well <unk> one is a print on demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine we have one of these things now it 's completely <unk> 's all conveyor belt <unk> and it makes a book <unk> and it 's called the espresso book machine and in about ten minutes <unk> you can press a button and make a book something else i 'm quite excited about in this particular domain <unk> beyond these sort of kiosk y things where you can get books on demand is some of these new little screens that are coming out  <unk> and i don 't mean to to steal any thunder here <unk> but we 've gone and used one of these things to be an e book reader <unk> so here 's one of the beta units and you can it actually turns out to be a really <unk> we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it and it turns out that two hundred dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good at two hundred dots per inch <unk> it 's kind of the equivalent of a three hundred dot print laser printer we 're in good enough shape you actually can go and read scanned books <unk> well let 's try out this send books to india thing and there was a project with funded by the national science foundation sent a bunch of scanners and the american libraries were supposed to send books well they didn 't  they didn 't want to send their books so we bought one hundred thousand books and sent them to india and then we learned why you don 't want to send books to india <unk> the lesson we learned out of this is scan your own books <unk> if you really care about books <unk> you 're going to scan them better especially if they 're valuable books if they 're new books and you can just <unk> you know <unk> butcher them because you could just buy another one that 's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning <unk> but do things that you love <unk> but the indians have been scanning a lot of their own books about three hundred thousand now doing very <unk> did over a million and the egyptians are about thirty thousand <unk> but we sent thought <unk> ok if we 're going to need to do this <unk> let 's do it in library how do we go and do this and how do we get it down so that it 's a cost point that we could afford <unk> and we sort of picked the price point of ten cents a page if it 's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize ocr package it up make it so that you could download print and bind it the whole shebang we would have achieved something so we started out trying to figure out how do we <unk> get to ten cents and we tried these robot things and they worked pretty well sort of these <unk> auto page turning things if we can have mars rovers  you 'd think you could turn pages <unk> but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages and the volume isn 't there so anyway so we ended up making our own book scanner <unk> museum lighting so even if it 's a black and white book  you can go and get the proper intonation <unk> so you basically do a beautiful respectful job this is not a fax this is the idea is to do a beautiful job as you 're going through these libraries <unk> and we 've been able to achieve ten cents a page if we run things in volume this is what it looks like at the university of toronto <unk> and actually it turns out to <unk> a living wage people seem to love it <unk> yes it 's a little boring <unk> but some people kind of get into the zen of it  and especially if it 's kind of interesting books that you care about in languages that you can read we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this at getting ten cents a page <unk> so ten cents a page three hundred pages in your average book thirty dollars a book  the library <unk> of congress if you did the whole darn thing twenty six million books is about seven hundred and fifty million dollars right but a million books i think actually would be a pretty good start and that would cost thirty million dollars that 's not that big a bill and what we 've been able to do is get into libraries we 've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries and libraries are up for having their books scanned the getty here moving their books to the ucla which is where we have one these scanning centers and scanning their out of copyright books which is fabulous so we 're starting to get the institutional responsibility the thing we 're missing is the ten cents if we can get the ten cents  all the rest of it flows we 've scanned about two hundred thousand <unk> now we 're scanning about fifteen thousand books a month and it 's starting to to gear up another factor of two from there <unk> so all in all  that 's going very well <unk> and we 're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world <unk>  so i think of we 're kind of going from the out of copyright library stuff and amazon com is coming from the in print world <unk> <unk> and i think we 'll meet in the middle some place and have the classic thing that you have which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel <unk> and so we 're starting up a program to do out of print works but loaning them exactly what loaning means i 'm not quite sure <unk> but anyway loaning out of print works from the boston public library <unk> the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program to try out this model of where does a library stop <unk> and where does the bookstore take over so all in all it 's possible to do this in large scale we 're also going back over microfilm and getting that online so we can do ten cents a page we 're going fifteen thousand books a month and we 've got about two hundred and fifty thousand books online counting all the other projects that are starting to add <unk> so what i wanted to argue is <unk> books are within our grasp the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal yes it costs tens of millions <unk> low hundreds of millions <unk> but one time shot and we 've got basically the history of printed literature online <unk> and then there 's business model issues about how to try to effectively <unk> get it to people but it is within our grasp technologically and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online  now let 's go for audio and i 'm going to go through these so how much <unk> how much is there <unk> well as best we can tell there are about two to three million disks having been published so <unk> published materials we 've been able to sort of point at it costs about ten dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online if you 're doing things in volume <unk> but we 've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny this is a fairly heavily litigated area <unk>  so we 've found that there are niches in the music world that aren 't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system and we 've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net  in the united states it doesn 't cost you to give something away  right if you give something to a charity or to the public you get a pat on the back and a tax donation except on the net where you can go broke <unk> if you put up a video of your garage band and it starts getting heavily accessed <unk> you can lose your guitars or your house this <unk> doesn 't make any sense so we 've offered unlimited storage <unk> unlimited bandwidth forever for free  to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library <unk> and we 've been getting a lot of takers one is the rock ' n ' rollers  the rock ' n ' rollers had a tradition of sharing as long as nobody made any money you could concert recordings it 's not the commercial recordings but concert <unk> started by the grateful dead and we get about two or three bands a day signing up they give permission <unk> and we get about forty or fifty concerts a day we have about forty thousand concerts everything the grateful dead ever did  up on the net so that people can see it and listen to this material <unk> so audio is possible to put up but the rights issues are really pretty thorny we 've got a lot of collections now a couple hundred thousand items and it 's growing over time  moving images <unk> you think of theatrical releases there are not that many of them as best we can tell there are about one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand movies ever that are really meant for a large scale theatrical distribution <unk> it 's just not that many but half of those were indian but anyway it 's doable but we 've only found about a thousand of these things that to be out <unk> so we 've digitized those and made those available <unk> but we 've found that there 's lots of other types of movies that haven 't really seen the light of day archival films we 've found also a lot of political films a lot of amateur films all sorts of things that are are basically needing a home a permanent home so we 've been starting to make these available and it 's grown to be very popular we 're not quite a youtube we tended towards <unk> things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies which has just been great fun <unk> television comes quite a bit larger we started recording twenty channels of television twenty four hours a day it 's sort of the biggest tivo box you 've ever seen it 's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television russian chinese japanese iraqi al jazeera bbc cnn abc cbs nbc <unk> hours a day we only put one week up which is mostly for cost reasons which is the nine eleven sort of from nine eleven two thousand and one for one week what did the world see <unk>  cnn was saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets were they let 's look at the palestinian television and find out  how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past and television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable except by jon stewart who does a fabulous job <unk> so anyway television is i would suggest within our grasp <unk> so fifteen dollars per video hour and also about one hundred dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars per celluloid <unk> <unk> hour we 're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net <unk> and we 've got now a lot of these materials <unk> so we 've got about one hundred thousand pieces up there <unk> so books music video software there 's only fifty thousand titles of it mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections <unk> but we 've worked through some of those but we we 've still got real problems in washington well we 're best known as the world wide web we 've been archiving the world wide web since one thousand nine <unk> we take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it <unk> every two months <unk> and actually it 's really been pioneered by alexa internet which donates this collection to the internet archive and it 's been growing along for the last eleven years <unk> and it 's a fantastic resource and we 've made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were <unk> if you go and search on something this is <unk> the different versions of it that we have this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release and this is what it looked like at stanford so anyway you 've got basically an idea of where things came from mostly people want to see their old stuff out of this  if there 's one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one which is probably best known for burning <unk> don 't just have one copy <unk> so we 've started to we 've made another copy of of all of this and we actually put it back in the library of alexandria <unk> so this is a picture of the internet archive at the library of alexandria and we now have also another copy building up in amsterdam so  we should put it in the san andreas fault line in san francisco <unk>  flood zone in amsterdam <unk> the library of alexandria <unk> carved above their door
