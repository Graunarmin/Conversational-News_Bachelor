 <unk> come with me to the bottom of the world  antarctica  the highest <unk> driest <unk> windiest and yes coldest region on earth more arid than the sahara and in parts colder than mars  the ice of antarctica glows with a light so dazzling <unk> blinds the unprotected eye <unk> early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it  the weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level beneath its weight <unk> yet the ice of antarctica is a calendar of climate change <unk>  it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages <unk> nowhere on earth offers us such a perfect record  and here scientists are drilling into the past of our planet to find clues to the future of climate change  this past january i traveled to a place called wais divide about six hundred miles from the south pole <unk> it is the best place on the planet many say to study the history of climate change there about forty five scientists from the university of wisconsin the desert research institute in nevada and others have been working to answer a central question about global warming  <unk> what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary temperatures it 's urgent work we know that temperatures are rising this past may was the warmest worldwide on <unk> and we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too what we don 't know is the exact precise <unk> immediate impact of these changes on natural climate <unk> <unk> patterns winds ocean currents precipitation rates cloud formation things that bear on the health and well being of billions of people  <unk> from mcmurdo station the main u s supply base on the coast of antarctica <unk>  wais divide itself though is a circle of tents in the snow  in blizzard winds <unk> the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse <unk> it snows so heavily there the installation was <unk> the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here ten times faster than anywhere else in antarctica <unk> they have to dig themselves out every day  it makes for an exotic and chilly commute but under the surface is a hive of industrial activity centered around an eight million dollar <unk> like a biopsy needle plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and isotopes for analysis  ten times a day they extract the 10 foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow season after season for thousands of years <unk>  it 's really a time machine at the peak of activity <unk> this year <unk> the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another three hundred and sixty five years deeper into the past <unk>  periodically they remove a cylinder of ice like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell from the barrel of a drill <unk> they inspect it they check it for cracks for drill damage for spalls for chips  more importantly they prepare it for inspection and analysis by twenty seven independent laboratories in the united states and europe <unk> who will examine it for forty different trace chemicals related to climate  some in parts per quadrillion yes <unk> i said that with a q quadrillion <unk> they cut the cylinders up into three foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs <unk> some eight thousand miles from the drill site <unk>  each cylinder is a parfait of time  this ice formed as snow fifteen thousand eight hundred years ago <unk> when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint and considering the radical new technology of the alphabet <unk> bathed in polarized light and cut in cross section this ancient ice reveals itself as a mosaic of colors each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice have affected this material at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch  <unk> it begins with a snowflake and by digging into fresh snow we can see how this process is ongoing today  this wall of undisturbed snow back lit by sunlight <unk> shows the striations of winter and summer snow layer upon layer <unk>  each storm scours the atmosphere <unk> washing out dust <unk>  <unk> trace chemicals  and depositing them on the snow pack year after year millennia after millennia <unk>  creating a kind of periodic table of elements that at this point is more than eleven thousand feet thick  from this we can detect an extraordinary number of things we can see the calcium from the world 's deserts soot from <unk> as an indicator of the strength of a pacific monsoon all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes to this remote and very cold place  most importantly <unk>  these cylinders and this snow trap air <unk> each cylinder is about ten percent ancient air a pristine time capsule of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane <unk> nitrous oxide all unchanged from the day that snow formed and first fell and this is the object of their scrutiny <unk> but don 't we already know what we need to know about greenhouse gases why do we need to study this anymore don 't we already know how they affect temperatures don 't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization  the truth is we only know the outlines <unk> and what we don 't completely understand we can 't properly fix <unk> indeed we run the risk of making things worse <unk> consider <unk> the single most successful international <unk> <unk> environmental effort of the 20th century the montreal protocol in which the nations of earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of <unk> chemicals used at that time in air conditioners <unk> refrigerators and other cooling devices we banned those chemicals and we replaced them unknowingly  with other substances that molecule per molecule are a hundred times more potent as heat trapping greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide <unk>  this process requires extraordinary precautions <unk> the scientists must insure that the <unk> they have to insure this ice doesn 't melt <unk> imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics <unk>  they have to in fact make sure this ice never gets warmer than about twenty degrees below zero <unk> otherwise the key gases inside it will dissipate <unk> so in the coldest place on earth  they work inside a refrigerator  as they handle the ice in fact they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven <unk> that when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen they can don a fresh pair <unk> they work against the clock and against the thermometer  so far they 've packed up about four thousand five hundred feet of ice cores for shipment back to the united states this past season they manhandled them across the ice <unk> air national guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of antarctica where it was boarded onto a freighter <unk>  shipped across the tropics to california <unk> unloaded put on a truck driven across the desert to the national ice core laboratory in denver colorado where as we speak <unk> scientists are now slicing this material up for samples for analysis to be distributed to the around the country and in europe  antarctica was this planet 's last empty quarter the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world <unk>  early explorers sailed off the edge of the map  and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended  here ice seems a living presence <unk> the wind that rubs against it gives it voice <unk>  it is a voice of experience <unk> it is a voice we should heed <unk>
