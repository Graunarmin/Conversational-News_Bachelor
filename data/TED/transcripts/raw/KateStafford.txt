 <unk> a documentary by jacques cousteau won both the palme d <unk> 'or and an oscar award this film was called le monde du silence or the silent <unk> the premise of the title was that the underwater world was a quiet world  we now know sixty years later that the underwater world is anything but silent <unk> although the sounds are inaudible above water depending on where you are and the time of year the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or <unk> and marine mammals all use sound  they use sound to study their habitat to keep in communication with each other to navigate to detect predators and prey they also use sound by listening to know something about their environment take for an example the arctic <unk> it 's considered a vast inhospitable place sometimes described as a desert <unk>  because it is so cold and so remote and ice covered for much of the year <unk>  and despite this  there is no place on earth that i would rather be than the arctic <unk> especially as days lengthen and spring comes to me the arctic really <unk> embodies this disconnect between what we see on the surface and what 's going on underwater you can look out across the ice all white and blue and cold and see nothing but if you could hear underwater the sounds you would hear would at first amaze and then delight you  and while your eyes are seeing nothing for kilometers but ice <unk> your ears are telling you that out there <unk> there are bowhead and beluga whales <unk> walrus and bearded seals  the ice too makes sounds it screeches and cracks and pops and groans as it collides and rubs when temperature or currents or winds change and under one hundred percent sea ice in the dead of winter bowhead whales are singing and you would never expect that because we humans we tend to be very visual animals for most of us <unk> but not all  our sense of sight is how we navigate our world  for marine mammals that live underwater <unk> where chemical cues and light transmit poorly sound is the sense by which they see and sound transmits very well underwater much better than it does in air so signals can be heard over great distances in the arctic <unk> this is especially important because not only do arctic marine mammals have to hear each other <unk>  but they also have to listen for cues in the environment that might indicate heavy ice ahead or open water <unk>  remember <unk> although they spend most of their <unk> lives underwater they are mammals and so they have to surface to breathe <unk>  so they might listen for thin ice or no ice or listen for echoes off nearby ice arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape in the <unk> but when the ice is frozen solid <unk> and there are no big temperature shifts or current changes  the underwater arctic has some of the lowest ambient noise levels of the world 's oceans <unk>  but this is changing this is primarily due to a decrease in seasonal sea ice <unk>  which is a direct result of human greenhouse gas emissions <unk>  we are in effect with climate change <unk> conducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet  over the past thirty years areas of the arctic have seen decreases <unk> in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks to four months <unk> this decrease in sea ice is sometimes referred to as an increase in the open water season that is the time of year when the arctic is navigable to vessels <unk>  and not only is the extent of ice changing <unk>  but the age and the width of ice is <unk> now you may well have heard that a decrease in seasonal sea ice is causing a loss of habitat for animals that rely on sea ice <unk>  such as ice seals or walrus or polar bears <unk>  decreasing sea ice is also causing increased erosion along coastal villages <unk> and changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals  climate change and decreases in sea ice are also altering the underwater soundscape of the arctic what do i mean by soundscape <unk>  those of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living use instruments called hydrophones which are underwater microphones <unk>  and we record ambient noise the noise all around us and the soundscape describes the different contributors to this noise field <unk> we are hearing on our hydrophones are the very real sounds of climate change we are hearing these changes from three fronts  from the air from the water and from land <unk> first air <unk> wind on water creates waves  these waves make bubbles the bubbles break  and when they do they make noise and this noise is like a hiss or a static in the background in the arctic <unk> when it 's ice covered most of the noise from wind doesn 't make it into the water column <unk> because the ice acts as a buffer between the atmosphere and the water this is one of the reasons that the arctic can have very low ambient noise levels but with decreases in seasonal sea ice <unk> not only is the arctic now open to this wave noise <unk> but the number of storms and the intensity of storms in the arctic has been increasing  all of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean second water  with less seasonal sea ice <unk> subarctic species are <unk> moving north <unk> and taking advantage of the new habitat that is created by more open water  now arctic whales like this bowhead  they have no dorsal fin because they have evolved to live and swim in ice covered waters <unk>  and having something sticking off of your back is not very conducive to migrating through ice <unk>  and may in fact be excluding animals from the ice but now <unk> everywhere we 've listened we 're hearing the sounds of fin whales and humpback whales and killer whales <unk>  further and further north <unk>  and later and later in the season <unk>  we are hearing in essence an invasion of the arctic by subarctic species <unk>  and we don 't know what this means <unk> will there be competition for food between arctic and subarctic animals  might these subarctic species introduce diseases or parasites into the arctic  and what are the new sounds that they are producing doing to the soundscape underwater <unk>  and third land <unk> and by land <unk> i mean people  more open water means increased human use of the arctic <unk>  just this past summer a massive <unk> cruise ship made its way through the northwest passage the once mythical route between europe and the pacific decreases in sea ice have allowed humans to occupy the arctic more often  it has allowed increases in oil and gas exploration and extraction <unk> the potential for commercial shipping  as well as increased tourism <unk> and we now know that ship noise increases levels of stress hormones in whales and can disrupt feeding behavior  air guns which produce loud every ten to twenty seconds <unk> changed the swimming and vocal behavior of whales  and all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space <unk> which arctic marine mammals can communicate  now  arctic marine mammals are used to very high levels of noise at certain times of the year <unk>  but this is primarily from other animals or from sea ice <unk>  and these are the sounds with which they 've evolved <unk> and these are sounds that are vital to their very survival  these new sounds are loud and they 're alien <unk> impact the environment in ways that we think we understand but also in ways that we don 't <unk>  remember  sound is the most important sense for these animals <unk> and not only is the physical habitat of the arctic changing rapidly <unk> but the acoustic habitat is <unk> it 's as if we 've plucked these animals up from the quiet countryside and dropped them into a big city in the middle of rush hour and they can 't escape it  so what can we do now <unk>  we can 't decrease wind speeds or keep subarctic animals from migrating north <unk>  but we can work on local solutions to reducing human caused underwater <unk> one of these solutions is to slow down ships that traverse the arctic <unk> because a slower ship is a quieter ship we can restrict access in seasons and regions that are important for mating or feeding or migrating we can get smarter about quieting ships and find better ways to explore the ocean <unk> and the good news is there are people working on this right now <unk>  but ultimately we humans have to do the hard work of reversing or at the very least decelerating human caused atmospheric changes <unk> so let 's return to this idea of a silent world underwater it 's entirely possible that many of the whales swimming in the arctic today <unk> especially long lived species like the bowhead whale that the inuits say can live two human lives it 's possible that these whales were alive in <unk> when jacques cousteau made his film and in retrospect <unk> considering all the noise we are creating in the oceans today <unk>  perhaps it really was the silent world
