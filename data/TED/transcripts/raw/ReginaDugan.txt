 <unk> you should be nice to nerds <unk> in fact <unk> i 'd go so far as to say if you don 't already have a nerd in your life you should get one <unk> i 'm just saying <unk> scientists and engineers change the world i 'd like to tell you about a magical place called darpa where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure <unk>  now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize <unk> because when you remove the fear of <unk> impossible things suddenly become possible  if you want to know how ask yourself this question  what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail <unk>  if you really ask yourself this question <unk> you can 't help but feel uncomfortable  i feel a little uncomfortable  because when you ask it you begin to <unk> understand how the fear of failure constrains you <unk> how it keeps us from attempting great things  and life gets dull  amazing things stop happening <unk> sure <unk> good things happen but amazing things stop happening <unk>  now i should be clear <unk> 'm not encouraging failure <unk> i 'm discouraging fear of failure <unk>  because it 's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new <unk> things always has failure along the way we 're tested <unk> and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving <unk> something great  clemenceau said life gets interesting when we fail <unk> because it 's a sign that we 've surpassed ourselves <unk> expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in ten million years we could build an aircraft that would fly <unk> and two months later on december <unk> orville wright powered the first airplane across a beach in north carolina the flight lasted twelve seconds and covered <unk> one year later the next declarations of impossibilities began ferdinand foch a french army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army  said airplanes are interesting toys <unk> but of no military value  forty years later <unk> aero experts coined the term <unk> transonic <unk> they debated should it have one s or two  you see <unk> they were having trouble in this flight regime <unk> and it wasn 't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in one thousand nine <unk> there was no wind tunnel data beyond mach <unk> chuck yeager climbed into the cockpit of his bell x 1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility <unk>  and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound six of eight atlas rockets blew up on the pad <unk>  after eleven complete mission failures we got our first images from space <unk> and on that first flight we got more data than in all u 2 missions combined <unk>  it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther  and to do so we 've had to believe in impossible things and we 've had to refuse to fear failure <unk>  that 's still true today <unk> we don 't talk about flying transonically <unk> or even supersonically <unk> we talk about flying hypersonically not mach two or mach three mach twenty  at mach twenty we can fly from new york to long beach in eleven minutes and twenty seconds  at that speed <unk> the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel three thousand five hundred degrees <unk> fahrenheit like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it  and we are flying it or trying to  darpa 's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built <unk> it 's boosted <unk> the minotaur iv has too much impulse <unk> so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an eighty nine degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory  that 's an unnatural act for a rocket  the third stage has a camera <unk> we call it rocketcam <unk> and it 's pointed at the hypersonic glider  this is the actual <unk> rocketcam footage from flight one <unk>  now to conceal the shape we changed the aspect ratio a little bit <unk> but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider <unk> as it heads into the atmosphere back towards earth <unk>  but we collected more hypersonic flight data than in thirty years of ground based testing combined <unk> and in the second flight  three minutes of <unk> aerodynamic flight at mach twenty <unk> we must fly <unk> require that you fly <unk> you can 't learn to fly at mach twenty unless you fly <unk>  and while there 's no substitute for speed <unk> maneuverability is a very close second  if a mach twenty glider takes eleven minutes and twenty seconds to get from new york to long <unk> a hummingbird would take well days you see hummingbirds are not hypersonic but they are maneuverable in fact <unk>  the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards <unk> it can fly up down <unk> forwards <unk> backwards <unk> even and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can 't go we 'd need an aircraft small <unk> enough and maneuverable enough to do so  this is a hummingbird drone <unk>  it can fly in all directions <unk> even backwards <unk> it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera <unk> it weighs <unk> it does not eat nectar in two thousand and eight it flew for a whopping twenty seconds a year later two minutes then six eventually eleven  many prototypes crashed many <unk> but there 's no way to learn to fly like a <unk> matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot  failure is part of creating <unk> new and amazing things <unk> we cannot both fear failure <unk> or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human  or perhaps spider man will one day be gecko man  a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square millimeter of a gecko 's footpad has fourteen thousand hair like structures called setae <unk> they are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces <unk>  today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko 's foot the result <unk> can support a static load of six hundred and sixty pounds <unk>  that 's enough to stick six 42 inch plasma tv 's to your wall no nails  so much for velcro <unk> right <unk> and it 's not just passive structures it 's entire <unk> is a spider mite <unk> it 's one millimeter long but it looks like godzilla next to these micromachines  in the world of godzilla spider mites we can make millions of mirrors <unk> each one fifth the diameter of a human hair <unk> moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays <unk> so that we can watch movies like and if we can build machines at that scale <unk> what about eiffel tower like trusses at the microscale <unk>  today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam  so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an suv  from the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature 's storms  there are forty four lightning strikes per second around the globe <unk> each <unk> lightning bolt heats the air to forty four thousand degrees fahrenheit hotter than the surface of the sun what if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons <unk>  beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters <unk>  experiments suggest that lightning could be the next gps <unk>  electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains <unk> using a grid the size of your thumb with thirty two electrodes on the surface of his brain tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm <unk> and his thoughts made him reach for katie this is the first time a human has controlled a robot with <unk> thought alone <unk> and it is the first time that tim has held katie 's hand in seven years  that moment mattered to tim and katie  and this green goo may someday matter to you <unk> this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months <unk>  and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever <unk> and if it seems far fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can 't solve  <unk> september <unk> the gamers of foldit solved the <unk> three dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to aids in rhesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments  for fifteen years it was unsolved <unk> in the scientific community <unk> the gamers of foldit solved it in fifteen days <unk>  now they were able to do so by working together they were able to work together because they 're connected by the internet <unk> and others <unk> also connected to the internet used it as an instrument of democracy <unk>  <unk> people or thirty percent of the world 's population <unk> it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals <unk> it allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group <unk> but it too <unk> the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper  and then on october 29th the first <unk> packet switched message was sent from <unk> ucla to sri the first two letters of the word login  that 's all that made it through an l and an o and then a buffer overflow crashed the system <unk> o now a worldwide force  so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa  they are nerds <unk>  and they are heroes among us  they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure <unk> they remind us that we all have nerd power <unk> sometimes we just forget <unk>  <unk> there was a time when you weren 't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut <unk> an adventurer jacques cousteau you could jump higher run faster kick harder than anyone <unk> you believed in impossible things and you were fearless <unk> <unk> you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and engineers can indeed change the world so can you <unk> you were born to  so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail <unk> now i want to say <unk> this is not easy <unk> it 's hard <unk> to hold onto this feeling really hard i guess in some way i sort of believe it 's supposed to be hard  doubt and fear always creep in we think someone else someone smarter than us someone more capable <unk> someone with more resources will solve that problem <unk> but there isn 't anyone else <unk>  there 's just you <unk>  and if we 're lucky <unk> in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says  let me help you believe  jason harley did that for me <unk> jason started at darpa on march 18th two thousand and ten he with our transportation team  i saw jason nearly every day sometimes twice a day and more so than most he saw the highs and the lows <unk> the celebrations and the disappointments <unk>  and on one particularly dark day for me <unk> jason sat down and he wrote an email  <unk> and when he hit send <unk> he probably didn 't realize what a difference it would make it mattered to me <unk> in that moment and still today when i doubt when i feel afraid  when i need to reconnect <unk> i remember his words <unk> they were so powerful <unk> there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you  and remember be nice to nerds <unk> what happened on that second flight yeah it also went into the pacific  we didn 't fly it into the pacific  no there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed <unk> and so in the second flight <unk> we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it ca i imagine you 're not planning to open up to passenger service from new york to long beach anytime soon rd it might be a little warm ca  what do you picture that glider being used for rd  well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it 's ultimately used will be determined by the <unk> the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than sixty minutes ca  and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds like what 's the payload it could carry rd  well i don 't think we ultimately know what it will be right we 've got to fly it first ca but not necessarily just a camera <unk>  <unk> you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly <unk> and there haven 't been that many planes built since that flap why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird isn 't that a very expensive <unk> solution for a small maneuverable flying object rd so i mean <unk> in part <unk> we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time  the folks at aerovironment tried three hundred or more different wing designs twelve different forms of the avionics <unk> took them ten full prototypes to get something that would actually fly <unk> but there 's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something <unk> you 'd recognize <unk> so we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing <unk> but when things looks just natural you also don 't see them <unk> my headquarters  because i think as well as the awe of looking at that i 'm sure some people here are thinking <unk> technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the white house i mean do you worry about the pandora 's box issue here <unk> singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise <unk> that 's what we do  it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn 't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time  it 's just the nature of what we do <unk> now our responsibility is to push that edge and we have to be of <unk> course mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used but we can 't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn 't advancing <unk> it 's advancing ca i mean you 're clearly a really inspiring leader and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal <unk> can 't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team 's brilliance rd  sure <unk> i think you couldn 't be human if you didn 't ask those questions ca how do you answer them rd  well i don 't always have answers for them <unk> right <unk> i think that <unk> my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have i work with some of the most amazing people and with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility <unk>  and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of <unk> thank you so much for coming to
