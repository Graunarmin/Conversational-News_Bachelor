 <unk> all buildings today have something in common  they 're made using victorian technologies <unk>  this involves blueprints industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers  all of this effort results in an inert object and that means that there is a one way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities this is not sustainable  i believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature not insulating them from it  <unk> in order to do this we need the right kind of language  living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism <unk>  and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another <unk> either through the production or the absorption of energy <unk> and this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way <unk> so i 'm interested in the use <unk> of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture <unk>  but they don 't exist so i 'm having to make them  i 'm working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture <unk>  and we 're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach that means we 're generating them from scratch  one of our collaborators is chemist martin hanczyc <unk> and he 's really interested <unk> in the transition from inert to living matter now that 's exactly the kind of process that i 'm interested in when we 're thinking about sustainable materials <unk>  so <unk> martin he works with a system called the protocell now all this is and it 's magic is a little fatty bag <unk> and it 's got a chemical battery in it and it has no dna <unk>  this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living  it is able to move around its environment  it can follow chemical gradients it can undergo complex reactions some of which are happily architectural  so here we are these are protocells patterning their environment <unk> we don 't know how they do that yet <unk> this is a protocell and it 's vigorously shedding this skin now this looks like a chemical kind of birth <unk> this is a violent process  here we 've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate <unk> and that 's the shell around that globular fat they are quite brittle so you 've only got a part of one there so what we 're trying to do is we 're trying to push these technologies <unk> construction approaches for architecture which contrast the current victorian top down methods which impose structure upon matter  that can 't be energetically sensible  so bottom up materials actually exist today <unk> they 've been in use <unk> in architecture since ancient times if you walk around the city of oxford where we are today <unk> and have a look at the brickwork which <unk> i 've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days you 'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone <unk> and if you look even closer you 'll see in that limestone there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other and then they are fossilized over millions of years  now a block of limestone in itself isn 't particularly that interesting it looks beautiful <unk> but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere maybe they could extract carbon dioxide  would it give this block of limestone new properties well most likely it would it might be able to grow it might be able to self repair and even respond to dramatic changes in the in the immediate environment <unk>  so <unk> architects are never happy with just one block of an <unk> when we think about scaling up metabolic materials we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water  so one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice <unk> now venice as you know has a tempestuous relationship with the sea and is built upon <unk> so we 've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we 're working with to sustainably reclaim venice <unk>  and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city  so here is the technology we have today <unk> this is our protocell technology effectively making a shell like its limestone forefathers and depositing it in a very complex environment <unk> against natural materials we 're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this  now this is the very interesting part we don 't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals what we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles <unk> so you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light <unk> the dark foundations we 've observed this in the laboratory the protocells can actually move away from the light they can actually also move towards the light you have to just choose your species so that these don 't just exist as one entity <unk> we kind of chemically engineer them and so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically around the foundations of venice effectively petrifying it <unk>  now <unk> this isn 't going to happen <unk> 's going to take a while it 's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case by case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of venice <unk>  but gradually as the buildings are repaired we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city an accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide <unk>  also it will attract the <unk> who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture  so this is really interesting now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way <unk>  but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere <unk> this is terrestrial chemistry we 've all got it which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for first world countries  so in summary i 'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies and building architectures from a
