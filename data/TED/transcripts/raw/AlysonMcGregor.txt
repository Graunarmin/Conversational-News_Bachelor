 <unk> we all go to doctors <unk> and we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they 're prescribing are based upon evidence evidence that 's designed <unk> to help us however the reality is that that hasn 't always been the case for everyone <unk>  what if i told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population  i 'm an emergency medicine doctor i was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency <unk> it 's about saving lives how cool is that  ok there 's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes but no matter who walks through the door to the er  we order the same tests  we prescribe the same medication without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients  why would we we were never taught <unk> that there were any differences between men and women a recent government accountability study revealed that eighty percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market are due to side effects on women so let 's think about that for a minute why are we discovering side effects on women only after a drug has been released to the market do you know that it takes <unk> years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory to animal studies  to then clinical trials on humans <unk> finally to go through a regulatory approval process to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you  not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes <unk> to go through that process <unk>  so why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through  what 's happening well it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory <unk> they 're male cells <unk> and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals <unk> and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men <unk>  how is it that the male model became our framework for medical research  let 's look at an example that has been popularized in the media <unk> and it has to do with the sleep aid ambien  ambien was released on the market over twenty years ago  and since then of millions of prescriptions have been written primarily to women because women suffer more sleep disorders than men <unk>  but just this past year the food and drug administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only  because they just realized that women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men <unk> causing them to wake up in <unk> morning with more of the active drug in their system <unk>  and then they 're drowsy and they 're getting behind the wheel of the car <unk> and they 're at risk for motor vehicle accidents and i can 't help but think as an emergency physician how many of my patients that i 've cared for over the years <unk> were involved in a motor vehicle accident that possibly could have been prevented if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon twenty years ago when this drug was first released  how many other things need to be analyzed by gender what else are we missing  <unk> a lot of things <unk> and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent  so some much needed guidelines or rules were set into place <unk> and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age from entering into any medical research studies <unk>  there was fear <unk> what if something happened to the fetus during the study <unk> who would be responsible <unk>  and so the scientists at this time actually thought this was a blessing in disguise <unk> because let 's face it men 's bodies are pretty homogeneous  they don 't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men  it was easier <unk> it was cheaper <unk> not to mention at this time there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way  apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones  so it was decided  medical research was performed on men and the results were later applied to women  what did this do <unk> to the notion of women 's health  women 's health became synonymous with reproduction <unk>  breasts ovaries uterus pregnancy <unk>  it 's this term we now refer to as bikini medicine  and this stayed this way until about the 1980s when this concept was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies we actually did them a disservice  in that apart from reproductive issues <unk> virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient  since that time an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way you know  we have this saying in medicine  children are not just little adults <unk>  and we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults <unk> because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light <unk> and we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives  and i know the same thing can be said about women women are not just men with boobs and tubes <unk> they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity  let 's take the cardiovascular system for example  this area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks  heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women  but more women die within the <unk> first year of having a heart attack than men  men will complain of crushing chest pain an elephant is sitting on their chest and we call this typical  women have chest pain too but more women <unk> can 't seem to get enough air in just so tired lately  and for some reason we call this atypical even though as i mentioned women do make up half the population <unk>  and so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these <unk> if we look at the anatomy the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different in women compared to men  and the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack well they were initially designed <unk> tested and perfected in men and so aren 't as good at determining that in women  and then if we think about the medications common medications that we use like aspirin  we give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack <unk>  but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman it 's actually harmful  what this is doing is merely telling us that <unk> we are scratching the surface emergency medicine is a fast paced business in how many <unk> areas of medicine like cancer and stroke  are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing  or even why is it that some people get those <unk> runny noses more than others or why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes work in some and not in others  the institute of medicine has said every cell has a sex  what does this mean sex is dna <unk> gender is how someone presents themselves in society <unk>  and these two may not always match up as we can see with our transgendered population <unk>  but it 's important to realize that from the moment of conception  every cell in our bodies skin <unk> hair heart and lungs contains our own unique dna <unk> and that dna contains the chromosomes that determine whether we become male or female man or woman <unk> it used to be thought that those <unk> <unk> chromosomes pictured here xy if you 're male xx if you 're female merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes <unk> and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex <unk>  but we now know that that theory was wrong or it 's at least a little incomplete <unk> and thankfully scientists like dr page from the whitehead institute  who works on the y chromosome and doctor yang from ucla they have found evidence that tells us that those sex determining chromosomes that are in every cell in our bodies continue to remain active for our entire lives and could be what 's responsible for the differences we see in the dosing of drugs or why there are differences between men and women in the susceptibility and severity of diseases  this new knowledge is the game changer and it 's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence but it 's up to the clinicians to start translating this data <unk> of a national organization called sex and gender women 's health collaborative <unk> and we collect all of this data so that it 's available for teaching and for patient care <unk> and we 're working to bring together the medical educators to the <unk> 's a big job <unk> it 's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception <unk>  but i believe in them i know they 're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens into the current curriculum it 's about training the future health <unk> of a division within the department of emergency medicine here at brown university called sex and gender in emergency medicine and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women in emergent conditions <unk>  like heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse <unk> but we also believe that education is <unk> paramount <unk> we 've created a <unk> <unk> 360 degree model of education we have programs for the doctors for the nurses for the students and for the patients <unk> because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders  we all have a role in making a difference <unk>  but i must warn you this is not easy in fact it 's hard <unk>  it 's essentially changing the way we think about medicine and health and research it 's changing our relationship to the health care system <unk> but there 's no going back we now know just <unk> enough to know that we weren 't doing it right <unk>  martin luther king jr has said change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability <unk>  but comes through continuous struggle  and the first step towards change is awareness this is not just about improving medical care for women this is about personalized individualized health care for everyone  this awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women  and from now on i want you to ask your doctors whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender they may not know the answer yet <unk> but the conversation has begun and together we can all learn <unk> remember for me and my colleagues in this field your sex and gender matter thank you
