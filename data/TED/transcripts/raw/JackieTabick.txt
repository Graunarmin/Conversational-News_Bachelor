 <unk> one of my favorite cartoon characters is snoopy <unk>  i love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life <unk>  so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he 's lying there and he says  i really understand <unk> and i really appreciate how one should love one 's neighbor as one love 's oneself <unk>  the only trouble is the people next door i can 't stand them this in a way is <unk> of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea we all i think believe in compassion if you look at all the world religions all the main world religions you 'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion <unk> so in judaism we have from our torah that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself and within jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings <unk> have hillel who taught that you shouldn 't do to others what you don 't like being done to yourself  and all the main religions have similar teachings <unk>  and again within judaism <unk> we have a teaching about god <unk> who is called the compassionate one ha rachaman  after all how could the world exist without god being compassionate  and we as <unk> taught within the torah that we are made in the image of god <unk> so we too have to be compassionate <unk>  but what does it mean how does it impact on our everyday life sometimes of course being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are <unk> i know there are many times when i 've gone and conducted a funeral <unk> or when i have been sitting with the bereaved <unk> or with people who are dying <unk>  and i am overwhelmed by the sadness by the difficulty the challenge that is there for the family for the person <unk> and i 'm touched <unk> so that <unk> tears come to my eyes  and yet <unk> if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings i wouldn 't be doing my job because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to <unk> and yet on the other hand if i didn 't feel this compassion then i feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi and these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world who <unk> be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war <unk> famine <unk> or earthquakes <unk> or tsunamis <unk>  i know some people who say well <unk> you know there 's just so much out there i can 't do anything i 'm not going to even begin to try  and there are some charity workers who call this compassion <unk> there are others who feel they can 't confront compassion anymore <unk> and so they turn off the television and don 't watch  in judaism though we tend to always say <unk> there has to be a middle way  you have to of course be aware of the needs of <unk> but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people so part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick and of course you can 't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more and there 's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation <unk> which says that when <unk> god created the world <unk> god thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice <unk>  because after all god is just therefore there should be justice throughout the world <unk>  and then god looked to the future and realized if the world was created just with justice <unk> world couldn 't exist so god thought nope i 'm going to create the world just with compassion and then god looked to the future and realized that in fact if the world were just filled with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos there had to be limits to all things <unk> the rabbis describe <unk> this as being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass bowl  if you put too much cold water in it will shatter if you put boiling water in it will shatter <unk> what do you have to do put in a mixture of the two <unk>  and so god put both of these possibilities into the world there is something more though that has to be there and that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world into action so like <unk> just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors we actually have to do something about it <unk>  and so there is also within judaism this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important chesed  all these three things then have to be melded together <unk> the idea of justice <unk> which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of of what 's right about life what 's right about living <unk> what should we be doing <unk> social justice  there has to be a willingness to do good deeds <unk>  but not of course at the expense of our own sanity <unk> you know there 's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things and balancing <unk> them all in the middle is this notion of compassion <unk> which has to be there if you like at our very roots  this idea of compassion comes to us because we 're made in the image of god <unk> who is ultimately the compassionate one  what does this compassion entail it entails understanding the pain of the other but even more than that it means understanding one 's connection to the whole of creation understanding that one is part of that creation <unk> that there is a unity that underlies all that we see  all that we hear <unk> that we feel i call that unity god <unk> and that that unity is something that connects all of creation and of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we 're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things <unk> that something i do here <unk> that if i use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern africa <unk>  so there is a connectivity <unk> and i have to understand that as part of the creation <unk> as part of me being made in the image of god <unk> and i have to understand <unk> understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs this eighteen minutes business <unk> i find quite fascinating  because in judaism <unk> the number eighteen in hebrew letters <unk> stands for life the word in life <unk> this is what 's important in terms of compassion but something else as well  actually eighteen minutes is important because at passover when we have to eat unleavened bread the rabbis say what is the difference between dough that is made into bread and dough that is made into unleavened bread <unk> that 's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven <unk>  what does it mean dough becomes leaven it means it gets filled with hot air  what 's matzah what 's unleavened bread <unk> you don 't get it <unk>  symbolically <unk> what the rabbis say is that at passover <unk> what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air our pride <unk> pride our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve round us  so we try and get rid of those and so doing try to get rid of the habits the emotions the ideas that enslave <unk> that make our eyes closed <unk> give us tunnel vision so we don 't see the needs of others and free ourselves and free ourselves from that and that too is a basis for having compassion for understanding our place in the world <unk>  now there is  <unk> gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day  and as many people do he was dozing off during the sermon  and as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of leviticus in the torah <unk> and they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in jerusalem the priests used to have bread <unk> used to place into a special table in the temple in jerusalem <unk>  the man was asleep <unk> but he heard the words bread <unk> temple god <unk> and he woke up he said god wants bread that 's it god wants bread i know what god wants and he rushed <unk> after the sabbath he made twelve loaves of bread <unk>  took them to the synagogue went into the synagogue <unk>  opened the ark and said god i don 't know why you want this bread but here you are and he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the torah  then he went home <unk>  the cleaner came into the synagogue <unk> goes to the ark he opens the ark there 's bread <unk> god you 've answered my plea you 've answered my question  takes the bread and goes home <unk>  meanwhile the rich man thinks to himself <unk> who rules the entire universe wants my bread he rushes to the synagogue i 'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it he goes in there and it 's not there  and he says god you really did want it you wanted my bread <unk> next week with raisins  this went on for years <unk>  <unk> the man would bring bread with raisins with all sorts of good things put it into the ark <unk>  every week the cleaner would come god you 've answered my plea again take the bread <unk> take it home <unk> went on until a new rabbi came rabbis always spoil things the rabbi came in and saw what was going on and he called the two of them to his office <unk> and he said you know this is what 's happening  <unk> you mean god didn 't want my bread and the poor man said and you mean god didn 't answer my pleas and the rabbi said you 've misunderstood me you 've misunderstood totally he said of course <unk> what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering god 's plea that we should be compassionate  and god he said to the poor man is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give he looked at the rich man he held the rich man 's hands and said don 't you understand he <unk> so that is the way i feel that i can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate  of understanding that there is a connectivity that there is a unity in this world that i want to try and serve that unity <unk>  and that i can try and do that by understanding i hope <unk> trying to understand something of the pain of others <unk>  but understanding that there are limits that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them and that i have to understand that there are limits to my energy to the giving i can give i have to reevaluate them try and separate out the the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me <unk> so that i can see the world clearly
