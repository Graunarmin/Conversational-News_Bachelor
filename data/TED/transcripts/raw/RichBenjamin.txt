 <unk> imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name  a place with splendid vistas a place where you can drive just twenty minutes and put your sailboat on the water it 's a seductive place <unk> place isn 't it i don 't live there <unk> has posted at least six percent population growth since two thousand  secondly <unk> the majority of that growth comes from white migrants <unk>  and third the whitopia has an ineffable charm a pleasant look and feel  <unk> are ticking i immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them <unk> 1850s brigham young dispatched families to st george to grow cotton because of the hot arid climate <unk> and so they called it utah 's dixie <unk>  and the name sticks to this day <unk>  i approached my time in each whitopia like an anthropologist i made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities <unk> who i needed to meet where i needed to be  and i threw myself with gusto in these communities <unk> i went to zoning board meetings i went to democratic clubs and republican clubs  i went to poker nights  in st george i rented a home at the entrada one of the town 's premier gated communities there were no motel six 's or howard johnsons for me i lived in whitopia as a resident and not like a visitor <unk>  i rented myself this home by phone <unk> i went on my journey i had barely ever held a golf club  by the time i left <unk> i was golfing at least three times a week  golf helps people bond <unk> some of the best interviews i ever scored during my trip were on <unk> golf courses one venture capitalist for example invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members <unk> i also went fishing  because i had never fished this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use <unk>  i also played poker every <unk> my poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew but they weren 't bluffing about their social beliefs <unk> some of the most raw salty conversations i ever had during my journey were at the poker table <unk>  i 'm a gung ho entertainer <unk>  i love to cook i hosted many <unk> and in return people invited me to their dinner parties <unk> and to their barbecues and to their pool parties and to their birthday parties <unk>  but it wasn 't all fun  immigration turned out to be a big issue in this whitopia  the st george 's citizens council on illegal immigration held regular and active protests against immigration and so what i gleaned from this <unk> debate this would become it was a real time preview <unk> and so it has become  next stop <unk> almost heaven  a cabin i rented for myself in coeur d <unk> 'alene in the beautiful north idaho panhandle <unk>  i rented this place for myself also by phone  <unk> a thousand places to see before you die lists coeur d <unk> 'alene it 's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen boatmen and fishermen  my growing golf skills came in handy in coeur d 'alene i golfed with retired lapd cops in one thousand nine <unk> around eleven thousand families and cops <unk> racial unrest for north idaho <unk> and they 've built an expatriated community <unk>  given the conservatism of these cops there 's no surprise that north idaho has a strong gun culture <unk> in fact it is said north idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations  so what 's a resident to do <unk> to fit in  i hit the gun club  when i rented a gun the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind <unk>  until i showed him my new york city driver 's license  that 's when he got nervous i 'm not as bad a shot as i thought i might have been  what i learned from north idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around  in north idaho <unk> in my red pickup truck i kept a notepad <unk> and in that notepad i counted more confederate flags than black people  in north idaho <unk> i found confederate flags on key chains  on cellphone paraphernalia and on cars  about a seven minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of aryan nations the white supremacist group  america 's promise <unk> <unk> during my visit so i decided to crash it i 'm the only non aryan journalist i 'm aware of ever to have done so  among the many memorable episodes of that retreat is when abe <unk> sidled up next to me he slapped my knee and he said hey rich i just want you to know one thing <unk>  we are not white supremacists we are white separatists <unk> we don 't think we 're better than you we just want to be away from you <unk> fact they 're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all <unk> rather they emigrate there for friendliness <unk> comfort security safety reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself next stop was georgia <unk>  in georgia <unk> i stayed in an exurb north of atlanta <unk> in utah i found poker in idaho i found guns <unk> in georgia i found god  the way that i immersed myself in this whitopia was to become active at first redeemer church a megachurch that 's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus <unk> i was active in the youth ministry and for me personally <unk>  i was more comfortable in this whitopia than say in a colorado or an idaho <unk> or even a suburban boston  that is because [ there ] in georgia <unk> white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another <unk> i was less <unk> at the level of conscious and unconscious bias it 's possible <unk> not for racist reasons though it has racist outcomes  many whitopians feel pushed by illegals social welfare abuse <unk> how a country can have racism without racists  many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn 't believe i would go on such a venture <unk>  the reality is that many white americans <unk> interpersonal race relations how we treat each other as human beings are vastly better than in my parents ' generation  can you imagine me going to whitopia forty years ago what a journey that would have been  and yet some things haven 't changed america is as <unk> <unk> and seventy  as americans we often find ways to cook for each other  to dance with each other to host with each other <unk>  but why can 't that translate into how we treat each other as communities it 's a devastating irony  how we have gone forward as individuals as communities <unk>  one of the whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying one black man is a delightful dinner guest <unk> fifty black men is a ghetto  <unk> white people will no longer be the american majority as such will there be more <unk> in looking at this <unk> the danger of whitopia is that the more segregation we have the less we <unk> look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias <unk>  i ventured on my <unk> thousand mile journey to learn where why and how white people are fleeing but i didn 't expect to have so much fun on my <unk> i didn 't expect to learn so much about myself <unk>  i don 't expect i 'll be living in a <unk> whitopia or a blacktopia for that matter  i do plan to continue golfing every chance i get  and i 'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches
