 <unk> the following are my opinions and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor 's office  i am a prosecutor <unk> i believe in law and order i am the adopted son of a police officer a marine and a hairdresser <unk> i believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities <unk>  i love my job and the people that do it <unk>  i just think that it 's our responsibility to do it better  by a show of hands <unk>  how many of you by the age of twenty five had either acted up in school <unk> went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of <unk> drank alcohol before your legal age all right  how many of you shoplifted <unk> tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight yes even with a sibling  now how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions <unk> how many of you sitting here today think that you 're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion laughter point taken <unk>  when we talk about criminal justice reform we often focus on a <unk> and that 's what i want to talk to you about today <unk> but first i 'm going to since you shared with me i 'm going to give you a confession on my part i went to law school to make money <unk>  i had no interest in being a public servant i had no interest in criminal law and i definitely didn 't think that i would ever be a prosecutor near the end of my first year of law school i got an internship in the roxbury division of boston municipal court <unk> i knew of roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in boston plagued by gun violence and drug crime  my life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship <unk>  i walked into a courtroom and i saw an auditorium of people who one by one would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only <unk> they were predominately black and brown <unk>  and then a judge a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life altering decisions about that person without their input  they were predominately white  as each person one by one approached the front of that courtroom <unk> i couldn 't stop but think how did they get here i wanted to know their stories <unk>  and as the prosecutor read the facts of each case  was thinking to myself we could have predicted that that seems so preventable <unk>  not because i was an expert in criminal law but because it was common sense <unk>  over the course of the internship i began to recognize people in the auditorium not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any <unk> my second year of law school i worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney and in that experience i met many young men accused of murder  even in our worst i saw human stories <unk>  and they all contained childhood trauma victimization poverty loss <unk> disengagement from school <unk> early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system all leading to a seat in a courtroom <unk> convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison and it was during those meetings with those men that i couldn 't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail <unk> <unk> for the next eighty years when we could have reinvested it up front and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place  my third year of law school i defended people accused of small street crimes mostly mentally ill mostly homeless mostly drug addicted all in need of help  they would come to us <unk> and we would send them away without that help  they were in need of our assistance <unk> but we weren 't giving them <unk> by people who knew nothing about them <unk>  the staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work <unk> the unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender  the power dynamic that i came to understand made me become a prosecutor  i don 't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem we know the criminal justice system needs reform <unk> we know there are two point <unk> three million people in american jails and prisons making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet <unk>  we know there 's another seven million people on probation or parole <unk> we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color particularly poor people of color  and we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms but what we do not discuss <unk> our prosecutors are to receive them  when we talk about criminal justice reform we as a society focus on three things <unk> we complain we tweet we protest about the police about sentencing laws and about prison <unk>  we rarely <unk> if ever talk about the prosecutor  in the fall of two thousand and nine a young man was arrested by the boston police department he was eighteen years old he was african american and he was a senior at a local <unk> public school <unk> he had his sights set on college but his part time minimum wage job wasn 't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school  in a series of bad decisions he stole thirty laptops from a store and sold them on the internet this led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of thirty felony <unk> the potential jail time he faced is what stressed christopher out the most but what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future <unk>  i was standing in arraignments that day when christopher 's case came across my desk and at the risk of sounding dramatic in that moment i had christopher 's life in my hands <unk> i was twenty nine years old a brand new prosecutor and i had little appreciation for how the decisions i would make would impact christopher 's life christopher 's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such but i didn 't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer  for the most part prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions regardless of our intent <unk>  despite our broad discretion we learn to avoid risk at all cost rendering our discretion basically useless history has conditioned us to believe that somehow the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety despite evidence to the contrary <unk>  we 're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins so prosecutors aren 't really incentivized to be creative at our case dispositions or to take risks on people we might not otherwise <unk> to an outdated method <unk> counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want <unk> and that 's safer communities <unk>  yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned christopher  they have little appreciation for what we can do arraigning christopher would give him a criminal record <unk> making it harder for him to get a job <unk> setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing <unk> criminal justice system today with a criminal record and without a job christopher would be unable to find employment <unk> education or stable housing  without those protective factors in his life christopher would be more likely to commit further more serious crime <unk> the more contact christopher had with the criminal justice system the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again all at tremendous <unk> social cost to his children to his family and to his peers and ladies and gentlemen it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us  when i came out of law school  i did the same thing as everybody else i came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice but i never learned what justice was in my classes none of us do  none of us <unk> and yet prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system  our power is virtually boundless in most cases not the judge not the police not the legislature not the mayor not the governor not the president can tell us how to prosecute our cases <unk>  the decision to arraign christopher and give him a criminal record was <unk> i would choose whether to prosecute him for thirty felonies for one felony for a misdemeanor or at all  i would choose whether to leverage christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial and ultimately i would be in a position to ask for christopher to go to jail  these are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered <unk> and we are unaware and untrained of the grave consequences of those decisions <unk> one night this past summer i was at a small gathering of professional men of color from around the city  as i stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth as you do as public servant i noticed across the room a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me and i i recognized him but i couldn 't place from where and before i knew it this young man <unk> was hugging me and thanking me  you cared about me and you changed my life it was christopher  see i never arraigned christopher he never faced a judge or a jail he never had a criminal record  instead i worked with christopher first on being accountable for his actions <unk> and then putting him in a position where he wouldn 't seventy five percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to best buy and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we couldn 't recover  christopher did community service he wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community  he applied to college he obtained financial aid and he went on to graduate from <unk> after we finished hugging i looked at his name tag to learn that christopher was the manager of a large bank in boston christopher had accomplished and making a lot more money than me  he had accomplished all of this in the six years since i had first seen him in roxbury court <unk>  i can 't take credit for christopher 's journey to <unk> but i certainly did my part to keep him on the path  there are thousands of christophers out there some locked in our jails and prisons we need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that and to protect them an employed christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one it 's a bigger win for all of us in retrospect the decision not to throw the book at christopher makes perfect sense <unk> when i saw <unk> him that first day in roxbury court i didn 't see a criminal standing there i saw myself a young person in need of intervention  as an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens <unk> i knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system <unk>  along the way <unk> and guidance of my district attorney my supervisor and judges <unk> i learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ruining them  and that 's how we do it in boston <unk>  we helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids get a job <unk>  instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail for punching another teenager we secured mental health treatment and community supervision a runaway girl <unk> girl who was arrested for prostituting to survive on the streets needed a safe place to live and grow something we could help her with  i even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack he put a loaded 9 millimeter  we would spend our time that we 'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming <unk> up with real solutions to the problems as they presented <unk>  which is the better way to spend our time  how would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs  why are we spending eighty billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing when we could take that money and reallocate it into education <unk> into mental health treatment into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods  so why should this matter to you well one we 're spending a lot of money  our money  it costs one hundred and nine thousand dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year with a sixty percent chance that that person will return to the very same system that <unk> a terrible return on investment  number two it 's the right thing to do <unk>  if prosecutors were a part of creating the problem it 's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us <unk>  <unk> and number three your voice and your vote can make that happen the next time there 's a local district attorney 's election in your jurisdiction ask candidates these <unk> questions one what are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer  two what data are you collecting and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it 's working and number three <unk> if it 's not working for everybody what are you doing to fix it if they can 't answer the questions <unk> they shouldn 't be doing the job  each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living breathing example of the power of opportunity of intervention of support and of love <unk>  while each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever <unk> <unk> malfeasances you committed <unk> barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today some of the greatest minds on the planet <unk>  every day thousands of times a day prosecutors around the united states wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring <unk> about opportunity intervention <unk> support and yes <unk> even love  those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community and a strong community is a safe one <unk> if our communities are broken don 't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated inefficient expensive methods demand more vote for the prosecutor <unk> 's helping people stay out of jail not putting them in demand better you deserve it your children deserve it the people who are tied up in the system deserve it but most of all the people that we are sworn to <unk> <unk> protect and do justice for demand it we must <unk> we must do better <unk>
