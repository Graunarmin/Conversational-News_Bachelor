 <unk> i 'm going to read a few strips these are most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine called metropolis and the first story is called the faulty switch <unk> another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch  it 's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight  but at dusk everything changes <unk> the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install these <unk> <unk> 79 cent switches behind them <unk> we know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward <unk> but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light  recalls to mind a dirty men 's room in the rear of a greek coffee shop  this sound colors our first impression of any room it can 't be helped <unk> but where <unk> commonly described as a click come from is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action <unk>  or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment <unk> the often dental consonant of no <unk> <unk> language or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach <unk> they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls <unk>  but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic <unk>  the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life announcing our entry into every lightless room  the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature  it has a deep melancholy ring  children don 't like it it 's why they leave lights on <unk> adults find it comforting <unk>  but wouldn 't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship <unk>  or the recorded crowing of a rooster  or the distant peel of thunder <unk>  thomas edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one <unk> for the filament of his electric light bulb <unk>  why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch  that 's the end of that the next story is called in praise of the taxpayer that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have <unk> survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration these one or two story structures designed <unk> to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings <unk> yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction <unk>  although they make no claim to architectural beauty <unk> they are in their perfect temporariness a delightful alternative <unk> to the large scale structures that might someday take their place the most perfect examples occupy corner lots they offer a pleasant respite from the <unk> <unk> development around them a break of light and air  an architectural biding of time so buried in signage are these <unk> that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor <unk>  the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed <unk> and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer <unk> the few surfaces <unk> and necktie stores now these provisional structures have in some cases <unk> remained standing <unk> for the better part of a human lifetime  the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization a healthy sublimation of the urge to build  and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone that 's the end <unk> for the ancient egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead thirty cubits from foot to knee  it was not until the 14th century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a grecian temple <unk> upholstered in flesh and cloth over the next two hundred years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin 's lap and then back again  every child recapitulates this ascension <unk> straddling one or both legs sitting sideways or leaning against the body <unk> from there to the modern ventriloquist 's dummy is but a brief moment in history  you were late for school again this morning <unk>  the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap  the illusion of speech follows incidentally <unk>  what have you got to say for yourself jimmy as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance  we have fading memories of that provisional temple <unk> erected each time an adult sat down  on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on  it is children and teenage girls who are most keenly <unk> aware of its architectural beauty <unk>  they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels <unk>  the relationship between <unk> a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission <unk> the bathrooms and kitchens will of course have no windows  the lap of luxury is an architectural <unk> construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ <unk>  that 's the end the next story is called the haverpiece collection a nondescript warehouse visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway <unk> serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit <unk> the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry <unk> the foreboding sheen of an extra large date <unk> do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach proof bins <unk>  pears dried in the form of genital organs apricot halves like the ears of <unk> by maurice haverpiece a wealthy prune juice bottler and consolidated to form the core collection <unk> as an art form it lies somewhere between <unk> the rest of the collection remains here <unk> stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and <unk> center a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar
