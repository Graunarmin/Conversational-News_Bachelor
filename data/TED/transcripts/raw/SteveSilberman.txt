 <unk> just after christmas last year one hundred and thirty two kids in california got the measles by either visiting disneyland or being exposed to someone who 'd been there  the virus then hopped the canadian border <unk> infecting more than one hundred children in quebec one of the tragic things about this outbreak is that measles which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world  an effective vaccine against it has been available for more than half a century <unk>  but many of the kids involved in the disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents <unk> were afraid of something allegedly even worse autism but wait wasn 't the paper that sparked the controversy about autism and vaccines debunked <unk> retracted <unk> and branded a deliberate fraud by the british medical journal  don 't most science savvy people know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is <unk> of you do but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism why <unk>  here 's why  this is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time  for most of the 20th century autism was considered an incredibly rare condition <unk>  the few psychologists and pediatricians <unk> who 'd even heard of it figured they would get through their entire careers without seeing a single case  for decades the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in ten thousand <unk> but then <unk> the numbers started to skyrocket <unk> fundraising organizations like autism speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic <unk> if you could catch it from another kid at disneyland  so what 's going on if it isn 't vaccines what is it  if you ask the folks down at the centers for disease control in atlanta what 's going on  they tend to rely on phrases like broadened diagnostic criteria and better case finding <unk> to explain these rising numbers <unk>  but that kind of language doesn 't do much to allay the fears of a young mother who is searching her two year old 's face for eye contact  if the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened why were they so narrow in the first place why were cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk> five years ago <unk> i decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions <unk> i learned that <unk> what happened has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science than it does with the seductive power of storytelling  for most of the 20th century <unk> clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered <unk>  but that story turned out to be wrong and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health <unk> there was a second more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature  this second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next  the first story starts with a child psychiatrist at johns <unk> kanner published a paper describing eleven young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds <unk> ignoring the people around them  even their own parents  they could amuse themselves for hours by flapping their hands in front of their faces <unk> but they were panicked by little things like their favorite toy being moved from its <unk> without their knowledge based on the patients who were brought to his clinic kanner speculated that autism is very rare by the <unk> as the world 's leading authority on the subject he declared that he had seen less than one hundred and fifty true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as south africa  that 's actually not surprising <unk> kanner 's criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective for example <unk> he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism  he once bragged that he had turned nine out of ten kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis <unk> kanner was a smart guy <unk> but a number of his theories didn 't pan out he classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis caused by cold and and unaffectionate parents  these children he said had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn 't defrost at the same time however kanner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clustered in certain areas like music <unk> math and memory one boy in his clinic could distinguish between eighteen symphonies before he turned two  when his mother put on one of his favorite records he would correctly declare beethoven  but kanner took a dim view of these abilities <unk> claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things <unk> they 'd heard their pompous parents say <unk> desperate to earn their approval  as a result autism became a source of shame and stigma for families <unk>  and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good <unk> becoming invisible to the world at large <unk>  amazingly <unk> it wasn 't until the <unk> that researchers began to test kanner 's theory that autism was rare <unk> wing was a cognitive psychologist in london who thought that kanner 's theory of refrigerator parenting were bloody stupid as she told me <unk>  she and her husband john were warm and affectionate people and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named susie  lorna and john knew how hard it was to raise a child like susie without support services special education <unk> and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis to make the case to the national health service that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families lorna and her colleague judith gould decided to do something that should have been done thirty years earlier  they undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population they pounded the <unk> pavement in a london suburb called camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community  what they saw made clear that kanner 's model was way too narrow  while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse  some kids couldn 't talk at all <unk> while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics or the genealogy of royalty  in other words these children didn 't fit into nice neat boxes as judith put it and they saw lots of them  way more than kanner 's monolithic model would have predicted  at first they were at a loss to make sense of their data how had no one noticed these children <unk> but then lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published in german in one thousand nine <unk> the year after kanner 's paper and then forgotten buried with the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about  kanner knew about this competing paper but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work  it had never even been translated into english <unk> but luckily <unk> lorna 's husband spoke german and he translated it for her  the paper offered an alternate story of autism  its author was a man named hans asperger who ran a combination clinic and residential school in vienna in the <unk> asperger 's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards <unk>  mornings at his clinic began with exercise <unk> classes set to music <unk> and the children put on plays on sunday afternoons <unk>  instead of blaming parents for causing autism  asperger framed it as a lifelong polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one 's whole life <unk>  rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients asperger called them his <unk> little professors <unk> and enlisted their help in developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them <unk>  crucially  asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability  he believed that autism and autistic traits are common and always have been seeing aspects <unk> of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture like the socially awkward scientist and the absent minded professor  he went so far as to say it seems that for success in science and art a dash of autism is essential  lorna and judith realized that kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents <unk> causing it  over the next several years they quietly worked with the american psychiatric association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called the autism spectrum  in the late ' 80s and early <unk> their changes went into effect <unk> swapping out kanner 's narrow model <unk> for asperger 's broad and inclusive one  these changes weren 't happening in a vacuum  by coincidence as lorna and judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria  people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time  before rain man came out in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight only a tiny ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like <unk>  but after dustin hoffman 's unforgettable performance as raymond babbitt earned rain man four academy awards pediatricians psychologists teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like  coincidentally at the same time <unk> the first easy to use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced  you no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts to get your child <unk> evaluated  the combination of rain man the changes to the criteria <unk> and the introduction of these tests created a network effect  a perfect storm of autism awareness <unk>  the number of diagnoses started to soar just as lorna and judith predicted <unk> indeed hoped <unk> enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved  then andrew wakefield came along to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines a simple <unk> powerful and seductively believable story that was as wrong as kanner 's theory that autism was rare <unk> if the cdc 's current <unk> that one in sixty eight kids in america are on the spectrum is correct <unk> autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world  in recent years autistic people have come together on the internet to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical breakthrough  coining the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition <unk> to think in terms of human operating systems just because a p c is not running windows doesn 't mean that it 's broken  by autistic standards <unk> the normal human brain is easily distractable obsessively social and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail  to be sure autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them <unk> still catching up to asperger who believed that the cure for the most disabling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers <unk> accommodating employers <unk> supportive communities and parents who have faith in their children 's potential  an autistic [ man ] named zosia zaks once said we need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity <unk> as we sail into an uncertain future  we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society <unk>  we can 't afford to waste a brain
