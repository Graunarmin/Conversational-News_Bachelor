 <unk> my job at twitter is to ensure user trust <unk> protect user rights and keep users safe <unk> both from each other and at times from themselves  let 's talk about what scale looks like at twitter <unk>  back in january <unk> two thousand and nine we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform  january two thousand and fourteen  more than five hundred million we were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes that 's a <unk> vast majority of activity on twitter puts no one in harm 's way there 's no risk involved my job is to root out and prevent activity that might  sounds straightforward right you might even think it 'd be easy given that i just said the vast majority of activity on twitter puts no one in harm 's way  why spend so much time searching for potential <unk> calamities in innocuous activities  given the scale that twitter is at a one in a million chance happens five hundred times a day it 's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale for us <unk> edge cases those rare situations that are unlikely to occur are more like norms ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone there 's no threat involved maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like australia <unk> <unk> 's heart reef or tweeting about a concert they 're attending or sharing pictures of cute baby animals <unk>  <unk> nine nine nine percent that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly one hundred and fifty thousand per month  the sheer scale of what we 're dealing with makes for a challenge you know what else makes my role particularly challenging  people do weird <unk> and i have to figure out what they 're doing why and whether or not there 's risk involved often without much in terms of context or background  i 'm going to show you some examples that i 've run into during my time at twitter these are all real examples of situations that at first seemed cut and dried but the truth of the matter was something altogether different  the details <unk> if you saw a tweet that only said this  you might think to yourself that looks like abuse after all why would you want to receive the message yo bitch  now <unk> i try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes <unk> i knew that yo bitch was also often a common greeting between friends as well as being a popular breaking bad reference  i will admit that i did not expect to encounter a fourth use case <unk>  it turns out it is also used on twitter when people are role playing <unk> and in fact in that case it 's not only not abusive it 's technically just an accurate greeting  so okay <unk> determining whether or not something is abusive without context <unk> definitely hard <unk>  let 's look at spam <unk>  here 's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior <unk> sending the exact same message to thousands <unk> people while this is a mockup i put together using my account we see accounts doing this all the time  seems pretty straightforward <unk> we should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior <unk>  turns out there 's some exceptions to that rule <unk>  turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the international space station is passing overhead because you <unk> wanted to go outside and see if you could see it you 're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it 's spam  okay <unk> let 's make the stakes higher <unk>  back to my account <unk>  again exhibiting classic behavior <unk> this time it 's sending the same message and link this is often indicative of something called phishing <unk> somebody trying to steal another person 's <unk> account information by directing them to another website  that 's pretty clearly not a good thing <unk> we want to and do suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior <unk>  so why are the stakes higher for this <unk>  well this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video <unk> of a police officer beating a non violent protester who 's trying to let the world know what 's happening <unk>  we don 't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it  that means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors and even then we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate <unk>  now <unk> given the sorts of challenges i 'm up <unk> it 's crucial that i not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected  and that 's not just an issue for me or for twitter it 's an issue for you <unk> it 's an issue for anybody who 's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things <unk>  so what do i do  i pause and i think  how could all of this go horribly wrong i visualize catastrophe <unk>  and that 's hard <unk> there 's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that like when you 're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement  but you still have to do it particularly if you 're marrying five hundred million tweets per day what do i mean by <unk> visualize catastrophe  i try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death and what to do to prevent that  which happens to be my next example this is my cat <unk> eli <unk>  we wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their <unk> a picture is worth a thousand words you only get one hundred and forty characters you add a photo to your tweet look at how much more content you 've got now <unk>  there 's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet  my job isn 't to think of those it 's to think of what could go wrong  how could this picture lead to my death <unk>  well <unk> here 's one possibility <unk> there 's more in that picture than just a cat <unk>  there 's geodata  when you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera <unk> there 's a lot of additional information saved along in that image in fact this image also contains the equivalent of this  more specifically <unk> this  sure it 's not likely that someone 's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture i took of my cat <unk> but i start by assuming the worst <unk> will happen that 's why when we launched photos on twitter we made the decision to strip that <unk> if i start by assuming the worst and work <unk> <unk> backwards i can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases <unk> given that i spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen <unk> it wouldn 't be surprising if my worldview was gloomy  it 's not the vast majority of interactions i see and i see a lot believe me are positive people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other it 's just <unk> that for those of us dealing with scale for those of us tasked with keeping people safe <unk>  we have to assume the worst will happen <unk> because for us a one in a million chance is pretty good odds thank you
