 <unk> i have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres of course we all here in this room live in biosphere one  i 've also lived in biosphere two and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres and hopefully from that i get to learn something  so what did i learn well <unk> here i am inside biosphere two making a pizza <unk> so i am harvesting the wheat in order to make the dough and then of course i have to <unk> milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese it took me four months in biosphere two to make a pizza <unk> here in biosphere one well it takes me about two minutes because i pick up the phone and i call and say hey can you deliver the pizza  so biosphere two was essentially a three acre entirely sealed miniature world that i lived in for two years and twenty minutes  over the top it was sealed with steel and glass <unk> underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel essentially entirely sealed  so we had our own miniature rainforest a private beach with a coral reef we had a savanna marsh a desert we had our own half acre farm that we had to grow everything and of course we had our human habitat where we lived <unk>  back in the mid ' 80s when we were designing biosphere two <unk> we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions i mean what is a biosphere <unk> back then yes i guess we <unk> <unk> all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the earth right well you have to get a little more specific than that if you 're going to build one <unk>  <unk> that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed that is nothing goes in or out at all no material and energetically open which is essentially what planet earth is  this is a chamber that was one 400th the size of biosphere two that we called our test module and the very first day that this fellow john allen walked in to spend a couple of days days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we 'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive  the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something fungus but of course none of that happened <unk>  and over the ensuing few years there were great sagas about designing biosphere two <unk> but by one thousand nine hundred and ninety one we finally had this thing built <unk> and it was time for us to go <unk> give it a go  we needed to know is life this malleable can you take this biosphere that has evolved on a planetary scale and jam it into a little bottle and will it survive big questions <unk>  and we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe if we were going to go to mars for instance would we take a biosphere with us to live in it we also wanted to know so we can understand more about the earth that we all live <unk> finally time for us to go in and try out this baby let 's take it on a maiden voyage will it work <unk> or will something happen that we can 't understand and we can <unk> <unk> 't fix <unk> thereby negating the concept of man made biospheres <unk> so eight of us went in four men and four women and this is the world that we lived in so on the top we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean and underneath we had all this technosphere we called it which is where all the pumps and the valves <unk> <unk> and the water tanks and the air handlers and all of that one of the biospherians called it garden of eden on top of an aircraft carrier and then <unk> also we had the human habitat of course with the laboratories and all of <unk> this is the agriculture it was essentially an organic farm  the day i walked into biosphere two i was for the first time breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world <unk> except seven other people  at that moment i became part of that biosphere <unk> and i don 't mean that in an abstract sense <unk> i mean it rather <unk> the sweet potatoes that i was growing <unk> and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes  and those sweet potatoes became part of me <unk> in fact we ate so many sweet potatoes i became orange with sweet potato <unk> i literally was eating the same carbon over and over again  i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way  <unk> came to our atmosphere however it wasn 't that much of a joke over the long term because it turned out that we were losing oxygen quite a lot of oxygen  and we knew that we were losing co2 and so we were working to sequester carbon good lord we know that term now we were growing plants like crazy we were taking their biomass storing them in the <unk> trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere <unk> we were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere we stopped irrigating our soil as much as we could we stopped tilling so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air <unk>  but our oxygen was going down faster than our co2 was going up which was quite unexpected because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module <unk> and it was like playing atomic hide and seek we had lost seven tons of oxygen and we had no clue where it was <unk>  <unk> lose a lot of oxygen and our oxygen went down quite far it went from twenty one percent down to fourteen point two percent my goodness do you feel dreadful <unk>  i mean we were dragging ourselves around the biosphere and we had sleep apnea at night so you 'd wake up gasping with breath <unk> because your your blood chemistry has changed and that you literally do that you stop breathing and then you  take a breath and it wakes you up and it 's very irritating and everybody outside <unk> thought we were dying i mean the media was making it sound like were were dying and i had to call up my mother every other day saying no mum it 's fine fine we 're not dead we 're fine we 're fine  and the doctor was in fact <unk> checking us to make sure we were in fact fine <unk> but in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen and one day he couldn 't add up a line of figures <unk> and it was time for us to put <unk> your life support system was failing you wasn 't that dreadful yes <unk>  in a sense it was terrifying except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time if it really got bad though who was going to say i can 't take it anymore not me that was for sure  but on the other hand it was the scientific gold of the project because we could really crank this baby up as a scientific tool and see if we could <unk> in fact find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone <unk> and we did indeed find it and we found it in the concrete essentially <unk> it had done something very simple we had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost it broke down it took oxygen out of the air it put co2 into the air and it went into the concrete pretty straightforward really so <unk> elated because in fact <unk> although you might say we had discovered something that was quite uhh  when your oxygen is is going down <unk> stopped working essentially in your life support system that 's a very bad failure <unk> except that we knew what it was and we knew how to fix it and nothing else emerged that <unk> really was as serious as that <unk> and we proved the concept more or less people on the other hand was a different subject we yeah i don 't know that we were fixable <unk> we all went quite nuts i will say and the day i came out of biosphere two i was thrilled i was going to see all my family and my friends for two years i 'd been seeing people through the glass <unk>  and everybody ran up to me <unk> and i recoiled they stank  people stink we stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant and all kinds of stuff now we had stuff inside biosphere to keep ourselves clean but nothing with perfume and boy do we stink out here  not only that but i lost touch of where my food came from i had been growing all my own food  i had no idea what was in my food where it came from i didn 't even recognize half the names in most of the food that i was eating in fact <unk> i would stand for hours in the aisles of shops reading all the names on all of the things people must have thought i was nuts <unk> it was really quite astonishing <unk> and i slowly lost track of where i was in this big biosphere in this big biosphere that we <unk> in biosphere two i totally understood that i had a huge impact on my biosphere <unk> everyday <unk> and it had an impact on me very viscerally very literally <unk>  so i went about my business <unk> paragon space development corporation a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere because i had nothing else to do  and one of the things we did was try to figure out how small can you make these biospheres <unk> and what can you do with <unk> and so we sent one onto the mir space station we had one on the shuttle and one on the international space station for sixteen months where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete <unk> <unk> multiple life cycles in space really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are <unk>  <unk> a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon which is going to be pretty fun <unk> and the legacy of that is a system that we were designing an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on mars <unk>  and part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of co2 and oxygen and water through this plant system  as a result of that modeling i ended up in all places in eritrea in the horn of africa eritrea <unk> formerly part of ethiopia  is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful  incredibly stark <unk> and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there it is so dry  this is what i saw <unk> but this is also what i saw i i saw a company that had taken seawater and sand and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it and it will produce a food crop in this case it was oilseed  it was astonishing they were also producing mangroves in a plantation <unk> and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals <unk> they could produce milk and whatnot like we had in the biosphere <unk> and all of it was coming from this shrimp farms <unk> shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth frankly from an <unk> <unk> environmental point of view <unk> they pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean they also pollute their <unk> next door neighbors so they 're all shitting each other 's ponds quite literally <unk>  <unk> of these and turning them into all of this food they were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people they had created an industrial <unk> ecosystem of a sense <unk> i was there because i was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program under the u n kyoto protocol system <unk>  in a mangrove forest like this i have no idea well of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the earth <unk>  and understand its interactions with the entire earth <unk> and put your project in that context <unk>  around the world today we 're seeing an incredible transformation from what i would call a biocidal species  one that whether we <unk> or unintentionally have designed our systems to kill life a lot of the time  this is in fact this beautiful photograph is in fact over the amazon <unk>  and here the light green are areas of massive deforestation and those beautiful wispy clouds are in fact <unk> fires <unk> we 're in the process of transforming from this to what i would call a biophilic society one where we learn to nurture society  now it may not seem like it <unk>  but we are it is happening all across the world <unk> in every kind of walk of life and every kind of career and industry that you can think of <unk>  and i think often times people get lost in that <unk> i possibly find my way in that it 's such a huge subject  and i would say that the small stuff counts <unk> it really does this is the story of a rake in my backyard  this was my backyard <unk> very early on when i bought my property and in arizona of course everybody puts gravel <unk> and they like to keep everything beautifully raked and they keep all the leaves away and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out and i want to throttle them <unk> it 's a certain type of aesthetic <unk> we 're very uncomfortable with untidiness <unk>  and i threw away my rake <unk>  and i let all of the leaves fall from the trees that i have on my property <unk>  and over time essentially what have i been doing i 've been building topsoil <unk> and so now all the birds come in and i have hawks and i have an oasis <unk> this is what happens every spring for six weeks six to eight weeks i have this flush of green oasis this is actually in a riparian area <unk> and all of <unk> <unk> tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake the small stuff counts <unk> the industrial revolution and prometheus has given us this the ability to light up the world <unk>  it has also given us this the ability to look at the world from the outside <unk> now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to and compare it to this biosphere <unk>  but we can look at the world and try
