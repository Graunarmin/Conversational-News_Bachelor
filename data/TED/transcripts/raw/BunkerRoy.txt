 <unk> love story with the poor <unk> living on less than one dollar a day <unk> i went to a very elitist <unk> snobbish expensive education in india and that almost destroyed me <unk>  i was all set to be a diplomat teacher doctor all laid out <unk> i don 't look it but i was the indian national squash champion for three years laughter the whole world was laid out for me everything was at my feet i could do nothing wrong  and then i thought out of curiosity i 'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like so <unk> i went to what was called the worst bihar famine in india and i saw <unk> starvation death people dying of hunger for the first time it changed my life i came back home told my mother i 'd like to live and work in a village  mother went into a coma  <unk> the whole world is laid out for you the best jobs are laid out for you and you want to go and work in a village i mean is there something wrong with you i said no i 've got the best eduction it made me think <unk> and i wanted to give something back in my own way  what do you want to do in a village <unk> no job <unk> no money no security no prospect i said i want to live and dig wells for five years <unk> wells for five years you went to the most expensive school and college in india and you want to dig wells for five years she didn 't speak to me for a very long time <unk> because she thought i 'd let my family down <unk>  but then  i was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have which are never brought into the mainstream which is never identified respected applied on a large scale <unk> and i thought i 'd start a barefoot college college only for the poor <unk> what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college i went to this village for the first time <unk> elders came to me and said are you <unk> are you doing here <unk> why are you here <unk> the education system in india makes you look look at paris and new delhi and zurich <unk> what are you doing in this village is there something wrong <unk> actually start a college only for the poor  what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college so the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice <unk> they said please  don 't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college so it 's the only college in india where if you should have a ph d or a master 's you are disqualified to come you have to be a cop out or a wash out or a dropout to come to our college <unk>  you have to work with your hands <unk> you have to have a dignity of labor you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community <unk> so we started the barefoot college <unk> and we redefined professionalism <unk> a professional is someone who has a combination of competence <unk> confidence and belief a water diviner is a professional a traditional midwife is a professional a traditional bone setter is a professional these are professionals all over the world you find them in any inaccessible village around the world <unk> and we thought that these people should come into <unk> and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal it needs to be used needs to be applied needs to be shown to the world outside that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today <unk> so the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of mahatma <unk> you eat on the floor <unk> you sleep on the floor <unk> you work on the floor there are no contracts <unk> no written contracts you can stay with me for twenty years go tomorrow <unk>  and no one can get more than $ one hundred a month <unk> you come for the money <unk> you don 't come to barefoot college <unk>  you come for the work and the challenge <unk> you 'll come to the barefoot college  that is where we want you to try crazy ideas whatever idea you have come and try <unk> doesn 't matter if you fail <unk> battered bruised you start again it 's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher  and it 's the only college where we don 't give a certificate <unk> you are certified by the community you serve <unk> you don 't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer <unk>  so when i said that they said well show us what is possible what are you doing this is all <unk> mumbo jumbo if you can 't show it on the ground so we built the first barefoot college in <unk> it was built by twelve barefoot architects who can 't read and write built on $ one <unk> hundred and fifty people lived there <unk> worked there they got the aga khan award for architecture in two thousand and two but then they suspected <unk> thought there was an architect behind it i said yes they made the blueprints <unk> but the barefoot architects actually constructed the college we are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ fifty thousand because they didn 't believe us and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the barefoot architects of tilonia <unk> <unk> what can you build in this place he had one look at the soil and said forget it no way no water rocky soil  i was in a bit of a spot <unk> and i said okay i 'll go to the old man in village and say ' what should i grow in this spot '  he looked quietly at me and said you build this you build this you put this and <unk> is what it looks like today  went to the roof <unk> and all the women said clear out  the men should clear out because we don 't want to share this technology with the men this is waterproofing the roof  it is a bit of jaggery a bit of urens and a bit of other things i don 't know but it actually doesn 't leak <unk> it hasn 't leaked <unk> all the power comes from the sun forty five kilowatts of panels on the roof and everything works off the sun for the next twenty five years so long as the sun shines we 'll have no problem with power but the beauty is that is was installed by a priest a hindu priest <unk> who 's only done eight years of primary schooling never been to school never been to college <unk> he knows more about solar than anyone i know anywhere in the world guaranteed  food if you come to the barefoot college <unk> is solar cooked <unk>  but the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women <unk> illiterate women  who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker it 's a parabolic scheffler solar cooker <unk>  unfortunately they 're almost half german <unk> they 're so precise <unk> to the last inch they can make that cooker and we have sixty meals twice a day of solar cooking we have a dentist she 's a grandmother illiterate who 's a dentist she actually looks after the teeth of seven thousand children  barefoot technology  <unk> no engineer no architect thought of it but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs  very little water is wasted all the roofs are connected underground to a four hundred thousand liter tank <unk>  and no water is wasted <unk> if we have four years of drought we still have water on the campus because we collect rainwater  sixty percent of children don 't go to school <unk> because they have to look after animals <unk> so we thought of starting a school at night for the children because the night schools of tilonia over seventy five thousand children have gone through these night schools because it 's for the convenience of the of the child it 's not for the convenience of the teacher and what do we teach in these schools <unk> democracy <unk> citizenship  how you should measure your land  what you should do if you <unk> if your animal is sick this is what we teach in the night schools but all the schools every five years we have an election between six to fourteen year old children participate in a democratic process <unk> and they elect a prime minister the prime minister is twelve years old <unk> she looks after twenty goats in the morning but she 's prime minister in the evening <unk>  she has a cabinet a minister of education a minister for energy a minister for health <unk> and they actually monitor and supervise one hundred and fifty schools for seven thousand children  she got the world 's children 's prize five years ago and she went <unk> first time ever going out of her village <unk> never seen sweden <unk> wasn 't dazzled at all by what was happening <unk>  and the queen of sweden who 's there <unk> turned to me and said can you ask this child where she got her confidence from she 's only twelve years old and she 's not dazzled by anything  and the girl who 's on her left <unk> turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said please tell <unk> where the percentage of illiteracy is very high we use puppetry  puppets is the way we communicate <unk>  you have <unk> jokhim chacha who is three hundred years old <unk>  he is my psychoanalyst <unk> he is my teacher he 's my doctor <unk> he 's my lawyer <unk>  he 's my donor <unk> he actually raises money solves my disputes <unk> he solves my problems in the village <unk> if there 's tension <unk> a friction between the teacher and the parent the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says shake hands <unk> the attendance must not drop  these puppets are made out of recycled world bank reports <unk> we 've covered all over india from ladakh up to bhutan all solar electrified villages by people who have been trained <unk>  and we went to ladakh <unk> and we asked this woman this <unk> at minus forty you have to come out of the roof <unk> because there 's no place it was all snowed up on both sides and we asked this woman what was the benefit you had from solar electricity  and she thought for a minute and said it 's the first time i can see my husband 's face in winter  went to afghanistan <unk> one lesson we learned <unk> men are restless men are ambitious men are compulsively mobile <unk> and they all want a certificate  all across the globe you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate why because they want to leave the village and go to a city looking for a job <unk> so we came up with a great solution train grandmothers what 's the best way of communicating in the world today <unk> afghanistan for the first time  and we picked three women and said we want to take them to india they said impossible they don 't even go out of their rooms and you want to take them to india  i said i 'll make a concession i 'll take the husbands along as well so i took the husbands along of course the women were much more intelligent than the men <unk> six months  how do we train these women sign language <unk>  you don 't choose the written word <unk> you don 't choose the spoken word <unk> you use sign language <unk> and in six months they can become solar engineers <unk> they go back and solar electrify their own village <unk> this woman went back and <unk> set up a workshop the first village ever to be solar electrified in afghanistan [ was ] by the three women  this woman is an extraordinary grandmother fifty five years old and she 's solar electrified two hundred houses for me in afghanistan and they haven 't collapsed <unk> <unk> she actually went and spoke to an engineering department in afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between ac and dc he didn 't know  those three women have trained twenty seven more women and solar electrified one hundred villages in afghanistan <unk> we went to africa <unk> and we did the same thing  all these women sitting at one table from eight nine countries all chatting to each other not understanding a word because they 're all speaking a different language but their body language is great they 're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers <unk> i went to sierra leone <unk> and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night comes across this village comes back goes into the village says <unk> there 's a solar electrified village in sierra leone he said no half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day what 's the story  so he summoned me and said can you train me one hundred and fifty grandmothers  i said i can 't mr president <unk> but they will <unk> the grandmothers will so he built me the first
