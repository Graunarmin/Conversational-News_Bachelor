 <unk> here to talk about congestion <unk> namely road congestion road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon it exists in basically all of the cities all around the world which is a little bit surprising when you think i mean think about how different cities are actually <unk> i mean you have the typical european cities with a dense urban core good public transportation mostly  not a lot of road capacity <unk> but then on the other hand you have the american cities <unk> it 's moving by itself okay <unk> anyway the american cities  lots of roads dispersed over large areas almost no public transportation and then you have the emerging world with a mixed variety of vehicles mixed land use patterns also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core <unk>  and traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures <unk> dense cities or dispersed cities lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bike lanes or more information or lots of different things but nothing seems to work <unk>  but all of these attempts have one thing in common they 're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car <unk> driving they 're essentially to a point attempts at planning what other people should do planning their life for them  now <unk> planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do and let me tell you a story back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine when the berlin wall fell <unk> an urban urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying basically <unk> i 'd like to know <unk> who 's in charge of london 's bread supply  and the urban planner in london goes  what do you mean <unk> who 's in charge of london 's i mean <unk> no one is in charge oh but surely someone must be in charge i mean it 's a very complicated system someone must control all of this  no <unk>  no no one is in charge i mean it basically i haven 't really thought of it it basically organizes itself  it organizes itself <unk> that 's an example of a complex social system <unk> which has the ability of <unk> and this is a very deep insight  when you try to solve really complex social problems the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives you don 't plan the details <unk> and people will figure out what to do how to adapt to this new framework <unk>  and let 's now look at <unk> how we can use this insight to combat road congestion this is a map of stockholm my hometown <unk> now stockholm is a <unk> <unk> roughly two million people but stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges narrow bridges old bridges which means lots of road congestion and these red dots show the most congested parts which are the bridges that lead into the inner city <unk> and then someone came up with the idea that apart from good public transport <unk> from spending money on roads  let 's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks <unk> now one or two euros that isn 't really a lot of money <unk> i mean compared to parking charges and running costs etc so <unk> you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn 't really react to this fairly small charge you would be wrong  <unk> twenty percent well <unk> that 's a fairly huge figure you might think but you 've still got eighty percent left of the problem right because you still have eighty percent of the traffic now that 's also wrong  because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon <unk> meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really really rapidly <unk>  but fortunately <unk> it also works the other way around <unk> if you can reduce traffic even somewhat then congestion will go down much faster than you might think <unk>  now congestion charges were introduced in stockholm on january three  two thousand and six and the first picture here is a picture of stockholm one of the typical streets <unk> january two  the first day with the congestion charges looked like this  this is what happens when you take away twenty percent of the cars from the streets <unk> reduce congestion quite substantially  but well as i said i mean <unk> car drivers adapt <unk> right so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges <unk> wrong again <unk>  it 's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in stockholm <unk> and we basically have the same low traffic levels still but you see there 's an interesting gap here in the time series in two thousand and seven <unk> well <unk> the thing is that <unk> congestion charges they were introduced first as a trial so they were introduced in january and then abolished again at the end of july <unk> followed by a referendum and then they were reintroduced again in two thousand and seven <unk> which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity i mean this was a really a really fun experiment to start with <unk> and we actually got to do it twice <unk> like to do this every once a year or so but they won 't let me do that but it was fun anyway <unk> so we followed up what happened  this is the last day with the congestion charges july thirty one and you see the same street but now it 's summer and summer in stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year <unk> and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this all the cars were back <unk> and you even have to admire the car drivers they adapt so extremely quickly the first day they all came back <unk>  and this effect this effect hanged on so two thousand and seven figures looked like this <unk>  now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know <unk> but i would say that the most surprising slide here i 'm going to show you today is not this one it 's this one  this shows public support for congestion pricing of stockholm <unk> and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in <unk> the beginning of spring two thousand and six people were fiercely against it seventy percent of the population didn 't want this <unk>  but what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect that people hated it more and more no on the contrary they changed up to a point where we now have seventy percent support for keeping the charges <unk>  meaning that i mean let me <unk> seventy percent of the population in stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free <unk>  okay so why can that be why is that well <unk> think about it this way <unk> who changed <unk> i mean <unk> the twenty percent of the car drivers that disappeared surely they must be discontent in a way <unk> and where did they go <unk> if we can understand understand this then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this <unk> well so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services and tried to figure out who changed <unk> and where did they go and it turned out that they don 't know themselves for some reason the car drivers are they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do <unk> and why is that it 's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think  each day people make new <unk> and people change and the world changes around them and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don 't even notice they 're not even aware of this themselves <unk>  and the other question who changed their mind <unk> who changed their opinion and why  so we did another interview survey tried to figure out why people changed their mind <unk> and what type of group changed their <unk> and after analyzing the answers it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven 't changed their minds <unk>  they 're actually confident that they have they have liked congestion pricing all along <unk>  which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with twenty percent and reduced congestion by enormous numbers <unk> and people aren 't even aware that they have changed <unk> and they honestly believe <unk> that they have liked this all along
