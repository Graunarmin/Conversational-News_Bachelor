 <unk> really here to talk about is the how okay so how exactly do we create this <unk> <unk> if you will <unk> innovation now i want to tell you a quick story we 'll go back a little more <unk> in fact the date i 'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date it was february 3rd two thousand and eight anyone remember what happened february 3rd two thousand and eight  super bowl i heard it over here <unk> it was the date of the super bowl <unk> and the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues john king and halee fischer wright and i <unk> noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties is that it seemed to us that across the <unk> united states <unk> if you will tribal councils had convened <unk>  and they had discussed things of great national importance like do we like the budweiser commercial  and do we like the nachos and who is going to win but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support <unk> and if you go back in time <unk> it looked like hilary clinton was going to get the democratic nomination and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way <unk> but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect <unk> <unk> had happened in these tribes all across the united states now what is a tribe a tribe is a group of about twenty so <unk> built that important things happen <unk> and so as we surveyed the if you will representatives from various tribal councils that met also known as super bowl parties <unk> we sent the following <unk> <unk> email off to forty newspaper editors the following day february 4th we posted it on our website this was before super tuesday we said the tribes that we 're in are saying it 's going to be <unk> the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous ten years studying tribes studying these naturally occurring groups all of you are members of tribes in <unk> <unk> walking around at the break many of you had met members of your tribe and you were talking to them and many of you were doing what great if you will tribal leaders do <unk> which <unk> <unk> is to find someone who is a member of a tribe and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe and make introductions <unk> that is in fact what great tribal leaders do <unk> so here is the bottom line <unk>  if you focus in on a group like this this happens to be a usc game and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people you would in fact see not a single crowd just like there is <unk> not a single crowd here but you would see these tribes that are then coming together and from a distance it appears that it 's a single group and so people form tribes <unk> they always have they always will just as fish swim and birds fly people form tribes it 's just what we do but here 's the rub not all tribes are the same  <unk> all a member of tribes <unk> if you can find a way to take the tribes that you 're in and nudge them forward along these tribal stages to what we call stage <unk> <unk> five which is the top of the mountain but we 're going to start with what we call stage one <unk> now <unk> this is the lowest of the stages you don 't want this okay <unk> this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen but it 's one that i think we need to learn from  <unk> produces people who do horrible things this is the kid who shot up virginia tech  stage one is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes and then pool together with people who think like they do  stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons now again we don 't often deal with stage one <unk> and i want to make the point that as members of society we need <unk> it 's not enough to simply write people off but let 's move on to stage two <unk> now stage one you 'll notice says <unk> in effect life sucks this other book that steve mentioned that just came out called the three laws of performance my colleague <unk>  steve zaffron and i argue that as people see the world so they behave well if people see the world in such a way that life sucks then their behavior will follow automatically from that it will be despairing hostility <unk> do whatever it takes to survive even if that means undermining other people now my birthday is coming up shortly <unk> and my driver 's license expires <unk> and the reason that that 's relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe <unk> which looks like this  now am i saying that in every department of motor vehicles across the land you find a stage two culture <unk> the one near me where i have to go in just a few days <unk> what i will say when i 'm standing in line is how can people be so dumb and yet live  now am i saying that there are dumb people working here actually no i 'm not <unk> but i 'm saying the culture makes people dumb <unk> <unk> stage two culture and we find these in all sorts of different places you find them in fact in the best organizations in the world you find them in all places in society i 've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class but here is the point if you believe and you say to people in your tribe in effect my life sucks <unk>  i mean if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn 't suck but i don 't so it does if that 's how you talked imagine what kind of work would get done what kind of innovation would <unk> get done <unk> the amount of world changing behavior that would happen <unk> in fact it would be basically nil now when we go on to stage three this is the one that hits closest to home <unk> <unk> for many of us because it is in stage three that many of us move and we park and we stay  <unk> now imagine having a whole room of people saying in effect i 'm great and you 're not or i 'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that a whole group of people communicating that way talking that way <unk> i know this sounds like a joke three doctors walk into a bar <unk> but in this case three doctors walk into an elevator i happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book and one doctor said to the others did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine  and the other said no that 's great congratulations the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said well while you were you know doing your research notice the condescending tone while <unk> <unk> you were off doing your research <unk> i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution and the third one got the same wry smile and said well while you were off doing your research <unk> and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery that <unk> eventually we 'll train monkeys to do or cells or robots or maybe not even need to do it at all i was off running the future of the residency program which is really the future of medicine and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back and the <unk> <unk> elevator door opened and they all walked out that is a meeting of a stage three tribe <unk> now <unk> we find these in places where really smart successful people show up like oh i don 't know here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation it is moving from stage three to stage four <unk>  let 's take a look at a quick video snippet this is from a <unk> employees volunteer time in the advice booth notice it looks like something out of a peanuts cartoon okay we 're going through the hallway here at zappos <unk> this is a call center <unk> notice how it 's decorated notice people are applauding for us they don 't know who we are and they don 't care and if they did they probably wouldn 't applaud you 'll notice the level of excitement notice <unk> again how they decorate their office now what 's important to people at zappos  these may not be the things that are important to you but they value things like fun and they value creativity one of their stated values is be a little bit weird and you 'll notice they are a <unk> <unk> little bit weird <unk> <unk> so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual <unk> competence then something very important happens the group gels <unk> and it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly <unk> <unk> people into something larger into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence stage four tribes can do remarkable things but you 'll notice we 're not at the top of the mountain yet there is in fact another stage  <unk> not recognize the scene that 's up here <unk> and if you take a look at the headline of stage five which is life is great this may seem a little incongruous <unk> this is a scene or snippet <unk> from the truth and reconciliation process in south africa for which desmond tutu won the nobel prize now think about that south africa <unk> terrible atrocities had happened in the society <unk> and people came together focused only on those two <unk> values truth and reconciliation there was no road map no one had ever done anything like this before and in this atmosphere where the only guidance was people 's <unk> <unk> values and their noble cause <unk> what this group accomplished was historic <unk> and people at the time feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has <unk> descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end in fact south africa has not gone down that road largely because people like desmond tutu <unk> set up a stage five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country to bring everyone together so people hear this and <unk> <unk> they conclude the following as did we in doing the study <unk> okay <unk> got it i don 't want to talk stage one that 's like <unk> don 't want to talk like they do at the particular dmv that 's close to where dave lives i really don 't want to just say i 'm great because that kind of sounds narcissistic and then i won 't have any friends saying we 're great that sounds pretty good but i should really talk stage five right life is great well in fact there are three somewhat <unk> findings that come out of all this the first one if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it the phrase <unk> that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights i mean that 's stage five right life is great oriented only by our values no other guidance <unk> in <unk> <unk> fact most of the document is written at stage two my life sucks because i live under a tyrant <unk> also known as king george we 're great <unk> who is not great <unk> great leaders what about gandhi what about martin luther king i mean surely these were just people who preached life is great right just one little bit of happiness and joy after another in fact martin luther <unk> <unk> king 's most famous line was at stage three he didn 't say we have a dream he said i have a dream why did he do that because most people are not at stage five <unk> percent of working tribes say these are employed tribes say i 'm great and you 're not and we have to duke it out every day so we resort to politics only about twenty two percent of tribes are at stage four <unk> oriented by our values saying we 're <unk> and our values are beginning to unite us only two percent only two percent of tribes get to stage five and those are the ones that change the world so the first little finding from this <unk> is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society <unk>  within their tribes to the next level i 'd like to show you some examples of this one of the people we interviewed was frank jordan <unk>  former mayor of san francisco before that he was chief of police in san francisco <unk>  and he grew up essentially in stage one and you know what changed his life it was walking into one of these a boys and girls club <unk> now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco he went from being alive and <unk> passionate at stage one remember life sucks despairing hostility i will do whatever it takes to survive to walking into a boys and girls club <unk> folding his arms sitting down in a chair <unk> and saying wow my life really sucks <unk> i don 't know anybody i mean if i was into boxing like they were then my life wouldn 't suck but i don 't so it does <unk> so i 'm going to sit here in my chair and not <unk> in fact that 's progress <unk> we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then over time getting them connected <unk>  so <unk> what about moving from stage three to stage four <unk> i want to argue that we 're doing that right here ted represents a set of values and as we unite around these values something really interesting begins to <unk> if you want this experience to live on as something historic <unk> then at the reception tonight i 'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do <unk> <unk> and call networking which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach extend your influence but instead find someone you don 't know and find someone else you don 't know and introduce them  <unk> do that they extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them not just to myself so that my following is greater <unk> but i connect people who don 't know each other <unk> to something greater than themselves and ultimately that adds to their values <unk> but we 're not done yet <unk> because then how do we go from stage four <unk> which is great <unk> to stage <unk> the story that i like to end with is this it comes out of a place called the gallup organization you know they do polls right <unk> so it 's stage four we 're great who is not great <unk> pretty much everybody else <unk> <unk> who does polls if gallup releases a poll on the same day that nbc releases a poll people will pay attention to the gallup poll okay we understand that  <unk> instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that what does the entire world think  and they found a way to do the first ever world poll they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics who reported being bored <unk> and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out how do we survey the population <unk> how do we survey populations that don 't have access to technology and speak languages we don 't speak and we don 't know anyone who speaks those languages because in order to achieve on this great mission we have to be able to do it incidentally they did pull it off and they released the <unk> the tribes that you 're in and <unk> nudge them forward
