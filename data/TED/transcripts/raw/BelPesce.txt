 <unk> i dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams <unk>  when we think about the dreams we have and the dent we want to leave in the universe it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have and projects that never happen laughter so i 'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not to follow your dreams  one  believe in overnight success <unk> you know the story right  the tech guy built a mobile app and sold it very fast for a lot of money <unk>  you know the story may seem <unk> i bet it 's incomplete if you go investigate further the guy has done thirty apps before and he has done a master 's on the topic a phd  he has been working on the topic for twenty years this is really interesting i myself have a story in brazil that people think is an overnight success <unk> i come from a humble family <unk>  and two weeks before the deadline to apply for mit i started the application process <unk> got in  people may think it 's an overnight success <unk> but that only worked because for the seventeen years prior to that i took life and education seriously  your overnight success story is always a result of everything you 've done in your life through that moment  believe someone else has the answers for you constantly people want to help out right  all sorts of people your family your friends your business partners they all have opinions on which path you should take and let me tell you go through this pipe  but whenever you go inside there are other ways you have to pick as well <unk> and you need to make those decisions yourself  no one else has the perfect answers for your life  and you need to keep picking those decisions right the pipes are infinite and you 're going to bump <unk> your head and it 's a part of the process <unk>  three <unk> and it 's very subtle but very important <unk>  decide to settle when growth is guaranteed so when your life is going great  you have put together a great team <unk> and you have growing revenue and everything is set time to settle  when i launched my first book <unk> i worked really really hard to distribute it everywhere in brazil <unk> with that over three million people downloaded it over fifty thousand people bought physical copies when i wrote a sequel <unk> some impact was guaranteed <unk>  even if i did little <unk> sales would be ok <unk>  but ok is never ok <unk> when you 're growing towards a peak <unk> you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another <unk> maybe if i did little a couple hundred thousand people would read it and that 's great already <unk>  but if i work harder than ever i can bring this number up to millions  that 's why i decided with my new book to go to every single state of brazil <unk> and i can already see a higher peak <unk> there 's no time to settle down <unk>  fourth tip <unk> and that 's really important <unk> believe the fault is someone else 's  i constantly see people saying <unk> great idea <unk> but no investor had the vision to invest oh i created this great product <unk> but the market is so bad the sales didn 't go well or i can 't find good talent my team is so below expectations  if you have dreams it 's your responsibility to make them happen <unk> yes <unk> it may be hard <unk> the market may be bad <unk> but if no one invested in your idea <unk> if no one bought your product for sure there is something there that is your fault  laughter definitely you need to get your dreams and make them happen <unk> and no one achieved their goals alone <unk> but if you didn 't make them happen <unk> it 's your fault and no one else 's be responsible for your dreams and one last tip <unk> and this one is really important as well <unk> believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves <unk> once i saw an ad <unk>  and it was a lot of friends they were going up a mountain it was a very high mountain <unk> and it was a lot of work <unk> you could see that they were sweating and this was tough <unk> and they were going up <unk>  <unk> life is never about the goals themselves life is about the journey <unk>  yes <unk> you should enjoy the goals themselves <unk> but people think that you have dreams and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams it 's a magical place where happiness will be all around but achieving a dream is a momentary sensation <unk> and your life is not  the only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey  that 's the best way and your journey is simple it 's made of steps some steps will be right on <unk> sometimes you will trip <unk> if it 's right on celebrate <unk> because some people wait a lot to celebrate <unk> and if you tripped <unk> turn that into something to learn if every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate <unk> you will for sure enjoy the journey <unk>  so five tips <unk> believe in overnight success <unk> believe someone else has the answers for you believe that when growth is guaranteed <unk> you should settle down <unk> believe the fault is someone else 's and believe that only the goals themselves matter believe me you do that and you will destroy your dreams
