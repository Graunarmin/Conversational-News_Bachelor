 <unk> i am a chef and a food policy guy but i come from a whole family of teachers my sister is a special ed teacher in chicago my father just retired <unk> years teaching fifth grade <unk> my aunt and uncle were professors my cousins all teach everybody in my family basically teaches except for me  they taught me that the only way to get the right answers is to ask the right questions <unk> so what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for <unk> there 's obviously many important questions <unk> but i think the following is a good place to start  what do we think the connection is between a child 's growing mind and their growing body <unk>  what can we expect our kids to learn if their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients what can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally <unk> going hungry <unk>  and with all the resources that we are pouring into schools  we should stop and ask ourselves are we really setting our kids up for success  now a few years ago <unk> i was a judge on a cooking competition called chopped four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes <unk> except for this episode it was a very special one instead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight something that i would know nothing about  these chefs were school chefs  you know the women that you used to call lunch ladies but the ones i insist we call school chefs  <unk> these women god bless these women spend their day cooking for thousands of kids breakfast and lunch with only <unk> <unk> six eight per lunch with only about a dollar of that actually going to the food <unk> in this episode the main course mystery ingredient was quinoa <unk>  now i know it 's been a long time since most of you have had a school lunch and we 've made a lot of progress on nutrition but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias so this was a challenge <unk>  but the dish that i i will never forget was cooked by a woman named cheryl barbara <unk>  cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut  she cooked this delicious pasta <unk> it was amazing <unk> it was a pappardelle with italian sausage kale parmesan <unk> basically just threw the quinoa pretty much uncooked into the dish it was a strange choice <unk> and it was super crunchy <unk> so i took on the tv accusatory judge thing that it 's a monday  and that in my school at high school in the community i always cook pasta see cheryl explained that for many of her kids <unk>  there were no meals on the weekends  no meals on saturday <unk>  no meals on <unk> she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew her children would eat something that would stick to their ribs she said  something that would fill them up  cheryl talked about how by the time monday came her <unk> hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn 't even begin to think about learning food was the only thing on their mind  the only thing  and unfortunately the stats they tell the same story so let 's put this into the context of a child <unk>  and we 're going to focus on the most important meal of the day  <unk> meet allison she 's twelve years old <unk> she 's smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up if allison goes to a school that serves a nutritious breakfast to all of their kids <unk> here 's what 's going to follow  her chances of getting a nutritious meal one with fruit and milk one lower in sugar and salt dramatically increase  allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid she 'll have to visit the nurse less <unk> she 'll have lower levels of anxiety and depression she 'll have better behavior <unk> she 'll have better attendance and she 'll show up on time more often why <unk>  well <unk> because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school  overall <unk> allison is in much better health than the average school kid <unk> so what about that kid who doesn 't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for he 's also twelve he 's a wonderful kid <unk> he wants to be a doctor by the time tommy is in kindergarten he 's already underperforming in math  by the time he 's in third grade <unk> he 's got lower math and reading scores  by the time he 's eleven it 's more likely that tommy will have to have repeated a grade <unk>  research shows that kids who do not have <unk> consistent nourishment particularly at breakfast have poor cognitive function overall <unk>  so how widespread is this problem <unk> well <unk> unfortunately it 's pervasive <unk>  let me give you two stats that seem like they 're on opposite ends of the of the issue but are actually two sides of the same coin <unk> on the one hand <unk> one in six americans are food insecure <unk> including sixteen million children almost twenty percent are food insecure in this city alone in new york city four hundred and seventy four thousand kids under the age of eighteen face hunger every year it 's crazy on the other hand <unk> diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country <unk> by far <unk> and fully a third of the kids that we 've been talking about tonight are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime <unk>  now what 's hard to put together but is true is that many times these are the same children  so they fill up on on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities and that their families can afford <unk> but then by the <unk> the month food stamps run out or hours get cut at work <unk> and they don 't have the money to cover the basic cost of food <unk>  but we should be able to solve this problem right we know what the answers are as part of my work at the white house we instituted a program that for all schools that had forty percent more low income kids we could serve <unk> breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school for free this program has been incredibly successful because it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast and that was the barrier of stigma  see schools serve <unk> it was only available for the poor kids  so everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help <unk>  now all kids <unk> no matter how much or how little their parents make have a lot of pride <unk>  so what happened <unk> well the schools that have <unk> saw an increase in math and reading scores by seventeen point five percent seventeen point five percent <unk>  and research shows that when kids have a consistent nutritious breakfast  their chances of graduating increase by twenty percent twenty percent when we give our kids the nourishment they need we give them the chance to thrive <unk> both in the classroom and beyond <unk>  now <unk> you don 't have to trust me on this but you should talk to donna martin <unk>  i love donna martin <unk> donna martin is the school nutrition director at burke county in waynesboro georgia burke county is one of the poorest districts in the fifth poorest state in the country <unk> and about one hundred percent of donna 's <unk> students live at or below the poverty line  a few years ago donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming <unk> and overhaul her nutrition standards <unk>  she improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains <unk> she served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids <unk> and she implemented a dinner program why <unk> many of her kids didn 't have dinner when they went home <unk>  so how did they respond <unk> well the kids loved the food  they loved the better nutrition <unk> and they loved not being hungry <unk>  but donna 's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place  his name from eric parker and he was the head football coach for the burke county bears now <unk> coach parker had coached mediocre teams for years the bears often ended in the middle of the pack a big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states in the union <unk> but the year donna changed the menus the bears not only won their division <unk> they went on to win the state championship <unk> beating the peach county trojans and coach parker <unk> he credited that championship to donna martin <unk>  when we give our kids the basic nourishment they 're going to thrive <unk>  and it 's not just up to the cheryl barbaras and the donna martins of the world it 's on all of us and feeding our <unk> kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point what i 've laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face  if we focus on the simple goal of properly nourishing ourselves we could see a world that is more stable and secure  we could dramatically improve our economic productivity we could transform our health care and we could go a long way in ensuring that the earth can provide for generations to come food is that place where our collective efforts can have the greatest impact <unk> so we have to ask ourselves what is the right question what would happen if we fed ourselves more nutritious more sustainably grown food <unk> what would be the impact <unk> cheryl barbara <unk>  donna martin <unk> coach parker and the burke county bears i think they know the answer <unk> thank you guys so very much
