 <unk> this is my first trip first time in life i 'm outside of the walls of gaza <unk> i 'm so happy to be here <unk> to feel free to fly the sky <unk> to touch the sky <unk>  but that didn 't happen <unk> simply i live in gaza <unk> there is no airport  all borders are closed on every side we live in one of the biggest <unk> prisons in the world the only thing i can do is just to look up to the sky <unk>  on some days <unk> we are lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours <unk>  when it 's cold we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes <unk> sometimes we make food too  my job in gaza is to arrange <unk> everything for journalists who come to my homeland to tell the stories about what 's going on in gaza  many mornings i had to go to the border area to collect a journalist if anything should happen to the journalist  or if the journalist decides to cover a story the government doesn 't want us to cover bad things could happen navigating through my country helping journalists <unk> filmmakers <unk> news crews  is my working life  i believe my success comes from building a relationship not only with journalists and the news crews <unk> but also with the communities in the gaza strip  these communities who don 't want their stories <unk> be told <unk> i never looked to them as stories or numbers <unk> but like like me they are human beings <unk>  i have built up many relationships over ten years <unk> and guess what this gives me the chance to <unk> in some certain situations <unk> i feel as a woman <unk> i have more power <unk>  many male journalists in my society they want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country  that problem started when the gaza tunnel was being built  with the siege on gaza <unk> tunnels brought people all the basic needs like food <unk> building material other stuff we needed <unk> but not anymore <unk> because the egyptian side flooded them up with water and they are not working anymore drugs were being smuggled <unk> and many young people got addicted too  in the tradition of the palestinian society <unk> it 's forbidden for men to enter the household <unk> male journalists get the story <unk> but i did <unk>  i have a wonderful husband a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society <unk> he 's at home now with my two kids <unk> and i have another one that 's <unk> when i 'm working i call him every two hours <unk> and he knows if he doesn 't hear from me from me he should call my contact the one who gives me access to the story <unk>  which is the one who i trust  one of the times <unk> during the kidnapping of the british journalist alan johnston <unk> i was asked by an american magazine to set up a meeting with the kidnappers in gaza <unk> and i did the journalist covering the story and i were asked to meet outside of his hotel <unk> they came <unk> they picked us up in a black van with black windows <unk> masks on that day <unk>  and they drove us away <unk> far away in the middle of a field <unk> they took our cell phones and we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field <unk> i was so scared that day <unk> a day i will <unk> do what i do i do it because i believe if i didn 't a huge part of the story about gaza will be missing <unk>  there are some more stories i could tell you about my country <unk> and not all of them are bad <unk>  i love my country <unk> despite the terrible situation we live in siege poverty <unk> unemployment but there is life <unk> there are people who are dreamers and amazing people full of energy <unk>  we have wonderful music and a great music school we have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes <unk>  and gaza is the only place in the arab world where muslims and christians <unk> live in strong brotherhood applause during the time of war the hardest part for me is leaving <unk> <unk> the house early in the morning leaving my children i take a picture of them everyday <unk> being a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in gaza <unk>  but when i hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing i just head straight toward it because i want to be there first because these stories should be <unk> when my children were small and we heard the sound of the war  i used to tell them that they were fireworks now they are older <unk> they understand <unk>  i do have terrible nightmares because of all that i witnessed during war times especially these <unk> i still remember a little girl <unk> her name is hala <unk> she 's the only survivor from her family  her picture will be with me forever <unk> i will never forget her i 'm proud that i can stand here and be here today with you <unk>  i 'm proud that i can tell you stories <unk> sad and happy stories about my small corner of the world gaza <unk>  i 'm proud that i am the first female fixer working in gaza <unk> and the funny thing is they call me mr rambo in gaza  i hope one day i will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women all other amazing women i know in <unk> my country <unk> i hope that one day i can help other women in my country to be fixers like me <unk>  and of course sometimes <unk> i feel i can 't do this work anymore <unk> it 's just too much for me <unk> but i remember these words  don 't limit your challenge but challenge your limit <unk> don 't allow others to stand in front of your dreams
