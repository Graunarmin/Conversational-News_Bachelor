 <unk> how many people here would like to live to be at least eighty years old <unk>  yeah  i think we all have this hopeful expectation of living into old age <unk> let 's project out into the future to your future now everyone look at two people one of you probably has alzheimer 's disease <unk> in some way this terrifying disease is likely to affect us all  part of the fear around alzheimer 's stems from the sense that there 's nothing we can do about it  despite decades of research we still have no disease modifying treatment and no cure <unk>  so if we 're lucky enough to live long enough alzheimer 's appears to be our <unk> destiny <unk>  but maybe it doesn 't have to be  what if i told you we could change these statistics <unk> literally change our brain 's destiny <unk> without relying on a cure or advancements in medicine <unk>  let 's begin by looking at what we currently understand about the neuroscience of alzheimer 's <unk>  here 's a picture of two neurons connecting the point of connection this space <unk> circled in red is called the synapse  the synapse is where neurotransmitters are released this is where signals are transmitted where communication happens  this is where we think feel see hear desire <unk> and remember <unk>  and the synapse is where alzheimer 's happens <unk> let 's zoom in on the synapse and look at a cartoon representation of what 's going on during the business of communicating information in addition to releasing neurotransmitters like glutamate into the synapse neurons also release a small peptide called amyloid beta  normally amyloid beta is cleared away metabolized by <unk> the janitor cells of our brains <unk> while the molecular causes of alzheimer 's are still debated most <unk> neuroscientists believe that the disease begins when amyloid beta begins to accumulate <unk>  too much is released or not enough is cleared away and the synapse begins to pile up with amyloid beta <unk>  and when this happens it binds to itself forming sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques  how many people here are forty years old or older you 're afraid to admit it now <unk> initial step into the disease this presence of amyloid plaques accumulating can already be found in your brains <unk> the only way we could be sure of this would be through a pet scan because at this point <unk> you are blissfully unaware you 're not showing any impairments in memory language or cognition  <unk> we think it takes at least fifteen to twenty years of amyloid plaque accumulation before it reaches a tipping point <unk>  then triggering a molecular cascade that causes the clinical symptoms of the disease <unk>  prior to the tipping point <unk> your lapses in memory might include things like  why did i come in this room or oh what 's his name or  where did i put my keys  now <unk> before you all start freaking out again because i know half of you did at least one of those in the last twenty four hours these are all normal kinds of forgetting  in fact i would argue that these examples might not even involve your memory because you didn 't pay attention to where you put your keys in the first place <unk>  after the tipping point <unk> the glitches in <unk> language and cognition are different <unk> instead of eventually finding your keys in your coat pocket or on the table by the door you find them in the refrigerator  or you find them and you think what are these for  so what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point <unk> our microglia janitor cells become <unk> releasing chemicals that cause inflammation and cellular damage <unk> we think they might actually start clearing away <unk> the synapses themselves a crucial neural transport protein called <unk> <unk> and twists itself into something called tangles which choke off the neurons from the inside  by mid stage alzheimer 's we have massive inflammation and tangles and all out war at the synapse and cell death <unk>  so if you were a scientist trying to cure this disease at what point would you ideally want <unk> to intervene  many scientists are betting big on the simplest solution keep amyloid plaques from reaching that tipping point <unk>  which means that drug discovery is largely focused on developing a compound that will prevent eliminate or reduce amyloid plaque accumulation so the cure for alzheimer 's will likely be a preventative medicine 're going to have to take this pill before we reach that tipping point <unk> before the cascade is triggered before we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator <unk>  we think this is why to date these kinds of drugs have failed in clinical trials not because the science wasn 't sound but because the people in these trials were already symptomatic <unk> it was too late  think of amyloid plaques as a lit match at the tipping point the match sets fire to the forest <unk>  once the forest is ablaze it doesn 't do any good to blow out the match you have to blow out the match before the forest catches fire  even before scientists sort this out this information is actually really good news for us because it turns out that the way we live can influence the accumulation of amyloid plaques and so there are things we can do to <unk> keep us from reaching that tipping point <unk>  let 's picture your risk of alzheimer 's as a see saw scale <unk>  we 're going to pile risk factors on one arm and when that arm hits the floor <unk> you are symptomatic and diagnosed with alzheimer 's <unk>  let 's imagine you 're fifty years old you 're not a spring chicken anymore so you 've accumulated some amyloid plaques with age your scale is tipped a little bit <unk>  now let 's look at <unk> your dna <unk> we 've all inherited our genes from our moms and our dads some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it  if you 're like alice in still alice you 've inherited a rare genetic mutation that cranks out amyloid beta <unk> and this alone will tip your scale arm to the ground <unk>  but for most of us the genes we inherit will only tip the arm a bit  for example apoe4 is a gene variant that increases amyloid but you can inherit a copy of apoe4 from mom and dad and still never get alzheimer 's <unk>  which means that for most of us our dna alone does not determine whether we get alzheimer 's <unk>  so what does we can 't do anything about getting older or the genes we 've inherited so far we haven 't changed our brain 's destiny <unk> what about sleep  in <unk> slow wave deep sleep our glial cells rinse cerebral spinal fluid throughout our brains clearing away metabolic waste that accumulated in our synapses while we were awake <unk>  deep sleep is like a power cleanse for the brain  but what happens if you shortchange yourself on sleep many scientists believe that poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predictor of <unk> alzheimer 's <unk> a single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta <unk> and amyloid accumulation has been shown to disrupt sleep <unk> which in turn causes more amyloid to accumulate and so now we have this positive feedback loop that 's going to accelerate the tipping of that scale  what else <unk> high blood pressure diabetes obesity smoking high cholesterol have all been shown to increase our risk of developing alzheimer 's <unk>  some autopsy studies have shown that as many as eighty percent of people with alzheimer 's also had cardiovascular disease aerobic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta in animal models of the disease <unk> <unk> mediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter the tipping of this scale so there are many things we can do to prevent or delay the onset of alzheimer 's <unk> but let 's say you haven 't done any of them let 's say there 's alzheimer 's in your family so you 've likely inherited a gene or two that tips your scale arm a bit <unk>  you 've been burning the candle at both ends for years you love bacon <unk> and you don 't run unless someone 's chasing you let 's imagine that your amyloid plaques have reached that tipping point your scale arm has crashed to the floor <unk> you 've tripped the cascade setting fire to the forest causing inflammation tangles and cell death <unk>  you should be symptomatic for alzheimer 's <unk>  you should be having trouble finding words and keys and remembering what i said at the beginning of this talk <unk>  but you might not be <unk> be  there 's one more thing you can do to protect yourself from experiencing the symptoms of alzheimer 's <unk> even if you have the full blown disease pathology ablaze in your brain it has to do with neural plasticity and cognitive reserve  remember the experience of having alzheimer 's is ultimately a result of losing <unk> the average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses which is fantastic we 've got a lot to work with <unk>  and this isn 't a static number <unk> we gain and lose synapses all the time through a process called neural plasticity  every time we learn something new we are creating and strengthening new neural connections new synapses  in the nun study <unk> six hundred <unk> all over the age of seventy five when the study began were followed for more than two decades  they were regularly given physical checkups and cognitive tests <unk> and when they died their brains were all donated for autopsy  in some of these brains scientists discovered something surprising <unk>  despite the presence of plaques and tangles and brain shrinkage what appeared to be unquestionable <unk> alzheimer 's the nuns who had belonged to these brains showed no signs of having the disease while they were alive <unk>  how can this be <unk>  we think it 's because these nuns had a high level of cognitive reserve <unk> which is a way of saying that they had more functional synapses  people who have more years of formal education who have a high degree of literacy who engage regularly in mentally stimulating activities all have more cognitive reserve  they have an abundance <unk> and a redundancy in neural connections <unk>  so even if they have a disease like alzheimer 's compromising some of their synapses they 've got many extra backup connections <unk> and this buffers them from noticing that anything is amiss <unk>  let 's imagine a simplified example <unk> let 's say you only know one thing about a subject <unk> let 's say it 's about me <unk>  you know that lisa genova wrote still alice and that 's the only thing <unk> you know about me <unk> you have that single neural connection that one synapse <unk>  now imagine you have alzheimer 's <unk> you have plaques and tangles and inflammation and microglia devouring that synapse <unk>  now when someone asks you hey who wrote ' still alice '  you can 't remember because that synapse is either failing or gone you 've forgotten me forever <unk> if you had learned more about me <unk> let 's say you learned four things about me <unk> now imagine you have alzheimer 's and three of those synapses are damaged or destroyed  you still have a way to detour the wreckage you can still remember my name <unk>  so we can be resilient to the presence of alzheimer 's pathology through the recruitment <unk> and we create these pathways <unk> this cognitive reserve <unk> by learning new things ideally we want these new things to be as rich in meaning as possible recruiting sight and sound and associations and emotion <unk>  so this really doesn 't mean doing crossword puzzles you don 't want to simply retrieve information you 've already <unk> because this is like traveling down old familiar streets cruising neighborhoods you already know  you want to pave new neural roads <unk>  building an alzheimer 's resistant brain means learning to speak italian meeting new friends <unk> reading a book or listening to a great ted talk <unk>  and if despite all of this you are someday diagnosed with alzheimer <unk> there are three lessons i 've learned from my grandmother and the dozens of people i 've come to know living with this disease <unk>  diagnosis doesn 't mean you 're dying tomorrow <unk> keep living  you won 't lose your emotional memory you 'll still be able to understand love and joy  you might not remember what i said five minutes ago <unk> but you 'll remember how i made you feel <unk>  and you are more than what you can remember
