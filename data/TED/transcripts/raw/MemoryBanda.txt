 <unk> i 'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from malawi <unk> eileen piri <unk> eileen is only thirteen years old <unk>  but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote i found her poem so interesting so motivating <unk> so i 'll read it to you  she entitled her poem i 'll marry when i want  i 'll marry when i want <unk> my mother can 't force me to marry  my father cannot force me <unk> me to marry <unk>  my uncle my aunt <unk> my brother or sister cannot force me to marry <unk>  no one in the world can force me to marry i 'll marry when i want <unk> even if you beat me even if you chase me away <unk> even if <unk> you do anything bad to me i 'll marry when i want <unk>  i 'll marry when i want <unk> but not before i am well educated <unk>  and not before i am all grown up i 'll marry when i want  <unk> but where i and eileen come from  this poem <unk> which i have just read to you is a warrior 's cry <unk>  i am from malawi malawi is one of the poorest countries very poor <unk> gender equality is questionable  growing up in that country <unk> i couldn 't make my own choices in life <unk> i couldn 't even explore personal opportunities in life i will tell you a story of two different girls two beautiful girls these girls grew up under the same roof  they were eating the same food sometimes they would share clothes <unk> and even shoes <unk>  but their lives ended up differently in two different paths  the other girl is my little sister  my little <unk> sister was only eleven years old when she got pregnant it 's a hurtful thing  not only did it hurt her even me <unk> i was going through a hard time as well  as it is in my culture <unk>  once you reach puberty <unk> stage <unk> you are supposed to go to initiation camps  in these initiation camps <unk> you are taught how to sexually please a man  there is this special day <unk> which they call very special day  where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls <unk> imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day <unk>  most girls end up pregnant <unk>  they even contract hiv and aids and other sexually transmitted diseases for my little sister <unk> she ended up being <unk> she 's only sixteen years old and she has three children  her first marriage did not survive <unk> nor did her second marriage  on the other side there is this girl  she 's amazing <unk> i was thirteen years old <unk>  i was told <unk> you are grown up <unk> you have now reached of age <unk> you 're supposed to go to the initiation camp <unk> go to the initiation camps  you know what the women said to me you are a stupid girl <unk> stubborn  you do not respect the traditions of our society of our community i said no because i knew where i was going i knew what i wanted in life i had a lot of dreams as a young girl  i wanted to get well educated  to find a decent job in the future <unk> i was imagining myself as a lawyer seated on that big chair <unk>  those were the imaginations that were going through my <unk> and i knew that one day i would contribute something a little something to my community <unk>  but every day after refusing women would tell me  look at you <unk> you 're all grown up your little sister has a baby what about you that was the music that i was hearing every day <unk>  and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don 't do something that the community needs them to do when i compared the two stories between me and my sister <unk> i said  why can 't i do something  why can 't i change something that has happened for a long time in our community  that was when i called other girls just like my sister <unk> who have children who have been <unk> in class but they have forgotten how to read and write <unk>  i said come on we can remind each other how to read and write again how to hold the pen how to read to hold the book  it was a great time i had with them <unk>  nor did i just learn a little about them <unk> but they were able to tell me their personal stories  what they were facing every day as young mothers <unk> mothers that was when i was like ' why can 't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers our traditional leaders that these are the wrong things  it was a scary thing to do  because these traditional leaders they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages a hard thing to change but a good <unk> thing to try <unk>  so we tried <unk> it was very hard but we pushed <unk>  and i 'm here to say that in my community it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader <unk> and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be <unk> in my community  that was the first time a community <unk> they had to call the bylaws the first bylaw that protected girls in our community <unk>  we did not stop there <unk>  we forged ahead <unk> we were determined to fight for girls <unk> not just in my community <unk> but even in other communities  when the child marriage bill was being presented in february <unk> we were there at the parliament house  every day when the members of parliament were entering we were telling them would you please support the bill  and we don 't have much technology like here <unk> but we have our <unk> phones so we said why can 't we get their numbers and text them so we did that <unk> it was a good thing so when the bill passed we texted them back thank you for supporting the bill and when the bill was signed by the <unk> 's a good thing to know that the bill passed <unk> but let me tell you this there are countries where eighteen is <unk> the legal marriage age <unk> but don 't we hear cries of women and girls every day <unk>  every day <unk> girls ' lives are being wasted away <unk>  this is high time for leaders to honor their commitment <unk>  in honoring this commitment <unk> it means keeping girls ' issues at heart every time we don 't have to be subjected as second but they have to know that women as we are in this room  we are not just women we are not just girls <unk> we are extraordinary we can do more <unk>  and another thing for malawi <unk> and not just malawi but other countries the laws which are <unk> you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced the law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there <unk>  they need to be publicized at the local level at the community level  where girls ' issues are very striking  girls face issues <unk> difficult issues at the community level every day <unk> so if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them <unk>  they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them  and another thing i would say is that girls ' voices and women 's voices are beautiful they are there but we cannot do this alone <unk>  male advocates they have to jump in to step in and work together it 's a collective work  what we need is what girls elsewhere need good education and above all not to marry whilst eleven <unk> we can transform the legal the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights i am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage <unk> in a generation this is the moment where a girl and a girl and millions of girls worldwide will be able to say i will marry when i want
