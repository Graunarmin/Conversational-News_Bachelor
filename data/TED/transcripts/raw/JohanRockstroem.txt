 <unk> unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth  this is bad news <unk>  but perhaps surprising to you it 's also part of the good news we 're the first generation thanks to science to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability <unk> ability of planet earth to support human development as we know it it 's also good news because the planetary risks we 're facing are so large that business as usual is not an option <unk>  in fact we 're in a phase where transformative change is necessary which opens the window for innovation for new ideas and new paradigms <unk> this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability on this journey i 'd like to bring apart from yourselves a good friend <unk>  a stakeholder who 's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues <unk> a stakeholder who refuses to compromise planet earth so i thought i 'd bring her with me today on stage to have her as a witness of <unk> a remarkable journey <unk>  which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we 've had over the past ten thousand years  this is the living conditions on the planet over the last one hundred thousand years it 's a very important period it 's roughly half the period when we 've been fully modern humans on the planet we 've had the same roughly abilities that developed civilizations as we know it  this is the environmental conditions on the planet here used as a proxy  <unk> temperature variability it was a jumpy ride eighty thousand years back in a crisis we leave africa <unk> we colonize australia in another crisis sixty thousand years back we leave asia for europe in another crisis <unk> forty thousand years back <unk> and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase the only period in the whole history of the planet <unk> that we know of that can <unk> <unk> support human development a thousand years into this period we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns we go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people <unk> we are today <unk> the mesopotamian culture we invent agriculture we domesticate animals and plants <unk>  you have the roman the greek and the story as you know it the only phase as we know it that can support humanity the trouble is we 're putting a quadruple sqeeze on <unk> <unk> this poor planet <unk> a quadruple sqeeze which as its first squeeze has <unk> people committed to nine billion people it 's an equity issue as well <unk> the majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority <unk> the twenty percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid 18th century <unk>  the majority of the planet <unk> aspiring for development having the right for development are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle <unk> a momentous pressure  the second pressure on the planet is of course the climate agenda the big issue where the policy interpretation <unk> of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at four hundred and fifty ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees  to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the west antarctic ice sheet <unk> holding six meters level rising the risk of destabilizing the greenland ice sheet holding another seven meters sea level rising  now you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet <unk> a resilient planet but unfortunately the third pressure <unk> is the ecosystem decline never have we seen in the past fifty years such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet <unk>  one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term in our forests land and biodiversity  the forth pressure is surprise the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old <unk> in our so to say linear systems and that in fact surprise is universal as systems tip over very rapidly abruptly and often irreversibly this dear friends poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale  we may in fact have entered a new geological era the anthropocene where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level  now as a scientist what 's the evidence for this well the evidence is unfortunately <unk>  ample it 's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change <unk>  you can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being nitrous oxide methane deforestation overfishing land degredation loss of species they all show the same pattern over the past two <unk> hundred years  simultaneously they branch off in the mid 50s ten years after the second world war  showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid 50s you see for the first time an imprint on the global level <unk>  and i can tell you you enter the disciplinary research in each of these <unk> you find something remarkably important the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves  that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet <unk> the decade when we have to bend the curves  now as if this was not enough to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states separated by thresholds illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system now the system may gradually under pressure of climate change <unk> erosion biodiversity loss lose the depth of the cup the resilience but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly <unk> under a threshold be tipping over upff sorry <unk> changing state <unk> where new biophysical logic takes over new species take over and the system gets locked do we have evidence of this yes <unk> coral reef systems <unk>  biodiverse low nutrient hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing unsustainable tourism climate change <unk>  a trigger and the system tips over <unk>  loses its resilience soft corals take over <unk> we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development the arctic a beautiful system a regulating biome at the planetary level <unk> taking the knock after knock on climate change <unk> appearing to be in a good state no scientist could predict that in two thousand and <unk> <unk> seven suddenly what could be crossing a threshold <unk> the system suddenly very surprisingly loses thirty to forty percent of its summer ice cover  <unk> logic may change it may get locked in an undesired state <unk> because it changes color absorbs more energy and the system may get stuck in my mind the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation  as a sideline you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic to be able to control the oil resources if we have evidence which we now have that wetlands forests [ unclear ] monsoon system the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way  thirty or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time do we have to put the planet into the the pot  so we have to ask ourselves are we threatening this extraordinarily stable holocene state  are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we 're coming too close to thresholds that <unk> could lead to deleterious and very undesired if now catastrophic change for human development <unk>  you know <unk> you don 't want to stand there  in fact you 're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing at the foaming slippery waters at the threshold in fact there 's a fence quite upstream of this threshold beyond which you are in a danger zone and this is the new paradigm which we gathered two three years <unk> back <unk> recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future <unk>  aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts is of the past now we to ask ourselves which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the holocene  and could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems science identify the thresholds the points where we may <unk> may expect nonlinear change <unk> and could we even define a planetary boundary a fence within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity this work which was published in nature  late two thousand and nine  after a number of years of analysis <unk> led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which under active stewardship would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space these include of course climate it may surprise you that it 's not only climate  but it shows that we are interconnected among many systems on the planet with the three big systems climate change stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems where the scientific evidence of large scale <unk> of the history of the planet <unk> but we also include what we call the slow variables the systems that under the hood regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet <unk> land use change rate of biodiversity loss freshwater use  functions which regulate biomass on the planet <unk> carbon sequestration diversity <unk> and then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify air pollution including warming gases and air polluting sulfates and nitrates <unk> but also chemical pollution <unk>  together these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the anthropocene <unk> understanding that the planet is a complex self regulating system  in fact <unk> most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three <unk> one for all all for one you degrade forests you go beyond the boundary on land <unk> you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable the drama here is <unk> in fact that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one <unk>  if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development  now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries what you see here in black line is the safe operating space the quantified boundaries as suggested by this analysis <unk> the yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point the pre industrial point where we 're very safely in the safe operating space  in the ' 50s we start branching out  in the ' 60s already through the green revolution and the <unk> haber bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere you know human 's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole <unk> we don 't transgress the climate boundary until the early ' 90s actually <unk> right after rio and today we are in a situation where we estimate that we 've transgressed three boundaries the rate of biodiversity loss <unk> which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs degrees of freedom on the others but we are approaching fast on land water phosphorus and oceans but this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity to put the light on our so far overpowered industrial vehicle which operates as if we 're only on a dark straight highway  now the question then is how gloomy is this is then sustainable development utopia <unk> there 's no science to suggest in fact there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change <unk> that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative <unk> a transformative gear across scales the drama is of course is that two hundred countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction <unk>  but it changes fundamentally <unk> our governance and management paradigm from the current linear command and control thinking <unk> looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible a much more adaptive approach where we recognize that redundancy both in social and environmental systems is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change  we have to invest in persistence in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup we have to invest in transformations capability <unk> moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis and of course to adapt <unk> to unavoidable change <unk> this is a new paradigm we 're not doing that at any scale on governance but is it happening anywhere do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level <unk>  and the list can start becoming longer and longer there 's good news here for example from latin america where <unk> farming systems of the ' 50s and ' 60s led farming basically to a dead end with lower and lower yields degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in paraguay uruguay and a number of countries <unk> brazil  leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies which today for example <unk>  in some countries have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch zero till farming which not only produces more food but also sequesters carbon  the australian great barrier reef is another success story under the realization from <unk> tourist operators fishermen <unk> the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime  global change <unk> beautification rack culture overfishing and unsustainable tourism all together placing this system in the realization of crisis <unk> but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build <unk> resilience acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole and then allow for much more redundancy in the system  sweden the country i come from has other examples where wetlands in southern sweden were seen as as in many countries as <unk> these into a key component of sustainable urban planning so crisis leading into opportunities  now what about the future <unk>  well the future of course has one massive challenge which is feeding a world of nine billion people we need nothing less than a new green revolution and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink <unk> it has to basically do this on current land <unk> cannot expand anymore <unk> because it erodes the planetary boundaries <unk> we cannot continue consuming water as we do today with twenty five percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean <unk> and we need a transformation well <unk> interestingly and based on my work and others in africa for example we 've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts  sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers ' fields  and innovations in tillage systems we can triple quadruple yield levels on current land  elinor ostrom <unk> the latest nobel laureate of economics clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in <unk> can deal with the global commons at a large scale <unk>  but even on the hard policy area we have innovations we know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low carbon economy in record time <unk> and what shall we do <unk> everybody talks about carbon taxes it won 't work emission schemes but for example one policy measure feed in tariffs on the energy system which is already applied from china doing it on offshore wind systems all the way to the u s where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy but you can subsidize electricity to poor people you get people out of poverty <unk> you solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector while at the same time <unk> stimulating innovation examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level <unk>  <unk> no doubt opportunity here and we can list many many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet <unk> the key though in all of these the red thread is the shift in mindset moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future <unk> where we instead backcast our future <unk> what is the playing field on the planet <unk> what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate and then backtrack innovations within that but of course the drama is it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option <unk>  so there is scientific evidence  they sort of say the harsh news that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization in fact what we have to do over the next forty years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we 're in today  now science indicates that yes we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space if we move simultaneously <unk> collaborating on a global level from <unk> <unk> local to global scale <unk> in transformative options which build resilience on a finite planet <unk> thank you
