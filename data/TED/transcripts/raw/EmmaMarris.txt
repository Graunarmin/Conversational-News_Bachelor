 <unk> we are stealing nature from our children now  when i say this i don 't mean that we are destroying nature that they will have wanted us to preserve  although that is unfortunately also the case what i mean here is that we 've started to define nature in a way that 's so <unk> purist and so strict that under the definition we 're creating for ourselves there won 't be any nature left for our children when they 're adults <unk>  but there 's a fix for this so let me explain  right now <unk> humans use half of the world to live to grow their crops and their timber to pasture their animals <unk> if you added up all the human beings we would weigh ten times as <unk> much as all the wild mammals put together <unk>  we cut roads through the forest  we have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches <unk> we 've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers <unk>  and of course <unk> we 've changed the chemistry of the air <unk>  <unk> more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in one thousand seven hundred and fifty  so all of these changes and many others have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the anthropocene  and this is a term that some geologists are suggesting we should give to our current epoch <unk> given how pervasive human influence has been over it now it 's still just a proposed <unk> but i think it 's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet <unk>  so where does this put nature <unk> what counts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by humans <unk>  so twenty five years ago environmental writer bill mckibben said that because nature was a thing apart from man and because climate change meant that every centimeter of the earth was altered by man then nature was over <unk> his book the end of nature  i disagree with this i just disagree with this i disagree with this definition of nature <unk>  because fundamentally we are animals right like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet <unk> and all the other plants and all the other microbes and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman  i think that nature is anywhere where life thrives <unk> anywhere where there are multiple species together <unk> anywhere that 's green and blue and thriving and filled with life and growing <unk>  and under that definition things look a little bit different  now <unk> i understand that there are certain parts of this nature that speak to us in a special way places like yellowstone or the mongolian steppe or the great barrier reef or the serengeti places that we think of as kind of edenic representations of a nature before we screwed everything up <unk>  and in a way they are less impacted by our day to day activities many of these places have no <unk> roads or few roads so on like such <unk> but ultimately even these edens are deeply influenced by humans <unk> now let 's just take north <unk> north america for example since that 's where we 're meeting  so between about fifteen thousand years ago when people first came here they started a process of interacting with the nature that led to the extinction of a big slew of large bodied animals  from the mastodon to the giant ground sloth <unk> all of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us <unk>  and when those animals went extinct you know the ecosystems didn 't stand still massive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests changed the composition of forest from one tree to another  so even in these edens even in these perfect looking places that seem to remind us of a past before humans  we 're essentially looking at a humanized landscape  not just these prehistoric humans but <unk> historical humans indigenous people all the way up until the moment when the first colonizers showed up and the case is the same for the other continents as well humans have just been involved in nature in a very influential way for a very long time now just recently someone told me oh but there are still wild places <unk> i was just there  it 's awesome <unk> national geographic sent me to man national park which is in the peruvian amazon <unk> but it 's a big chunk of rainforest <unk> uncleared no roads protected as a national park one of the most in fact biodiverse parks in the world <unk>  and when i got in there with my canoe <unk> what did i find <unk>  but people  people have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years people live there and they don 't just <unk> float over the jungle they have a meaningful relationship with the landscape  they hunt <unk>  they grow crops <unk> they domesticate crops they use the natural resources to build their houses to thatch their houses they even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals these people are there and they 're interacting with the environment in a way that 's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment now i was with an <unk> anthropologist on this trip <unk> and he told me as we were floating down the river he said there are no demographic voids in the amazon  this statement has really stuck with me because what it means is that the whole amazon is like this there 's people everywhere <unk>  and many other tropical forests are the same and not just tropical forests people have influenced ecosystems in the past <unk> and they continue to influence them in <unk> present even in places where they 're harder to notice <unk> so <unk> if all of the definitions of nature that that we might want to use that involve it being untouched by humanity or not having people in it if all of those actually give us a result where we don 't have any nature <unk> then maybe they 're the wrong definitions maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple <unk> species by the presence of a thriving life now if we do it that way what do we get <unk> it 's this kind of miracle all of a sudden there 's nature all around us all of a sudden we see this monarch caterpillar munching on this plant and we realize that there it is and it 's in this empty lot in chattanooga and look at this empty lot i mean <unk> there 's like probably a dozen minimum plant species growing there supporting all kinds of insect life  and this is a completely unmanaged space a completely wild space <unk> this is a kind of wild nature right under our nose that we don 't even notice <unk> and there 's an interesting little paradox too so this nature this <unk> suburban agricultural existence that flies under the radar <unk> it 's arguably more wild than a national park <unk>  because national parks are very carefully managed in the 21st century <unk>  crater lake in southern oregon which is my closest national park is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the <unk> but they 're managing it carefully one of the issues they have now is white bark pine die off white bark pine is a beautiful charismatic i 'll say it 's a charismatic that grows up at high altitude and it 's got all these problems right now with disease <unk> there 's a blister rust that was introduced bark beetle  so to deal with this the park service has been planting rust resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park <unk>  even in areas that they are otherwise <unk> managing as wilderness <unk> and they 're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas as i saw last time i went hiking there  and this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think national parks are heavily managed <unk>  the wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure fires are suppressed <unk> fires are started non native species are <unk> native species are reintroduced <unk> and in fact i took a look and banff national park is doing all of the things i just listed suppressing fire having fire radio collaring wolves reintroducing bison  it takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched  and in a further irony these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard sometimes <unk> lot of us like to go there and because we 're managing them to be stable in the face of a changing planet <unk> they often are becoming more fragile over time  which means that they 're the absolute worst places to take your children on vacation  because you can 't do anything there you can 't climb the trees you can 't fish the fish you can 't make a campfire out in the middle of <unk> you can 't take home the pinecones there are so many rules and restrictions that from a child 's point of view <unk> this is like the worst nature ever  because children don 't want to hike through a beautiful landscape for five hours and then look at a beautiful view that 's maybe what we want to do as adults but what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot and just tinker with it just work with it just pick it up build a house build a fort do something like that  additionally these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live <unk> and they 're expensive to get to they 're hard to visit so this means <unk> <unk> that they 're only available to the elites and that 's a real problem the <unk> just staying inside <unk> and when they asked them why what are the barriers to going outside the response of sixty one percent was there are no natural areas near my home  and this is crazy <unk> this is just patently false <unk>  i mean seventy one percent of people in the us live within a 10 minute walk of a city park <unk>  and i 'm sure the figures are similar in other countries <unk> and that doesn 't even count your back garden <unk> the urban creek the empty lot everybody lives near nature <unk>  every kid lives near nature we 've just somehow forgotten how to see it we 've spent too much time watching david attenborough documentaries where the nature is really sexy and we 've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally <unk> right outside our door the nature of the street tree <unk>  so here 's an example <unk> philadelphia <unk> there 's this cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground that 's been abandoned  now <unk> this may sound like the beginning of the high line story in manhattan and it 's very similar except they haven 't developed this into a park yet although they 're working on it  so for now <unk> it 's still this little sort of secret wilderness in the heart of philadelphia <unk> and if you know <unk> the hole is in the chain link fence you can scramble up to the top and you can find this completely wild meadow just floating above the city of philadelphia <unk>  every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there <unk> this is completely autonomous self willed nature <unk> and it 's right in the middle of the city  and they 've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys and there are over fifty plant species up there <unk> this is an ecosystem a functioning ecosystem <unk>  it 's creating soil it 's sequestering carbon there 's pollination going on i mean this is really an ecosystem <unk>  so scientists have started calling ecosystems like these novel ecosystems because they 're often dominated by non native species and because they 're just super weird they 're just <unk> <unk> unlike anything we 've ever seen before for so long we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash  <unk> fields timber plantations that are not being managed on a day to day basis second growth forests generally the entire east coast where after agriculture moved west the forest sprung up <unk>  and of course <unk> pretty much all of hawaii where novel ecosystems are the norm where exotic species totally dominate  this forest here has queensland maple it has sword ferns from southeast asia <unk> you can make your own novel ecosystem too it 's really simple you just stop mowing your lawn <unk> ilkka hanski was an ecologist in finland and he did this experiment himself he just stopped mowing his lawn and after a few years <unk> he had some grad students come and they did sort of a bio blitz of his backyard <unk>  and they found three hundred and seventy five plant species <unk> including two endangered species when you 're up there on that on that future high line of philadelphia <unk>  surrounded by this wildness surrounded by this diversity this abundance this vibrance <unk>  you can look over the side and you can see a local playground for a local school <unk>  and that 's what it looks like  these children have that <unk> under my definition there 's a lot of the planet that counts as nature <unk> but this would be one of the few places that wouldn 't count as nature there 's nothing there except humans <unk> no other plants  no other animals  and what i really wanted to do was just like throw a ladder over the side and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow  in a way i feel like this is the choice that faces us if we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good  we might as well just pave them over <unk> world where everything is changing we need to be very careful about how we define nature  in order not to steal it from our children we have to do two things first we cannot define nature as that which is untouched <unk>  this never made any sense anyway nature has not been untouched for thousands of years <unk>  and it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit and have a relationship with  including only nature that children cannot touch which brings me to the second thing that we have to do which is that we have to let children touch nature <unk>  because that which is untouched is unloved  we face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet climate change <unk> is among them <unk> there 's others too habitat loss is my favorite thing to freak out about in the middle of the but in order to solve them we need people smart dedicated people who care about nature <unk>  and the only way we 're going to raise up a generation of people who care about nature is by letting them touch nature <unk>  i have a fort theory of ecology <unk> fort theory of conservation every ecologist i know <unk> every conservation biologist i know <unk> every conservation professional i know <unk> built forts when they were kids  if we have a generation that doesn 't know how to build a fort we 'll have a generation that doesn 't know how to care about nature <unk>  and i don 't want to be the one to tell this kid who is on a special program that takes philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods and takes them to city parks  i don 't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he 's holding is a non native invasive weed that he should throw away <unk> as trash <unk> i think i would much rather learn from this boy that no matter where this plant comes from it is beautiful and it deserves to be touched and appreciated thank
