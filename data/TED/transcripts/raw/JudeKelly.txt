 <unk> why do we think that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance and stories by women are thought to be merely about women <unk> my grandmother left school when she was twelve she had fourteen children  my mother left school when she was fifteen <unk> she was a secretary <unk> i graduated from university to become a theater director <unk>  and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i 'll never meet fought for women to have rights  get the vote <unk> get education have progress <unk> and i 'm determined to do <unk> i started a festival called wow women of the world seven years ago and it 's now in twenty countries across five continents and one of those countries is somaliland in africa <unk>  so i traveled there last year <unk> and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves the <unk> these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world <unk>  these paintings are thought to be round about nine thousand to eleven thousand years old <unk>  art  what humanity has done ever since it evolved <unk>  it 's how we speak about ourselves <unk> how we understand our identity how we look at our surroundings who we find out about each other because of the meaning of our lives <unk> lives that 's what art is for  so look at this little picture i think it 's a little girl <unk> i thought it was a bit like me when i was a little girl <unk> and i thought well who painted this joyful <unk> youthful figure <unk>  and i asked the curator of the caves i said tell me about the men and women who painted these  and he looked at me absolutely askance <unk> and he said women didn 't paint these pictures and i said well it was eleven thousand years ago i said how do you know  and he said women don 't do these things men made these marks women don 't  now <unk> i wasn 't really surprised <unk> because that 's an attitude that i 've seen continuously all my <unk> life as a theater maker  we are told that divine knowledge comes down through the masculine <unk>  whether it be to the imam <unk> the priest <unk> the rabbi <unk> the holy man similarly we 're told that creative genius resides in the masculine that it is <unk> the masculine that will be able to tell us about who we really are that the masculine will tell the universal story on behalf of all of us  whereas women artists will really just talk about women 's experiences women 's issues only really relevant to women and of passing interest to men and really only some men and it 's that conviction  <unk> that i think colors so much of whether we 're prepared to believe that women 's stories really matter <unk> and unless we 're prepared to believe that women 's stories really matter  then women 's rights don 't really matter <unk> and then change can 't really come <unk> i want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal <unk> i took my two children when they were little caroline was eight and robby was five to see e t  and it 's a fantastic story of this little alien who ends up in an american family with a mum two brothers and a sister <unk>  but he wants to go <unk> not only that but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him <unk> and they 're looking for him <unk>  so the children have a plot they decide they 're going to take him back to his spaceship as soon as they can  and they plop him in a bicycle basket and off they ride <unk>  but unfortunately <unk> the baddies have found out and they 're catching up and they 've got sirens and they 've got their guns they 've got the <unk> closing up on the children and the children are never going to make it and then all of a sudden magically <unk> the bikes fly up in the air <unk>  over the clouds <unk> over the moon <unk> and they 're going to save e t  so i turn to see my children 's faces <unk> and robby is enraptured <unk> he 's there with them he 's saving e t he 's a happy boy <unk>  <unk> why can 't i come and then all of a sudden i realized they weren 't children they were boys all boys  and caroline who had invested so much in e t well she wasn 't invited to save him <unk> and she felt humiliated and spurned <unk> so i wrote to steven spielberg and i said i don 't know if you understand the psychological importance of what 's happened and are you prepared to pay for the therapy bills twenty years later i haven 't had a word back from him <unk> but i 'm still hopeful <unk> but i thought it was interesting because if you read reviews of what he intended with e t he says very specifically  i wanted the world to understand that we should love and embrace difference  but somehow he didn 't include the idea of girls ' difference in this thinking <unk>  he thought he was writing a story about all humanity caroline thought he was marginalizing half of humanity <unk>  he thought he was writing a story about human <unk> goodness she thought he was writing a lad 's heroic adventure <unk> and this is common  men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication  but of course how could they be they are writing from male experience through male 's eyes  we have to have a look at this ourselves we have to be <unk> prepared to go back through all our books and our films all our favorite things <unk> and say actually this is written by a male artist not an artist  we have to see that so many of these stories are written through a male perspective <unk> which is fine <unk>  but then females need to have fifty percent of the rights for the stage <unk> the film the novel the place of creativity  let me talk about hamlet to be or not to be that is the question <unk>  but it 's not my question my question is why was i taught as a young woman that this was the quintessential example of human dilemma and human experience it 's a marvelous story but actually <unk> it 's about a young <unk> be able to make it as a powerful figure in a male world unless he takes revenge for his father 's murder <unk>  he talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option <unk>  but the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide ophelia <unk> after she 's been humiliated and abused by him never gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings <unk>  finished with ophelia he turns on his mum because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex  laughter it is a great story <unk>  but it is a story about male conflict male dilemma male struggle <unk>  but i was told this was the story of human beings <unk> despite the fact that it only had two women in it  and unless i reeducate myself i am always going to think that women 's stories <unk> matter less than men 's  a woman could have written hamlet but she would have written it differently <unk> and it wouldn 't have had global recognition  as the writer margaret atwood says when a man writes about doing the dishes <unk> it 's realism  when a woman writes about doing it it 's an unfortunate genetic <unk> this is not just something that belongs to then i mean  when i was a young girl wanting desperately to be a theater director <unk> this is what my male lecturer said to me  well there are three women directors in britain he said jude  there 's joan knight who 's a lesbian there 's joan littlewood who 's retired and there 's buzz goodbody who 's just killed herself <unk> so which of those three would you like <unk> slur on gay women the fact is he wanted to humiliate me <unk>  he thought it was silly that i wanted to be a director <unk>  and i told my friend marin alsop the conductor and she said oh yes well <unk> my music teacher said exactly the same he said ' women don 't conduct '  but all these years later <unk> we 've made our mark <unk> the current head of the paris conservatoire said recently it takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony  and women are too weak  laughter the artist george baselitz said well the fact is women can 't paint <unk> well they can 't paint very well the writer v s naipaul said two years <unk> i can read two paragraphs and know immediately if it 's written by a woman and i just stop reading because it 's not worthy of me audience whoa  and it goes on  we have to find a way of stopping young girls and women feeling not only that their story doesn 't matter <unk> but they 're not allowed to be the storyteller <unk>  because once you feel that you can 't stand in the central space and speak on behalf of <unk> the world <unk> you will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small select group  you will tend to do smaller work on smaller stages your economic power will be less your reach of audiences will be less  and your credit will be less as an artist <unk> and we do finally give artists these incredible prominent spaces <unk> the world because they are our storytellers  now <unk> why should it matter to you if you 're not an artist <unk> supposing you 're an accountant or an entrepreneur or a medic or a scientist should you care about women artists  absolutely you must <unk> because as you can see from the cave paintings  all civilizations all of humanity have relied upon artists <unk> tell the human story <unk> and if the human story is finally told by men take my word for it <unk> it will be about men  so let 's make a change let 's make a change to all our institutions and not just in the west don 't forget this message of <unk> of women to hold creative genius is being told to girls and women in nigeria in china in russia in indonesia all over the world girls and women are being told that they can 't finally hold the idea of creative inspiration and i want to ask you do you believe that do you believe that women can be a creative genius <unk> support women artists <unk> buy their work insist that their voices are heard find platforms on which their voices will be made  and remember this  that in a sense if we 're going to get past this moment of a world where we know that we are unequal  it 's artists who have to imagine a different world <unk> i 'm calling on all artists women and men to imagine a <unk> gender equal world <unk>  let 's paint it <unk> let 's draw it <unk> let 's write about it let 's film it and if we could imagine it <unk> then we would have the energy and the stamina to work towards it when i see this little <unk> eleven thousand years ago <unk> i want to know that the little girl now can stand there and think she 's entitled to her dreams she 's entitled to her destiny and she 's entitled to speak on behalf of the whole world be recognized for it and applauded
