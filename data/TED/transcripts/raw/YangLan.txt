 <unk> the night before i was heading for scotland i was invited to host the final of china 's got talent show in shanghai with the eighty thousand live audience in the stadium guess who was the performing guest <unk> susan boyle and i told her i 'm going to scotland the next day  she sang beautifully <unk> and she even managed to say a few words in chinese <unk> was a line from our chinese parallel susan boyle a <unk> a vegetable vendor in shanghai who loves singing western opera <unk> but she didn 't understand any english or french or italian so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in chinese  and the last sentence of nessun dorma that <unk> she was singing in the stadium was green onion for free  so [ as ] susan boyle was saying that eighty thousand live audience sang together that was hilarious <unk>  so i guess both susan boyle and this vegetable vendor in shanghai belonged to <unk> the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment <unk>  yet their courage and talent brought them through and a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams <unk>  well being different is not that difficult <unk> we are all different from different perspectives <unk> but i think being different is good because you present a different point of view you may have the chance to make a difference  my generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of china that has made so many changes in the past twenty thirty years  i remember that in the year of one thousand nine hundred and ninety when i was graduating from college <unk> i was applying for a job in the sales department of the first <unk> hotel in beijing great wall sheraton it 's still there  so after being interrogated by this japanese manager for a half an hour <unk> he finally said so miss yang  do you have any questions to ask me  i summoned my courage and poise and said yes but could you let me <unk> actually do you sell  i didn 't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five star hotel that was the first day i set my foot in a five star hotel <unk>  around the same time i was going through an audition the first ever open audition by national television in china with another thousand college girls <unk> the producer told us they were looking for some sweet <unk> innocent and beautiful fresh face so when it was my turn <unk> i stood up and said why [ do ] women 's personalities on television always have to be beautiful sweet <unk> innocent and you know <unk> supportive <unk> why can 't they have their own ideas and their own voice i thought i kind of <unk> offended them but actually they were impressed by my words <unk> and so i was in the second round of competition <unk> and then the third and the fourth after seven rounds of competition <unk> i was the last one to survive it  so i was on a national television prime time show  and believe it or not that was the first show on chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own <unk> and my weekly audience at that time was between two hundred to three hundred million people <unk>  well after a few years i decided to go to the u s and columbia university to pursue my postgraduate studies and then started my own media company <unk> which was unthought of <unk> during the years that i started my career <unk> so we do a lot of things i 've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past and sometimes i have young people approaching me say lan you changed my life and i feel proud of that  but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country i was in beijing 's bidding for the olympic games i was representing the shanghai expo i saw china embracing the world and vice versa <unk> sometimes i 'm thinking what are today 's young generation up to  how are they different and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china or at large the world <unk>  so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social <unk> they look like <unk> well this is a girl called guo meimei twenty years old beautiful she showed off her expensive bags clothes and car <unk> on her microblog <unk> which is the chinese version of twitter <unk> and she claimed to be the general manager of red cross at the chamber of commerce <unk>  <unk> a turmoil <unk> against the credibility of red cross  the controversy was so heated that the red cross had to open a press conference to clarify it and the investigation is going on  so far  as of today we know that she herself made up that title probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity all those expensive items <unk> were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend who used to be a board member member in a subdivision of red cross at chamber of commerce it 's very complicated to explain <unk>  but anyway the public still doesn 't buy it it is still boiling it shows us a general mistrust of <unk> lacked transparency in the past <unk> and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog  microblog boomed in the year of two thousand and ten with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled a major news portal alone has more than one hundred and forty million <unk> two hundred million the most popular blogger it 's not me it 's a movie star <unk> and she has more than nine point five million followers or fans about eighty percent of those microbloggers are young people under thirty years old <unk>  and because as you know the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government social media <unk> to let the steam out a little bit  but because you don 't have many other openings the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong active and even violent <unk>  so through microblogging <unk> we are able to understand chinese youth even better <unk>  so how are they different first of all most of them were born in the <unk> by families who favored boys to girls <unk> now we have ended up with thirty million more young men than women  that could pose a potential danger to the society but who knows we 're in a globalized world so they can look for girlfriends from other countries <unk> most <unk> have fairly good education the illiteracy rate in china among this generation is under one percent  in cities <unk> eighty percent of kids go to college <unk> but they are facing an aging china with a population above <unk> sixty five years <unk> <unk> old coming up with seven point some percent this year and about to be fifteen percent by the year of two thousand and thirty and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially and taking <unk> care of them when they 're sick <unk> so it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy <unk> years old  so making a living is not that easy for young people college graduates are not in short supply in urban areas college graduates find the starting salary is about four hundred u s dollars a month  while the average rent is above $ five hundred <unk> so what do they do they have to share space squeezed in in very limited space to save money and they call themselves tribe of ants  and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment <unk> they figured out they have to work for thirty to forty years to afford their first apartment  that ratio in america would only <unk> cost a couple five years to earn but in china it 's thirty to forty years with the skyrocketing real estate price  among the two hundred million migrant workers <unk> sixty percent of them are young people <unk>  they find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas most of them don 't want to go back to the countryside <unk> but they don 't have the sense of belonging they work <unk> longer hours with less income <unk> less social welfare and they 're more vulnerable to job losses <unk> subject to inflation <unk> tightening loans from banks <unk> appreciation of the renminbi or decline of demand from europe or america for the products they produce <unk> appalling incident in a southern oem manufacturing compound in china thirteen young workers in their late teens and early <unk> 20s committed suicide just one by one like causing a contagious disease <unk> but they died because of all different personal reasons but this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society <unk> about the isolation both physical and mental  of these migrant workers for those who do return back to the countryside they find themselves very welcome locally because with the knowledge skills and networks <unk> they have learned in the cities with the assistance of the internet <unk> they 're able to create more jobs upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market <unk> <unk> so for the past few years the coastal areas they found themselves in a shortage of labor these diagrams show a more general social background the first one is the engels coefficient which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade  in terms of family income to about 37 some percent <unk> but then in the <unk> two years it goes up again to thirty nine percent indicating a rising living cost the gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of zero point four <unk> now it 's zero point five even worse than that in america showing us the income inequality <unk>  and so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of <unk> the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread <unk> so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities <unk> or or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest <unk>  <unk> social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand for the past decade or so a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property <unk>  and it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation sometimes people get <unk> and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest <unk>  so when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the internet people cry for the government to take actions to stop this  so the good news is that earlier this year the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court <unk>  similarly many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the internet <unk> we heard about polluted air <unk> polluted water <unk> poisoned food and guess what we have faked beef <unk>  they have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish and it turns it to look like beef <unk> and then lately <unk> people are very concerned about cooking oil because thousands of people have been found [ refining ] cooking oil from restaurant slop <unk>  so all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the internet <unk> and fortunately we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns <unk>  while young people seem to be very sure about their participation in but sometimes they 're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life  china is soon to pass the u s as the number one market for luxury brands that 's not including the chinese expenditures in europe and elsewhere <unk> but you know what half of those consumers are earning a <unk> below two thousand u s dollars they 're not rich at all they 're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status <unk>  and this is a girl explicitly saying on a tv dating show that she would rather cry in a bmw than smile on a bicycle <unk>  but of course we do have young people who would still prefer to smile whether in a bmw or [ on ] a bicycle <unk> the next picture you see a very popular phenomenon called naked wedding or naked marriage it does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding <unk> but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house without a car without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet to show their commitment to true love <unk>  and also people are doing good through social media and the first picture showed us that a truck caging five hundred homeless and kidnapped <unk> dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging <unk> people were donating money dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck and after hours of negotiation five hundred dogs were rescued and here also people are helping to find missing children a father posted his son <unk> 's picture onto the internet after thousands of resends in relay <unk> the child was found and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging <unk>  so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years  happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values <unk> but also it 's about the environment <unk> are thinking about the following questions are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher gdp <unk>  how are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth to keep sustainability and stability <unk>  and also how capable is the <unk> to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time i guess these are the questions people are going to answer and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves <unk> thank you very much
