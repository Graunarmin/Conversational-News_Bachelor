 <unk> i was ten years old when i learned what the word genocide meant it was two thousand and three and my people were being brutally attacked because of their race hundreds <unk> a nation torn apart at the hands of its own government  my mother and father immediately began speaking out against the crisis i didn 't really understand it <unk> except for the fact that it was destroying my parents  one day i walked in on my mother crying <unk> and i asked her why we are burying so many people i don 't remember the words that she chose to describe genocide to her 10 year old daughter <unk> but i remember the feeling  we felt completely alone as if no one could hear us as if we were essentially invisible  this is when i wrote my first poem about darfur  i wrote poetry to convince people to hear and see us and that 's how i learned the thing that changed <unk> me it 's easy to be seen <unk> i mean look at me i 'm a young african woman with a scarf around my head <unk> an american accent on my tongue and a story that makes even the most brutal of monday mornings seem inviting <unk> but it 's hard to convince people that they deserve to be seen  i learned this in my high school classroom one day when my teacher asked me to give a presentation about <unk> darfur <unk> i was setting up the projector when a classmate of mine said why do you have to talk about this can 't you think about us and how it will make us feel <unk> self didn 't know what to say to her or how to explain the pain that i felt in that moment and in every moment that we were forced not to talk about <unk> me back to the days and nights on the ground in darfur  where we were forced to remain silent where we didn 't speak over morning tea because the warplanes overhead would swallow any and all noise  back to the days when we were told not only that we don 't deserve to be heard but that we do not have a right to exist and this is where the magic happened <unk> classroom when all the students started taking their seats and i began to speak despite this renewed feeling that i didn 't deserve to be there  that i didn 't belong there or have a right to break the silence  as i talked  and my classmates listened  the fear ebbed away  my mind became <unk> and i felt safe  it was the sound of our grieving  the feel of their arms around me the steady walls that held us together <unk>  it felt nothing like a vacuum <unk>  i choose poetry because it 's so visceral  when someone is standing in front of you mind body and soul saying witness me it 's impossible not to become keenly aware of your own humanity  this changed everything for <unk> me it gave me courage <unk>  every day i experience the power of witness and because of that i am whole  and so now i ask will you witness me  they hand me the microphone as my shoulders sink under the weight of this stress the woman says <unk> the one millionth refugee just left south sudan can you comment  i feel my feet rock back and forth on the heels my mother bought begging the question do we stay <unk> or is it safer to choose flight  my mind echoes the numbers  one million gone <unk>  two million displaced <unk>  four hundred thousand dead in darfur and this lump takes over my throat as if each of those bodies just found a grave right here in my esophagus  <unk> country all north and south and east and west so restless the nile couldn 't hold us together and you ask me to summarize  they talk about the numbers as if this isn 't still happening as if five hundred thousand didn 't just die in syria as if three thousand aren 't still making their final stand at the bottom of the mediterranean  as if there aren 't entire volumes full of fact sheets about our genocides and now they want me to write one fact  we never talked over breakfast because the warplanes would swallow our voices <unk> fact my grandfather didn 't want to leave home so he died in a war zone fact a burning bush without god is just a fire <unk>  i measure the distance between what i know and what is safe to say on a microphone  do i talk about sorrow <unk> displacement <unk>  do i mention the violence how it 's never as simple as what you see on tv how there are weeks <unk> ' worth of fear before the camera is on  do i tell her about our bodies how they are sixty percent water but we still burn like driftwood making fuel of our sacrifice do i tell her the men died first <unk> forced to watch the slaughter that they came for our children scattering them across the continent until our homes sank that even castles sink at the bite of the bomb do i talk about the elderly our heroes <unk>  too weak to run too expensive to shoot how they would march them hands raised rifles at their backs into the fire how their walking sticks kept the flames alive <unk> feels too harsh for a bundle of wires and an audience to swallow  too relentless like the valley that filled with the putrid smoke of our deaths is it better in verse <unk>  can a stanza become a burial shroud  will it sting less if i say it softly if you don 't see me cry will you listen better will the pain leave when the microphone does why does every word feel as if i 'm saying my last thirty seconds for the sound bite <unk> and now three minutes for the poem my tongue goes dry the same way we died becoming ash <unk> having never been coal <unk>  i feel my left leg go numb <unk> and i realize that i locked my knees bracing for impact <unk> i never wear shoes i can 't run in thank you  so i wanted to leave on a positive note  because that 's the paradox that this life has been  <unk> the places where i learned to cry the most i also learned how to smile after so here goes  you have a big imagination or four hundred thousand ways to cry for zeinab <unk> i am a sad girl <unk> but my face makes other plans <unk> focusing energy on this smile so as not to waste it on pain the first thing they took was my sleep <unk>  eyes heavy but wide open thinking maybe i missed something  maybe the cavalry is still coming they didn 't come so i bought bigger pillows  my grandmother could cure anything by talking the life out of it and <unk> she said that i could make a thief in a silo laugh in the middle of our raging war war makes a broken marriage bed out of sorrow  you want nothing more than to disappear but your heart can 't salvage enough remnants to leave  but joy joy is the armor we carried across the borders of our broken homeland <unk> hasty mix of stories and faces that lasts long after the flavor is gone  a muscle memory that overcomes even the most bitter of times my memory is spotted with days of laughing until i cried or crying until i laughed laughter and tears are both involuntary <unk> to our capacity for expression so allow me to express that if i make you laugh it 's usually on purpose <unk> and if i make you cry i 'll still think you are beautiful  this is for my cousin zeinab <unk>  bedridden on a random afternoon <unk>  i hadn 't seen her since the last time we were in sudan together <unk> and there i was at her hospital bedside in a 400 year old building in france zeinab wanted to hear poems  suddenly <unk> english arabic and french were not enough <unk>  every word i knew became empty noise <unk> and zeinab said well get on with it  and i read her everything that i <unk> and we laughed <unk> and we loved it and it was the most important stage that i 've ever stood on  surrounded by family by remnants of a people who were given as a dowry to a relentless war but still managed to make pearls of this life  by the ones who taught me to not only laugh <unk> but to live in the face of death <unk>  who placed their hands across the sky <unk> measuring the distance to the sun and saying i 'm gonna meet you there and for zeinab zeinab who taught me love in a place like france <unk> zeinab <unk> who wanted to he ar poems on her deathbed dilated fibromyalgia her heart muscles expanded until they couldn 't function <unk> and she held me <unk> and she made me feel like gold <unk> and i said zeinab <unk> isn 't it strange that your only problem is that your heart was too big
