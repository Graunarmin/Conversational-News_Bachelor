 <unk> take a look at this drawing can you tell what it is i 'm a molecular biologist by training <unk> and i 've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings  they 're usually referred to as a model figure a drawing <unk> that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs this particular drawing is of a process called it 's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell <unk>  there 's a problem with this drawing though <unk> and it 's mainly in what it doesn 't show from lots of experiments from lots of different scientists we know a lot <unk> about what these molecules look like how they move around in the cell <unk> and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment  so in collaboration with a clathrin expert tomas <unk> kirchhausen we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that  so we start outside of the cell now we 're looking inside clathrin are <unk> through connections with a membrane clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble or a vesicle that 's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell  proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle <unk> making it separate from the rest of the membrane and now clathrin is basically done with its job <unk> and so proteins are coming in now we 've covered them yellow and orange that are responsible for taking apart this <unk> cage <unk> and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again  these processes are too small to be seen directly even with the best microscopes so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis <unk>  here 's another illustration <unk> and this is a drawing of how a researcher <unk> might think that the hiv virus gets into and out of cells and again this is a vast oversimplification and doesn 't begin to show what we actually know about these processes  you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses <unk>  why <unk> because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really <unk> i spent months in hollywood learning 3d animation software and i spend months on each animation and that 's just time that most researchers can 't afford  the payoffs can be huge though molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy <unk>  and i 'm working on a new project now called the science of hiv where i 'll be <unk> animating the entire life cycle of the hiv virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail  the animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades data on what this virus looks like how it 's able to infect cells in our body  and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection  over the years i found that animations aren 't just useful for communicating an idea <unk> but they 're also really useful for exploring a <unk> hypothesis biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study and with the data we have now that 's just not good enough anymore  the process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas  one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were <unk> directly to the animation that she and i worked on together <unk> and in this way animation can feed back into the research process  i believe that animation can change biology <unk> it can change the way that we communicate with one another how we explore our data and how we teach our students <unk> but for that change to happen we need more researchers creating animations <unk> and toward that end i brought together a team of biologists animators and programmers to create a new free open source software we call it molecular flipbook that 's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations  <unk> anyone can view download and contribute their own animations <unk>  we 're really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today <unk>  we are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they 're able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures <unk> thank you
