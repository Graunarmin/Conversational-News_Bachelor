 <unk> i would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard there is no wi fi involved it 's just light and you may wonder what 's the point <unk> and the point is this  there will be a massive extension of the internet to close the digital divide <unk>  and also to allow for what we call the internet of things tens of billions of devices connected to the internet  in my view <unk> such an extension of the internet <unk> work if it 's almost this means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible <unk> and this is where the solar cell and the led come in i demonstrated for the first time at ted in two thousand and eleven <unk> data incredibly fast and also in a safe and secure manner  data is transported by the light encoded in subtle changes of the brightness  if we look around we have many leds around us so there 's a rich infrastructure of li fi transmitters around <unk> but so far we have been using special devices small photo detectors to receive the information encoded in the data  i wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our li fi lights <unk>  and this is why i have been looking into solar cells and solar panels  a solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy this is why we can use <unk> a solar cell to charge our mobile phone <unk> but now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the led  so if the incoming light fluctuates <unk> so does the energy harvested from the solar cell <unk>  this means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information <unk> from the light and by the solar cell <unk> because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted  of course the question is can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness <unk> such as the ones transmitted by our led lights <unk>  and the answer to that is yes we can  we have shown in the lab that we can receive up to fifty megabytes per second from a standard off the shelf solar cell and this is faster than most broadband connections these days now let me show you in practice  in this box is a standard <unk> it is connected to the laptop <unk> and also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell <unk>  and this instrument shows something at the moment this is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light  now what i would like to do first is <unk> only switch on the light for a moment <unk>  and what you 'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right  so the solar cell for a moment is harvesting energy from this artificial light source <unk>  if i turn it off we see it drops i turn it on so we harvest energy with the solar cell <unk> but next i would like to activate the streaming of the video <unk> and i 've done this by pressing this button so now this led lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the led in a very subtle way and in a way that you can 't recognize with your eye <unk> because the changes are too fast to recognize <unk>  but in order to prove the point i can block the light of the solar cell <unk> so first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well if i remove the blockage the video will restart <unk>  and i can repeat that so we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well <unk> so that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver <unk> but now imagine that this led lamp is a street light and there 's fog and so i want to simulate fog <unk> and that 's why i brought a handkerchief with me and let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell <unk> first you notice the energy harvested <unk> drops as expected <unk>  but now the video still continues  this means despite the blockage <unk>  there 's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell <unk> so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information in this case a high definition video  what 's really important here is that a solar cell has <unk> become a receiver for high speed wireless signals encoded in light <unk> while it maintains its primary function as an energy harvesting device that 's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill <unk> or indeed lamp post <unk> doesn 't matter where the beam hits the solar cell  and the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows solar cells integrated into street furniture <unk>  or indeed solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the internet of things <unk> because simply <unk> we don 't want to charge these devices regularly <unk> or worse replace the batteries every few <unk> months  as i said to you this is the first time i 've shown this in public it 's very much a lab demonstration a prototype <unk>  but my team and i are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years <unk>  and we hope we will will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide <unk> and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the internet and all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption because of the solar cells quite the opposite <unk> thank you
